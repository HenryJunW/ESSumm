# ROUGE 2.0

ROUGE 2.0 is an easy to use evaluation toolkit for Automatic Summarization tasks. It uses the [ROUGE](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W04-1013) system of metrics which works by comparing an automatically produced summary or translation against a set of reference summaries (typically human-produced). ROUGE is one of the standard ways to compute effectiveness of auto generated summaries. To understand how ROUGE works you can [read this article](http://www.rxnlp.com/how-rouge-works-for-evaluation-of-summarization-tasks/).


## Features

The latest version of ROUGE 2.0 supports the following:

* Evaluation of ROUGE-N (unigram, bigrams, trigrams, etc)
* Evaluation of ROUGE-L (summary level LCS)
* Evaluation of ROUGE-S and ROUGE-SU (skip-gram and skip-gram with unigrams)
* Evaluation of multiple ROUGE metrics at one go
* Stemming for different languages
* Stopword removal with customizable stop words
* Evaluation of unicode texts (e.g. Persian)
* Minimal formatting requirements for system and reference summaries
* Output in CSV â€“ this makes it super easy for score analysis
* Full documentation and support via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/RxNLP/ROUGE-2.0/issues) and [RxNLP Q&A](http://www.rxnlp.com/ask-question/#.WpnDHpPwZTY)

This is an open-source project, so if you want to implement other measures, please read the [documentation](#contributing-to-rouge20) on how to contribute to this project.  

## Quick Start
* Ensure you have [Java 1.8](https://java.com/en/download/) and above installed. You only need the JRE.
* Download latest version of [ROUGE 2.0 distribution zip file](https://github.com/RxNLP/ROUGE-2.0/tree/master/versions)
* Unpack the zip file
* Move into the ROUGE 2.0 directory `cd <rouge2-1.x-runnable>`
* Do a test run: `java -jar rouge2-1.x.jar`. You should see results in the console and in `rouge2-1.x-runnable/results.csv`
* The above step uses the sample summarization tasks under `rouge2-1.x-runnable/projects/test-summarization` and the default settings in `rouge2-1.x-runnable/rouge.properties` file.

## Full Documentation
* [Usage instructions](docs/usage-documentation.md). 
* Please use Java 1.8 and above to run the ROUGE 2.0 package. 
* To build on the source code or make contributions, please read the installation instructions below.

## Installation

To build on the source code of ROUGE 2.0, [clone the repository](https://github.com/RxNLP/ROUGE-2.0.git) and import the project as a Maven project by selecting the `pom.xml` file in the root directory from Eclipse, IntelliJ or other IDE's. Next, add the jars under the `lib` directory to your build path for the code to compile. Note that you can also install the jars in the `lib` directory by creating a local maven repository for those jar files. All you would need to do after that is to add the local dependencies to your `pom.xml`.
