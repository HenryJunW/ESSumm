This meeting of the Berkley Meeting Recorder group charts the progress of their project and covers ongoing issues as well as some new ones.
The most pressing issue concerns the demos which the group are preparing for the DARPA meeting next month.
Here they discuss the querying and indexing tool which is progressing well albeit with a few front-end issues , and also the transcriber tool.
Transcription is progressing well , with new people hired , and double checking almost complete.
Work is also going on in parallel with IBM.
Additionally , the group have progressed further with data storage issues , with backing-up their data now regarded as a priority , and more disk space required.
Tools for accessing key file information have been developed which should ensure all meeting information is present.
The collection of CrossPad note-taking data will be pursued in future meetings.
Finally , other progress made includes getting the ChannelTrans interface working , ordering more wireless microphones , and analysing recognition runs.
