With respect to encoding more fine-grained acoustic information in transcriptions , the question was posed: which features should be marked?
Speaker mn014 reported problems pre-segmenting speech recorded via the lapel microphones.
Normalization of the energy measured across and within channels is problematic when performed for speakers who say little or nothing during meetings.
The evaluation of pre-segmented data is difficult without tightly transcribed time references to the individual channels from which the speech was derived.
The SRI recognizer requires that multi-channel format units not be too large , indicating that some additional pre-processing of unit lengths may be necessary.
