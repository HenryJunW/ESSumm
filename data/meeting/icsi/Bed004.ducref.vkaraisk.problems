After the trial run of the experiment , some minor issues , like the length of the preliminary reading and the need to order the tasks given to the subjects , were highlighted.
It is also possible that the pool of subjects ends up comprising almost entirely of students; more variation in the sample is needed.
From a system design perspective , the progress so far has shown that the combinatorics of the Bayes-net even for a simple task , like the choice of Vista/Enter/Tango mode , could render it unmanageable.
The belief-net presented in the meeting is not a working Bayes-net.
Consequently , it is as yet unclear what the decision nodes in the net are , and what values these can take.
Even if those were decided , how to extract the necessary information from the data , would still be an open issue.
Looking at the bigger picture , the current task is yet to provide insights into more general ways to achieve linguistic deep understanding.
With these intricacies in mind , it is not easy to put together a presentation of the project cohesive and attractive enough for the other research groups in the institute.
