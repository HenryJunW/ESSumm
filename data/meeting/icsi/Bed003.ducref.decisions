It is necessary for the belief-net to have at least one layer of nodes between the features and the final output.
This makes the structure more flexible in terms of coding feature-layer probabilities.
Another technique to systematise the work is the thematic clustering of the features , each cluster forming a Bayes-net of each own: for example features like "admission fee" and "opening hours" can feed into an intermediate "entrance" node connecting to the main middle layer.
The next stage is to refine the set of feature nodes and identify possible clusters.
Although , in theory , traditional AI plan recognition techniques could also be helpful for inferring intentions , the schemas involved are too elaborate for this task.
Further work also includes discussing the possible advantages of Bayes-net packages , other than JavaBayes , with experts at ICSI.
If they continue using JavaBayes , a script to help with the inputting of probabilities in the nodes is needed , as the in-built method is cumbersome.
Finally , it was decided that at least some of the experiments designed for the new data collection initiative will factor in the intentions studied in the current task.
