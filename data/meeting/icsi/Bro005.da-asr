Bro005.A.dialogueact43	98.83	102.387	A	PhD	s^rt	+1	3	since last three can also see respected throwing work and this 
Bro005.A.dialogueact44	103.277	115.416	A	PhD	fh|s	+1	3	um so since last week we've talked to defeat the call on with um so if you chose with nets train them get the we saw nine of my addition but 
Bro005.A.dialogueact45	115.416	117.156	A	PhD	s	+1	2	addition but sweets that's also because the economist 
Bro005.A.dialogueact46	117.276	119.956	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	because the economist not compete each 
Bro005.D.dialogueact47	119.0	119.0	D	Professor	b	-1	0	compete each 
Bro005.D.dialogueact48	119.378	119.778	D	Professor	b	-1	0	compete each 
Bro005.A.dialogueact50	120.146	122.046	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	one standup completely saying but we have 
Bro005.D.dialogueact49	119.778	120.208	D	Professor	b	-1	0	compete each one standup 
Bro005.A.dialogueact51	122.046	127.306	A	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	but we have more of yourself to compare with it's work using wind up yet tea and 
Bro005.A.dialogueact52	127.306	132.826	A	PhD	s	+1	2	tea and find any uh um yeah that that seems very important 
Bro005.A.dialogueact53	133.674	134.594	A	PhD	fh|s^no	-1	0	uh then they should take 
Bro005.A.dialogueact54	134.594	140.706	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	then they should take um let's see anyway or it to be

Bro005.A.dialogueact57	145.806	154.556	A	PhD	s^rt	+1	3	uh when we lose the docks training set using french spanish and english you have one hundred and six we thought that that in eighteen 
Bro005.A.dialogueact58	154.556	156.056	A	PhD	s	+1	3	thought that that in eighteen nine with the that and 
Bro005.D.dialogueact59	156.701	163.801	D	Professor	s^bu	+1	3	yeah and underneath the basement and again all of these numbers are with you a hundred percent being at the baseline performance but with 
Bro005.A.dialogueact60	161.346	161.696	A	PhD	s^aa	+1	1	yeah and underneath at the baseline 
Bro005.A.dialogueact61	161.806	162.866	A	PhD	s^na	-1	0	yeah and underneath the basement at the baseline

Bro005.A.dialogueact66	168.034	178.759	A	PhD	s	-1	0	no we see that the gap between the different training set it's much uh much more it 
Bro005.D.dialogueact65	167.761	168.081	D	Professor	s^bk^m	-1	0	yeah so no we see u. k. yeah see it

Bro005.D.dialogueact211	622.547	631.843	D	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	so um so what that says is that in a match condition we end up with a fair amount of worse printing and the uh guilty 
Bro005.D.dialogueact212	632.552	635.552	D	Professor	qy.%--	+1	1	now that we have a number i suppose for the match that i 
Bro005.D.dialogueact213	635.612	636.872	D	Professor	s	+1	1	that i mean match but 
Bro005.D.dialogueact214	636.872	640.572	D	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	+1	1	mean match but uh use of italian training italian timed it just for guilty only 
Bro005.B.dialogueact215	641.48	643.3	B	PhD	h|s^aa^rt	-1	0	uh yeah so the she's uh yes

Bro005.B.dialogueact472	1155.66	1166.25	B	PhD	s	-1	0	perhaps yeah i don't know but maybe we craft they not and that's what's it'd be it'd be they've done this other stuff maybe okay that's that's one thing but see 
Bro005.A.dialogueact473	1164.59	1165.33	A	PhD	s^am	-1	0	perhaps yeah okay 
Bro005.D.dialogueact474	1165.92	1166.81	D	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	yeah okay that's that's one thing but see 
Bro005.D.dialogueact475	1166.81	1168.52	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	that's that's one thing but see the other thing is that um i mean 
Bro005.D.dialogueact476	1168.52	1170.58	D	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	that um i mean it's good to take the difficult case but let's 
Bro005.D.dialogueact477	1170.58	1172.97	D	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	case but let's let's consider what that means 
Bro005.D.dialogueact478	1173.76	1176.71	D	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	what what we're saying is that one of one of the things that i mean 
Bro005.D.dialogueact479	1176.91	1182.05	D	Professor	s	+1	1	things that i mean my interpretation if you're near secretive suggestions something like that's it's motivation when 
Bro005.D.dialogueact480	1182.93	1194.77	D	Professor	s	+1	1	when we trained on data that is in one sense or another similar to the testing data then we get a win by having just discernment training 
Bro005.A.dialogueact481	1191.21	1191.71	A	PhD	b	-1	0	then we get 
Bro005.D.dialogueact482	1195.39	1199.88	D	Professor	s	+1	1	when we train on something that's quite different we have a potential they have some problems 
Bro005.A.dialogueact483	1197.16	1198.09	A	PhD	b	-1	0	we have a potential they have 
Bro005.D.dialogueact484	1200.61	1211.91	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and um if we get something that helps us when it's somewhat similar and doesn't hurt us too much when it when it's quite different that's maybe not so bad 
Bro005.A.dialogueact485	1208.14	1208.33	A	PhD	b	-1	0	when it when 
Bro005.A.dialogueact487	1212.28	1212.66	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	so the question is 
Bro005.D.dialogueact486	1212.21	1218.94	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it just so the question is if you took the same combination and you tried it out on uh on say digits 
Bro005.A.dialogueact488	1217.83	1218.83	A	PhD	qy^2^bu	-1	0	it just uh on say digits 
Bro005.A.dialogueact489	1218.83	1219.03	A	PhD	b	-1	0	it just say digits you know dude 
Bro005.D.dialogueact490	1219.51	1219.91	D	Professor	s^f	-1	0	you know dude 
Bro005.D.dialogueact491	1219.91	1221.48	D	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	you know dude was that things aren't done 
Bro005.A.dialogueact492	1221.99	1222.46	A	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	done yeah okay 
Bro005.D.dialogueact493	1222.51	1223.06	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah okay uh 
Bro005.D.dialogueact494	1223.77	1229.88	D	Professor	qo	-1	0	uh then does that uh you may be seminars conditions and so forth does it does it then look much better 
Bro005.A.dialogueact495	1229.98	1230.42	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	much better and it's what 
Bro005.D.dialogueact496	1230.51	1234.35	D	Professor	qo	-1	0	and it's what is the range over these different kinds of uh a tax so 
Bro005.D.dialogueact497	1235.02	1235.64	D	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	anyway okay 
Bro005.D.dialogueact498	1235.84	1236.59	D	Professor	s^bk|s^co	-1	0	anyway okay go ahead 
Bro005.A.dialogueact499	1236.35	1236.59	A	PhD	b	-1	0	go ahead 
Bro005.B.dialogueact500	1238.58	1249.63	B	PhD	s	-1	0	um with teased that both go to a nation which i do i'm spending man you seem de niro no none that that we've name brought got it and 
Bro005.B.dialogueact502	1250.21	1254.46	B	PhD	s	-1	0	uh i cost found mart it's the same as sucked 
Bro005.D.dialogueact501	1250.11	1250.44	D	Professor	b	-1	0	uh i 
Bro005.A.dialogueact503	1255.87	1257.82	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	so he i even it'd be but 
Bro005.B.dialogueact504	1255.99	1256.76	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so he it'd be but 
Bro005.A.dialogueact505	1258.06	1258.16	A	PhD	b	-1	0	slightly better 
Bro005.D.dialogueact506	1258.13	1258.93	D	Professor	s^aa^m	-1	0	slightly better 
Bro005.A.dialogueact507	1259.12	1259.3	A	PhD	b	-1	0	i but 
Bro005.B.dialogueact508	1259.25	1260.56	B	PhD	s^aa^m	-1	0	i but but it is better

Bro005.D.dialogueact510	1261.54	1271.87	D	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah maybe maybe maybe and and you know again maybe if you use of uh delta there uh you would bring it up to where it was you know at least about the same for difficult case 
Bro005.B.dialogueact511	1265.9	1268.09	B	PhD	fg|s^am	-1	0	yeah maybe maybe maybe there uh you would bring it up to where it was you know 
Bro005.A.dialogueact512	1267.17	1267.92	A	PhD	b	-1	0	maybe you would bring it up to 
Bro005.B.dialogueact513	1270.7	1270.98	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	for difficult 
Bro005.A.dialogueact514	1271.85	1272.11	A	PhD	b	-1	0	that's so case so 
Bro005.A.dialogueact518	1272.69	1275.82	A	PhD	s^t^tc	-1	0	that's so perhaps it is it jumped as the last experiment it's so 
Bro005.B.dialogueact516	1272.41	1274.2	B	PhD	%	-1	0	that's so perhaps it is it jumped as the last so 
Bro005.B.dialogueact517	1272.59	1272.92	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	that's so so 
Bro005.D.dialogueact515	1272.3	1272.61	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	that's so so 
Bro005.A.dialogueact519	1275.82	1281.25	A	PhD	s	-1	0	experiment it's either this information from doing and you're the work if we use only decide and so it's it's huh 
Bro005.B.dialogueact520	1280.04	1280.36	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	only decide and so it's 
Bro005.D.dialogueact521	1281.22	1281.62	D	Professor	b	-1	0	it's huh 
Bro005.A.dialogueact522	1282.11	1283.01	A	PhD	s	-1	0	it's again but this season nine yeah huh

Bro005.B.dialogueact531	1294.01	1304.4	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	then we did say talk to a nation i if i don't follow that uh it doesn't well what 
Bro005.D.dialogueact532	1296.81	1297.0	D	Professor	b	-1	0	say talk to a nation 
Bro005.B.dialogueact533	1304.96	1306.05	B	PhD	s	-1	0	well what what work about said 
Bro005.B.dialogueact534	1306.05	1308.67	B	PhD	s	-1	0	about said that distant uncles who would issue 
Bro005.B.dialogueact535	1314.55	1322.12	B	PhD	s	-1	0	posting for date did u. b. p. a. p. did that is that yeah craft eighty five going see i went on on 
Bro005.B.dialogueact536	1322.61	1327.0	B	PhD	s	-1	0	on on distant uncle difficulty would easily class babysitting points one 
Bro005.D.dialogueact537	1328.58	1337.11	D	Professor	fh|s^t^tc	-1	0	um but way there's a another um suggestion that would apply uh to the second configuration 
Bro005.D.dialogueact538	1338.29	1344.5	D	Professor	s	-1	0	which uh which made uh by uh hurry 
Bro005.D.dialogueact539	1345.45	1359.02	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and that was that um if you have a feed two streams into h. t. k. um and you uh change the uh variance he scaled variance 
Bro005.D.dialogueact540	1359.31	1370.48	D	Professor	s	-1	0	he scaled variance is associated with uh these strange um you can effectively scale the strange 
Bro005.D.dialogueact541	1371.45	1371.72	D	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right so 
Bro005.D.dialogueact542	1371.72	1379.32	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	right so um you know without changing the scripts for h. d. k. which is the 
Bro005.D.dialogueact543	1379.32	1383.29	D	Professor	s	-1	0	which is the rule here uh you can still change the variance is which would effectively 
Bro005.A.dialogueact544	1380.84	1381.27	A	PhD	b	-1	0	rule here uh you can still 
Bro005.A.dialogueact545	1381.05	1381.77	A	PhD	b	-1	0	uh you can still 
Bro005.D.dialogueact546	1383.29	1388.51	D	Professor	s	-1	0	is which would effectively change the scale of these these uh two streams that come in 
Bro005.A.dialogueact547	1389.31	1390.22	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bro005.D.dialogueact548	1390.63	1405.74	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and um so um if you do that for instance it may be the case that um yeah well you should not be considered a strong 
Bro005.A.dialogueact549	1406.12	1406.6	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro005.D.dialogueact550	1407.85	1410.39	D	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	and um so this is just setting them to be 
Bro005.D.dialogueact551	1411.29	1411.56	D	Professor	s^fa	-1	0	you have equal 
Bro005.D.dialogueact552	1411.62	1413.39	D	Professor	s	-1	0	you have equal equal weight 
Bro005.D.dialogueact553	1414.73	1416.05	D	Professor	s	-1	0	maybe shouldn't be way 
Bro005.B.dialogueact554	1416.73	1417.0	B	PhD	s^am	-1	0	i yeah i i'm sorry 
Bro005.D.dialogueact555	1417.16	1420.58	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i yeah i i'm sorry say that gives more experiments if one wants to look at that but 
Bro005.D.dialogueact556	1420.58	1426.51	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	look at that but but uh um you know on the other hand it's just experiments at the level of the age to get recognition it's not even h. 
Bro005.A.dialogueact557	1422.84	1423.67	A	PhD	b	-1	0	you know on the other hand it's just experiments 
Bro005.D.dialogueact558	1426.51	1427.71	D	Professor	s	-1	0	it's not even h. decay uh 
Bro005.A.dialogueact560	1428.14	1429.13	A	PhD	b	-1	0	uh well i guess you have to

Bro005.A.dialogueact638	1671.64	1677.46	A	PhD	s	-1	0	actually i where i do prefer to do exactly what they did when i was in belgium 
Bro005.A.dialogueact639	1678.16	1681.31	A	PhD	s	+1	1	so i think exactly the same i figure ration seven downs 
Bro005.A.dialogueact640	1681.31	1684.1	A	PhD	s	+1	1	seven downs with nine france of context 
Bro005.A.dialogueact641	1685.17	1686.64	A	PhD	s	+1	1	and we just train them to meet 
Bro005.A.dialogueact642	1688.34	1690.06	A	PhD	s	+1	1	and on the a large database so but spying and 
Bro005.A.dialogueact643	1690.26	1691.63	A	PhD	s	+1	1	so but spying and everything 
Bro005.A.dialogueact644	1692.6	1693.07	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro005.A.dialogueact645	1695.39	1699.67	A	PhD	s	+1	1	i a. and starting to train also that works with larger context so 
Bro005.A.dialogueact646	1699.92	1704.24	A	PhD	s	+1	1	context so this would would be something between traps and that's it down because 
Bro005.A.dialogueact647	1704.24	1707.76	A	PhD	s	+1	1	because see have quite large bounds 
Bro005.A.dialogueact648	1708.36	1710.46	A	PhD	s	+1	1	and it's because of the context of so 
Bro005.A.dialogueact649	1710.88	1713.44	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	of so yeah 
Bro005.A.dialogueact650	1714.1	1714.25	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	we still have to work 
Bro005.A.dialogueact651	1714.38	1715.86	A	PhD	s	+1	2	we still have to work and finish 
Bro005.A.dialogueact652	1717.11	1723.84	A	PhD	s	+1	2	uh they take you to make a decision on which an peace can be the best of the different languages for the 
Bro005.A.dialogueact653	1723.84	1730.32	A	PhD	s	+1	2	languages for the moment it's that they make network and perhaps the that were print and everything so 
Bro005.A.dialogueact654	1730.94	1736.64	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	so no we that he's doing its work some with with that uh um gosh it works 
Bro005.A.dialogueact655	1737.16	1739.09	A	PhD	s	-1	0	this demo song finish and see 
Bro005.B.dialogueact656	1737.46	1737.7	B	PhD	b	-1	0	this demo 
Bro005.A.dialogueact657	1739.27	1742.78	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and see which ones 
Bro005.A.dialogueact658	1744.01	1750.24	A	PhD	s	+1	1	what the knicks pots of the duck just sweat busy kia kind of summary of fourth everything that has been down so 
Bro005.A.dialogueact659	1750.24	1753.9	A	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	so seventy nine and they'd be trained is 
Bro005.A.dialogueact660	1754.83	1757.52	A	PhD	s^t1	-1	0	with the trees 
Bro005.A.dialogueact661	1759.71	1762.45	A	PhD	s	+1	1	down on ten friends they divisions

Bro005.A.dialogueact701	1856.02	1859.72	A	PhD	s	+1	1	the fact that that be turn on target task decrease their rates 
Bro005.A.dialogueact702	1860.34	1871.18	A	PhD	s	+1	1	and then and it beeps trained and uh um it's up to another target asked you can preview or rate compared to using straight futures except 
Bro005.A.dialogueact703	1871.6	1873.33	A	PhD	s	-1	0	except in the future so not bad 
Bro005.A.dialogueact704	1874.15	1878.89	A	PhD	fh|s^bsc	-1	0	uh a kitty except if the future on up to you know nine 
Bro005.A.dialogueact705	1880.51	1883.47	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and just depends depend damaged bets or even you could 
Bro005.A.dialogueact706	1883.53	1886.28	A	PhD	s	-1	0	bets or even you could train um nothing the target beaches yeah 
Bro005.D.dialogueact707	1886.99	1891.63	D	Professor	fg|s^bs^cs	-1	0	yeah so it sounds like isn't that correct some of the problems with some poor normalization but if

Bro005.D.dialogueact792	2052.27	2056.32	D	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	that that what we were concerned about is that if it's not on the target ask if 
Bro005.D.dialogueact793	2057.03	2062.07	D	Professor	s	+1	1	it's on the target task then it it it helps to have the l. p. transforming and if

Bro005.D.dialogueact795	2063.04	2070.55	D	Professor	s	+1	1	it uh if it's not on the target task then depending on how different it is uh you can get uh a reduction in performance 
Bro005.A.dialogueact796	2070.65	2071.29	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and the question 
Bro005.D.dialogueact797	2071.37	2074.79	D	Professor	qo	-1	0	and the question is now how to oh yeah one out the other how 
Bro005.D.dialogueact798	2074.79	2077.67	D	Professor	s	-1	0	out the other how to they merely rate the the problems 
Bro005.A.dialogueact799	2077.72	2078.36	A	PhD	b	-1	0	um 
Bro005.D.dialogueact800	2078.36	2085.9	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um because it it certainly does it's nice to have in there when it when there is something like that

Bro005.A.dialogueact803	2091.87	2100.87	A	PhD	fg|s^rt.%--	+1	1	yeah so so just that the reason yeah the reason is that perhaps the targets that that that dependency language dependency and the night dependency so that's what you're say there actually 
Bro005.D.dialogueact804	2092.33	2093.57	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so just that the reason yeah the so that's what you're say there actually 
Bro005.D.dialogueact805	2093.57	2093.89	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	that the reason yeah the there actually 
Bro005.A.dialogueact806	2102.07	2104.87	A	PhD	s	+1	1	yeah but this has been updated because

Bro005.A.dialogueact810	2114.25	2116.77	A	PhD	s	+1	3	but that they make the torch get the best but

Bro005.D.dialogueact833	2183.6	2192.18	D	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	thing but you're saying a little bit general things observer bowl so far there's something you're not completely convinced about and is uh

Bro005.A.dialogueact945	2433.13	2438.15	A	PhD	s	+1	1	that two of the main issues props pasta in the language of dependency and uh night dependency and 
Bro005.A.dialogueact946	2438.25	2445.99	A	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	and perhaps tight rangers the language dependency we should focus some some other kind of training targets

Bro005.A.dialogueact948	2447.39	2449.6	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and that think that thing seems important 
Bro005.A.dialogueact949	2450.68	2452.17	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because of teammate three 
Bro005.D.dialogueact950	2452.35	2452.91	D	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro005.A.dialogueact951	2453.66	2454.19	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh for a moment you use 
Bro005.A.dialogueact952	2454.19	2456.87	A	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	for a moment you use we use funny kicked targets but 
Bro005.A.dialogueact953	2456.87	2459.53	A	PhD	s	+1	1	targets but because of so year's such a country targets soft targets perhaps 
Bro005.A.dialogueact954	2459.81	2465.02	A	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	targets perhaps even usenet towards that doesn't do education but just regression 
Bro005.A.dialogueact955	2465.02	2466.23	A	PhD	s	+1	1	but just regression so 
Bro005.A.dialogueact956	2466.23	2469.04	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so uh trying to us you running towards that 
Bro005.A.dialogueact957	2469.88	2475.12	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh there's a regression 
Bro005.D.dialogueact958	2474.47	2474.93	D	Professor	b	-1	0	uh 
Bro005.A.dialogueact959	2475.12	2476.33	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	there's a regression 
Bro005.A.dialogueact960	2476.75	2488.9	A	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	but you could compute futures and not not features we talk not i mean uh comes from the few noisy chose in other features that are not noisy but 
Bro005.A.dialogueact961	2488.9	2490.05	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	not noisy but continuous teacher not 
Bro005.A.dialogueact962	2490.05	2493.65	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	not our targets 
Bro005.D.dialogueact963	2490.52	2491.2	D	Professor	b	-1	0	not

Bro005.A.dialogueact965	2495.91	2497.15	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah that seems like a good thing to do probably 
Bro005.D.dialogueact966	2495.91	2498.49	D	Professor	fg|s	+1	1	yeah that seems like a good thing to do probably 
Bro005.D.dialogueact967	2497.28	2498.74	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	a good thing to do probably 
Bro005.D.dialogueact968	2500.38	2502.85	D	Professor	s	+1	1	not uh again of short term sort of thing 
Bro005.A.dialogueact969	2502.26	2502.58	A	PhD	b	-1	0	sort of thing 
Bro005.D.dialogueact970	2503.47	2509.54	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i mean one of the things about that is that yeah it's either 
Bro005.D.dialogueact971	2510.03	2516.07	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i guess a major risk have their thing is being 
Bro005.A.dialogueact972	2516.34	2516.48	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro005.A.dialogueact973	2517.35	2517.9	A	PhD	b	-1	0	but yeah 
Bro005.D.dialogueact974	2517.4	2519.81	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	but yeah so did you so what 
Bro005.A.dialogueact975	2518.44	2524.5	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so did you so what what this one thing did this could be cool that could that perhaps to reducing rigid tendency unfold 
Bro005.A.dialogueact976	2524.8	2532.21	A	PhD	s	-1	0	tendency unfold for the spots um we could combine the sweets other approach like but potentially to approach so the the idea 
Bro005.A.dialogueact977	2532.63	2537.03	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so the the idea of put things all the noise that the can find inside the database i think 
Bro005.A.dialogueact980	2537.76	2541.87	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i think pinch meet which using more than fifty just run noisiest train network 
Bro005.B.dialogueact979	2537.51	2537.78	B	PhD	b	-1	0	i think 
Bro005.D.dialogueact978	2537.18	2537.74	D	Professor	b	-1	0	i think 
Bro005.A.dialogueact981	2542.63	2545.72	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	so it's just one approach 
Bro005.A.dialogueact983	2546.11	2551.68	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and the other smoking down uh it's i think it's more robust stupidly changes 
Bro005.D.dialogueact982	2546.08	2546.79	D	Professor	b	-1	0	and the other smoking down 
Bro005.D.dialogueact984	2547.55	2548.15	D	Professor	b	-1	0	uh 
Bro005.A.dialogueact985	2552.47	2562.81	A	PhD	s^am	+1	1	so perhaps think something like melted down train them about this he's which uh future space targets yeah could could have yeah if you it's interesting 
Bro005.D.dialogueact986	2561.73	2563.36	D	Professor	s^aa|s^ba	-1	0	yeah could could have yeah if you it's interesting thought maybe if you just 
Bro005.D.dialogueact987	2563.36	2564.65	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	thought maybe if you just trained up 
Bro005.D.dialogueact988	2565.63	2569.72	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean it when when fantasy would be if something our particular toward targets 
Bro005.D.dialogueact989	2570.14	2573.74	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and you have um some reasonable database um 
Bro005.D.dialogueact990	2573.88	2574.67	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	um but 
Bro005.D.dialogueact991	2574.87	2580.3	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but then which is uh copied over many times with a range of different noises

Bro005.D.dialogueact1132	2920.38	2923.54	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	what what but my son for the reverberations case at least in in when i was 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1133	2923.54	2925.32	D	Professor	s	-1	0	in in when i was four work for these other ones that 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1134	2925.94	2928.02	D	Professor	s	-1	0	that you did have nice interpret interpretive effects that is 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1135	2928.62	2936.38	D	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	that is that yes if you knew what the reverberations condition is going to be and you train for that then you got the best results but if you had 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1136	2936.38	2949.68	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but if you had say heavily reverberations cake heavy curb ration case and i know reverberations k. something that was uh modest on of reverberations and you get some result in between the two so

Bro005.D.dialogueact1147	3008.94	3010.07	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	well see i book you were doing 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1148	3010.64	3012.54	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	you were doing something something that was maybe analogy

Bro005.D.dialogueact1150	3014.02	3016.12	D	Professor	s	-1	0	were doing something i was in wait a little better behaved purpose replacing

Bro005.D.dialogueact1153	3020.08	3026.95	D	Professor	s	+1	1	cure the problem seems to be is the we don't have uh huge really huge snapped with a really huge amount of training yeah 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1154	3027.57	3031.58	D	Professor	s	+1	1	but we have for this kind of task i would think a modest amount naming friends 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1155	3031.58	3033.17	D	Professor	s	+1	1	amount naming friends actually is not much a modest 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1156	3033.79	3038.85	D	Professor	s	+1	1	a modest amount of of uh training data from a couple different conditions 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1157	3039.45	3048.28	D	Professor	s	+1	2	and then it in is that and the real situation is that there's enormous for ability that we anticipate in a test that in terms of language 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1158	3049.11	3049.98	D	Professor	s	+1	2	noise type 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1159	3050.64	3053.87	D	Professor	fh|s	+1	2	uh channel characteristic 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1160	3054.28	3055.25	D	Professor	s	-1	0	sort of all over the map a bunch of different dimension 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1161	3055.25	3056.5	D	Professor	s	-1	0	a bunch of different dimension 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1162	3057.13	3064.48	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and so i'm just concerned that we don't really the data to train up i mean one 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1163	3064.48	3071.31	D	Professor	s	-1	0	up i mean one of the things that we were seeing is that the one we had it in we don't have a good donation for this but 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1164	3071.39	3075.9	D	Professor	s	-1	0	this but we are seeing that we're adding in a few different databases 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1165	3077.03	3079.88	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and uh the performance is getting worse 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1166	3081.07	3088.27	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and uh we just take one of those databases a pretty good one it actually is is is is is better 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1167	3088.99	3095.61	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and uh that says to me yes that you know there might be some problems with notation models some of the data base writing in or something like that but one

Bro005.D.dialogueact1277	3436.74	3442.0	D	Professor	s:s	-1	0	point uh we say okay we we have shown that we can improve this in this way 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1278	3442.54	3447.12	D	Professor	s^cs:qo	-1	0	what's your newest version and then 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1279	3447.85	3449.21	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and then maybe they'll have something is better and then we combined 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1280	3449.21	3450.26	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and then we combined is always 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1281	3450.62	3451.33	D	Professor	s	-1	0	is always hard i mean i i 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1282	3451.33	3459.94	D	Professor	s	-1	0	hard i mean i i i used to work with folks who were trying to prove a good uh h. m. m. system with uh with and they're on that system 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1283	3460.57	3464.39	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	common problems that you'd one 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1284	3464.87	3466.76	D	Professor	s	-1	0	you'd one the actually true not just for no mess but just 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1285	3466.76	3474.88	D	Professor	s	-1	0	just for no mess but just in general report working with uh re scoring uh and best lesser gladys is coming came from uh mainstream recognize or 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1286	3475.4	3482.17	D	Professor	s	-1	0	uh you get something from the uh the other site at one point and you work really hard on making it better with three scoring but they're working 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1287	3482.73	3484.25	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but they're working really hard too so by 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1288	3484.69	3491.62	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so by the time you have uh improved their score they have also improved their score and now 
Bro005.A.dialogueact1289	3486.36	3486.96	A	PhD	b	-1	0	you have 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1290	3491.62	3492.92	D	Professor	s	-1	0	score and now is any difference because 
Bro005.A.dialogueact1291	3492.5	3493.48	A	PhD	b	-1	0	is any difference because the other 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1292	3492.92	3493.48	D	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	is any difference because the other 
Bro005.B.dialogueact1293	3494.3	3494.73	B	PhD	b	-1	0	so 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1294	3494.43	3497.37	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so um i guess at some point will have to uh 
Bro005.A.dialogueact1295	3496.0	3496.37	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	at some point will have

Bro005.D.dialogueact1312	3532.73	3537.08	D	Professor	s^f|s	-1	0	so are you weekend for you know it uh training targets i says and so forth that's 
Bro005.A.dialogueact1313	3535.32	3535.66	A	PhD	b	-1	0	i 
Bro005.A.dialogueact1315	3537.14	3542.07	A	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	so are you weekend for we we can't forget combining that the future is imaging prep so focus that's 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1314	3537.08	3538.3	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so are you weekend for we we can't that's 
Bro005.A.dialogueact1316	3542.07	3546.27	A	PhD	qrr^d	-1	0	focus more on the targets and and uh training day time 
Bro005.A.dialogueact1317	3546.39	3546.75	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	time 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1318	3547.43	3551.33	D	Professor	s^bk|s	-1	0	yeah i think for right now um i i i really liked m. s. g. and i think that you 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1319	3551.33	3555.29	D	Professor	s	-1	0	g. and i think that you know one of things i like about it is has such different temper properties 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1320	3556.12	3565.55	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and um i think that there is ultimately uh really good uh potential for and bringing in things with different temper properties 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1321	3566.43	3571.08	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	only 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1322	3571.72	3573.06	D	Professor	s	-1	0	only have limited time and there's a lot of other things 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1323	3573.06	3574.61	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and there's a lot of other things you have to look at it seems 
Bro005.A.dialogueact1324	3574.51	3575.42	A	PhD	b	-1	0	you have to look at it seems like much more core 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1325	3574.61	3578.34	D	Professor	s	-1	0	you have to look at it seems like much more core questions are issues about the training so 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1326	3579.21	3580.56	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and the training targets 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1327	3581.42	3585.65	D	Professor	s	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro005.D.dialogueact1336	3598.07	3608.13	D	Professor	s	-1	0	having gone through this process and trying many different things i would imagine certain things uh come up that you're curious about attitude got 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1337	3608.3	3609.71	D	Professor	s	-1	0	attitude got getting too and so 
Bro005.D.dialogueact1338	3609.71	3617.35	D	Professor	s	-1	0	getting too and so dust settles from the in value ration uh i think that would be time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most you know your most
