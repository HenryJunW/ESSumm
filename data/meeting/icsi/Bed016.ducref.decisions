As the talk at EML will also refer to a theoretical framework , it was suggested that along with presenting NTL and the piece on mirror neurons , it also alludes to relevant fMRI work.
The neural side of the research could be of interest to various groups.
The language analysis itself will be introduced in terms of image schemas.
On the other hand , it was arranged for more feedback on the thesis proposal to be sent by email.
The latest version of the construction formalism will also be needed to complete the presentation.
