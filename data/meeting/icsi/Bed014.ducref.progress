Several technical matters are being resolved: a conversion program is being written for data to be translated between XML and the Java Embedded-Bayes notation; the language generation templates are now available for the english version of the SmartKom system; SmartKom now works on three different machines at ICSI.
On the other hand , future collaboration on belief-nets has already been agreed with another research group.
The construction analysis and formalism are also progressing.
Several issues that have been dealt with were mentioned during the meeting: indefinite pronouns and wh-questions , noun-phrase structure , etc.
This analysis is being done with the help of a linguist , who often provides different perspectives to methods and terminology.
