ICSI's Meeting Recorder Group have returned from a meeting with some important decisions to make.
They have developed a piece of software which allows them to implement their two main approaches to dealing with noise.
The base rate is currently set at the second best rate as of the last project evaluation , and it does not yet include everything the group have been working on.
With this in mind , they have decided to set most things , and concentrate on studying only a few key aspects , the neural network , the voice activity detector , and the noise estimation.
