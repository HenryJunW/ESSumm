Bmr023.C.dialogueact152	357.259	358.299	C	PhD	s	-1	0	me that we can talk about 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact153	359.296	364.546	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	it seems it looks i haven't the summer and still not complete but 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact154	364.626	364.866	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	but 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact155	365.907	371.911	C	PhD	fh|s^ba	+1	2	it looks like the put attracted some investments working goes 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact157	372.479	378.159	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	using the what factors that we considered for this price i'm just applying that's pretty 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact156	372.478	373.188	F	Professor	b	-1	0	using the what factors 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact158	378.058	378.728	F	Professor	s^j	-1	0	that's pretty 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact159	379.209	379.459	C	PhD	b	-1	0	okay so you just need 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact161	379.498	379.948	F	Professor	s^bk^rt	-1	0	okay so you just need 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact160	379.438	381.928	G	PhD	s^co	-1	0	just have to take the reciprocal okay so you just need to copy over to this one 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact162	381.056	386.067	C	PhD	s	-1	0	have to take the reciprocal the number because they have different meanings that stuff uh yeah well to this one 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact163	383.492	383.642	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	because 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact164	385.447	385.907	F	Professor	s^fe	-1	0	that stuff uh 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact165	386.326	387.876	F	Professor	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	yeah well that's always good to do 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact166	388.063	388.393	C	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact167	388.076	388.436	F	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact168	390.091	390.521	F	Professor	fg	-1	0	okay uh 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact169	390.621	391.561	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	but one issue actually okay uh 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact170	391.251	407.03	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	but one issue actually that just came up in discussion with lives and and on was um as far as meeting recognitions concerned we would really like to uh move to uh doing the recognition on automatic technician 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact171	392.325	392.535	F	Professor	b	-1	0	that just came up 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact172	408.405	420.012	C	PhD	s^df	+1	3	because in all the previous experiment's we had the you know we were especially cheating by having uh um you know the i have to contestants the base of the recognition and so now 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact173	418.846	419.646	F	Professor	b	-1	0	contestants the base of the recognition 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact174	420.632	425.842	C	PhD	s^cs.%-	+1	4	and so now with the segments are working so well i think we should consider doing uh 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact175	420.882	421.432	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and so now with the segments 
Bmr023.B.dialogueact176	422.315	422.465	B	Grad	s^co^t3	-1	0	are working so well 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact179	426.459	427.399	C	PhD	s^e.%-	-1	0	yeah it it you think we should increase the 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact177	426.409	427.419	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	yeah it it you think we should increase the 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact178	426.458	428.548	F	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	yeah it it yeah yeah you think we should increase the air raid good 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact180	427.849	428.369	E	PhD	fg|s^bk	-1	0	it it yeah yeah we should increase the air raid good 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact183	428.882	429.152	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah yeah air raid good 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact182	428.789	428.959	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah yeah air raid good 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact181	428.548	428.918	F	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	yeah yeah air raid good 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact185	429.742	429.972	C	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact184	429.494	429.684	F	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr023.E.dialogueact186	430.35	432.06	E	PhD	s	-1	0	that's that's what i wanted to do it anyway so we should 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact188	431.938	432.168	C	PhD	b	-1	0	to do it anyway so we should 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact189	432.06	434.58	E	PhD	s^cs.%-	-1	0	so we should just get together and and even the good thing 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact187	431.894	432.284	G	PhD	b	-1	0	to do it anyway so we should 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact190	432.89	433.11	C	PhD	b	-1	0	so we should just get and even 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact191	433.583	440.793	G	PhD	s^ba	+1	2	just get together and and even the good thing is it since you um have high recall even if you look for session because they're over generating that's good because 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact192	440.793	447.593	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	that's good because we could train noise models and recognize it for these kinds of uh transients and things that come from the microphone but 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact194	441.405	441.615	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	we could train 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact193	440.976	441.206	E	PhD	b	-1	0	that's good because we could train 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact195	444.632	444.842	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	these kinds of 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact196	447.593	459.55	G	PhD	s^df	+1	1	but i know that if we run recognition on constrained on the whole way form we do very poorly because we're we're getting in persons in places but that you may well becoming out so we do 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact197	457.312	457.642	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	in places but that you may 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact198	457.509	457.739	E	PhD	b	-1	0	in places but that you may 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact199	458.77	459.31	F	Professor	b	-1	0	well becoming out so we do 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact200	459.55	461.69	G	PhD	s	+1	1	we should we should consider doing some out so we do need some kind of presented 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact201	460.19	471.686	C	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	we should we should consider doing some extra things like no retraining are adapting uh was for background noise to the to this need some kind of presented and 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact202	466.977	467.247	G	PhD	b	-1	0	adapting uh was 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact203	468.838	469.268	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	for background noise to the to this 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact204	471.268	471.508	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact205	471.746	476.208	G	PhD	s^cs.%--	+1	1	and yeah using t. those you know plus carriers of some kind or right now they're 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact206	473.02	473.36	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	those 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact207	476.328	479.007	G	PhD	s	-1	0	right now they're discreet yes or no for 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact209	479.351	479.621	E	PhD	b	-1	0	yes or no for 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact208	479.307	483.881	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	yes or no for speaker too consider those particular speaker back background all 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact211	484.271	484.461	C	PhD	b	-1	0	the rest of the 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact210	484.241	484.301	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	the rest of the 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact212	484.471	486.591	G	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah yeah so the rest of the interesting things that could be done 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact213	486.037	486.257	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah so could be done 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact214	486.557	487.417	E	PhD	s^na	-1	0	yeah so the could be done 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact215	487.781	487.951	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	the 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact216	488.718	488.918	F	Professor	fg	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact217	490.344	493.884	F	Professor	qh^rt^t^tc	-1	0	so uh when we do the idea and stuff 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact219	494.62	505.182	D	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah so um talked with brian and gave him the alternatives to the single beep at the end of each other instead we had generated before and so and some they 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact218	494.254	495.254	F	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	yeah so um and some 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact220	503.727	504.057	F	Professor	b	-1	0	we had generated before 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact221	505.59	506.47	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	and so they uh truck 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact222	506.01	507.63	F	Professor	s^2^j	-1	0	uh truck chunks 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact223	507.57	507.74	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	chunks 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact225	508.11	508.71	D	PhD	s^j^m	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bmr023.D.dialogueact227	509.557	511.247	D	PhD	s	+1	2	and so he talks over the transcriber and the transcriber thought 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact228	511.247	519.487	D	PhD	s^cs^e	+1	2	and the transcriber thought that the easiest thing for them would be if there was a beep and then then i and number digit and then a beep at the beginning of each one and that would help 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact229	516.787	516.997	F	Professor	b	-1	0	i and number digit 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact230	518.159	518.439	F	Professor	b	-1	0	at the beginning of 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact231	519.487	521.876	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	each one and that would help keep them from getting lost 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact232	522.351	527.713	D	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	where'd and um so adam little script to generate those style uh beeps and so 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact234	527.978	529.158	C	PhD	qw	-1	0	where'd you get the digits uh beeps and so we're i came up 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact233	527.713	528.313	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	where'd you get the digits uh beeps and so we're 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact235	529.46	531.94	D	PhD	s	-1	0	i came up here and just recorded the numbers one through ten 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact236	532.517	533.417	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	it sounds really good the sound that's a great 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact237	532.81	532.95	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	it sounds really 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact239	533.774	534.334	D	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	good yeah the sound of that's a great idea 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact238	533.704	534.634	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	good yeah the sound of that's a great idea 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact240	534.357	534.707	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yeah of idea 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact241	535.39	537.18	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and you slice them into so um yeah we just use those 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact242	537.0	539.32	C	PhD	qy	-1	0	you slice them into the yeah 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact243	539.43	539.64	C	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact244	540.032	545.092	D	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	he recorded three he did he die recorded actually i recorded one through ten three times in three different speeds and then he picked like the fastest 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact245	541.293	542.123	C	PhD	b	-1	0	recorded three recorded actually i recorded one through ten three times

Bmr023.D.dialogueact247	545.602	550.865	D	PhD	s	-1	0	like the fastest one so he just cut those out and splice them in between uh two beats 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact249	551.032	553.412	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	sounds like a radio announcers voice really really funny

Bmr023.D.dialogueact263	570.405	570.925	D	PhD	s^am	-1	0	um maybe and 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact264	571.055	577.035	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	she said it wasn't going to the transcriber said it wouldn't be a problem because they can actually make a template that has beep number beep so for them it'll be 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact266	577.175	578.785	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so for them it'll be very quick 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact265	577.09	577.46	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so for them it'll be 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact268	579.245	581.857	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	to to put those in there and the transcribing 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact267	578.939	579.229	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	very quick to to put those 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact269	582.57	585.48	D	PhD	s^cc	+1	1	so um we were going to send him one more sample meeting uh 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact270	585.76	587.82	D	PhD	s	+1	1	meeting uh and to does run his segment asian adam's 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact271	587.82	590.03	D	PhD	s	+1	1	his segment asian adam's going to generate uh jump file and then 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact272	590.575	593.445	D	PhD	s^cc	+1	1	and then um i'll give it to brian in they can try that out when we get that 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact273	593.545	599.635	D	PhD	s	+1	1	that out when we get that back we'll see if that sort of fixes the problem we had with uh too many beats in the last transcription 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact274	600.165	604.795	F	Professor	s^bk|qy^rt	+1	1	okay to do what do you have any idea to turn around and on the steps are just uh

Bmr023.F.dialogueact293	636.309	643.69	F	Professor	s	+1	3	and so we don't sort of really no exactly what they're doing and how long are we doing and so forth because 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact294	643.69	648.1	F	Professor	s^df	+1	4	and so forth because right now she has no choice but to operate in the mode that we already have working and uh 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact295	648.087	648.437	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and uh 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact296	648.29	649.14	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	and uh so 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact297	649.918	653.608	F	Professor	s^co	-1	0	yeah i yeah so it'd be it'd be good to sort of get that resolved uh since because couldn't 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact298	652.786	653.116	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	yeah i yeah uh since because couldn't 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact300	653.746	658.446	D	PhD	s	-1	0	i yeah i i hope we can get a better estimate from this one that we send them since because couldn't 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact299	653.608	653.948	F	Professor	%-	-1	0	i yeah since because couldn't 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact302	659.2	661.057	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact301	658.816	659.356	F	Professor	b	-1	0	send them

Bmr023.F.dialogueact304	663.749	664.669	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	yet oh no 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact305	665.621	673.241	F	Professor	s^cs	+1	3	uhhuh i mean particular i would i would really hope that when we do to start uh meeting in july that we sort of have we're we're into production mode somehow that we 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact306	672.928	673.328	D	PhD	b	-1	0	uhhuh mode somehow that we 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact307	673.421	679.586	F	Professor	s	+1	3	that we we actually have a stream going i mean you know how how well it does and how and i print i think that would 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact308	678.243	678.573	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and i 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact309	679.586	682.99	F	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	print i think that would that would certainly be a a very good thing now 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact310	683.143	684.003	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right right 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact311	685.336	685.466	F	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact312	687.22	687.79	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact313	690.322	697.158	F	Professor	s^cs^t^tc	-1	0	okay they before we do the meeting to organized thing maybe you could say relevant stuff about where inscriptions 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact314	697.744	703.442	A	Postdoc	fg|s	+1	1	okay so um we um the transcribers of continued to work past what i'm calling set one which was 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact315	703.442	708.065	A	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	one which was accepted and talking about this point but uh they've gotten 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact316	708.065	711.855	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	but uh they've gotten five meetings done in that set 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact317	712.135	713.865	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	right now they're in the process of being edited 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact318	714.355	716.055	A	Postdoc	fh|%--	-1	0	um the um see 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact319	716.335	717.135	A	Postdoc	s^co	-1	0	see i hired two transcribers 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact320	717.195	720.265	A	Postdoc	s	+1	3	i hired two transcribers today thinking of hiring another one which will because 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact321	720.265	722.155	A	Postdoc	s^df^e	+1	3	one which will because we had a lot of attrition and 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact322	722.737	724.617	A	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	and that will bring our total too they die 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact323	724.807	726.477	F	Professor	s^j	-1	0	too they die off after they do 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact324	725.715	726.735	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	off after they do 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact327	728.364	729.694	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	well you know it's it's various things so one 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact325	727.888	728.218	D	PhD	s^j	-1	0	well you know it's it's out 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact326	728.347	728.657	F	Professor	b	-1	0	well you know it's it's 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact328	729.694	733.814	A	Postdoc	s^df.%-	-1	0	various things so one of them had a baby um you know one of them really wasn't planning oh that was about unforeseen 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact329	732.736	735.076	C	PhD	s^j.%-	-1	0	know one of them really wasn't planning oh that was about unforeseen side effect 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact330	738.173	741.023	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	one of them um had never plan to work past january nieces all these various 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact331	741.023	742.393	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	nieces all these various things because we you know we presented 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact332	742.393	745.613	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	things because we you know we presented is possibly a month project back in january and and 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact333	745.613	748.003	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	in january and and and and um so it makes sense it 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact334	748.183	748.843	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so it makes sense it 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact335	748.843	752.94	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so it makes sense it through attrition we we were down to to to but they're really solid we're 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact336	752.94	754.44	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	but they're really solid we're really lucky the two that we kept and 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact337	754.7	760.97	A	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	kept and uh well i mean i mean if he can't see it i mean is we got a good cause good car car 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact338	758.579	762.309	G	PhD	s^j	-1	0	cause good car car yeah but still transcribing this meeting 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact339	762.531	765.631	A	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	yeah but still i mean it it's just a matter of we we're we're we've got uh no back meeting 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact340	765.405	766.045	F	Professor	s^j	-1	0	got uh to to the ones who no back 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact341	766.041	772.661	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	to to the ones who who um had had been put in a lot of hours up to this point and there continue putting a lot of was was wonderful 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact342	772.661	774.021	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	a lot of was was wonderful an excellent work and so 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact343	774.527	780.797	A	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	and so then in addition um i hired two more today and i'm planning to hire a third one with this within this coming week but 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact344	780.797	789.183	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	this coming week but but the plan is as as uh more of the same we discussed this and the plan right now is to keep the staff on the on the leave your side you know rather 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact345	789.183	789.513	A	Postdoc	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	you know rather 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact346	789.793	792.113	A	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	you know rather than hiring like eight to ten right now because if 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact347	790.142	790.872	F	Professor	b	-1	0	than hiring like eight 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact348	792.453	800.662	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because if the idea of a thing comes through really quickly then um we would want to have to but you know lay people off and stuff so 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact349	800.662	800.972	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	off and stuff so 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact350	801.719	805.479	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	this way and and i got really a lot of response for for my notice my thing i could 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact351	805.479	808.679	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	notice my thing i could hire additional people my age too 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact352	809.052	813.435	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah and the other thing is i mean in the unlikely event and since we're 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact353	813.435	816.575	F	Professor	s	-1	0	event and since we're so far from this it's a little hard to i am this way in the unlikely 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact354	816.575	823.01	F	Professor	s	-1	0	this way in the unlikely event that we actually find that we have uh transcribers on staff were twiddling their thumbs because you know there's 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact355	823.01	833.434	F	Professor	s	-1	0	because you know there's you know all the stuff that that was sitting there has been transcribed in there and they're faster that the pipeline is faster than uh than degeneration 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact356	834.096	834.696	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact357	834.876	841.966	F	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	um in in today's event that that they actually don's uh i i bet we could find some other stuff for them to do so 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact359	842.104	842.694	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	oh yes i i think 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact358	841.966	848.74	F	Professor	s	-1	0	oh yes stuff for them to do so i i think that eight as we're talking if we if we heard twelve then we could you know rent a a problem later i mean we 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact360	848.74	851.11	F	Professor	s	-1	0	problem later i mean we also just couldn't sustain that forever but but um 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact361	851.11	853.44	F	Professor	s	-1	0	but but um from such a reasons but 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact362	853.44	862.636	F	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	a reasons but if we hire you know we have five on staff five or six times at any given time then it's a small enough number so we can be flexible either way 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact363	863.454	863.634	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr023.A.dialogueact364	864.014	864.214	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact365	864.564	864.674	F	Professor	b.%	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr023.G.dialogueact366	865.559	871.359	G	PhD	s^cs^rt	-1	0	it'd be great to this um we can we might need some help again getting the tighter boundaries or some hand 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact367	871.359	878.68	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	or some hand to experiment with um you'd have a ground truth for this segment haitian work which i guess 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact368	878.68	883.28	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	uhhuh yeah haitian work which i guess you have some already that was really helpful and probably is more 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact369	883.536	892.076	E	PhD	fg|s^na.%-	-1	0	uhhuh yeah that was something that i planned working on this uh to use so the transcripts of a child done by now and to to use them uh for uh yeah the new ones with the tighter boundaries 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact370	884.388	884.718	G	PhD	b	-1	0	that was something 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact371	891.491	892.371	G	PhD	s^2	-1	0	uh for uh yeah the new ones with the tighter boundaries 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact372	892.206	892.456	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah with the tighter boundaries 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact373	892.371	893.751	G	PhD	s^2^e	-1	0	yeah yeah and with the tighter boundaries yeah 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact374	893.507	893.687	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah and yeah 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact375	893.987	897.377	E	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah and to use them for for training at all for for whatever you have to to yeah 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact376	897.507	900.957	E	PhD	s	-1	0	you have to to create some speech non speech label follows them 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact377	901.507	907.127	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and yeah but that that's the thing was so one time just looking into it 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact378	907.461	907.741	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	it 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact379	908.72	912.17	A	Postdoc	s^ba^tc	+1	2	they they they precipitation just so much i was extremely helpful now there was uh 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact380	912.37	913.71	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	now there was uh a good so a couple

Bmr023.A.dialogueact400	950.545	952.765	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	perceptive i really want to have this meeting up transcribes i haven't 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact401	952.765	954.765	A	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	up transcribes i haven't done it yet but i want to do that and 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact402	954.765	958.565	A	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	want to do that and she's out of town um for a couple of weeks but i want to do that when she returns um 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact403	959.035	966.585	A	Postdoc	fh|s^df	-1	0	because she was saying you know what i in a span a very short term yes it seems like the ones that need to be just are these these these things and she was saying 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact404	966.585	969.355	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	these things and she was saying the short patterns is of the um you know 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact405	966.933	967.443	G	PhD	b	-1	0	these things and she was saying the short patterns 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact406	967.469	967.739	E	PhD	b	-1	0	the short patterns 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact407	968.811	969.011	E	PhD	b	-1	0	is of the um you know 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact408	969.805	971.385	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know i mean you're you're where if this but 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact410	971.685	976.705	A	Postdoc	s^ba	+1	2	this but but actually it's so correct for so much of the time is an enormous times here 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact409	971.424	971.814	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	this but 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact411	977.035	978.795	A	Postdoc	s	+1	2	and just a sweet little run down trees 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact413	979.255	979.575	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact412	979.117	979.677	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	so 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact414	980.342	982.832	A	Postdoc	fh|s^cs	-1	0	um yeah i think would be interesting to combine these 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact415	982.837	983.017	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	combine these 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact416	984.352	987.542	G	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	it's actually a record of where they change i mean you can 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact417	987.542	989.542	G	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	change i mean you can compare it to death on the just so 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact418	989.732	991.932	G	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	you could do it it's it's on the just so that we new 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact419	991.015	991.535	A	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	could do it it's it's new 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact420	991.535	996.133	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	could do it it's it's complicated in that um it's even when they create new new 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact421	991.789	992.109	E	PhD	b	-1	0	could do it it's it's complicated in that new 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact422	995.099	1001.46	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	it's even when they create new yeah new segments or something and will be well not that easy but 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact423	1001.46	1003.87	E	PhD	s^na	-1	0	that easy but i think one can do that i mean if we keep the old copy of the 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact424	1002.25	1004.91	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	i think one can do that i mean if we keep the old copy of the old time x. just 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact425	1004.66	1004.83	E	PhD	b	-1	0	old time x. just 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact426	1004.91	1008.17	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	there is yeah that would be great to have old time x. just so that if we run it we know whether we're which ones were cheating and 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact427	1005.82	1006.0	E	PhD	b	-1	0	so that if we run it we know whether we're 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact428	1007.24	1007.36	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah which ones were cheating 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact430	1008.22	1009.65	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	there is that there is one problem that would be great to have to know that and and be good 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact429	1008.17	1008.38	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	there is that would be great to have and 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact431	1008.73	1015.64	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	there is that there is one problem with and that's when they start partway through than what i do is i merge what they've done with these pre segmented version so it's not that would be great to have to know that and and be good 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact432	1009.1	1010.1	G	PhD	s	-1	0	that there is one problem with and that's when they to know that and be good 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact433	1010.04	1010.17	E	PhD	b	-1	0	with and that's when they 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact434	1015.64	1018.8	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	version so it's not a pure it's not a pure conditions with what 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact435	1018.8	1023.12	A	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	2	pure conditions with what you really like is that they started with preset mentioned we're the always through and 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact436	1019.53	1019.95	G	PhD	b	-1	0	you really like is that 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact437	1023.78	1027.05	A	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	and um i uh they wasn't 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact438	1027.74	1029.83	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	wasn't possible for about four the recent ones 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact439	1030.38	1031.65	A	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	but will be possible future because we 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact440	1030.39	1030.79	E	PhD	b	-1	0	but will be possible 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact441	1031.65	1032.59	A	Postdoc	s^df.%--	-1	0	future because we were 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact443	1033.83	1034.08	E	PhD	s^na	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact442	1033.75	1034.33	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	yeah

Bmr023.G.dialogueact445	1034.91	1045.89	G	PhD	s^cs	+1	2	yeah as long as we have a record i guess the original automatic when you can always find out how well we would do in recognition side by using those boundaries 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact446	1036.37	1036.53	E	PhD	b	-1	0	i guess 
Bmr023.E.dialogueact447	1041.16	1041.36	E	PhD	b	-1	0	how well

Bmr023.F.dialogueact456	1063.31	1067.98	F	Professor	fh|qy^bu^rt^t^tc	-1	0	yeah so uh you were saying something about organizing the meeting so 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact457	1068.03	1077.59	D	PhD	s^aa|s.%-	+1	3	so um uh jane in adam and i had a meeting where we talked about the reorganization of the directory structure for all of the meeting just recorded 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact458	1077.13	1077.75	F	Professor	qy^j^rt	-1	0	of the meeting just recorded 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact459	1078.54	1078.73	D	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	now 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact460	1080.32	1081.48	D	PhD	s^e	+1	3	for all the media recorded it it it 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact461	1081.54	1081.89	D	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	it it it 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact462	1082.51	1086.4	D	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um and so we've got a plan for what we're going to do their and then 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact463	1086.4	1097.78	D	PhD	s	+1	1	their and then jane also prepared a um started getting all of the the meetings organized so she prepared a uh spreadsheet which i spent the last couple of days adding too 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact464	1098.29	1102.94	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so i went through all of the data that we have collected so far and have been 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact465	1102.94	1115.56	D	PhD	s	+1	1	and have been putting it into uh a spreadsheet with start time the day the old meeting the new meeting name the number of speakers the duration of the meeting comments you know what it's transcription status is all that kind of stuff and 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact466	1115.94	1122.5	D	PhD	s^df	+1	0	of stuff and so the idea is that we can take this and then exported h. announce mounted on the meeting recorder webpage that we can oh great 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact468	1122.5	1124.92	D	PhD	s^df	+1	1	that we can keep people update about what's going on oh great 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact467	1122.29	1122.97	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	that we can oh great 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact469	1125.49	1127.52	D	PhD	fh|s^cc	-1	0	um i've got to get smart permission from jane because i have some 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact470	1127.52	1131.26	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	from jane because i have some some gaps here that i need to get her to fill in but so 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact471	1131.26	1143.53	D	PhD	s	+1	1	in but so far um has of monday the fourteenth um we've had a total number of meetings sixty two hours of meetings that we've collected and 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact472	1144.02	1145.07	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact473	1146.06	1149.53	D	PhD	s	+1	1	that's another interesting thing the average number of speakers from meeting is six 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact474	1151.02	1151.52	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact475	1152.13	1155.49	D	PhD	s^cc	+1	1	and i'm going to have on here the total amount it's been transcribed so far but i've got a bunch 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact476	1155.49	1156.39	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so far but i've got a bunch of uh that's 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact477	1156.64	1161.6	D	PhD	s	-1	0	of uh that's what i talk to jane about figure out exactly which ones have have been completed and so forth 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact478	1162.1	1171.05	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but um this'll be a nice thing that we can put up on the uh the website and people can be informed of the status of various different ones and they'll also lists 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact479	1171.05	1179.06	D	PhD	s	+1	1	and they'll also lists uh like under the status if it's at i. b. m. or if it's a dixie uh or if it's completed or which ones were excluding in and there's 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact480	1179.06	1184.6	D	PhD	s	-1	0	in and there's a place for comments so we can um say why we're excluding things and so forth now 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact481	1184.81	1185.14	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	and so forth now with the ones that 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact482	1184.88	1189.51	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and so forth now with the ones that um are ready transcribes we we have enough there that you know we've 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact483	1189.72	1192.04	F	Professor	s	-1	0	that you know we've very done some studies and so forth and um 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact484	1192.05	1192.23	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact485	1193.01	1205.91	F	Professor	fh|qy^cs	-1	0	it should we go through and do the business is of of having the uh participants approve it uh for proves the transcriptionist for description and so forth 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact486	1206.46	1207.53	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	um it just shitty in principle 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact487	1207.53	1212.48	A	Postdoc	s^aap	-1	0	just shitty in principle i i would say yes although i still i'm doing some the final past editing trying to converted 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact488	1212.69	1216.83	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	trying to converted over to the master file see being the channel ice person it's 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact489	1216.83	1221.68	A	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	ice person it's it seems like i get into a certain way and then something else entertain i have to stop cleaning 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact490	1222.02	1225.62	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	up these things like the uh the places where the transcriber was uncertain and 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact491	1225.62	1228.08	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	uncertain and and doing spot checking here and there so um 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact492	1228.44	1233.69	A	Postdoc	fh|s^cs	-1	0	so um uh i guess it would make sense to wait till the that's done 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact493	1234.12	1235.18	A	Postdoc	fh|%-	-1	0	um but but well well let me put it another 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact494	1234.54	1240.75	F	Professor	s^co	+1	1	um but but well well let me put it another sort of uh milestone uh as i did with the uh the the pipeline 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact495	1236.52	1236.84	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	sort of uh 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact496	1241.31	1244.91	F	Professor	fh|s	+1	2	guess um we are going to have to start a meeting in the middle of july 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact498	1244.98	1245.32	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	guess in the middle of july and i think you could be 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact497	1244.91	1246.15	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	guess in the middle of july and i think you could be given that 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact499	1246.78	1254.71	F	Professor	s	+1	2	given that we've been we've given a couple public talks about her ready space by months and months i think to be pretty bad if we continued to say none of this is available 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact500	1255.42	1256.03	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	will certainly be done 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact501	1256.34	1257.95	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	will certainly be done by then yeah right suing 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact502	1257.47	1262.78	F	Professor	fg|s^cs:s	+1	2	by then yeah right suing just we we want to be able to say here is a subset that is available right now 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact503	1262.28	1262.43	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	right now 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact504	1262.93	1263.31	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	right now and that's just been through 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact505	1263.37	1265.65	F	Professor	s^e	+1	2	and that's just been through the legal issues and so forth so 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact506	1263.93	1264.29	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	and that's just been through the legal issues 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact507	1265.88	1266.29	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah that's right and so forth so 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact508	1266.39	1267.42	A	Postdoc	s^aa|%-	-1	0	yeah that's right so that 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact509	1267.1	1267.37	F	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	so that 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact510	1268.0	1268.36	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact511	1269.28	1270.99	F	Professor	fh|s^e	-1	0	and they don't have to prove right before july 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact512	1269.81	1277.26	C	PhD	s	+1	2	and they don't have to prove you know the unedited version they can just get their approval to whatever right before july well in principle 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact513	1276.68	1277.07	A	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	well in principle 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact514	1277.11	1284.64	F	Professor	s^aap.%-	+1	2	yeah but the i mean well in principle yes but i mean if if if somebody actually did get in some legal issue with it and 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact515	1283.7	1283.97	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	legal issue with 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact516	1284.44	1289.14	C	PhD	s^arp	+1	2	yeah but the i mean the editing will continue i'm only if if there was a found they will be fixed but they won't it and 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact517	1289.69	1292.97	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	well but they won't change the the content of the meeting content 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact518	1291.1	1291.93	D	PhD	s^2	-1	0	the content content 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact519	1292.94	1295.53	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	well see this is the this is the issue subtleties of the meeting well it it's changes clarifying question 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact520	1293.32	1293.75	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	see this is the this well it it's 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact521	1293.62	1301.22	G	PhD	qh	-1	0	see this is the this is the issue subtleties the thing too well it it's changes clarifying question question then you know how can they agreed to it before they know her final version 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact522	1301.49	1308.26	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	the thing too is there can be subtleties were person uses this word instead of that word which could have been transcribed the other way and 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact523	1302.07	1302.42	F	Professor	b	-1	0	is there can be subtleties 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact524	1302.3	1302.65	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	is there can be subtleties 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact525	1308.95	1313.64	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and not and they wouldn't have been funders if it'd been this other word you know 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact526	1313.64	1314.03	A	Postdoc	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	other word you know it you out 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact527	1314.27	1318.03	F	Professor	s^na	+1	2	it you out there there's a point at which i agree it becomes ridiculous because you know you could do 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact528	1318.03	1323.84	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because you know you could do this final thing and then a year from now somebody could say you know that should be a period not a question are right 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact529	1323.84	1324.11	F	Professor	qh^rt	-1	0	a question are right and you don't 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact530	1324.64	1330.47	F	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	and you don't you there's no way we're going to go back and ask everybody do you approve this uh you know this document now so 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact531	1330.47	1330.74	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	now so 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact532	1331.28	1344.44	F	Professor	s:s^co	-1	0	so i think what it is is that the the the the thing that they sign i i look at in a while but it has to be open enough that sort of says okay from now on you know now that i've read this you can use do anything you want with these data 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact533	1344.91	1345.23	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	data and uh but 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact534	1345.29	1347.3	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and uh but i think we wanted so 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact535	1347.3	1361.5	F	Professor	s^cs.%-	-1	0	uhhuh i agree i totally so assuming that it's that kind of wording i don't remember um i think we just want to have it enough confidence ourselves that it's so close to the final form it's going to be in a year from now that they're 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact536	1360.04	1360.29	A	Postdoc	s^aa^rt	-1	0	uhhuh i agree a year from now that 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact537	1360.52	1360.89	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	uhhuh i agree a year from now that 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact538	1361.67	1362.4	A	Postdoc	s^aa^r	-1	0	i totally agree it's just they're 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact540	1362.71	1376.83	A	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	agree it's just a question of uh if if the person is using the transcript is the way of them judging what they said the weather was funders then it seems like it's it's it needs to be more correct than if we could count on them relive thing to the meeting 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact539	1362.65	1362.9	F	Professor	b	-1	0	agree it's just 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact541	1377.45	1381.01	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because it becomes in a way of uh legal documents if they've agreed well i forget how we 
Bmr023.A.dialogueact542	1381.18	1382.43	A	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	if they've agreed to that well i forget how we end right i figure 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact543	1381.38	1382.4	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	if they've agreed to that well i forget how we end right i figure 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact544	1382.67	1383.98	F	Professor	s	-1	0	to that end right i figure how we ended up on this but 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact545	1383.97	1390.76	F	Professor	s	-1	0	how we ended up on this but i remember my taking the position of not making it so so easy for everybody to deserve everything and 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact546	1390.76	1397.85	F	Professor	s	-1	0	everything and and i was taking the position of of having it be really straight for people to check every aspect of it including the audio 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact547	1398.49	1400.02	F	Professor	s^no	-1	0	i don't remember who won me that 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact548	1400.07	1400.2	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	that

Bmr023.F.dialogueact601	1494.79	1500.42	F	Professor	fg|s^df	-1	0	anyway have what we've gone down the steps a number of times i know this can lead to extended conversations they're not really get anywhere so the latest that have men and a lot of meeting 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact602	1500.42	1507.39	F	Professor	s^co	+1	2	yes anywhere so the latest suggests that uh offline that uh the people involved figure it out and take care of it before so i okay

Bmr023.F.dialogueact610	1519.89	1520.69	F	Professor	qo^t^tc	-1	0	so let's see i got 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact611	1522.02	1526.46	F	Professor	fh|s^rt	-1	0	to that uh the part about his project in class and uh 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact612	1526.46	1529.15	F	Professor	fh|s^e	-1	0	and uh or written written version so that was

Bmr023.F.dialogueact614	1529.15	1531.46	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	so that was stuff he was doing with you 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact616	1532.69	1532.84	F	Professor	b	-1	0	i mean it's i 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact615	1532.34	1534.94	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i mean it's i guess one thing we're learning is that the amount we 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact617	1534.94	1537.05	G	PhD	s	-1	0	is that the amount we have eight meetings there because we couldn't use 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact618	1537.05	1539.94	G	PhD	s^df	+1	1	because we couldn't use the non native all non native meetings and 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact619	1539.94	1546.28	G	PhD	s	+1	1	native meetings and it's oh probably below specials on enough data for us for the things we're looking at because the 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact620	1546.29	1551.94	G	PhD	s^df	+1	4	at because the pathetic features are very noisy and so you you need a lot of data in order to model them 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact621	1552.44	1554.15	G	PhD	s	+1	3	i'm so we're starting to see some patterns and we're hoping that maybe 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact622	1554.15	1560.8	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and we're hoping that maybe with i don't know double or triple the date it was twenty meetings or so that we would start to get better results but 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact623	1560.8	1582.71	G	PhD	s	+1	3	better results but we did find that some of the features that i get jane would know about that are expressing sort of the distance of um boundaries from peaks in yet or and some local range pitch range effects like how close people are to their floor are showing up and he's classifies 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact624	1583.28	1587.68	G	PhD	s^e	+1	1	which i also being given some word features that are cheating because they're true words um 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact625	1588.02	1590.11	G	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	so these are based on some alignment word features 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact626	1590.53	1593.0	G	PhD	s	-1	0	word features like um word frequency and whether 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact627	1593.55	1595.83	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and whether or not some of the back channel and so forth 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact628	1596.69	1600.34	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	so the dominant features including everything so we're starting to see i think some interesting 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact629	1599.1	1603.2	F	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	so the dominant features including everything where those those and she thinks right interesting

Bmr023.G.dialogueact683	1662.65	1665.88	G	PhD	s^e	+1	1	type finding sense boundaries finding this one's the boundaries and 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact685	1665.88	1673.05	G	PhD	s	+1	1	one's the boundaries and then i had done some work on finding from the foreground speech whether or not someone was likely to interrupt so where 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact686	1673.05	1682.26	G	PhD	s^e:qy	+1	1	so where you know if i'm talking now in some in an address is about to enter at me is he going to choose a certain place in my speech either preside a clear word based and they 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact687	1682.68	1685.79	G	PhD	s	+1	2	and they are the presided futures actually showed up 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact688	1686.43	1688.68	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and a neat thing even though 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact689	1688.68	1690.58	G	PhD	s^e	+1	1	a neat thing even though the word features were available 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact690	1691.18	1694.81	G	PhD	s^r.%--	+1	1	and anything there too as i tried some putting the speaker so 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact691	1694.82	1698.35	G	PhD	s	+1	1	the speaker so i gave everybody a short version of their names of the real names 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact692	1698.35	1699.49	G	PhD	s	-1	0	names of the real names are in there which we couldn't 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact693	1699.49	1700.41	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	are in there which we couldn't use 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact694	1700.98	1702.88	G	PhD	fh|s^cs	-1	0	use should use i. d.'s or something 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact695	1703.68	1704.89	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and those don't show up 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact696	1705.14	1711.59	G	PhD	s^bs	+1	1	so that means that overall um it wasn't just modeling morgan or it wasn't just smiling single person 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact697	1711.75	1712.05	F	Professor	b	-1	0	person 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact698	1712.33	1712.83	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr023.G.dialogueact699	1714.39	1718.79	G	PhD	s	-1	0	but was sort of trying to uh i get a general idea them model 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact700	1718.83	1723.95	G	PhD	s	-1	0	idea them model the tree class very strange to find general locations that were applicable to different speakers even 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact701	1723.95	1726.18	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	to different speakers even though there are huge speaker effect so 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact702	1726.18	1726.46	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact703	1727.25	1738.82	G	PhD	s^co	-1	0	the but the mean limitation now is like because we're only looking at things that happen every ten words or every twenty words we need more more data uh more data per speaker 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact704	1740.02	1740.57	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr023.G.dialogueact705	1741.22	1743.61	G	PhD	s^ba^cs	-1	0	it also be interesting to look at the e. d. u. meetings because we 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact706	1743.61	1747.39	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	meetings because we did include meeting tight as a features so 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact707	1747.39	1747.73	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact708	1748.42	1754.79	G	PhD	s	-1	0	whether you are in now meeting recorder meeting were real buses meeting did matter interrupts because 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact709	1754.79	1757.59	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	interrupts because they're just fewer interrupts and the robust meetings and 
Bmr023.B.dialogueact710	1757.24	1757.72	B	Grad	b	-1	0	meetings and 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact711	1758.01	1762.98	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so but classify learns more about morgan than it does about sort of the average person which 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact712	1760.89	1761.19	F	Professor	b	-1	0	morgan than it does about sort of the 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact713	1762.98	1764.4	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	average person which not that probably do 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact714	1764.56	1767.65	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	that probably do better than um i wasn't generalizing so 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact716	1768.07	1768.41	F	Professor	b	-1	0	it's and 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact715	1767.97	1768.35	G	PhD	%--	-1	0	so it's and 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact717	1768.97	1774.41	G	PhD	s	-1	0	it's and i think john um well we have a long list of things he's starting to look at now over the summer where we can 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact718	1774.41	1774.99	G	PhD	%--	-1	0	summer where we can 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact719	1775.9	1778.56	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and he'll be able to report on more things in the future but it was great 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact720	1778.56	1787.95	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	in the future but it was great that you can at least go from uh you know james transcripts and uh i recognize or output in to this point and 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact721	1787.95	1792.3	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	to this point and i think it's something mari can probably in her preliminary report like yeah we're 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact722	1792.3	1795.69	G	PhD	s:s	-1	0	like yeah we're at the point we're training these class fires and we just 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact723	1795.69	1804.47	G	PhD	s	-1	0	fires and we just reporting very preliminary but suggestive results that some features both word and prop pathetic work 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact724	1805.3	1809.6	G	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	yeah i think that was interesting to me is that the pitch features are better than in switchboard 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact725	1810.23	1812.8	G	PhD	s	+1	1	and i think that really is from the coast talking mikes because 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact726	1812.8	1821.53	G	PhD	s^df	+1	1	better in one sense talking mikes because the pitch processing that was done has much cleaner behavior than than the switchboard telephone less 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact727	1820.15	1821.28	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	better in one sense switchboard telephone less 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact728	1821.28	1822.13	C	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	better in one sense less 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact729	1822.83	1830.9	G	PhD	h|s^ba	+1	1	well first of all the pitch track from have less having been doubling than than switchboard and 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact730	1830.9	1832.37	G	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	than switchboard and there's a lot less dropouts so if you 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact731	1832.43	1842.47	G	PhD	s	+1	1	so if you ask how many regions where you would normally expect somebody else to be occurring are completely devoid of pitch information other was a pitched 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact732	1839.35	1840.14	F	Professor	b	-1	0	are completely devoid 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact733	1839.44	1839.94	F	Professor	b	-1	0	are 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact734	1842.47	1847.54	G	PhD	s	+1	1	other was a pitched record just to get a high enough probability of voicing for words for for 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact735	1847.64	1849.43	G	PhD	s^e.%--	-1	0	words for for you know five where that much 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact736	1848.41	1848.84	F	Professor	b	-1	0	you know 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact737	1849.49	1851.08	G	PhD	s	-1	0	five where that much fewer than in switch so the missing 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact738	1851.08	1855.35	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so the missing we had a big missing data problem in switchboard 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact739	1856.18	1858.55	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and so the features weren't as reliable because they were often 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact740	1858.55	1860.22	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	could have reliable because they were often just not available so that's actually 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact742	1860.64	1864.39	D	PhD	qy^rt	+1	1	could have to do with the the lower frequency cut off on the switchboard so that's actually good may maybe 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact741	1860.51	1861.38	G	PhD	s	-1	0	could have to do with the the so that's actually good 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact743	1864.59	1868.31	G	PhD	s^am|s	+1	1	may maybe you mean to tell we had tell from endless for switchboard and 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact744	1868.71	1876.38	G	PhD	s	+1	1	and we had the i'm annoying sort of telephone handset movement problem that i think they also affected

Bmr023.C.dialogueact765	1933.45	1935.73	C	PhD	s	-1	0	they were higher number of conditions actually 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact766	1935.93	1936.11	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	actually so deletion 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact768	1936.76	1943.7	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so you so actually it it's prefer to have uh positive or negative some fishing which means deletion 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact767	1936.75	1937.46	G	PhD	qy^br^rt	-1	0	so you deletion 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact769	1943.7	1945.93	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	which means

Bmr023.C.dialogueact783	1966.34	1978.7	C	PhD	s	+1	2	you know talk and i talked and the next thing to do was probably too too and uh um the size of the cussing system um to to this to this feature factor which we have not at all just 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact784	1978.7	1983.97	C	PhD	s	+1	2	not at all just the same configuration that's a used for for the standard system and

Bmr023.C.dialogueact786	1983.97	1993.07	C	PhD	s	+1	2	the standard system and for instance uh then then to send me a message saying that seem you used um something like ten thousand for cluster 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact787	1994.35	1997.35	C	PhD	s	+1	2	know each each makes has ten thousands and uhhuh were you in sixty 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact788	1996.5	1997.01	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	thousands and uhhuh were you in sixty 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact789	1997.22	1998.43	D	PhD	s^bu	+1	2	and and really isn't sixty were you in sixty four 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact790	1997.94	1999.48	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and and really isn't sixty four so that's were you in sixty four

Bmr023.C.dialogueact792	1999.49	2001.64	C	PhD	s	+1	2	four so that's obviously a big difference and might 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact793	1999.74	2000.05	D	PhD	b	-1	0	four so that's obviously a big 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact794	2001.64	2002.76	C	PhD	s^am	-1	0	difference and might be way off and 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact795	2002.76	2007.79	C	PhD	s^am	+1	2	be way off and get very poorly trained you know got since that way

Bmr023.C.dialogueact811	2046.05	2053.48	C	PhD	s	+1	3	as i said before the using bands uh uh vocal tracks normalization option works very well so 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact813	2053.9	2062.53	C	PhD	s	+1	1	well so um i ran one experimental where we just that uh book protect our normalization only in the test data so 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact812	2053.7	2054.01	F	Professor	b	-1	0	well so um 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact814	2062.92	2065.81	C	PhD	s	+1	1	data so i didn't bother to retrain the months at all 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact815	2066.49	2068.09	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and to prove by one percent which is about what we got

Bmr023.C.dialogueact817	2080.64	2087.57	C	PhD	s	+1	1	so in the few hours will have the numbers for retraining everything with we're tracking from position so 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact818	2087.57	2089.33	C	PhD	s	-1	0	position so that might be improved further so

Bmr023.F.dialogueact824	2099.22	2099.39	F	Professor	b.%	-1	0	so you mean you improve one 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact823	2098.86	2104.34	G	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	so you mean you improve one percent over the system that doesn't have any detail in it already 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact825	2103.96	2105.03	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	detail in it already

Bmr023.F.dialogueact828	2109.3	2114.68	F	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	right right okay so and then we'll have our baseline to compare the currently hideous uh uh new things but 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact829	2113.82	2114.34	C	PhD	s^aa|%-	-1	0	right right hideous uh uh new things but 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact831	2114.82	2123.24	C	PhD	fg|s	+1	1	right and and what that's just also is of course that the currents switchboard mot isn't trained on very good teachers new things but 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact830	2114.68	2114.95	F	Professor	%-	-1	0	right new things but 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact832	2116.39	2116.71	F	Professor	b	-1	0	what that's just also 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact833	2124.82	2133.31	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	uh because it was trained on you know was used uh did not find stuff which didn't have any 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact834	2133.31	2134.42	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	which didn't have any of the 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact835	2135.42	2138.32	F	Professor	s^bk|s^df	-1	0	right but all of these effects for like a couple percent 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact836	2135.98	2137.14	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	right but all of these effects for like a couple percent 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact837	2139.08	2139.33	F	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact838	2139.33	2140.49	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	well but if you add them up 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact839	2140.08	2143.63	C	PhD	s^df^ng	+1	2	well but if you add them up you have uh almost five percent difference 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact840	2144.46	2146.15	F	Professor	s^m^t1.%--	-1	0	and all of them my fellow was one point 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact841	2146.15	2148.35	F	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	yeah my fellow was one point five percent one was point eight 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact842	2148.95	2151.12	C	PhD	s^aa|s^rt	-1	0	yeah i know we have another person with the detail eight that's three 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact843	2151.54	2152.8	F	Professor	s	-1	0	um that's three point three 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact844	2152.92	2154.44	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	um actually and that's point three 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact845	2154.62	2156.15	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	that's 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact846	2155.32	2155.95	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr023.C.dialogueact847	2157.28	2159.55	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	what's actually quite interesting is that with 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact848	2160.61	2164.63	C	PhD	s	-1	0	um well you probably maybe another half percent if you do the detail and training 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact849	2165.42	2174.13	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and then interesting if you optimize you've got more wind out of restoring uh in bestest uh enough 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact850	2174.71	2176.27	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	uh enough to my thing the way it's i mean 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact851	2176.79	2178.0	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	i mean then yeah then you do with the standard yeah 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact852	2177.02	2177.98	D	PhD	qy^2^bu^d^rt	-1	0	then yeah then you do with the standard 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact853	2178.0	2178.35	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact855	2179.17	2179.69	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	so but the part that's actually 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact854	2179.03	2185.17	F	Professor	s^bk|s	-1	0	so but the part that's actually adjustment of the front and per se as opposed to doing putting be vienna or something is it was couple so it was 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact856	2181.97	2182.26	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and per se as opposed to doing putting 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact857	2185.65	2189.88	F	Professor	s	-1	0	it was it was there was there was one thing that was on a half percent was play 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact858	2190.16	2191.34	F	Professor	%--	-1	0	so and and but she's i remember 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact859	2191.52	2192.49	F	Professor	s	-1	0	but she's i remember they were one of them 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact860	2192.49	2201.21	F	Professor	s	-1	0	they were one of them was uh to change to uh because it does it all at to affirm bark scale to mel scale which i 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact861	2200.89	2201.42	C	PhD	b	-1	0	to mel scale which i 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact862	2201.83	2203.63	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	which i really feel like saying in quotes because 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact863	2203.62	2206.74	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	quotes because they're essentially the same scale but that yeah why did that 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact865	2206.74	2214.14	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	same scale but that but but but any individual particular implementation of those things puts things in a particular place so that's yeah why did that too 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact864	2206.33	2207.41	G	PhD	fg|qw.%-	-1	0	same scale but that but but but yeah why did that too 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact866	2214.23	2214.77	C	PhD	b	-1	0	so that's 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact867	2214.63	2215.88	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so that's why i wanted to look so 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact868	2215.88	2216.86	F	Professor	s	-1	0	why i wanted to look so him looked at i 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact869	2216.99	2219.91	F	Professor	s	-1	0	him looked at i want to look at exactly where the filters were in the too and 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact870	2218.85	2219.22	C	PhD	b	-1	0	where the filters were in the too and 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact871	2219.91	2226.29	F	Professor	s^am	-1	0	were in the too and it it's probably something like there's one fewer one more filter in the sub one kill her and for whatever reason 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact873	2226.52	2227.22	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and for whatever reason with this particular 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact872	2226.29	2229.36	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and for whatever reason with this particular experiment is better one way or the 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact874	2229.36	2230.27	F	Professor	s	-1	0	one way or the other um 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact875	2229.46	2229.76	G	PhD	b	-1	0	one way or the 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact876	2230.9	2233.24	F	Professor	s^am^bd^cs	-1	0	other um it could be something more fundamental but it you know 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact877	2233.24	2234.91	F	Professor	s^bd^df^no	-1	0	but it you know i i don't know yet 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact878	2235.29	2237.68	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and the other and the other that was like when i have for something and it was 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact879	2237.68	2238.85	F	Professor	s	-1	0	for something and it was twenty percent which 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact880	2238.85	2239.69	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	twenty percent which was was the 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact881	2239.69	2240.53	F	Professor	qw^t1	-1	0	well that was combined was was the other thing 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact882	2240.45	2241.91	D	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	well that was combined with the triangular right other thing 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact883	2241.91	2242.15	D	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	with the triangular right yeah those 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact884	2242.81	2244.07	F	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah those those two were together we were able to separate 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact885	2243.88	2245.44	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	right those two were together we were able to separate boxes or one 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact886	2244.07	2245.24	F	Professor	s	-1	0	right we were able to separate boxes or one 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact887	2245.24	2246.27	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	right boxes or one thing but then there was a point eight 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact888	2246.27	2248.31	F	Professor	s	-1	0	the low thing but then there was a point eight percent was something else remember uh 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact890	2248.62	2250.11	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	the low frequency cutoff else remember uh oh yeah so that was 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact889	2248.31	2248.88	F	Professor	qy.%-	-1	0	the low else remember uh 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact891	2250.16	2255.46	F	Professor	s^bk|s	-1	0	oh yeah so that was that was uh that when i can claim credit for uh in terms of screen up in the first place so someone 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact892	2255.46	2256.83	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	place so someone of some of six that 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact893	2257.31	2259.03	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	which is that um i never played when i we 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact894	2259.03	2259.49	F	Professor	%--	-1	0	i we 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact895	2259.95	2262.27	F	Professor	s	-1	0	i we had some problems before with offsets this if this went back 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact896	2262.34	2265.67	F	Professor	s	-1	0	this if this went back to um i think wall street journal 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact898	2266.97	2267.49	C	PhD	b	-1	0	so we we had uh 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact897	2266.51	2267.7	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so we we had uh 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact899	2268.01	2273.03	F	Professor	s	-1	0	everybody else who was doing wall street journal knew that they were big d. c. offices in the state and the state and and and no 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact900	2273.03	2275.09	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and and and no we had mentioned it to us we're getting like 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact901	2273.58	2274.48	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and and and no we had mentioned it to us 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact902	2275.09	2277.09	F	Professor	s	-1	0	we're getting like really terrible results like two three times a year 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact903	2277.09	2279.07	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	like two three times a year everybody else is getting and then 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact904	2279.83	2284.69	F	Professor	s:s	-1	0	and then in casual conversation on matched mentioned uh well i guess you know course you're taking care of the offset this what 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact905	2284.69	2285.54	F	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	of the offset this what offsets 
Bmr023.B.dialogueact907	2285.93	2286.62	B	Grad	b	-1	0	offsets at that point yeah we're 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact906	2285.89	2286.53	C	PhD	b	-1	0	offsets at that point yeah we're 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact908	2286.14	2287.87	F	Professor	s	-1	0	at that point yeah we're pretty new i didn't we 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact909	2287.87	2289.78	F	Professor	s	-1	0	pretty new i didn't we never really like looked at it on the screen and 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact910	2289.78	2291.64	F	Professor	s^fe	-1	0	it on the screen and then we screen and we 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact912	2292.7	2293.25	C	PhD	b	-1	0	just big d. c. offset so 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact911	2292.31	2293.31	F	Professor	s	-1	0	just big d. c. offset so 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact913	2293.69	2295.41	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	so um in peel p. there was up like a or something 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact914	2294.53	2297.29	G	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	um in peel p. no it's it's there was up like a or something or when they recorded or just 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact915	2297.21	2304.06	F	Professor	s^ar|s	-1	0	no it's it's it's not at all uncommon for for record electronics to have different um d. c. offsets it's or just 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact916	2297.58	2298.0	G	PhD	qrr.%-	-1	0	no it's it's it's not or just 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact917	2304.08	2304.46	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	it's 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact918	2304.9	2306.4	F	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	it's it's you know no big deal it's yeah you could 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact919	2306.4	2308.91	F	Professor	s	-1	0	deal it's yeah you could have ten twenty thirty knows whatever and 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact920	2308.91	2309.96	F	Professor	s	-1	0	knows whatever and it's consistently in that's 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact921	2310.25	2314.73	F	Professor	s	-1	0	the thing is most people's front and have free emphasis but it was or it's or frequency 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact922	2315.09	2316.18	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so that it's a relative uh 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact923	2316.93	2320.47	F	Professor	s	-1	0	uh but was guilty we didn't actually have that we had we 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact924	2320.58	2328.73	F	Professor	s	-1	0	that we had we had the equivalent of preemptive says and i a uh what you're months and style waiting that occurs in the middle of peel p. 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact925	2328.73	2331.85	F	Professor	s	-1	0	p. it doesn't actually have a zero eight zero frequency like 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact926	2331.15	2331.39	G	PhD	b	-1	0	frequency like 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact927	2331.85	2334.66	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	frequency like the typical simple parenthesis that's we have something 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact928	2334.75	2335.71	F	Professor	s	-1	0	that's we have something more fancy it was like 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact929	2335.71	2336.31	F	Professor	s	-1	0	more fancy it was like around didn't have that 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact930	2336.31	2336.98	F	Professor	s	-1	0	around didn't have that 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact931	2337.48	2340.87	F	Professor	s:s	-1	0	so that's why i really know we better have a have a high pass filters just 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact932	2340.87	2343.26	F	Professor	s	-1	0	high pass filters just you know just take care of the problem so i put in i have to 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact933	2343.26	2350.53	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so i put in i have to filter that uh i think ninety ninety hurts are so uh for sixteen killer stamping 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact934	2351.39	2356.8	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and i never put anything in to adjust it for different different sampling rates 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact935	2357.37	2360.37	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and so uh so the of the code us know anything about that and so this is all 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact936	2360.37	2361.87	F	Professor	s	-1	0	that and so this is all they kill a person so 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact937	2361.87	2365.41	F	Professor	s	-1	0	they kill a person so it was a forty five hertz instead of ninety so 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact938	2363.55	2364.16	C	PhD	b	-1	0	instead of 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact939	2365.41	2366.46	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	ninety so um i 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact940	2366.83	2371.99	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	well he made the primer um i don't know if stan fixed it or 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact941	2371.17	2372.55	C	PhD	s	-1	0	well he made the primer he 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact942	2372.99	2373.89	F	Professor	s^m^na	-1	0	he made a parameter so 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact943	2373.89	2375.89	F	Professor	s	-1	0	made a parameter so it i guess if you get it right he did fix it and 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact944	2375.89	2378.03	F	Professor	s	-1	0	what what he did fix it and then and it's taken care of sampling right which is great 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact945	2378.03	2378.77	F	Professor	s	-1	0	what what which is great 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact946	2378.8	2379.97	D	PhD	qw	-1	0	what what is the parameters which is great 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact947	2379.09	2379.43	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	is the parameters 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact948	2379.97	2382.27	D	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	it's is the parameters is uh just the lower cut off that you want 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact949	2382.8	2385.68	C	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	it's called uh h. h. p. s. want yeah the

Bmr023.F.dialogueact957	2395.01	2397.89	F	Professor	s	-1	0	frankly we never did that with the ross of filter either so 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact959	2398.05	2398.59	C	PhD	b	-1	0	the rest of filters actually 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact958	2397.89	2403.06	F	Professor	s	-1	0	of filter either so the rest of filters actually doing a different thing in the much licensor because the main depending what's happened redoing which is 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact960	2403.06	2405.68	F	Professor	s	-1	0	which is another helpful but you're fine 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact961	2403.6	2404.02	C	PhD	b	-1	0	which is another helpful 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact962	2406.49	2407.39	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	but um 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact963	2408.58	2413.29	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so that that was the problem there was a we we had always intended to cut off a hundred hertz and just 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact964	2413.15	2413.59	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and just 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact965	2413.29	2414.57	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and just wasn't doing out so 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact966	2414.57	2415.06	F	Professor	s	-1	0	wasn't doing out so that had that 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact967	2415.06	2417.97	F	Professor	s	-1	0	that had that help despite like it cancer percent 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact968	2417.97	2419.28	F	Professor	s	-1	0	cancer percent but wasn't like 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact969	2421.01	2421.26	C	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr023.C.dialogueact970	2422.86	2431.71	C	PhD	s	-1	0	well but um well @reject@ again after completing heard experiment so we can add up all the differences and oh yeah but 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact971	2430.94	2431.34	F	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	differences and oh yeah but 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact973	2431.71	2433.02	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	differences and and that yeah but i guess my my point was that that 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact972	2431.34	2444.57	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	differences and and that yeah but i guess my my point was that that um hybrid system thing we did was uh primitive and anyway 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact974	2445.03	2445.11	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	and i 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact975	2445.36	2445.6	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and i 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact976	2445.68	2452.49	F	Professor	s	+1	2	and i think i agree with you that if we fixed lots of different things in their all that up and probably have a a a competitive system but i 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact977	2452.84	2455.87	F	Professor	s^bd^df	+1	2	system but i think not that much of it is due to the front and per se i think 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact978	2455.87	2459.06	F	Professor	s	+1	2	and per se i think maybe a couple of percent of it is as far as i can see from this uh unless 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact979	2459.16	2459.52	C	PhD	b	-1	0	uh unless 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact980	2459.7	2463.87	F	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	uh unless you call well if you call killed a friend a friend and that's a little more but 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact981	2463.87	2466.42	F	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	one experiment a little more but sort of four 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact982	2466.35	2481.51	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	well that's one experiment we should well probably need to do though and um at some point is since we're using that same than that that was trained on kelpie without all these things and it's for the tandem system we may want to go back and re train 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact983	2466.42	2466.55	F	Professor	s^f	-1	0	one experiment 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact984	2466.73	2466.82	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	one experiment 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact985	2481.8	2483.23	C	PhD	s^na|s^aa	-1	0	well that's what i meant yeah yeah for the tandem 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact986	2482.76	2483.4	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	what i meant yeah yeah for the tandem 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact987	2483.54	2484.71	D	PhD	s^e|s^f	-1	0	yeah for the tandem you know so we 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact988	2484.71	2488.46	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so so the you know so we can see if what effect it has on the tandem 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact989	2488.29	2491.09	C	PhD	fg|qy.%--	-1	0	so so the thing is is do we expect uh at this 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact990	2489.72	2490.13	F	Professor	b	-1	0	thing is is do we expect 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact991	2491.44	2504.2	C	PhD	qy^rt	+1	2	uh at this point i'm ass i'm you know i'm wondering is it can we expect to tennis and to do better than that properly trained you know a godson system trying to like you know in the future is with you know the rights choices parameters well that's 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact992	2504.86	2507.13	F	Professor	s^na|s^aa	-1	0	well that's what we're seeing in other areas yeah 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact993	2508.46	2508.79	F	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	so 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact994	2509.03	2510.41	F	Professor	%--	-1	0	it's so 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact995	2510.56	2513.08	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	so we but but we 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact996	2513.12	2517.22	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so we but but we may not i mean if it doesn't perform as well we may not know why i because we need 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact997	2517.52	2517.65	D	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	i because we need 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact998	2517.65	2520.63	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	i because we need to do the exact experiment 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact999	2519.17	2519.47	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	the exact 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1000	2522.51	2530.77	F	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean the reason i think it should is because you're putting in the same information and your transfer may need to be more discriminating 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1001	2531.29	2533.95	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1002	2534.27	2538.52	F	Professor	s	-1	0	now the thing is in some databases i wouldn't expect it to necessarily give you much and and part 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1003	2538.52	2548.78	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	much and and part of what i do is real power of it is that there's your transformation oh capability for taking all sorts of different while to things that we do not just 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1004	2548.78	2550.56	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	that we do not just the standard friend and but other 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1005	2550.56	2553.06	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	friend and but other things like with multiple streams and so forth analyze you 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1006	2553.2	2553.56	C	PhD	b	-1	0	analyze you 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1007	2553.49	2556.65	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	analyze you feed into the other system was this through this funnel 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1008	2557.42	2560.05	F	Professor	s	-1	0	um so i think i think that's the real power but i wouldn't expect huge and 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1009	2560.05	2562.29	F	Professor	s	-1	0	i wouldn't expect huge and huge improvements um 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1010	2563.09	2568.07	F	Professor	s	-1	0	but it should at least be roughly the same and maybe a little better if it seemed like way way 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1011	2567.69	2568.42	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and maybe a little better if it seemed like way way 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1012	2568.07	2570.32	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	if it seemed like way way worse 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1013	2570.69	2570.89	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1014	2571.07	2573.74	D	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	some we're going to another thing that under s. and i were talking about was so 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1015	2573.74	2580.48	D	PhD	s	-1	0	about was so then the first experiment that he did we just took the whole fifty six uh outputs and that's 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1016	2580.48	2586.92	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and that's um basically compared to a thirty nine input feature victor um either m. s. is here p. l. p. 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1017	2582.22	2582.61	F	Professor	b	-1	0	basically compared to 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1018	2584.96	2585.25	F	Professor	b	-1	0	feature victor um either m. s. 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1019	2587.6	2589.17	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	but one thing we could do is i mean just definite 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1020	2588.83	2590.2	F	Professor	s	-1	0	we could do is i mean just definite you say take the fifty 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1021	2590.2	2595.29	F	Professor	qy^bu^d	-1	0	yes there's regular you say take the fifty thousand these are the pretty finding on one they're ready outputs and and 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1022	2595.26	2597.28	D	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	yes there's regular tandem outputs through the and and through the kale too 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1023	2595.38	2596.07	F	Professor	%-	-1	0	yes there's regular tandem outputs and and through 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1024	2596.93	2598.0	F	Professor	qy^bu^d^e	-1	0	tandem outputs through the l. all that through the kale too okay 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1025	2597.81	2598.62	D	PhD	s^m^na	-1	0	through the l. all that the kale too okay 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1027	2598.8	2599.48	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	l. all that kind of stuff okay and so so 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1026	2598.69	2599.07	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	l. all that kind of stuff okay and so so 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1028	2599.31	2602.68	F	Professor	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	kind of stuff that's and so so then you have to use all fifty six of the guilty 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1030	2602.97	2603.72	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	that's what we did right the guilty 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1029	2602.68	2602.79	F	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	that's the guilty 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1031	2603.95	2604.19	D	PhD	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	what we did right so one thing 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1033	2604.61	2611.89	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so one thing we were wondering is if we did principal components and say took out just thirteen and then did deltas in double deltas on that so 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1032	2604.45	2604.82	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	so one thing 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1034	2608.11	2608.49	F	Professor	b	-1	0	took out just thirteen 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1036	2611.89	2616.17	D	PhD	s	-1	0	deltas on that so we treated this verse thirteen as though they were standard features i mean today 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1035	2611.61	2612.0	F	Professor	b	-1	0	deltas on that so we treated this 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1037	2616.13	2616.42	F	Professor	b	-1	0	i mean today 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1038	2616.78	2618.93	D	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	i mean today and do experiments like that uh 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1039	2619.47	2620.42	F	Professor	s^co	-1	0	uh talk with seven 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1040	2621.98	2623.09	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	he gets and things like that you see the crime 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1041	2623.48	2624.6	F	Professor	s^bd^df	-1	0	you see the crime carmen i forget 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1042	2624.6	2625.08	F	Professor	s^no	-1	0	carmen i forget 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1044	2625.27	2625.72	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1043	2625.24	2625.92	D	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1045	2626.3	2629.54	F	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean they're all different databases and different you know any c. k. and all that so it 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1046	2628.17	2628.63	D	PhD	b	-1	0	you know any c. k. 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1047	2629.54	2631.09	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and all that so it it may not apply but my recollection 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1048	2631.09	2635.35	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	but my recollection of it was that it didn't make it better but i didn't make it worse 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1049	2635.65	2636.17	D	PhD	b	-1	0	but again 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1050	2636.3	2643.46	F	Professor	s	-1	0	but again given all these differences maybe it's more important in your case that you not take a lot of these little variants uh components 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1051	2644.52	2649.63	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because in a sense then that's already got quite a bit of context and those teachers so if 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1052	2648.29	2648.59	F	Professor	b	-1	0	those 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1053	2649.77	2657.0	D	PhD	s	-1	0	teachers so if we did deltas and doubled deltas on top of those we're getting sort of even more 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1054	2658.08	2659.31	F	Professor	s^2	-1	0	which would be good or not 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1055	2659.07	2659.43	D	PhD	b	-1	0	not 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1056	2659.46	2659.71	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	not 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1057	2663.07	2663.73	F	Professor	fg|s^cs	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1058	2665.28	2676.12	C	PhD	s	+1	1	but the the main point is that you know it took us a while but we have uh procedure for coupling the two systems you bike now and 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1059	2676.12	2684.0	C	PhD	s	+1	1	and i mean there's still a conceivably some bog somewhere and the way we feeding and teachers either generating the morphine 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1060	2684.0	2688.08	C	PhD	s^e	+1	1	either generating the morphine to this to their right system but 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1061	2684.68	2685.23	D	PhD	b	-1	0	either generating the morphine to this 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1062	2686.71	2686.99	D	PhD	b	-1	0	to their

Bmr023.C.dialogueact1065	2689.46	2689.85	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	there might be because it's a 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1064	2689.09	2689.64	F	Professor	s^am	-1	0	there might be because it's a 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1066	2689.64	2691.13	F	Professor	s^ba^df	-1	0	there might be because it's a pretty big difference

Bmr023.C.dialogueact1069	2692.37	2695.95	C	PhD	s	-1	0	i'm wondering how we can how we can do like that i mean yeah

Bmr023.F.dialogueact1116	2781.02	2785.8	F	Professor	fg|s^cs	+1	2	discovered i i would actually double check with stuff on this point

Bmr023.F.dialogueact1118	2786.32	2787.9	F	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	he's probably the one here 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1119	2788.49	2792.55	F	Professor	s	-1	0	uhhuh he and then are the ones who are at this point most experienced with it and 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1120	2792.81	2793.67	D	PhD	b	-1	0	uhhuh it and 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1121	2794.18	2799.72	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and i mean there may be some little bits here and there that is not not being handled right 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1122	2801.17	2802.3	D	PhD	fg|s	+1	2	it's hard with features because you don't know what 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1123	2802.3	2804.28	D	PhD	s^df	+1	2	because you don't know what they should look like and you can't just 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1124	2804.5	2810.38	D	PhD	s^df^e.%-	+1	2	like and you can't just like but uh the values out and ask and you know look at them see there oh she had a lot of time 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1125	2810.17	2811.37	F	Professor	s^arp^j	+1	2	there oh she had a lot of time and and 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1126	2810.7	2810.94	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	there oh she had a lot of time 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1127	2811.37	2811.48	F	Professor	%-	-1	0	and and 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1128	2811.47	2817.44	G	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	and and also they're not and as i understand you you don't have a way to optimize features for the final word or right 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1129	2817.44	2817.71	G	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	or right 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1130	2818.11	2818.39	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	i mean these are just 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1131	2818.44	2820.33	G	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	i mean these are just dispirited but they're not 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1132	2820.33	2823.5	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	all my for phone discrimination but they're not up to my for the final right 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1133	2822.31	2824.21	C	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	all my for phone discrimination not for up to my for the final right so it there's always 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1135	2824.3	2824.82	C	PhD	s^e.%-	-1	0	not for so it there's always 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1134	2824.03	2835.05	G	PhD	s^bk|s.%-	-1	0	not for that's right well yeah that's yeah they they well you actually are but but it so it there's always this question of whether you might do better with those features if there was a way to train it for the word or metric that you're actually they actually 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1136	2825.05	2825.47	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	that's right this question of whether 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1137	2830.1	2830.84	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	well yeah that's for the 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1138	2831.71	2832.33	F	Professor	fg|%-	-1	0	yeah they they word or metric that you're actually 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1139	2833.89	2834.31	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	well you actually are they actually 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1140	2834.07	2835.22	F	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	well you actually are but but it they actually 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1141	2835.37	2837.29	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	but but it but in in directly well right 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1142	2837.42	2839.87	G	PhD	s^aa|s^df.%-	-1	0	so what what it and you may not well right it's in direct so you don't know 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1143	2838.26	2840.87	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so what what it and you may not be in this case come it's in direct so you don't know 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1144	2840.87	2841.59	F	Professor	s	-1	0	be in this case come to think of it because 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1145	2841.59	2845.42	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	to think of it because uh you just taking something was trained up elsewhere so what 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1146	2845.42	2852.99	F	Professor	s	-1	0	elsewhere so what what you what you do in the full procedure is too um i haven't better training 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1147	2853.77	2863.18	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so in fact you to the net is trained on uh they uh the turvy alignment of the training did did it comes from a referral system and so that's where the 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1148	2863.29	2867.86	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and so that's where the feedback comes around so that it is actually discriminate 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1149	2868.24	2870.21	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	you can prove that it's it's a 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1150	2870.98	2871.38	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	if 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1151	2872.01	2891.62	F	Professor	s	-1	0	you believe in the the turvy assumption that uh getting the best paths uh is almost equivalent to getting the best uh total probability you actually do improve that uh by training up on local local frames 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1152	2892.57	2894.85	F	Professor	s	-1	0	but um we aren't actually doing it here because 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1153	2895.0	2897.99	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	we did we did that for hybrid system an 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1154	2897.99	2899.87	F	Professor	s^df^e	-1	0	hybrid system an hour plugging it into another system so 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1155	2899.87	2903.01	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so another huge experiment another system so it isn't it would quite apply here 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1157	2902.98	2904.24	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	so another huge experiment we could do would be quite apply here 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1156	2902.89	2914.83	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	so another huge experiment we could do would be to take the tandem teachers uh do sri forced alignments using those features and then redo the net with those quite apply here yeah yeah exactly exactly so that you can optimize it further 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1158	2910.14	2910.74	F	Professor	b	-1	0	forced alignments 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1159	2911.49	2913.45	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	using those features and then redo the net yeah exactly exactly so that 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1160	2912.54	2912.79	F	Professor	b	-1	0	features and exactly 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1161	2913.82	2915.73	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	then redo the net with those yeah another thing is if you're not so that you can optimize it further word or yeah 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1163	2915.06	2915.41	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	another thing is if you're not word or yeah 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1162	2914.95	2921.56	F	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	with those yeah another thing is if you're not using the net for recognition per se but just for this transformation is probably bigger than it needs to be you can optimize it further word or yeah 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1164	2915.82	2916.07	G	PhD	b	-1	0	another thing is if you're not using the net word or yeah 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1165	2922.53	2923.95	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so that would save a lot of time 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1166	2924.29	2925.86	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and there's a mismatch in the phones 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1168	2928.06	2931.72	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	so using a a larger the largest sunset yeah actually all those 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1167	2927.68	2928.05	D	PhD	b	-1	0	so using a uhhuh 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1169	2931.11	2935.37	F	Professor	s^aa|s^am	-1	0	yeah actually all those things could could could could uh could it as well 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1170	2934.35	2935.5	D	PhD	b	-1	0	could it as well 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1171	2936.42	2941.3	F	Professor	s	+1	1	the other thing uh just mention this stuff and this was an innovation stephens which was pretty neat one uh 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1172	2941.97	2945.57	F	Professor	s	+1	1	one uh and my particularly play came here given all these things were mentioning 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1173	2946.18	2951.97	F	Professor	s	+1	1	um stephens idea was that um discriminate uh approaches are great 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1174	2952.6	2959.67	F	Professor	s	+1	1	even the local ones given you know there's ten charter loops which you can convince yourself turn into a global once 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1175	2960.61	2964.54	F	Professor	s	+1	1	um however there's times when it is not good 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1176	2965.2	2972.89	F	Professor	s^e	+1	1	uh when something about a test is is different enough from the training set that that uh the discrimination that you're learning is is is not a good one 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1177	2971.83	2972.19	C	PhD	b	-1	0	is is is not a good one 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1178	2973.85	2987.12	F	Professor	s	+1	1	oh really talked so uh his idea was to take as the input feature of actor too the uh cussing mixture system uh and eighteen cat nation uh listen on that uh poets and the regular features yeah 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1179	2987.46	2988.7	C	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	oh really talked about that yeah that 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1180	2988.04	2988.74	G	PhD	fg|%-	-1	0	about that that 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1181	2988.87	2989.16	F	Professor	b	-1	0	about that that did you did you 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1184	2989.45	2989.72	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	did you did you 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1182	2989.03	2989.65	D	PhD	b	-1	0	did you did you

Bmr023.C.dialogueact1185	2989.72	2990.13	C	PhD	b	-1	0	no did you did you do that already are 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1187	2990.96	2999.55	C	PhD	s^ar|s	-1	0	no but three three men when we when i first started corresponding with them about how to go about this i think that was one of the things that we definitely place there yeah i mean i'm sure that stuff was do that already are so that makes a lot of sense 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1186	2990.85	2990.98	G	PhD	qrr.%-	-1	0	no do that already are 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1188	2991.32	2993.15	G	PhD	s^bk|s^cs	-1	0	but three three men when we when i first started corresponding so that makes a lot of sense 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1189	2993.3	2993.44	G	PhD	b	-1	0	i first started corresponding 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1190	2996.58	2996.86	F	Professor	b	-1	0	i think 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1191	2998.74	3001.17	F	Professor	fg|s^bd	-1	0	we definitely place there yeah i mean i'm sure that stuff was the first to think of it but actually stuff and did 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1192	3000.66	3001.06	C	PhD	b	-1	0	the first to think of it but actually stuff and did 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1193	3001.17	3002.28	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	uh and it but actually stuff and did it and 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1195	3002.56	3003.56	C	PhD	s^bk|qy^rt	-1	0	uh and it doesn't help it and and and help 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1194	3002.44	3004.43	F	Professor	s	-1	0	uh and it doesn't help it and and and help a lot yeah so 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1197	3004.63	3005.47	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	a lot yeah so that's that's that's our current

Bmr023.F.dialogueact1198	3004.9	3009.95	F	Professor	s	-1	0	a lot yeah so that's that's that's our current best the system and they uh um there are saying yeah that makes sense 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1199	3007.82	3008.44	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and they uh um yeah that makes 
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1200	3008.7	3009.75	G	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	um there are saying yeah that makes sense 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1202	3010.45	3013.97	C	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	and you do okay let's see time from the country on the combined future victor yeah i is you should ever do worse

Bmr023.C.dialogueact1205	3015.17	3018.79	C	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	do you do you do okay let's see from on the combined features actor 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1206	3018.57	3018.84	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	actor 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1207	3019.18	3019.55	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1208	3020.45	3022.45	F	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	well actually i i usually check with him because he tried 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1209	3022.45	3024.38	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because you end up with this huge with him because he tried several different combinations 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1210	3024.06	3029.86	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because you end up with this huge feature actors so that might be a problem on this you do some from them and uh yeah i 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1211	3028.97	3029.88	F	Professor	s^bk|%-	-1	0	from them and uh yeah i 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1212	3030.09	3031.86	F	Professor	s^no	-1	0	well i don't remembers which came out that so he 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1213	3031.86	3035.53	F	Professor	s	-1	0	which came out that so he did one where you put on put the whole thing into one k. l. t. another 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1214	3035.9	3044.71	F	Professor	s	-1	0	l. t. another one since the the p. things are are ready or talking lies you left him alone and and just to to kill t. on the on the on the net outputs and i think 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1215	3039.7	3040.04	C	PhD	b	-1	0	you left him alone 
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1217	3044.73	3045.14	C	PhD	b	-1	0	the net outputs and i think that 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1216	3044.71	3045.76	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	the net outputs and i think that 
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1218	3046.12	3047.26	F	Professor	s^no	-1	0	and i don't remember which was better 
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1219	3048.41	3049.74	D	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	did he did he tried to
