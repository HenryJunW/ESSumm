Bed002.A.dialogueact2	10.383	13.723	A	Grad	s^cs^rt	-1	0	so just make sure that your wireless mike is on if you're wearing a wireless check one check 
Bed002.E.dialogueact3	12.822	13.472	E	Grad	s	-1	0	on if you're wearing a wireless check one check 
Bed002.E.dialogueact4	13.822	14.542	E	Grad	s	-1	0	a wireless one check one 
Bed002.A.dialogueact5	18.289	22.839	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and you should be able to see which one which one you're wrong by uh watching a little far as change 
Bed002.B.dialogueact6	23.925	24.855	B	Grad	qw	-1	0	so which is my bio 
Bed002.B.dialogueact7	24.855	25.185	B	Grad	%--	-1	0	which is my bio number one 
Bed002.B.dialogueact8	25.421	27.211	B	Grad	s	-1	0	number one so 
Bed002.A.dialogueact9	26.417	26.557	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed002.E.dialogueact10	27.711	27.941	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so 
Bed002.E.dialogueact11	27.941	29.261	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so what 
Bed002.A.dialogueact12	31.379	35.529	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so actually if you guys want to go ahead and read digits now as long as you sign a consent form that's all right three 
Bed002.E.dialogueact13	35.493	37.013	E	Grad	qy	-1	0	all right no three digits at the same time out 
Bed002.A.dialogueact14	37.281	37.461	A	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	no out 
Bed002.A.dialogueact16	38.242	38.452	A	Grad	s^ar^r	-1	0	no each individually 
Bed002.E.dialogueact15	37.84	38.18	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	no no each individually out 
Bed002.A.dialogueact17	38.552	39.332	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	no each individually were talking 
Bed002.A.dialogueact18	39.612	41.292	A	Grad	s	-1	0	were talking about doing all at the same time i think cognitive 
Bed002.A.dialogueact19	41.292	46.928	A	Grad	s	-1	0	time i think cognitive lee that would be really difficult to try to read the mall everyone else's grounded need extreme 
Bed002.E.dialogueact20	46.327	47.957	E	Grad	s^na	-1	0	everyone else's grounded need extreme focus 
Bed002.A.dialogueact21	48.2	53.13	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so when you're reading the digit strings the first thing to do is just say which transcript drawn the way we we may wined up 
Bed002.C.dialogueact22	50.26	50.75	C	Professor	s^t3	-1	0	the first thing to do is the way 
Bed002.C.dialogueact23	52.894	56.664	C	Professor	s	-1	0	transcript drawn we we may wined up with for we need versions of all this garbage 
Bed002.B.dialogueact24	57.194	58.074	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	um for our stuff uh 
Bed002.B.dialogueact26	58.074	58.204	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	um uh 
Bed002.C.dialogueact25	58.07	58.26	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	um uh 
Bed002.A.dialogueact27	58.903	62.003	A	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	um so the first thing you'd want to do is just say which transcript you're on so you can see the uh 
Bed002.C.dialogueact28	59.76	59.86	C	Professor	b	-1	0	so the first thing 
Bed002.A.dialogueact29	62.003	62.353	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	so you can see the 
Bed002.A.dialogueact30	62.653	63.593	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so you can see the transcript there's 
Bed002.A.dialogueact31	63.713	66.443	A	Grad	s	-1	0	transcript there's too large number strings on the digits 
Bed002.A.dialogueact32	66.443	68.423	A	Grad	s	-1	0	the digits do we just read that one and then you 
Bed002.A.dialogueact33	68.423	71.973	A	Grad	s	-1	0	one and then you read each line with a small pause between lines 
Bed002.A.dialogueact34	72.444	76.584	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and the pauses just about the person transcribing i can tell where one line ends and the other begins and i'll get all 
Bed002.A.dialogueact35	76.584	79.404	A	Grad	s	-1	0	begins and i'll get all read did you transfer so you can see how that goes 
Bed002.A.dialogueact36	81.2	81.62	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed002.A.dialogueact37	88.19	91.91	A	Grad	s	-1	0	again i'm not sure how much i should talk about stuff before everyone here 
Bed002.C.dialogueact38	93.44	93.71	C	Professor	b.%	-1	0	we we 
Bed002.C.dialogueact39	93.71	95.02	C	Professor	s	-1	0	well we we have one more coming 
Bed002.A.dialogueact40	95.206	95.406	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	well 
Bed002.A.dialogueact41	96.029	97.489	A	Grad	qh^cs	-1	0	and i go ahead and read digit strings can go going 
Bed002.A.dialogueact42	97.489	98.449	A	Grad	s^cs^e	-1	0	strings can go going from there 
Bed002.C.dialogueact43	141.465	141.735	C	Professor	z	-1	0	okay well 
Bed002.C.dialogueact44	141.735	143.085	C	Professor	z	-1	0	okay well we can start doing it 
Bed002.A.dialogueact45	326.454	326.674	A	Grad	s^ft	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed002.A.dialogueact46	327.422	329.512	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so uh just also note on wearing the microphone all you look like 
Bed002.A.dialogueact47	329.512	331.692	A	Grad	s	-1	0	microphone all you look like you're doing it reasonably correctly but you want 
Bed002.A.dialogueact48	331.692	334.382	A	Grad	s	-1	0	correctly but you want to about two son wits away from your mouse and then 
Bed002.A.dialogueact49	334.802	335.902	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	mouse and then at the corner 
Bed002.A.dialogueact50	336.403	338.343	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	and that so that you minimize press sounds so 
Bed002.A.dialogueact51	339.019	341.049	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	when you're breeding you don't read into the mike 
Bed002.A.dialogueact52	341.637	341.967	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed002.A.dialogueact53	343.292	343.992	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed002.A.dialogueact54	344.634	345.294	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	and uh 
Bed002.A.dialogueact55	346.941	351.238	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so everyone needs to fill out only once the speaker form and the consent form and 
Bed002.A.dialogueact56	351.957	353.137	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and the short form then you should 
Bed002.A.dialogueact57	353.647	355.007	A	Grad	s	-1	0	then you should read the consent form but uh the thing to notice 
Bed002.A.dialogueact58	355.007	360.179	A	Grad	s	-1	0	uh the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit all the transcripts so if you say 
Bed002.A.dialogueact59	360.584	373.834	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public which these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them uh you'll be given an opportunity by e. mail uh to bleep out any portions you don't like 
Bed002.A.dialogueact60	374.534	374.954	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed002.A.dialogueact61	375.934	378.934	A	Grad	s	-1	0	on the speaker form just allies much of the information you can't 
Bed002.A.dialogueact62	379.224	381.034	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	if you're not exactly sure about the region we're not exactly 
Bed002.A.dialogueact63	381.424	382.884	A	Grad	s^bd^df	-1	0	we're not exactly sure either so 
Bed002.A.dialogueact64	382.884	384.404	A	Grad	s	-1	0	sure either so don't worry too much about it it's just self 
Bed002.A.dialogueact65	384.464	385.594	A	Grad	s	-1	0	about it it's just self rating 
Bed002.A.dialogueact66	386.41	386.83	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed002.A.dialogueact67	388.883	389.813	A	Grad	s	-1	0	i think that's about it 
Bed002.A.dialogueact68	390.889	394.329	A	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	should i do you want me to talk at all about why we're doing this in with this project is there um you know 
Bed002.C.dialogueact69	393.731	395.141	C	Professor	h|s^aa	-1	0	this in with this project is there um you know no there was there was 
Bed002.A.dialogueact70	394.329	394.509	A	Grad	qrr.%--	-1	0	is there you know 
Bed002.C.dialogueact71	395.141	396.541	C	Professor	s^ar|s	-1	0	no there was there was let's see out so that's 
Bed002.C.dialogueact73	396.811	397.071	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	let's see out so that's another meeting here 
Bed002.E.dialogueact72	396.68	397.97	E	Grad	qy	-1	0	let's see out so that's another meeting here 
Bed002.B.dialogueact75	398.77	399.43	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	i i there's she got a neighbor and she 
Bed002.C.dialogueact74	398.723	401.363	C	Professor	s^na	-1	0	i i there's no she got a neighbor and she was notified whether she oh yeah yeah yeah 
Bed002.E.dialogueact76	400.321	400.931	E	Grad	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	no was notified oh yeah yeah 
Bed002.E.dialogueact77	400.931	401.681	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	no was notified whether she oh yeah yeah yeah 
Bed002.C.dialogueact78	401.673	404.343	C	Professor	s	-1	0	whether she knows so the question um yeah 
Bed002.C.dialogueact79	404.743	405.653	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed002.C.dialogueact80	407.102	409.492	C	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	so are the people going to be identified by name 
Bed002.A.dialogueact81	410.177	413.267	A	Grad	s	-1	0	well what we're going to we'll end on them eyes it in the transcript um right 
Bed002.A.dialogueact83	413.925	414.995	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	um but not in the right 
Bed002.C.dialogueact82	413.442	413.822	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	um right 
Bed002.A.dialogueact86	415.981	416.521	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	okay so the other okay so then in terms of people worrying 
Bed002.C.dialogueact84	415.601	415.911	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay so okay so 
Bed002.C.dialogueact85	415.911	422.151	C	Professor	s	-1	0	okay so the other okay so then in terms of people worrying about uh exercising things from the transcript it's unlikely since 
Bed002.C.dialogueact87	422.811	424.531	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	since it just isn't that beaded 
Bed002.C.dialogueact88	425.387	425.767	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	oh i see the deal 
Bed002.C.dialogueact89	425.767	427.487	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	right so if i said oh oh i see the deal but the but the way i 
Bed002.A.dialogueact90	426.978	431.858	A	Grad	s^aa|s:qw	-1	0	right so if i said oh hi gerry how're you we're not going to go through and cancel out the jerry but the but the way i yeah sure 
Bed002.C.dialogueact91	428.714	429.124	C	Professor	b	-1	0	hi gerry how're you we're not going to go yeah 
Bed002.C.dialogueact92	431.627	431.957	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	out the jerry sure 
Bed002.A.dialogueact93	432.669	438.599	A	Grad	s	-1	0	um so we will go through and in the speaker id tags they'll be you know and one of the seven and one away 
Bed002.C.dialogueact94	437.368	437.788	C	Professor	b	-1	0	and one of the seven and 
Bed002.A.dialogueact96	439.088	440.168	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	um but uh 
Bed002.C.dialogueact95	438.847	439.057	C	Professor	b	-1	0	one away um but uh 
Bed002.A.dialogueact97	441.443	442.953	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	uh i 
Bed002.A.dialogueact98	442.953	448.573	A	Grad	s^no	-1	0	uh i don't know a good way of doing it on audio and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data okay 
Bed002.C.dialogueact99	444.462	444.672	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	it on audio okay 
Bed002.C.dialogueact100	448.649	448.949	C	Professor	b	-1	0	the data 
Bed002.C.dialogueact101	449.059	450.059	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	yep no i i wouldn't complain nice one and then the second 
Bed002.A.dialogueact103	450.244	450.444	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yep one and then the second 
Bed002.C.dialogueact102	450.059	450.989	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	yep one and then the second 
Bed002.A.dialogueact104	451.276	451.486	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bed002.C.dialogueact105	451.816	452.156	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	well we can make okay 
Bed002.B.dialogueact106	452.371	454.691	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	well we can make up at the s. for each of us 
Bed002.A.dialogueact107	455.308	456.838	A	Grad	fg|s^na	-1	0	yeah i mean whatever you want to do is fine but we 
Bed002.C.dialogueact108	455.693	456.043	C	Professor	b.%	-1	0	yeah i mean whatever you want to do is fine but we 
Bed002.F.dialogueact109	455.922	456.092	F	Grad	b.%	-1	0	yeah i mean whatever you want to do is fine but we 
Bed002.A.dialogueact110	456.838	457.588	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	want to do is fine but we find that we want the 
Bed002.A.dialogueact111	457.588	459.608	A	Grad	s	-1	0	find that we want the needing to be as natural as possible 
Bed002.A.dialogueact113	460.057	461.637	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	that we're trying to do real meetings 
Bed002.C.dialogueact112	459.805	460.145	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	possible that we're trying to do real 
Bed002.A.dialogueact114	462.046	463.676	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and so we don't want to have to do alias is and we don't want 
Bed002.C.dialogueact115	462.049	462.389	C	Professor	b	-1	0	and so we don't want to have to do 
Bed002.A.dialogueact116	463.676	466.156	A	Grad	s	-1	0	alias is and we don't want people to be editing what they say so i think that 
Bed002.B.dialogueact117	464.985	465.275	B	Grad	b	-1	0	people to be editing what they say 
Bed002.A.dialogueact119	466.651	471.841	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so i think that it's better just to to propose process to edit out every time you bash microsoft 
Bed002.C.dialogueact118	466.223	466.453	C	Professor	b	-1	0	so i think that 
Bed002.B.dialogueact120	471.178	471.728	B	Grad	b	-1	0	microsoft 
Bed002.A.dialogueact121	472.001	472.191	A	Grad	s^f	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed002.C.dialogueact122	472.42	472.65	C	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed002.C.dialogueact123	474.028	476.268	C	Professor	fg|qh^cs^tc.%--	-1	0	they took um okay so why don't you tell us briefly your give 
Bed002.A.dialogueact125	476.73	476.98	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	they took your give 
Bed002.A.dialogueact126	476.98	477.52	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	they took your give give give your normal speil 
Bed002.C.dialogueact124	476.648	478.508	C	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	they took um your give give give your normal speil 
Bed002.A.dialogueact127	478.763	481.253	A	Grad	s	-1	0	um so is is the project is called meeting recorder and they're lots of different aspects 
Bed002.A.dialogueact128	481.253	483.193	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and they're lots of different aspects of the project um so 
Bed002.A.dialogueact129	483.373	487.163	A	Grad	s	-1	0	um so my particular interest is in the p. d. a. of the future this is a mock 
Bed002.A.dialogueact130	487.473	488.503	A	Grad	s	-1	0	this is a mock up of one yes we do believe 
Bed002.A.dialogueact131	488.503	491.103	A	Grad	s	-1	0	up of one yes we do believe that tedious future would be made of wood 
Bed002.A.dialogueact132	491.912	496.526	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	the idea is that you'd be able to put a p. d. a. at the table at any impromptu meeting and 
Bed002.A.dialogueact133	496.916	497.716	A	Grad	s	-1	0	meeting and record it and then be 
Bed002.A.dialogueact134	497.716	500.426	A	Grad	s	-1	0	record it and then be able to do creating retrieval later on on the meeting that's my 
Bed002.A.dialogueact135	500.646	502.106	A	Grad	s	-1	0	the meeting that's my particular interest is a portable device 
Bed002.A.dialogueact136	502.106	505.436	A	Grad	s	-1	0	is a portable device to do uh information retrieval one meetings other people 
Bed002.A.dialogueact137	505.786	508.496	A	Grad	s	-1	0	meetings other people are interested in other aspects of meetings um 
Bed002.A.dialogueact138	508.966	512.306	A	Grad	s	-1	0	um so the first step in that in any of these is to collect some data and 
Bed002.A.dialogueact139	512.926	517.706	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and so what we wanted is a room it's instrumented with both the tabletop microphones and these are 
Bed002.A.dialogueact140	517.706	520.196	A	Grad	s	-1	0	microphones and these are very high quality pressures on mike's as well as the 
Bed002.A.dialogueact141	520.566	522.066	A	Grad	s	-1	0	as well as the close talking mike's with a close 
Bed002.A.dialogueact142	522.624	525.694	A	Grad	s	-1	0	with a close talking talking like this is is some ground truth 
Bed002.A.dialogueact143	526.174	528.074	A	Grad	s	-1	0	gives us on high quality audio i'm especially for 
Bed002.A.dialogueact144	528.404	532.484	A	Grad	s	-1	0	i'm especially for people who are interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus refer people 
Bed002.A.dialogueact145	532.484	538.304	A	Grad	s	-1	0	corpus refer people were more interested in language we want to penalize them by having only thus far afield mike's available and then 
Bed002.A.dialogueact146	538.892	542.772	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and then also um it's a very very hard task in terms of speech recognition 
Bed002.A.dialogueact147	543.321	548.131	A	Grad	s	-1	0	um and so uh on the far field mice we can expect very low recognition results so he wanted to near 
Bed002.A.dialogueact148	548.46	552.2	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so he wanted to near field mice to at least isolate the difference between the two so that's why 
Bed002.A.dialogueact149	552.37	556.68	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	so that's why we're recording in parallel with the close talking in the far feel the same time 
Bed002.A.dialogueact150	557.3	560.97	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and then all these channels are recorded simultaneously in frame synchronized 
Bed002.A.dialogueact151	560.97	565.49	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	in frame synchronized silly so you can also do things like um being forming on all the microphones and do research 
Bed002.A.dialogueact152	565.49	566.62	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and do research like that 
Bed002.A.dialogueact153	567.252	573.282	A	Grad	s	-1	0	our intention is to release this state that to the public um probably through through body like the l. d. c. and 
Bed002.A.dialogueact154	573.752	576.622	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and uh just make it as a generally available corpus 
Bed002.A.dialogueact155	577.422	580.698	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um there's other work going on in meeting recording so we're 
Bed002.A.dialogueact156	580.698	582.368	A	Grad	s	-1	0	recording so we're we're working with sri with you w. 
Bed002.A.dialogueact157	582.638	583.478	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	with you w. um 
Bed002.A.dialogueact158	583.827	586.627	A	Grad	h|s^e	-1	0	um yes just started an effort which will include video we're not 
Bed002.A.dialogueact159	586.727	588.287	A	Grad	s	-1	0	video we're not including video obviously 
Bed002.A.dialogueact160	589.266	592.816	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and uh and then also i'm a small amount of assistance from idea

Bed002.A.dialogueact162	595.9	600.14	A	Grad	s	-1	0	um oh than the digit strings this is just a more constrained task um 
Bed002.A.dialogueact163	600.49	608.83	A	Grad	s	-1	0	um the because the general environment is so challenging we decide to to do at least one set of digits strings 
Bed002.A.dialogueact164	609.19	610.37	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	to give ourselves something easier and it's exactly the 
Bed002.A.dialogueact165	610.37	613.81	A	Grad	s	-1	0	easier and it's exactly the same digit strings is t. i. digits which is 
Bed002.A.dialogueact166	613.81	616.338	A	Grad	s	-1	0	i. digits which is uh common connected digits corpus so will have some 
Bed002.A.dialogueact167	616.338	618.858	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so will have some um comparison to be able to 
Bed002.C.dialogueact168	620.85	621.11	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	you know okay 
Bed002.A.dialogueact169	621.506	622.046	A	Grad	qo^rt^t^tc	-1	0	you know okay

Bed002.A.dialogueact171	623.04	626.16	A	Grad	s^bk|s^co	-1	0	so it'll last person comes and just have them where a wireless it should be on already 
Bed002.A.dialogueact172	626.16	627.21	A	Grad	s	-1	0	it should be on already um 
Bed002.A.dialogueact173	627.737	628.177	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	um either one of those

Bed002.A.dialogueact175	629.277	632.547	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and uh read digit strings and and fill out the forms so the most 
Bed002.A.dialogueact176	632.697	634.547	A	Grad	s	-1	0	the forms so the most important forms the consent forms of speech

Bed002.C.dialogueact202	685.92	692.787	C	Professor	s	+1	1	oh this was about um answering attention from teachers in context and the word like now 
Bed002.C.dialogueact203	692.997	696.317	C	Professor	s^e.%-	+1	1	well i i i i i and the word like go to see or visit or something

Bed002.C.dialogueact205	697.179	697.589	C	Professor	qy^bu^d	-1	0	yeah 
Bed002.E.dialogueact206	698.281	698.961	E	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	i think it 
Bed002.C.dialogueact207	700.121	701.601	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i guess except the better filters because i sent 
Bed002.C.dialogueact208	701.601	702.641	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	filters because i sent it to everybody 
Bed002.C.dialogueact209	703.181	704.031	C	Professor	s	-1	0	just blew it off okay 
Bed002.E.dialogueact210	703.229	703.449	E	Grad	b	-1	0	just blew it off 
Bed002.C.dialogueact211	704.031	704.381	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bed002.B.dialogueact212	706.02	706.74	B	Grad	s	-1	0	really simple that so this 
Bed002.B.dialogueact213	706.74	707.82	B	Grad	s	-1	0	really simple that so this is the idea

Bed002.B.dialogueact215	710.79	723.941	B	Grad	s	-1	0	we could pursue if we thought it's it's worth it but uh i think we we really agree on that to come up with a with a sort of very very first crew prototype 
Bed002.B.dialogueact216	724.251	727.421	B	Grad	s	-1	0	do some implementation work and do some some research and some money thing so 
Bed002.B.dialogueact217	728.001	731.0	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	the idea is if you want to go somewhere 
Bed002.B.dialogueact218	732.358	733.818	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	um and 
Bed002.B.dialogueact219	734.43	737.49	B	Grad	s^co.%--	-1	0	focus on that of ticks down oh i can 
Bed002.B.dialogueact220	737.62	738.8	B	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	oh i can actually walk for this stuff 
Bed002.B.dialogueact221	738.8	739.22	B	Grad	s^ba^t1	-1	0	actually walk for this stuff down here 
Bed002.B.dialogueact222	739.721	740.101	B	Grad	s^co	-1	0	down here that's the powder 
Bed002.B.dialogueact223	740.72	741.62	B	Grad	s	-1	0	that's the powder teller 
Bed002.B.dialogueact224	742.81	751.79	B	Grad	s	-1	0	no um we found or uh they didn't some experiments that there's three things you can do 
Bed002.B.dialogueact225	753.77	759.1	B	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um you can walk this way income really really close to it in touch 
Bed002.B.dialogueact226	759.67	760.27	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	in touch it 
Bed002.B.dialogueact227	761.722	763.892	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but you cannot enter or do anything outside and 
Bed002.B.dialogueact228	763.892	767.282	B	Grad	s	-1	0	do anything outside and it's interesting rock climbing it would three you know quit standing there's just a dark 
Bed002.B.dialogueact229	767.282	768.442	B	Grad	s	-1	0	there's just a dark and they you can touch

Bed002.B.dialogueact231	770.112	774.632	B	Grad	s	-1	0	if you want to actually go hop or into the tower you have to go this way and then 
Bed002.B.dialogueact232	774.752	777.062	B	Grad	s	-1	0	way and then through some building some stairs and so forth if you 
Bed002.B.dialogueact233	777.862	789.846	B	Grad	s	-1	0	if you actually want to see the power and that's what actually most people want to do is just have a good look of it take a picture for the comedy you have to go this way and go up here 
Bed002.B.dialogueact234	790.416	794.916	B	Grad	s	-1	0	you have them really view it exploded they bring the thirty years war 
Bed002.B.dialogueact235	795.266	796.476	B	Grad	s	-1	0	really interesting side 
Bed002.B.dialogueact237	797.456	802.466	B	Grad	fh|s^rt	-1	0	and then these uh these signs are and pass us that's 
Bed002.E.dialogueact236	797.115	797.355	E	Grad	b	-1	0	and then 
Bed002.B.dialogueact238	802.466	803.736	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	us that's the street

Bed002.B.dialogueact240	807.066	810.48	B	Grad	s	-1	0	you could tell that the do they let the cut out this part because

Bed002.B.dialogueact242	815.49	818.55	B	Grad	s	+1	1	it would always use the closest points to the object and then 
Bed002.B.dialogueact243	818.55	821.4	B	Grad	s	-1	0	the object and then mentors would be face in front of a wall but 
Bed002.B.dialogueact244	821.86	823.43	B	Grad	s	-1	0	wall but what do the massive do no good 
Bed002.B.dialogueact245	824.32	830.38	B	Grad	s	+1	2	what we find interesting first of all intentions differ 
Bed002.B.dialogueact246	831.525	833.985	B	Grad	s	+1	2	maybe you want to enter the building 
Bed002.B.dialogueact247	834.955	836.235	B	Grad	s	+1	2	maybe you want to see it take a picture 
Bed002.B.dialogueact248	836.465	837.325	B	Grad	s	+1	0	it take a picture of it 
Bed002.B.dialogueact249	838.243	841.883	B	Grad	s	+1	2	or maybe you actually want to come ask if it's possible to the bidding 
Bed002.B.dialogueact250	842.223	843.913	B	Grad	s	-1	0	for whatever reason that's maybe what's it what's it made 
Bed002.E.dialogueact251	843.351	844.381	E	Grad	qw	-1	0	that's maybe what's it what's it made out of 
Bed002.B.dialogueact252	845.69	847.43	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	um or red limestone 
Bed002.E.dialogueact253	850.179	851.309	E	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah so maybe you would want to touch it 
Bed002.B.dialogueact254	851.93	854.05	B	Grad	s^aa|s^m^na	-1	0	yeah maybe we'll touch it 
Bed002.B.dialogueact255	854.05	854.34	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed002.B.dialogueact256	855.86	862.61	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	okay i this this um these intentions we we could if you want to call it the the vista mode 
Bed002.B.dialogueact257	863.49	865.92	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	it just went to get the only you are look at it 
Bed002.B.dialogueact258	866.68	867.42	B	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah and remote and 
Bed002.B.dialogueact259	868.06	869.95	B	Grad	s	-1	0	uh what tangled mort i 
Bed002.B.dialogueact260	869.95	871.76	B	Grad	s	-1	0	tangled mort i was come up with city names so 
Bed002.B.dialogueact261	872.04	874.8	B	Grad	s	-1	0	this i means literally trusted it to touch 
Bed002.B.dialogueact262	875.78	883.8	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so but sometimes the the tangle more just really relevant in in the sense that if you want to uh 
Bed002.B.dialogueact263	886.1	895.612	B	Grad	s.%--	+1	2	if you don't have the attention of entering a building but you know that something is really close to it you just want to approach it's okay it's too that uh things consider 
Bed002.B.dialogueact264	895.992	900.352	B	Grad	s	-1	0	uh things consider for example the post office in chicago building so much that it has its own zip code 
Bed002.B.dialogueact265	901.122	905.222	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so the entrance could be my as way from the closest point so 
Bed002.B.dialogueact266	906.022	909.543	B	Grad	s	-1	0	sometimes it make sense maybe to to distinguish there 
Bed002.B.dialogueact267	910.503	915.84	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so um i flipped through twenty some 
Bed002.B.dialogueact268	915.84	917.85	B	Grad	s^bd^df	-1	0	twenty some i didn't look through all the data 
Bed002.B.dialogueact269	918.38	928.53	B	Grad	s	-1	0	um and there there's uh and nots more different ways in people's the ways people phrase out to gets if they want to get to set the pace 
Bed002.B.dialogueact270	929.21	933.26	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and sometimes here it's it's a little bit more all s. 
Bed002.B.dialogueact271	934.07	938.109	B	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	maybe i should go back a couple steps and so no okay it saddam's 
Bed002.B.dialogueact272	938.109	939.099	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	and so no okay it saddam's grab yourself a microphone

Bed002.C.dialogueact274	939.344	940.844	C	Professor	s^co	-1	0	grab yourself a microphone 
Bed002.B.dialogueact275	943.39	945.67	B	Grad	s	-1	0	you need to sign some stuff and @reject@ well you can sign afterwards 
Bed002.C.dialogueact276	944.684	946.294	C	Professor	s	-1	0	some stuff and @reject@ well you can sign afterwards yes 
Bed002.B.dialogueact277	946.373	946.833	B	Grad	s	-1	0	yes 
Bed002.E.dialogueact278	946.868	948.578	E	Grad	s	-1	0	afterwards okay yes uh stuff to read some digits 
Bed002.C.dialogueact279	948.89	949.44	C	Professor	s	-1	0	afterwards okay digits

Bed002.B.dialogueact292	973.85	974.15	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	okay i'm thirty and i thought they said 
Bed002.E.dialogueact291	973.663	974.863	E	Grad	s^ar|s^nd	-1	0	okay i'm thirty and i thought they said 
Bed002.C.dialogueact293	974.365	974.775	C	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	okay and i thought they said 
Bed002.C.dialogueact294	974.775	975.345	C	Professor	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	okay uhhuh and i thought they said 
Bed002.D.dialogueact296	975.269	975.839	D	Grad	s^bk|s^na	-1	0	uhhuh 
Bed002.E.dialogueact295	975.263	975.433	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	uhhuh 
Bed002.B.dialogueact297	976.923	978.163	B	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	okay that was a good year and people 
Bed002.B.dialogueact298	978.543	983.253	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and people when they when they wanted goto the building sometimes they just want to look at it sometimes 
Bed002.B.dialogueact299	983.82	985.0	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	it sometimes they want to enter it sometimes they want to get 
Bed002.B.dialogueact300	985.17	986.89	B	Grad	s	-1	0	sometimes they want to get really close to it 
Bed002.B.dialogueact301	988.54	989.58	B	Grad	s	-1	0	that's something we found just 
Bed002.B.dialogueact302	989.9	990.72	B	Grad	s	-1	0	we found just isn't 
Bed002.B.dialogueact303	991.15	997.24	B	Grad	s	+1	0	and the pace this way you would eat them put these intentions i sometimes expand it couldn't be different i gave an example 
Bed002.B.dialogueact304	997.24	1002.67	B	Grad	s	-1	0	i gave an example where the point where you end up if you want to look at it competed different from you want to interest 
Bed002.B.dialogueact305	1003.31	1011.14	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	so this is sort of fall people may it may phrase those requests to a uh a markup system it just the way they did it and 
Bed002.B.dialogueact306	1011.97	1016.02	B	Grad	s:qw	+1	0	and we get tons of of these do i get to i want to go to but also give 
Bed002.B.dialogueact307	1016.02	1019.29	B	Grad	s:s	-1	0	but also give me directions to and i would like to see 
Bed002.B.dialogueact308	1020.03	1026.5	B	Grad	fh|s.%--	-1	0	and um much we can sort of do if we we're closer because at that but they said it was the wrong 
Bed002.B.dialogueact309	1026.5	1027.32	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but they said it was the wrong one 
Bed002.B.dialogueact310	1028.61	1032.34	B	Grad	s	+1	1	um we can look at some factors that may make a difference first of all 
Bed002.B.dialogueact311	1032.48	1032.99	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	first of all 
Bed002.B.dialogueact312	1033.58	1034.81	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	very important and 
Bed002.B.dialogueact313	1034.85	1037.6	B	Grad	s	-1	0	important and um that i've completely forgot that's when we talked this 
Bed002.B.dialogueact314	1037.88	1040.58	B	Grad	s:qw	+1	1	we talked this is of course a crucial factor what type of object is this 
Bed002.B.dialogueact315	1041.69	1044.91	B	Grad	s	-1	0	some of the things you just don't want to take pictures off 
Bed002.B.dialogueact316	1045.81	1046.66	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	or very rarely 
Bed002.B.dialogueact317	1047.27	1048.85	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but you usually want to answer them 
Bed002.B.dialogueact318	1050.11	1052.43	B	Grad	s	-1	0	some updates i'm more dress 
Bed002.B.dialogueact319	1053.08	1055.14	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	more more highly full class and of course 
Bed002.B.dialogueact320	1055.64	1061.81	B	Grad	s	+1	1	and of course the the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person ones 
Bed002.B.dialogueact321	1062.53	1071.48	B	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	sometimes i found in there looking at the data in a superficial way of fun some sort of modify or is that that may also give us into and 
Bed002.B.dialogueact322	1071.48	1073.41	B	Grad	fh|s:s	-1	0	into and i'm trying to get to 
Bed002.B.dialogueact323	1074.1	1074.17	B	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	i need to get to 
Bed002.B.dialogueact324	1074.17	1075.27	B	Grad	s:s	-1	0	i need to get to sort of 
Bed002.B.dialogueact325	1075.44	1081.79	B	Grad	s	-1	0	sort of and so the fact that you're not really sightseeing and and just for their for pleasure and so forth and so forth 
Bed002.B.dialogueact326	1082.3	1086.9	B	Grad	s	+1	1	and this the stretching the context which onto this could be considered 
Bed002.B.dialogueact327	1087.13	1093.23	B	Grad	s	-1	0	that whatever it is you're doing at the moment may also enter conspiracy interpretation off off the face so 
Bed002.B.dialogueact328	1093.91	1095.75	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so this is really uh 
Bed002.B.dialogueact329	1095.75	1096.73	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	really uh it 
Bed002.B.dialogueact330	1097.22	1098.82	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	my suggestion is pretty simple 
Bed002.B.dialogueact331	1099.62	1101.61	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	we start with um 
Bed002.B.dialogueact332	1102.35	1104.7	B	Grad	s	-1	0	no let me say one more thing 
Bed002.B.dialogueact333	1105.2	1111.11	B	Grad	s	+1	1	what we do know is that the parts that are used in this market system but never differentiate between any of these so basically 
Bed002.B.dialogueact334	1111.54	1117.18	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so basically all of these things will result in the same x. amount and three have structure sort 
Bed002.B.dialogueact335	1118.06	1119.74	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	of action goal and 
Bed002.B.dialogueact336	1119.95	1121.04	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	goal and then an object and the source 
Bed002.D.dialogueact337	1120.63	1121.19	D	Grad	b.%	-1	0	then an object and the source 
Bed002.B.dialogueact338	1121.48	1121.59	B	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	and the source 
Bed002.B.dialogueact339	1121.59	1122.51	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and the source so 
Bed002.B.dialogueact340	1123.06	1128.46	B	Grad	s	+1	1	it's it's it's way too crude too after those differences in intentions 
Bed002.B.dialogueact341	1129.2	1130.25	B	Grad	s^rt:s^fe	-1	0	so i thought mm maybe four deep 
Bed002.B.dialogueact342	1130.25	1135.45	B	Grad	s	+1	2	maybe four deep understanding test that's a nice sort of playgrounds or first to the thing we 
Bed002.B.dialogueact343	1135.9	1137.93	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	the thing we can start at the and sort of look okay 
Bed002.B.dialogueact344	1137.99	1141.16	B	Grad	s	+1	0	sort of look okay we need we going to get those and three we have structures the crude 
Bed002.B.dialogueact345	1141.53	1143.71	B	Grad	s	-1	0	the crude i'm differentiated parse 
Bed002.B.dialogueact346	1144.35	1145.55	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	interpret its input 
Bed002.B.dialogueact347	1146.72	1155.29	B	Grad	s	-1	0	we may need additional part of speech or maybe just some information on the bird and mulder fires hoaxes aries well see 
Bed002.B.dialogueact348	1155.86	1156.3	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	well see and 
Bed002.B.dialogueact349	1157.03	1161.24	B	Grad	s^cc^rt	+1	1	i would try to to sort of come up with a list of factors that we needs to get out of there and 
Bed002.B.dialogueact350	1161.87	1165.62	B	Grad	s	+1	0	there and maybe we want to get a switch for the context so 
Bed002.B.dialogueact351	1165.96	1170.36	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so this is not something we we can actually money for but 
Bed002.B.dialogueact352	1170.97	1172.46	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but just is something we can set 
Bed002.B.dialogueact353	1173.79	1180.88	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and then you can all imagine sort of a constraint satisfaction program depending on on what um comes out 
Bed002.B.dialogueact354	1181.3	1184.38	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	we want to have and uh structure resulting if we 
Bed002.B.dialogueact355	1184.86	1197.62	B	Grad	s	+1	1	if we feed it through belief in that or or something along those lines we get an inferred intention we reproduce instructor that differentiate between the vista of the entire andy um tangle malt 
Bed002.B.dialogueact356	1198.14	1201.1	B	Grad	s	-1	0	i think we may be one to ignore it 
Bed002.B.dialogueact357	1201.2	1203.04	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	it that's an idea up for discussion 
Bed002.B.dialogueact358	1203.22	1204.02	B	Grad	s	-1	0	up for discussion we could change 
Bed002.B.dialogueact359	1204.62	1205.86	B	Grad	s	-1	0	we could change on of and any 
Bed002.B.dialogueact360	1205.86	1206.79	B	Grad	s	-1	0	on of and any that have it 
Bed002.B.dialogueact361	1208.69	1209.31	B	Grad	s	-1	0	throw it all away 
Bed002.F.dialogueact362	1211.57	1213.05	F	Grad	s	-1	0	but now that he may be sent actually now i remember the 
Bed002.C.dialogueact363	1213.1	1213.35	C	Professor	qw^br	-1	0	but now i remember the 
Bed002.F.dialogueact364	1213.45	1214.3	F	Grad	s	-1	0	but okay now i remember the email 
Bed002.C.dialogueact365	1214.77	1215.11	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay email 
Bed002.E.dialogueact366	1216.17	1216.44	E	Grad	b	-1	0	uh so 
Bed002.E.dialogueact367	1216.69	1220.29	E	Grad	s	-1	0	uh so i have no recollection whatsoever really you know i could go back and 
Bed002.E.dialogueact368	1220.29	1221.4	E	Grad	s	-1	0	not important you know i could go back and check 
Bed002.C.dialogueact369	1221.8	1222.44	C	Professor	s^ba^bd	-1	0	not important check 
Bed002.C.dialogueact370	1223.64	1230.63	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so what is important is that we understand what the proposed to ask 
Bed002.C.dialogueact371	1231.98	1235.74	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and they the i earn i talked about this some on friday 
Bed002.C.dialogueact372	1236.84	1239.73	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	we think it's well formed 
Bed002.C.dialogueact373	1240.27	1248.84	C	Professor	s	+1	2	we think it's a well formed uh starter task for this uh deeper understanding in the tourist domain 
Bed002.F.dialogueact374	1252.95	1255.27	F	Grad	qw	-1	0	so where is that these d. uh deeper understanding being done like i mean it's 
Bed002.F.dialogueact375	1255.27	1257.1	F	Grad	qy	-1	0	well done like i mean it's is it before the bees that is it uh 
Bed002.F.dialogueact376	1257.1	1257.67	F	Grad	qy.%--	-1	0	well is it uh 
Bed002.C.dialogueact377	1257.76	1260.26	C	Professor	s	-1	0	well it it's it's always all of it so in is it uh 
Bed002.C.dialogueact378	1260.49	1264.29	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it so in general it's always going to be the answer is everywhere uh 
Bed002.C.dialogueact379	1264.95	1269.66	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh so the notion is that uh this isn't real deep 
Bed002.C.dialogueact380	1270.05	1276.99	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but it's deep enough that you can distinguish between east three quite different kinds of uh going to see some first thing 
Bed002.C.dialogueact381	1277.94	1281.62	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and so that's that's the quote deep that we're trying to get at ann 
Bed002.C.dialogueact382	1282.05	1290.09	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	arbor's point is that the current front and doesn't give you any way to know i guess to 
Bed002.C.dialogueact383	1290.42	1294.81	C	Professor	s	-1	0	know i guess to do it but it also doesn't give you enough information to do it isn't 
Bed002.C.dialogueact384	1294.81	1304.45	C	Professor	s	-1	0	to do it isn't like if you just talk what the front then gives you and use some clever inference algorithm on it you would be able to figure out which of these is going on 
Bed002.C.dialogueact385	1305.19	1306.64	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so uh and this just 
Bed002.C.dialogueact386	1306.64	1309.35	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh and this just look in general is going to be true of any kind of deep understand there's going to be contextual 
Bed002.C.dialogueact387	1309.35	1310.64	C	Professor	s	+1	2	there's going to be contextual things are going to be linguistics 
Bed002.C.dialogueact388	1310.64	1311.84	C	Professor	s	+1	2	things are going to be linguistics things are going 
Bed002.C.dialogueact389	1311.84	1313.14	C	Professor	s	+1	2	things are going to be discourse things and 
Bed002.C.dialogueact390	1313.95	1315.55	C	Professor	s	+1	0	and they got to be combined 
Bed002.C.dialogueact391	1316.54	1320.38	C	Professor	s	+1	1	and my idea on how to combine them is with the belief that all may turn 
Bed002.C.dialogueact392	1320.38	1323.77	C	Professor	s^bd^df	-1	0	that all may turn out that some totally different thing is going to work better 
Bed002.C.dialogueact393	1324.18	1330.95	C	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	um the idea would be that new uh you or 
Bed002.C.dialogueact394	1334.74	1335.72	C	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	yeah everything your flying 
Bed002.B.dialogueact395	1335.98	1338.51	B	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah as as as if as i get i just uh your flying 
Bed002.B.dialogueact396	1338.67	1339.39	B	Grad	%--	-1	0	uh 
Bed002.C.dialogueact397	1339.07	1339.39	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed002.B.dialogueact398	1341.97	1343.84	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	so this course i i thought about that of course 
Bed002.B.dialogueact399	1343.84	1345.99	B	Grad	s	-1	0	thought about that of course that it's true sort of to oh i'm sorry okay 
Bed002.C.dialogueact400	1345.42	1345.86	C	Professor	s^bk|s^fa	-1	0	sort of to oh i'm sorry okay 
Bed002.C.dialogueact401	1345.86	1348.62	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	sort of to oh i'm sorry okay so this is minutes taking minutes as we go 
Bed002.C.dialogueact402	1348.62	1350.71	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	as we go is in his own way 
Bed002.B.dialogueact403	1349.24	1349.4	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	is in 
Bed002.C.dialogueact404	1351.35	1352.62	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	um but the anyway so the 
Bed002.C.dialogueact405	1352.62	1359.59	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	the anyway so the thing is uh not usually speaking you've you've got a for this little test i believe that which 
Bed002.C.dialogueact406	1359.88	1365.7	C	Professor	s	+1	1	that which is going to have this output the conditional probability of one of three things that the person 
Bed002.C.dialogueact407	1365.7	1371.39	C	Professor	s:s	-1	0	things that the person wants to to view it to answer it or to tangle with 
Bed002.C.dialogueact408	1373.03	1374.14	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh so that 
Bed002.C.dialogueact409	1374.84	1377.95	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so that that the output of the belief that is pretty well formed 
Bed002.C.dialogueact410	1378.75	1384.04	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and then the inputs are going to be these kinds of things 
Bed002.C.dialogueact411	1385.37	1386.89	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and then the question is 
Bed002.C.dialogueact412	1387.14	1387.78	C	Professor	s	+1	0	the two questions is 
Bed002.C.dialogueact413	1387.78	1390.81	C	Professor	qh	+1	2	the two questions is uh one where do you get this information from into 
Bed002.C.dialogueact414	1390.81	1392.34	C	Professor	qh	+1	1	from into what's the structure the belief that so what are 
Bed002.C.dialogueact415	1392.55	1396.82	C	Professor	qh^e	+1	0	that so what are the conditional probabilities of this that and the other given these things 
Bed002.C.dialogueact416	1397.29	1399.73	C	Professor	s	+1	1	and you probably need intermediate notes i we don't 
Bed002.C.dialogueact417	1399.73	1400.88	C	Professor	s^no	+1	0	notes i we don't know what they are yet 
Bed002.C.dialogueact418	1401.95	1409.01	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so that may well be that uh for example that uh knowing whether oh another thing you 
Bed002.C.dialogueact419	1409.34	1417.31	C	Professor	s	+1	1	oh another thing you want is some information uh uh i think about the time of day they you want 
Bed002.C.dialogueact420	1417.61	1419.49	C	Professor	s	-1	0	they you want to call that part of context of the 
Bed002.B.dialogueact422	1420.1	1420.72	B	Grad	b	-1	0	time of day matters a lot 
Bed002.C.dialogueact421	1419.84	1421.3	C	Professor	s	-1	0	of the time of day matters a lot 
Bed002.C.dialogueact423	1422.43	1427.88	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	want and if things are obviously closed 
Bed002.B.dialogueact424	1427.74	1428.7	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	want to answer that people don't 
Bed002.C.dialogueact425	1428.46	1429.94	C	Professor	s^m^na	-1	0	to answer that people don't want to enter them 
Bed002.C.dialogueact426	1430.5	1440.84	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and if it's not obvious you may want to actually uh point out the people that it's closed you know what they're going through is closed and they don't have the option of entering it 
Bed002.B.dialogueact427	1431.66	1432.24	B	Grad	%--	-1	0	if it's not obvious you 
Bed002.C.dialogueact428	1442.0	1451.95	C	Professor	s	-1	0	another thing that can come up and will come up as soon as you get serious about this is that another option of course is too have more of a dialogue 
Bed002.C.dialogueact429	1452.76	1454.37	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so if someone says something you could ask them 
Bed002.E.dialogueact430	1454.88	1455.14	E	Grad	b	-1	0	them okay 
Bed002.C.dialogueact431	1455.39	1455.67	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bed002.C.dialogueact432	1456.1	1458.64	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and not wanting to do is always ask them that's boring 
Bed002.C.dialogueact433	1458.64	1459.39	C	Professor	s^bd^df	-1	0	ask them that's boring and 
Bed002.C.dialogueact434	1460.09	1463.29	C	Professor	s	-1	0	also also be a pain for the person using it someone needs 
Bed002.C.dialogueact435	1463.62	1468.34	C	Professor	s	+1	1	it someone needs to do is build a little system this whatever got a question like that i got one of three answers have some which one 
Bed002.C.dialogueact436	1468.34	1469.45	C	Professor	s	-1	0	have some which one you want 
Bed002.C.dialogueact437	1470.81	1471.02	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay but that's 
Bed002.C.dialogueact438	1471.23	1474.49	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but maybe but that's uh not we're going to do 
Bed002.B.dialogueact439	1474.81	1478.31	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but maybe that's a fought state of the system that it's too close to call to do oh yeah 
Bed002.C.dialogueact440	1478.56	1478.87	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	oh yeah 
Bed002.C.dialogueact441	1479.11	1482.06	C	Professor	s	+1	0	you want if you want the ability to that you want the ability to ask but we don't want to do 
Bed002.C.dialogueact442	1482.06	1486.5	C	Professor	s	+1	0	but we don't want to do is the bill a system that always ask every time and it 
Bed002.C.dialogueact443	1486.5	1487.13	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	every time and it that's not getting out 
Bed002.C.dialogueact444	1487.42	1489.23	C	Professor	s^df	+1	0	that's not getting out the scientific problem and 
Bed002.B.dialogueact446	1489.31	1489.8	B	Grad	b	-1	0	and 
Bed002.C.dialogueact445	1489.23	1490.23	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and it's in general 
Bed002.C.dialogueact447	1490.58	1494.06	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it's in general your you know it's going to be much more complex than that 
Bed002.C.dialogueact448	1494.6	1497.52	C	Professor	s	-1	0	this is personally really simple case so 
Bed002.B.dialogueact449	1497.78	1497.95	B	Grad	b	-1	0	case so 
Bed002.C.dialogueact450	1498.04	1499.68	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed002.C.dialogueact451	1499.68	1499.89	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed002.B.dialogueact452	1500.18	1502.32	B	Grad	s^tc	-1	0	i have my one part to to bust first question um i 
Bed002.B.dialogueact453	1502.76	1512.18	B	Grad	s	-1	0	um i think also the the the deep understanding part of it is just going to be in there to the extent that be um wanted in terms of all modeling we can start you 
Bed002.B.dialogueact454	1512.18	1515.42	B	Grad	s	-1	0	we can start you know basic from she would being smuggled that 
Bed002.B.dialogueact455	1515.42	1516.01	B	Grad	s	-1	0	being smuggled that it's motions going 
Bed002.B.dialogueact456	1516.01	1516.91	B	Grad	s	-1	0	it's motions going 
Bed002.B.dialogueact457	1516.91	1518.26	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	it's motions going walking seeing we can m. m. r. and 
Bed002.B.dialogueact458	1518.26	1519.61	B	Grad	s	-1	0	we can m. m. r. and all of that and then 
Bed002.B.dialogueact459	1519.61	1525.12	B	Grad	s	-1	0	all of that and then compose whatever inferences so we make out of these really conceptual primitive that would be extremely 
Bed002.B.dialogueact460	1525.52	1528.83	B	Grad	s	-1	0	that would be extremely deep in into and and in my understanding so 
Bed002.C.dialogueact461	1527.88	1539.84	C	Professor	fg|qh	+1	0	in into and and in my understanding so this is the way they might come up if you want especially want to do that you might say um at an intermediate step and you believe that is their source pets goal scheming involved 
Bed002.C.dialogueact462	1540.57	1540.92	C	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	okay 
Bed002.C.dialogueact463	1541.21	1546.0	C	Professor	qh	+1	0	and if so uh is there a focus on thee will or if 
Bed002.C.dialogueact464	1546.48	1547.86	C	Professor	qh	-1	0	or if it was on the path or something 
Bed002.C.dialogueact465	1547.86	1548.35	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it was on the path or something and that 
Bed002.C.dialogueact466	1548.72	1555.23	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and that could be um one of the conditional you know 
Bed002.C.dialogueact467	1555.23	1559.51	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you know in some pieces believed that that could be the the appropriate thing to enter 
Bed002.F.dialogueact468	1560.14	1561.98	F	Grad	qw	-1	0	so what would be exciting that information from from 
Bed002.F.dialogueact469	1561.98	1562.68	F	Grad	s^bu^e^rt	-1	0	that information from from the into yeah 
Bed002.C.dialogueact470	1563.31	1563.97	C	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	no 
Bed002.C.dialogueact471	1564.41	1565.89	C	Professor	s^ar^r|s^df.%--	-1	0	no c. n. c. l. is not going to give you what he 
Bed002.C.dialogueact472	1565.89	1568.88	C	Professor	s	+1	1	is not going to give you what he was saying is the infield does not have any of that 
Bed002.C.dialogueact473	1569.11	1573.66	C	Professor	s:s	-1	0	all it has some really crude stuff saying person wants to go to a place being 
Bed002.F.dialogueact474	1569.19	1569.48	F	Grad	b	-1	0	all it has some really 
Bed002.E.dialogueact475	1573.85	1575.94	E	Grad	s^bu	+1	0	to a place being thrill is the old smart come out but 
Bed002.C.dialogueact476	1576.19	1576.4	C	Professor	s^aa	+1	0	right and 
Bed002.C.dialogueact478	1576.88	1580.27	C	Professor	s	-1	0	right and straight well in three l. i saw prefers them only markup language so we have that we we just a language right yeah 
Bed002.E.dialogueact477	1576.46	1576.65	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right and 
Bed002.E.dialogueact479	1578.6	1579.54	E	Grad	s	-1	0	saw prefers them only markup language just a language right yeah 
Bed002.E.dialogueact480	1579.54	1580.09	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	markup language so we have that we we language right yeah 
Bed002.C.dialogueact481	1580.45	1586.19	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	the parts are so we have that we we we have to have a better or of referring to 
Bed002.B.dialogueact482	1586.57	1587.42	B	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	the parts are put analyze yeah they 
Bed002.C.dialogueact483	1586.75	1586.91	C	Professor	b	-1	0	the parts are 
Bed002.B.dialogueact485	1587.66	1590.22	B	Grad	s	-1	0	put analyze speech i think it's they called it really yeah they well okay 
Bed002.C.dialogueact484	1587.56	1587.95	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	put analyze yeah they 
Bed002.C.dialogueact486	1587.95	1588.15	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	put analyze speech yeah they 
Bed002.C.dialogueact487	1589.38	1590.1	C	Professor	s^am	-1	0	i think it's they called it really well okay 
Bed002.B.dialogueact488	1590.34	1591.52	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	it really 
Bed002.C.dialogueact489	1592.0	1592.58	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	the 
Bed002.B.dialogueact490	1592.7	1595.52	B	Grad	s	-1	0	the no actually intention that assistance corporate conduct yeah but they could they call 
Bed002.C.dialogueact491	1595.08	1596.71	C	Professor	s	-1	0	conduct but they could they call intentional audits but 
Bed002.C.dialogueact492	1596.71	1598.19	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	and and the intention this hypothesis intentional audits but that anyway 
Bed002.B.dialogueact493	1597.25	1599.5	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and and the intention this hypothesis they called it intentional that anyway 
Bed002.C.dialogueact494	1598.25	1598.55	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	this hypothesis anyway 
Bed002.B.dialogueact495	1599.5	1601.05	B	Grad	s	-1	0	they called it intentional prophecies so 
Bed002.C.dialogueact496	1601.28	1601.48	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	so 
Bed002.C.dialogueact497	1601.99	1609.17	C	Professor	s	+1	1	so they're going to give us some crew uh or we can assume that you get this crude information 
Bed002.C.dialogueact498	1610.41	1611.03	C	Professor	s^e	+1	0	about intention and that's all they're going 
Bed002.C.dialogueact499	1611.03	1613.57	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and that's all they're going to provide 
Bed002.C.dialogueact500	1614.72	1616.71	C	Professor	s	+1	0	and they don't give you the kind of object they don't give 
Bed002.C.dialogueact501	1616.71	1619.46	C	Professor	s	-1	0	of object they don't give you any discourse history if you want to keep 
Bed002.C.dialogueact502	1619.46	1621.55	C	Professor	s	-1	0	history if you want to keep that you have to keep it somewhere else 
Bed002.B.dialogueact503	1624.18	1624.74	B	Grad	s	-1	0	well they keep to rafter 
Bed002.B.dialogueact504	1624.74	1625.82	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	well they keep to rafter it 
Bed002.C.dialogueact505	1626.67	1626.9	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right 
Bed002.B.dialogueact506	1627.21	1627.39	B	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	but @reject@ well they

Bed002.C.dialogueact508	1627.76	1629.97	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but @reject@ in there well they they keep they keep it by their lights it 
Bed002.B.dialogueact510	1630.11	1631.19	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah main there may or may not 
Bed002.C.dialogueact509	1629.97	1633.32	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah or it by their lights it main there may or may not they what we want 
Bed002.B.dialogueact511	1631.95	1632.37	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	yeah or they what we want

Bed002.E.dialogueact513	1634.66	1645.88	E	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	if if so someone because i want to touch the side of the powder tower that would basically we needed pop-up tango mode in that and the directions 
Bed002.C.dialogueact514	1645.39	1647.59	C	Professor	s^na|s^aa	-1	0	if if if they got a simple as that yeah and the directions

Bed002.C.dialogueact516	1648.08	1648.55	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	that wouldn't

Bed002.E.dialogueact519	1653.62	1659.1	E	Grad	s^bu|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	we had you in for a source past goal to some degree for it touching decide right 
Bed002.B.dialogueact520	1659.53	1664.41	B	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	and uh a said uh a point there if i understand you correctly

Bed002.B.dialogueact522	1666.7	1671.92	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	cause um some times people just say things

Bed002.B.dialogueact572	1778.93	1779.24	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	that members as well so 
Bed002.D.dialogueact571	1778.57	1778.76	D	Grad	b	-1	0	that members as well so 
Bed002.C.dialogueact573	1780.83	1781.17	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	but 
Bed002.C.dialogueact574	1783.5	1785.36	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so go go back to the the the yeah that's like 
Bed002.B.dialogueact576	1785.93	1788.67	B	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	so this is on toys it's not it's about the things they're opening the yeah that's like 
Bed002.C.dialogueact575	1785.51	1786.02	C	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	so this is on the yeah that's like 
Bed002.B.dialogueact577	1788.67	1789.85	B	Grad	s	-1	0	about the things they're opening times 
Bed002.B.dialogueact578	1790.36	1795.0	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and then covered with time of day this would so that 
Bed002.B.dialogueact579	1795.0	1795.56	B	Grad	s^f	-1	0	so that 
Bed002.D.dialogueact580	1795.85	1800.01	D	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	so that context was like um they're presumed purpose context like business or 
Bed002.D.dialogueact581	1800.01	1801.79	D	Grad	s	-1	0	like business or travel as 
Bed002.D.dialogueact582	1801.98	1806.28	D	Grad	s^e	-1	0	yeah i think we edited it as travel as well as the other and contacts like um now standing at this place at this time 
Bed002.C.dialogueact583	1805.55	1812.36	C	Professor	fg|s	+1	0	yeah i think we edited it as as we have all along that we we didn't astute distinguishing between situational context which is what you have this at this place at this time 
Bed002.C.dialogueact584	1812.36	1813.66	C	Professor	s	+1	0	which is what you have this context in 
Bed002.C.dialogueact585	1813.92	1815.15	C	Professor	s	+1	0	context in discourse context which was d. h. 
Bed002.B.dialogueact586	1814.91	1816.29	B	Grad	b	-1	0	discourse context which was d. h. and what age means 
Bed002.C.dialogueact587	1815.15	1816.07	C	Professor	s	-1	0	which was d. h. and what age means 
Bed002.B.dialogueact589	1816.4	1816.63	B	Grad	b	-1	0	and what age means 
Bed002.C.dialogueact588	1816.07	1817.13	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	great and what age means 
Bed002.B.dialogueact590	1817.35	1817.83	B	Grad	s	-1	0	great 
Bed002.B.dialogueact591	1818.43	1819.35	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	discourse is true okay whatever 
Bed002.B.dialogueact594	1819.5	1819.81	B	Grad	b	-1	0	okay whatever 
Bed002.C.dialogueact592	1819.1	1819.44	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay whatever 
Bed002.C.dialogueact593	1819.44	1819.79	C	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	okay whatever 
Bed002.C.dialogueact595	1820.25	1822.08	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so we can work out terminology later so they're they're 
Bed002.B.dialogueact596	1821.91	1822.12	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	terminology later so they're they're 
Bed002.C.dialogueact597	1822.4	1824.0	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so they're they're quite distinct 
Bed002.C.dialogueact598	1825.2	1825.93	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	i mean you need them both but 
Bed002.C.dialogueact599	1825.93	1826.92	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean you need them both but they're quite distinct 
Bed002.C.dialogueact600	1827.51	1835.87	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and so we're talking about doing it is as the first shot is not doing any of the linguistics 
Bed002.C.dialogueact601	1838.17	1842.31	C	Professor	s	-1	0	except to find out what seems to be useful so 
Bed002.C.dialogueact602	1842.91	1848.04	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so the the the reason the bullies medicine blue is the notion would be and this may be a bad just 
Bed002.C.dialogueact603	1848.15	1850.29	C	Professor	s^bd^df	-1	0	and this may be a bad just bad idea but the idea 
Bed002.C.dialogueact604	1850.29	1861.27	C	Professor	s^rt	+1	1	but the idea is to take is the first call see if we could actually build a belief that that would make this freeway distinction uh in a plausible way given 
Bed002.C.dialogueact605	1861.27	1861.88	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	way given 
Bed002.C.dialogueact606	1862.33	1864.18	C	Professor	s	+1	2	these we have all these transcripts and 
Bed002.C.dialogueact607	1864.28	1870.79	C	Professor	s	+1	1	and we're able to by hand extract the teachers to put into place that saying 
Bed002.C.dialogueact608	1870.79	1871.57	C	Professor	s:s^bk	-1	0	into place that saying uhhuh hear the things 
Bed002.C.dialogueact609	1871.57	1881.85	C	Professor	s^e:s	+1	1	uhhuh hear the things which if you could get the model spot of the language and discourse and put them into the police that it would tell you which of these three uh intentions is most likely 
Bed002.C.dialogueact610	1883.13	1892.38	C	Professor	s	+1	0	and to to actually do that build it um you know run you run on and dated where you hand transcribed the parameters and 
Bed002.C.dialogueact611	1892.92	1894.05	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and see how that goes if 
Bed002.C.dialogueact612	1894.63	1900.85	C	Professor	s	+1	3	if that goes well then we can start worrying about how we would extracted 
Bed002.C.dialogueact613	1901.24	1903.0	C	Professor	qh	-1	0	so where would you get this information and 
Bed002.C.dialogueact614	1903.62	1906.98	C	Professor	s	+1	0	and expanded that to other things like this 
Bed002.C.dialogueact615	1907.8	1912.14	C	Professor	s	+1	1	but if we can't do that then we're in trouble and then 
Bed002.C.dialogueact616	1912.76	1915.19	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and then if if you can't do this task 
Bed002.C.dialogueact617	1916.23	1917.63	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed002.B.dialogueact618	1918.21	1919.48	B	Grad	s^2^cs	-1	0	do different engine machine yeah or 
Bed002.B.dialogueact620	1919.84	1920.49	B	Grad	s^bsc	-1	0	engine machine and yeah or something by 
Bed002.C.dialogueact619	1919.56	1920.49	C	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	engine machine and yeah or something by 
Bed002.C.dialogueact621	1920.49	1925.75	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and something by it if if it's i believe that's what we'll switch to you know logic or some terrible thing but 
Bed002.C.dialogueact622	1925.75	1927.57	C	Professor	s	-1	0	terrible thing but i don't think that's going to be the case i think that 
Bed002.C.dialogueact623	1927.57	1937.42	C	Professor	s	+1	1	to be the case i think that uh if we can get the information i believe it is a perfectly good way uh doing b. differential combination of 
Bed002.C.dialogueact624	1939.4	1943.83	C	Professor	qh	+1	1	the really issue is do what are the factors involved in determining this

Bed002.D.dialogueact704	2071.78	2076.3	D	Grad	s	-1	0	latausha so uh i think don't know no that's fine i guess it's just knowing begin tension from the experimental subject 
Bed002.C.dialogueact705	2072.78	2073.09	C	Professor	b	-1	0	it's just knowing begin tension from 
Bed002.B.dialogueact706	2074.0	2074.53	B	Grad	b	-1	0	latausha the 
Bed002.C.dialogueact707	2074.75	2075.39	C	Professor	s^2|s^aa	-1	0	latausha so the experimental subject 
Bed002.C.dialogueact708	2075.68	2080.29	C	Professor	fg|s	+1	0	so uh i think don't know that we are going to actually use this little room and experimental subject 
Bed002.D.dialogueact709	2076.3	2076.88	D	Grad	%	-1	0	uh i think don't know 
Bed002.C.dialogueact710	2080.87	2084.81	C	Professor	s	+1	1	and start recording subjects probably within a month or something so 
Bed002.C.dialogueact711	2084.81	2088.09	C	Professor	s	-1	0	or something so this is not any look into you guys worry accept that 
Bed002.C.dialogueact712	2088.09	2094.68	C	Professor	s	-1	0	accept that we may want to push that effort to get information we need 
Bed002.C.dialogueact713	2095.1	2098.62	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so our job is to figure out how to solve these problems 
Bed002.C.dialogueact714	2099.17	2107.76	C	Professor	s	-1	0	if it turns out that we need data of a certain sort then the sort of data collection branch can be uh has to do that 
Bed002.C.dialogueact715	2108.62	2117.49	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and one of the reasons why we're recording the meeting for these guys just because we want their help and we we start doing uh recording of subjects 
Bed002.C.dialogueact716	2119.69	2120.82	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	so yeah you're absolutely right don't know you

Bed002.B.dialogueact736	2159.06	2160.41	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so there were never answers okay 
Bed002.D.dialogueact737	2159.57	2160.04	D	Grad	b	-1	0	so there were never answers okay 
Bed002.D.dialogueact738	2160.94	2161.99	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay okay

Bed002.D.dialogueact740	2163.14	2166.54	D	Grad	s^no	-1	0	i guess i don't know the situation of of collecting the data like here 
Bed002.D.dialogueact741	2166.54	2170.72	D	Grad	s^e	-1	0	data like here it you could imagine them being here around the city it's like one situation then you have 
Bed002.D.dialogueact742	2170.72	2177.59	D	Grad	s	-1	0	one situation then you have all sorts of other situational context factors that would influence how to interpret like you said the scope and things like that 
Bed002.B.dialogueact743	2176.24	2176.86	B	Grad	b	-1	0	like you said the scope and

Bed002.B.dialogueact750	2194.4	2198.53	B	Grad	s	+1	1	perverse so that's where perk some of the tasks we're not differentiated by intention of it too there was no

Bed002.D.dialogueact759	2208.61	2209.28	D	Grad	b	-1	0	we needed um that that's 
Bed002.B.dialogueact761	2211.53	2214.75	B	Grad	s	-1	0	things but you know you got to be something father people to model and

Bed002.B.dialogueact765	2226.24	2235.18	B	Grad	s	+1	1	some sometime at the moment courteous and i'm it's what to approach it from the and where we can just sort of start with this toy system that we can play around with so they 
Bed002.D.dialogueact766	2234.58	2234.91	D	Grad	b	-1	0	that we can play around with 
Bed002.B.dialogueact767	2235.74	2239.56	B	Grad	s	+1	0	so they would get a clearer notion of what input we need but that's what

Bed002.B.dialogueact769	2240.06	2241.41	B	Grad	s	-1	0	suffices and what doesn't and 
Bed002.B.dialogueact770	2241.83	2244.93	B	Grad	s	+1	1	doesn't and then we can start worrying about where you get this and but 
Bed002.B.dialogueact771	2244.93	2247.23	B	Grad	qh	-1	0	you get this and but what do we need you know 
Bed002.B.dialogueact772	2247.65	2253.62	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	know say once we all experts and changing that person for example maybe there's just a couple three things we need to do and then we get 
Bed002.B.dialogueact773	2253.62	2259.9	B	Grad	s	-1	0	we need to do and then we get more whatever part of speech and more construction type like

Bed002.E.dialogueact778	2268.17	2269.02	E	Grad	qy^e	-1	0	they have a map and you give 
Bed002.E.dialogueact779	2269.02	2271.35	E	Grad	s^bu^e	-1	0	and you give them this an aurio of some sort 
Bed002.B.dialogueact780	2272.62	2272.91	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bed002.B.dialogueact781	2274.11	2275.41	B	Grad	s	-1	0	imagine you're the the subject going to be in here

Bed002.B.dialogueact785	2287.55	2288.59	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so you actually see that 
Bed002.B.dialogueact786	2289.43	2291.39	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	um he uh um 
Bed002.B.dialogueact787	2291.9	2295.12	B	Grad	s	-1	0	um first thing it's just to read the text for burke so just

Bed002.B.dialogueact795	2320.48	2323.35	B	Grad	s	+1	0	first you have to go find out hard to get to that taste maybe it was the intention 
Bed002.B.dialogueact796	2323.54	2326.45	B	Grad	s	-1	0	maybe it was the intention of buying stamps and they're maybe's

Bed002.B.dialogueact810	2348.69	2353.48	B	Grad	s^rt	+1	0	go and then they chewing operator comes on and it's a part of ties us that the system is crashed but 
Bed002.B.dialogueact811	2353.93	2356.05	B	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	crashed but you are just you to continue you know the with a human

Bed002.B.dialogueact815	2363.19	2364.01	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and you go through it again and that was it

Bed002.C.dialogueact928	2571.35	2571.56	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay so anyway 
Bed002.C.dialogueact929	2571.86	2576.91	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	okay so anyway she's looking for some more part time work while she's waiting actually for graduate school 
Bed002.C.dialogueact930	2577.24	2577.97	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and she'll be in touch so 
Bed002.C.dialogueact931	2577.97	2581.85	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and she'll be in touch so we may have someone uh to do this and 
Bed002.C.dialogueact932	2582.0	2585.83	C	Professor	s	-1	0	she's got you know some background in in all this stuff and 
Bed002.C.dialogueact933	2585.9	2587.19	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	all this stuff and isn't linguists so 
Bed002.C.dialogueact934	2587.19	2587.49	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bed002.C.dialogueact935	2587.86	2597.65	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	so that's so nancy will have enough at some point we'll have another discussion on exactly well that you know how that's going to go 
Bed002.D.dialogueact936	2592.3	2592.86	D	Grad	b	-1	0	we'll have another discussion 
Bed002.C.dialogueact937	2598.32	2608.77	C	Professor	s	-1	0	change but all so um liz have offered to help us do this the data collection design and stuff 
Bed002.D.dialogueact938	2604.27	2604.73	D	Grad	b	-1	0	have offered 
Bed002.D.dialogueact939	2605.94	2606.79	D	Grad	b	-1	0	to help us do this 
Bed002.C.dialogueact940	2609.68	2613.12	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so when we get to that will have some people doing it know what to do 
Bed002.D.dialogueact941	2609.99	2610.29	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	so when we get to that will have some 
Bed002.D.dialogueact942	2614.43	2626.23	D	Grad	s^df	+1	0	i guess every set of having been beaten the details of this kind of thing is that um it's one thing to collect data for speech recognition or various other tests that have pretty clear correct answers but with the intention

Bed002.D.dialogueact996	2750.78	2752.38	D	Grad	s^aa|qh^e	-1	0	yeah like how close yeah because 
Bed002.C.dialogueact997	2752.41	2752.52	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	yeah because 
Bed002.D.dialogueact998	2752.57	2753.99	D	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	thing is really close yeah because tango 
Bed002.E.dialogueact999	2752.66	2753.64	E	Grad	s^aa|s^df.%-	-1	0	thing is really close yeah because tango 
Bed002.E.dialogueact1000	2753.92	2754.1	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	thing is really close tango 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1001	2755.39	2755.96	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	well anyway 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1003	2756.18	2756.59	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	so oh it's 
Bed002.F.dialogueact1002	2756.16	2756.39	F	Grad	%-	-1	0	so oh it's 
Bed002.F.dialogueact1004	2757.13	2761.97	F	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	right so like the question is what teachers can like we want to try to extract from had a bias or whatever 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1005	2761.95	2762.2	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right or whatever like the presence 
Bed002.F.dialogueact1006	2762.07	2767.89	F	Grad	s^e.%--	-1	0	is a construction like the presence of the word or the presence of a certain uh stem or certain construction 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1007	2765.72	2766.1	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	or certain construction 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1008	2767.7	2769.79	C	Professor	qh	+1	0	is a construction or the kind of object or 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1009	2769.79	2777.52	C	Professor	s^e	+1	0	of object or uh anything else that's in this it's either in the in this thee discourse itself or in the context 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1010	2778.09	2785.71	C	Professor	s	+1	1	so if it turns out that whatever it is you want to know where the person's uh tourist or no okay that becomes a teacher now how 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1011	2785.85	2788.52	C	Professor	s	+1	0	a teacher now how you determine that is another issue but for 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1012	2788.52	2800.72	C	Professor	s:s	-1	0	issue but for for the current problem would just be okay if you can be sure that supports versus a businessman versus the natives or something uh that would give you a lot of discriminatory power and then just 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1013	2800.72	2803.07	C	Professor	s:s^fe	-1	0	power and then just have a little section your belief that that set that was in the 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1014	2803.54	2805.16	C	Professor	s	+1	0	that was in the short run you accept them 
Bed002.F.dialogueact1015	2805.81	2806.41	F	Grad	b	-1	0	and see 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1016	2806.58	2808.11	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and see how how it worked and then in the longer run 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1017	2808.11	2818.03	C	Professor	s	+1	3	and then in the longer run you would figure out how all you could drive them from previous discourse or winning anything else you do 
Bed002.F.dialogueact1018	2815.3	2815.62	F	Grad	b.%	-1	0	from previous 
Bed002.F.dialogueact1019	2829.61	2831.41	F	Grad	qw	-1	0	so how should what's d. outside my country go 
Bed002.F.dialogueact1020	2831.45	2833.71	F	Grad	qw^e.%-	-1	0	okay so first my country go about figuring out is 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1021	2832.91	2834.52	C	Professor	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	okay so first of all it's uh about figuring out is 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1022	2834.63	2840.32	C	Professor	fh|qy	+1	0	of all it's uh uh we either you guys got a favorite belief that that you've you know played with bays 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1023	2840.32	2842.02	C	Professor	s^e	+1	1	with bays were or something 
Bed002.F.dialogueact1024	2842.4	2842.61	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed002.F.dialogueact1025	2844.24	2844.82	F	Grad	s^ar|s^nd	-1	0	no not really 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1026	2845.52	2845.78	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay well 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1027	2845.93	2847.13	C	Professor	fg|s^co	-1	0	okay well to get one okay 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1028	2847.82	2852.77	C	Professor	s^bk|s	+1	1	okay so so of the one of the things we want to do is actually uh pick a package 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1029	2853.23	2854.13	C	Professor	s	-1	0	of matter which one uh 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1030	2854.77	2857.23	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh personally what this could could interactive abilities because a lot of what 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1031	2857.23	2858.7	C	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	because a lot of what we're going to be 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1032	2859.05	2863.58	C	Professor	s	+1	1	you know we don't need one that will solve massive uh but we can that's quickly these 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1033	2863.58	2863.89	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	these 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1034	2863.96	2866.87	C	Professor	s	-1	0	these are not going to get big in in these people future 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1035	2867.25	2872.9	C	Professor	s	+1	1	we do one one in which it's easy to interact with and um modify 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1036	2874.08	2880.7	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	that's a lot of what it's going to be playing with this 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1037	2881.09	2887.41	C	Professor	s	+1	1	and probably one in which it's easy to have um what amounts to transcripts files so that if if 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1038	2887.53	2889.58	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so that if if we have all these cases 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1039	2890.47	2890.71	C	Professor	s^f	-1	0	okay so we make 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1040	2890.71	2892.89	C	Professor	s	-1	0	okay so we make up cases that have these teachers 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1041	2893.48	2896.61	C	Professor	s.%--:s	-1	0	okay and then you'd like to be able to say okay here's a bunch of cases driven 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1042	2896.84	2899.4	C	Professor	s	-1	0	cases driven ones that that you can do learning 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1043	2900.1	2902.63	C	Professor	s	-1	0	okay so you have all these cases and and their results in new 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1044	2902.63	2907.37	C	Professor	s	-1	0	results in new haven't algorithms go through and run around trying to separate the probabilities for you 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1045	2908.23	2909.57	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1046	2910.25	2911.64	C	Professor	s	-1	0	probably that's not worth it 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1047	2912.41	2919.14	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	i mean my guess is we aren't haven't updated it's good enough to make the these data sitting ones worth it but i don't know 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1048	2919.14	2919.62	C	Professor	s^df^no	-1	0	it but i don't know 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1049	2920.26	2925.88	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so so you got the first task for you two guys is too um pick a package 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1050	2926.83	2928.56	C	Professor	s	-1	0	okay you want to just you know standard think you want stable 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1051	2928.56	2929.71	C	Professor	s^e.%--	+1	1	standard think you want stable you want it's 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1052	2929.71	2929.77	C	Professor	%	-1	0	you want it's 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1053	2931.36	2942.45	C	Professor	s	+1	1	and as soon as we have one we can start trying to make the first cut at what's going on but what 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1054	2933.76	2934.66	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	have one we can start 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1055	2942.84	2944.38	C	Professor	s	-1	0	on but what i like about it's very concrete we we 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1056	2944.68	2946.73	C	Professor	s	+1	1	we we have we know what the outcome's are going to be 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1057	2947.19	2949.75	C	Professor	s	+1	1	and we have some some dated it's loose we can use 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1058	2949.75	2951.08	C	Professor	s	+1	0	it's loose we can use their own intuition 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1059	2952.05	2954.15	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and see how all hard it is n. t. importantly 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1060	2954.66	2957.86	C	Professor	s	-1	0	n. t. importantly what intermediate note we think we need 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1061	2958.45	2969.57	C	Professor	s	+1	0	so it if it turns out that just thinking about the probably a couple of things that you really need it you know this is the kind of thing that is you know intermediate little piece in your belief that to be really interesting 
Bed002.E.dialogueact1062	2969.65	2970.02	E	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed002.B.dialogueact1063	2972.93	2981.58	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and and invasive as a platform for a person maybe meet or whoever was interested in doing some linguistics analysis 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1064	2981.58	2984.79	B	Grad	s	-1	0	or we have the full frame that group here 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1065	2985.15	2988.58	B	Grad	s	-1	0	we can see what they have found out about those concepts already 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1066	2989.21	2990.91	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	containing the data 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1067	2991.65	2994.9	B	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	you have to come up with a nice instead of interests and 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1068	2994.9	2998.49	B	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	of interests and um maybe even means of uh expecting them 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1069	2999.1	3005.05	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and and the dog together cosby to become a nice paper that's going to be published somewhere we sit down and write to and 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1070	3006.01	3007.2	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	um when you said 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1071	3007.77	3011.37	B	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	when you said java based but he said you're talking about once and run of coffee know that are in 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1072	3011.37	3013.96	B	Grad	qrr	-1	0	know that are in the programming marriage hour know that it turns 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1073	3013.13	3019.08	C	Professor	s^ar|s	-1	0	marriage hour know that it turns out that there is a you know end of java libraries okay and it turns out 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1074	3019.43	3021.22	C	Professor	s	-1	0	okay and it turns out one call java base which is 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1076	3021.4	3021.64	B	Grad	b	-1	0	which is 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1077	3021.72	3021.88	B	Grad	b	-1	0	which is 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1075	3021.38	3024.56	C	Professor	s	-1	0	which is one that hurt people around here use a fair amount i've 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1078	3024.95	3026.35	C	Professor	s^no.%--	-1	0	amount i've no idea whether that's i 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1079	3026.89	3027.44	C	Professor	%	-1	0	i the obvious advantage 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1080	3027.48	3036.8	C	Professor	s	-1	0	the obvious advantage of that is that you can then relatively easily get all the other job the packages for grew weeks or whatever else you might want to do 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1081	3035.68	3036.11	B	Grad	b	-1	0	weeks or whatever else you might want to do 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1082	3037.12	3041.45	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so that that's i think why a lot of people doing research used that 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1083	3042.34	3043.12	C	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	but that may not be i have no idea 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1084	3043.12	3045.4	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	i have no idea whether that's the best choice and and 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1085	3045.4	3052.86	C	Professor	s	+1	1	choice and and there are plenty of people around students in the department who you know live and breathe baseness so 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1086	3053.01	3054.27	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh there's 
Bed002.D.dialogueact1087	3054.73	3057.92	D	Grad	s	-1	0	right there's a tool kit that um kevin murphy is developed 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1088	3057.46	3057.67	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right murphy is developed 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1089	3058.37	3058.78	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	it's okay which might be 
Bed002.D.dialogueact1090	3058.4	3059.91	D	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	it's okay so which might be useful too and 
Bed002.F.dialogueact1091	3059.05	3059.32	F	Grad	b	-1	0	so useful too and 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1092	3059.89	3063.01	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so yeah kevin would be a good person to start with nancy knows about useful too and it's available that lab coat 
Bed002.D.dialogueact1093	3059.91	3061.78	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so yeah kevin would be a good person to useful too and it's available that lab coat 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1094	3063.31	3064.03	C	Professor	s	-1	0	nancy knows about it what do you guys that kevin 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1095	3064.03	3065.82	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	it what do you guys that kevin yet or not but 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1096	3065.75	3065.96	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yet or not but 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1097	3065.93	3066.59	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	but yet or not but 
Bed002.F.dialogueact1098	3066.08	3066.55	F	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	but 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1099	3066.99	3067.4	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	but this is we all 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1101	3067.4	3071.5	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	this is we all probably have pretty sure that and the 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1100	3067.27	3067.4	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	this is we all 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1102	3072.15	3077.63	B	Grad	s	+1	1	for but this the bad luck history is is in producing x. another content ahead 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1103	3077.63	3079.1	B	Grad	s	-1	0	another content ahead of course the sex amount d. 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1104	3079.45	3089.21	B	Grad	s.x	+1	1	d. on tonnage eat that um uh student is is constructing for me back in in in mel is in all you and it's often x. amount and so that's 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1105	3089.66	3095.29	B	Grad	s.x	+1	1	and so that's where a lot of knowledge about bakeries about details about hostels and stuff is going to come from and yeah 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1106	3093.25	3093.84	C	Professor	b	-1	0	hostels and 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1107	3094.79	3095.0	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	stuff is going to come from and yeah 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1108	3095.87	3102.14	B	Grad	s	-1	0	from and so if it has that i all keeper but even if it's a topic that you would definitely be it was it was a cover so yeah we're sort of committed to x. 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1109	3100.8	3100.87	C	Professor	b	-1	0	be it was 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1110	3101.29	3105.83	C	Professor	fg|s	+1	1	it was a cover so yeah we're sort of committed to x. m. l. as the kind of uh interchange 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1111	3106.3	3108.15	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but that's not a big deal so 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1112	3107.68	3108.04	B	Grad	qh^df	-1	0	not a big deal so 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1113	3108.32	3108.39	B	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	deal so 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1114	3108.58	3115.66	C	Professor	s	-1	0	deal so in terms of uh you know changing in and out of any much we build would be x. email and 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1115	3115.85	3120.51	C	Professor	s	-1	0	would be x. email and if you're going off to query to be apology for example you have to deal with its interface 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1116	3122.07	3123.37	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that's that's fine and and 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1117	3123.37	3124.75	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	fine and and um 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1118	3125.36	3132.04	C	Professor	s	-1	0	all of these things have been built much bigger projects than this in mind so they they 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1119	3132.04	3134.23	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so they they have worked very hard it's kind of black boards 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1120	3134.24	3136.94	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	it's kind of black boards and multi way blackboard and 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1121	3136.93	3139.32	C	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	way blackboard and ways of inner changing and registering euro and so forth

Bed002.C.dialogueact1123	3140.23	3140.59	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	so 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1124	3142.66	3145.87	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that i don't think it's even worth worrying about just you 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1125	3146.74	3159.98	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean if we can get the core of the thing to work in a way that we're comfortable with then we can we can get in and out of it with uh x. m. l. little little script there's 
Bed002.C.dialogueact1126	3160.64	3161.01	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	yeah i believe i don't i don't 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1128	3161.22	3161.36	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah don't i don't 
Bed002.B.dialogueact1129	3161.5	3170.86	B	Grad	fg|s^rt	-1	0	yeah i i like for some of the what you said about the getting input from from just highest about where you where you have the day does specified features and so forth don't i don't
