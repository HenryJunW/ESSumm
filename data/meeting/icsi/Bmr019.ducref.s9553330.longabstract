The meeting at Berkley was of ICSI's group concerned with recognition of recorded meeting data.
The two main topics of conversation were adaptation within digit recognition , and alignment within the larger vocabulary meeting recognition.
The group discussed issues of different microphones , changing to using a new system , and whether people were making Eurospeech submissions.
They talked about adaption models , issues of multiple speakers , and they feel they lack data per speaker.
On alignment , they were concerned over matters of background and foreground speech , though they have identified common errors by looking more closely at the waves.
They also discussed plans for an up coming group meeting.
Most people have given up on submissions to Eurospeech , because the deadline was moved forward this year.
It has been found that lowering the pruning level actually improves performance on the meeting recognition.
It appears that most backchannels are created by someone who has asked a question while it is being answered.
