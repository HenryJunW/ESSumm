Bmr023.F.dialogueact47	122.425	123.115	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact49	125.933	126.313	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	I think {disfmarker}
Bmr023.G.dialogueact48	125.851	127.241	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	She can just walk in , I guess , or {disfmarker}
Bmr023.D.dialogueact50	127.103	127.393	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact52	127.673	128.373	D	PhD	s	-1	0	She 'll probably come up .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact51	127.427	127.667	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact53	128.173	130.383	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Since we 're starting late I figured we 'd better just start .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact54	130.05	130.97	F	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Yeah . Great idea .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact55	131.49	138.692	F	Professor	s^t	+1	2	I was gonna ask Adam to , uh , say if he thought anymore about the demo stuff
Bmr023.F.dialogueact56	138.772	145.78	F	Professor	s^df	+1	2	because {vocalsound} it occurred to me that this is late May and the DARPA meeting is in {pause} mid July .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact57	146.912	151.257	F	Professor	fh|s^no.%--	-1	0	Uh , but {vocalsound} I don't remember w what we {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact58	152.308	156.638	F	Professor	s	+1	2	I know that we were gonna do something with the transcriber interface is one thing ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact59	156.638	157.938	F	Professor	s	-1	0	but I thought there was a second thing .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact60	160.54	161.18	F	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	Anybody remember ?
Bmr023.G.dialogueact61	161.776	166.86	G	PhD	fg|s	+1	2	Well , we were gonna do a mock - up , like , question answering or something , I thought ,
Bmr023.G.dialogueact62	167.46	169.27	G	PhD	s^e^rt	-1	0	that was totally separate from the interface .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact63	169.45	169.98	G	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Do you remember ?
Bmr023.G.dialogueact64	171.523	177.937	G	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	Remember , like , asking questions and retrieving , {vocalsound} but in a pre - stored fashion .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact65	172.529	173.059	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact66	178.991	179.361	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact67	179.305	182.765	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	That was the thing we talked about , I think , before the transcriber {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact69	183.078	183.428	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact68	183.045	183.355	G	PhD	s^co^t3	-1	0	Come on in .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact70	185.073	186.933	F	Professor	s^co	-1	0	Alright . So anyway , you have to sort out that out
Bmr023.F.dialogueact71	187.143	188.853	F	Professor	s^co	-1	0	and get somebody going on it
Bmr023.F.dialogueact72	188.853	191.647	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	cuz we 're {disfmarker} got a {disfmarker} got a month left basically .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact73	191.837	191.897	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact74	193.459	194.129	G	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	You like these .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact75	194.129	194.389	G	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr023.G.dialogueact76	194.779	195.209	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK , good .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact77	198.408	199.008	F	Professor	fg	-1	0	OK .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact78	206.586	207.406	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um
Bmr023.F.dialogueact79	209.986	211.616	F	Professor	qw^t^tc	-1	0	OK . So , what are we g else we got ?
Bmr023.F.dialogueact80	211.906	213.216	F	Professor	s	-1	0	You got {disfmarker} you just wrote a bunch of stuff .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact81	214.02	216.47	G	PhD	s^ar|s	-1	0	No . That was all , um , previously here .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact82	216.826	217.086	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact83	218.66	221.68	G	PhD	s^na	-1	0	I was writing {pause} the digits and then I realized I could xerox them ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact84	221.603	221.633	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact85	221.703	222.573	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	oh .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact86	222.833	225.683	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because I didn't want people to turn their heads from these microphones .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact87	225.683	226.023	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact88	226.653	229.673	G	PhD	s	-1	0	We all , by the way , have the same digit form , for the record .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact89	230.767	231.037	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact90	231.548	232.028	F	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	That 's cool .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact91	232.41	232.74	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact92	232.993	243.113	F	Professor	qr.%-	-1	0	So , the choice is , uh , which {disfmarker} which do we want more , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the comparison , uh , {vocalsound} of everybody saying them at the same time or the comparison of people saying the same digits at different times that {disfmarker} ?
Bmr023.G.dialogueact93	243.04	244.97	G	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's just cuz I didn't have any more digit sheets .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact94	244.986	245.456	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	I know that .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact96	246.055	248.105	F	Professor	qw.%-	-1	0	But , you know , which opportunity should we
Bmr023.G.dialogueact95	245.924	246.184	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact97	246.994	247.254	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact98	251.34	251.82	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Unison .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact100	252.184	252.664	F	Professor	s^aa^m	-1	0	exploit ? {vocalsound} Unison .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact99	252.035	257.315	G	PhD	fg|s^cs	-1	0	I mean , it {disfmarker} Actually it might be good to have them separately and have the same exact strings .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact101	257.375	259.835	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	I mean , we could use them for normalizing or something ,
Bmr023.G.dialogueact102	259.895	263.165	G	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	but it of course goes more quickly doing them in unison .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact103	263.336	264.116	F	Professor	s^am	-1	0	I guess we 'll see
Bmr023.G.dialogueact104	263.555	263.915	G	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I don't know .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact105	264.116	265.306	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i I guess it 's dependent on
Bmr023.G.dialogueact106	264.621	265.481	G	PhD	s	-1	0	See how long we go .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact107	266.032	268.352	F	Professor	s^e^m	-1	0	how long we go and how good the snack is out there .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact109	268.666	275.966	E	PhD	s	-1	0	But anyway , they won't be identical as somebody is saying zero in some {disfmarker} sometimes , you know , saying O , and so , it 's not i not identical .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact108	268.522	270.262	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	Yeah . Hmm . Get some advance intelligence .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact110	272.729	273.179	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact111	273.883	274.213	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .

Bmr023.C.dialogueact151	354.719	357.259	C	PhD	s	-1	0	But , uh , that 's not d directly related to me .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact152	357.259	358.299	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Doesn't mean we can't talk about it .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact153	359.296	364.546	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	Um , it seems {disfmarker} It looks l I haven't {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker} The experiment is still not complete ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact154	364.626	364.866	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	but ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact155	365.907	371.911	C	PhD	fh|s^ba	+1	2	um , it looks like the vocal tract length normalization is working beautifully , actually ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact157	372.479	378.159	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	w using the warp factors that we computed for the SRI system and just applying them to the {vocalsound} ICSI front - end .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact156	372.478	373.188	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact158	378.058	378.728	F	Professor	s^j	-1	0	That 's pretty funny .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact159	379.209	379.459	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact161	379.498	379.948	F	Professor	s^bk^rt	-1	0	OK .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact160	379.438	381.928	G	PhD	s^co	-1	0	So you just need to {pause} copy over to this one .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact162	381.056	386.067	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Just had to take the reciprocal of the number because they have different meanings in the two systems .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact163	383.492	383.642	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact164	385.447	385.907	F	Professor	s^fe	-1	0	Ah !
Bmr023.F.dialogueact165	386.326	387.876	F	Professor	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	Yeah . Well , that 's always good to do .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact166	388.063	388.393	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact167	388.076	388.436	F	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact168	390.091	390.521	F	Professor	fg	-1	0	OK .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact169	390.621	391.561	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker}
Bmr023.C.dialogueact170	391.251	407.03	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	But one issue actually that just came up in discussion with Liz and {disfmarker} and Don was , um , as far as meeting recognition is concerned , um , we would really like to , uh , move , uh , to , uh , doing the recognition on automatic segmentations .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact171	392.325	392.535	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact172	408.405	420.012	C	PhD	s^df	+1	3	Because in all our previous experiments , we had the {disfmarker} uh , you know , we were essentially cheating by having the , um , you know , the h the hand - segmentations as the basis of the recognition .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact173	418.846	419.646	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact174	420.632	425.842	C	PhD	s^cs.%-	+1	4	And so now with Thilo 's segmenter working so well , I think we should {pause} consider doing a {disfmarker}
Bmr023.E.dialogueact175	420.882	421.432	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm . So .
Bmr023.B.dialogueact176	422.315	422.465	B	Grad	s^co^t3	-1	0	Come on .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact179	426.459	427.399	C	PhD	s^e.%-	-1	0	uh , doing {disfmarker}
Bmr023.E.dialogueact177	426.409	427.419	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	Yeah . We {disfmarker} But {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact178	426.458	428.548	F	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Y think {disfmarker} you think we should increase the error rate .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact180	427.849	428.369	E	PhD	fg|s^bk	-1	0	Anyway . Yeah .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact183	428.882	429.152	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact182	428.789	428.959	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact181	428.548	428.918	F	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Good .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact185	429.742	429.972	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact184	429.494	429.684	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact186	430.35	432.06	E	PhD	s	-1	0	That - that 's what I wanted to do anyway ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact188	431.938	432.168	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact189	432.06	434.58	E	PhD	s^cs.%-	-1	0	so we should just get together and {disfmarker}
Bmr023.G.dialogueact187	431.894	432.284	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact190	432.89	433.11	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact191	433.583	440.793	G	PhD	s^ba	+1	2	And even {disfmarker} The good thing is that since you , um , have high recall , {comment} even if you have low precision cuz you 're over - generating , that 's good
Bmr023.G.dialogueact192	440.793	447.593	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because we could train noise models in the recognizer for these kinds of , uh , transients and things that come from the microphones ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact194	441.405	441.615	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact193	440.976	441.206	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact195	444.632	444.842	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact196	447.593	459.55	G	PhD	s^df	+1	1	but {vocalsound} I know that if we run recognition unconstrained on a whole waveform , we do very poorly because we 're {disfmarker} we 're getting insertions in places what {disfmarker} that you may well be cutting out .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact197	457.312	457.642	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bmr023.E.dialogueact198	457.509	457.739	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact199	458.77	459.31	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact200	459.55	461.69	G	PhD	s	+1	1	So we do need some kind of pre - segmentation .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact201	460.19	471.686	C	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	We should {disfmarker} we should consider doing some extra things , like , um , you know , retraining or adapting the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the models for background noise to the {disfmarker} to this environment , for instance .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact202	466.977	467.247	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact203	468.838	469.268	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact204	471.268	471.508	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact205	471.746	476.208	G	PhD	s^cs.%--	+1	1	And , yeah , using Thilo 's , you know , posteriors or some kind of {disfmarker} or {disfmarker}
Bmr023.C.dialogueact206	473.02	473.36	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact207	476.328	479.007	G	PhD	s	-1	0	right now they 're {disfmarker} they 're discrete ,
Bmr023.E.dialogueact209	479.351	479.621	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact208	479.307	483.881	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	yes or no for a speaker , to consider those particular speaker background models .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact211	484.271	484.461	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact210	484.241	484.301	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact212	484.471	486.591	G	PhD	s	-1	0	There 's lots of ins interesting things that could be done .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact213	486.037	486.257	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact214	486.557	487.417	E	PhD	s^na	-1	0	Yeah . We should do that .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact215	487.781	487.951	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact216	488.718	488.918	F	Professor	fg	-1	0	Good .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact217	490.344	493.884	F	Professor	qh^rt^t^tc	-1	0	So , uh , why don't we , uh , do the IBM stuff ?
Bmr023.D.dialogueact219	494.62	505.182	D	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah . So , um , talked with Brian and gave him the alternatives to the single beep at the end of each utterance that we had generated before .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact218	494.254	495.254	F	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	You had some {pause} thing about that ?
Bmr023.F.dialogueact220	503.727	504.057	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact221	505.59	506.47	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	And so {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact222	506.01	507.63	F	Professor	s^2^j	-1	0	The , uh , Chuck chunks .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact223	507.57	507.74	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact225	508.11	508.71	D	PhD	s^j^m	-1	0	The Chuck chunks .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact224	507.721	507.971	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact226	508.71	508.89	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	Right .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact227	509.557	511.247	D	PhD	s	+1	2	And so he talked it over with the transcriber
Bmr023.D.dialogueact228	511.247	519.487	D	PhD	s^cs^e	+1	2	and the transcriber thought that the easiest thing for them would be if there was a beep and then the nu a number , a digit , and then a beep , uh , at the beginning of each one
Bmr023.F.dialogueact229	516.787	516.997	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact230	518.159	518.439	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact231	519.487	521.876	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	and that would help keep them from getting lost .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact232	522.351	527.713	D	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	And , um , {vocalsound} so Adam wrote a little script to generate those style , uh , beeps
Bmr023.C.dialogueact234	527.978	529.158	C	PhD	qw	-1	0	Where 'd you get the digits from ?
Bmr023.D.dialogueact233	527.713	528.313	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and so we 're {disfmarker}
Bmr023.D.dialogueact235	529.46	531.94	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I came up here and just recorded the numbers one through ten .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact236	532.517	533.417	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	They sound really good .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact237	532.81	532.95	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact239	533.774	534.334	D	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Does it sound OK ?
Bmr023.G.dialogueact238	533.704	534.634	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That 's a great idea .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact240	534.357	534.707	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact241	535.39	537.18	D	PhD	s	-1	0	So , um {disfmarker} Yeah . We just used those .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact242	537.0	539.32	C	PhD	qy	-1	0	And do you splice them into the {pause} waveform ?
Bmr023.C.dialogueact243	539.43	539.64	C	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	Or {disfmarker} ?
Bmr023.D.dialogueact244	540.032	545.092	D	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah . He {disfmarker} then he d I recorded {disfmarker} Actually , I recorded one through ten three times at three different speeds and then he picked .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact245	541.293	542.123	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact246	543.612	543.892	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact247	545.602	550.865	D	PhD	s	-1	0	He liked the fastest one , so he just cut those out {vocalsound} and spliced them in between , uh , two beeps .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact249	551.032	553.412	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	It sounds like a radio announcer 's voice . Really .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact248	550.891	551.711	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	It will be funny
Bmr023.E.dialogueact250	551.931	552.151	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bmr023.A.dialogueact252	553.762	554.472	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact251	553.64	554.05	D	PhD	qh	-1	0	Does it ?
Bmr023.E.dialogueact253	554.847	560.857	E	PhD	s^ba^j^rt	-1	0	It will be funny when you 're really reading digits , and then there are the chunks with {disfmarker} with your {pause} digits in ?
Bmr023.D.dialogueact254	558.96	559.84	D	PhD	s^aa|s.%-	-1	0	Yeah . With my {disfmarker}
Bmr023.A.dialogueact256	561.351	562.831	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Oh that 's right .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact255	560.956	561.366	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , right .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact257	561.716	561.996	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact259	563.574	564.064	A	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	Now actually ,
Bmr023.D.dialogueact258	563.42	564.0	D	PhD	s	-1	0	That 'll throw them ,
Bmr023.A.dialogueact261	564.444	565.324	A	Postdoc	qy.%-	-1	0	we 're {disfmarker} Are we handling {disfmarker} ?
Bmr023.D.dialogueact260	564.0	564.16	D	PhD	qy^d^g	-1	0	huh ?
Bmr023.F.dialogueact262	564.503	567.993	F	Professor	s^cs^j	-1	0	Uh , maybe we should have you record A , B , C for those or something .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact263	570.405	570.925	D	PhD	s^am	-1	0	Yeah . {comment} Huh ! Maybe .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact264	571.055	577.035	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	And she said it wasn't gonna {disfmarker} the transcriber said it wouldn't be a problem cuz they can actually make a template , uh , that has beep , number , beep .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact266	577.175	578.785	D	PhD	s	-1	0	So for them it 'll be very quick
Bmr023.E.dialogueact265	577.09	577.46	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact268	579.245	581.857	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	to {disfmarker} to put those in there {vocalsound} when they 're transcribing .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact267	578.939	579.229	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact269	582.57	585.48	D	PhD	s^cc	+1	1	So , um , we {disfmarker} We 're gonna send them one more sample meeting ,
Bmr023.D.dialogueact270	585.76	587.82	D	PhD	s	+1	1	uh , and Thilo has run his segmentation .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact271	587.82	590.03	D	PhD	s	+1	1	Adam 's gonna generate the chunked file .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact272	590.575	593.445	D	PhD	s^cc	+1	1	And then , um , I 'll give it to Brian and they can try that out .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact273	593.545	599.635	D	PhD	s	+1	1	And when we get that back we 'll see if that sort of fixes the problem we had with , uh , too many beeps in the last transcription .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact274	600.165	604.795	F	Professor	s^bk|qy^rt	+1	1	OK . Do w do {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} Do you have any idea of the turn - around on {disfmarker} on those steps you just said ?
Bmr023.G.dialogueact275	600.582	600.952	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Great .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact277	605.65	608.229	D	PhD	h|qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Uh . Our s our {disfmarker} On our side ?

Bmr023.D.dialogueact291	632.227	632.567	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact292	635.992	636.392	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact293	636.309	643.69	F	Professor	s	+1	3	And so we don't sort of really know exactly what they 'll be doing , how long they 'll be doing it , and so forth ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact294	643.69	648.1	F	Professor	s^df	+1	4	because right now she has no choice but to operate in the mode that we already have working .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact295	648.087	648.437	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact296	648.29	649.14	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	And , uh ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact297	649.918	653.608	F	Professor	s^co	-1	0	so it 'd be {disfmarker} It 'd be good to sort of get that resolved , uh , soon as we could ,
Bmr023.D.dialogueact298	652.786	653.116	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact300	653.746	658.446	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} Yeah , I {disfmarker} I hope @ @ {comment} we can get a better estimate from this {pause} one that we send them .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact299	653.608	653.948	F	Professor	%-	-1	0	and then {disfmarker}
Bmr023.D.dialogueact302	659.2	661.057	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	So . Um .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact301	658.816	659.356	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact303	662.49	664.654	D	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I don't know yet how long that 'll take .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact304	663.749	664.669	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	Yeah . Um {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact305	665.621	673.241	F	Professor	s^cs	+1	3	I mean in particular I would {disfmarker} I would really hope that when we do this DARPA meeting in July that we sort of have {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} we 're into production mode , somehow {disfmarker}
Bmr023.D.dialogueact306	672.928	673.328	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact307	673.421	679.586	F	Professor	s	+1	3	You know , that we {disfmarker} we actually {vocalsound} have a stream going and we know how {disfmarker} how well it does and how {disfmarker} and how it operates .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact308	678.243	678.573	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact309	679.586	682.99	F	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	I think that would {disfmarker} that would certainly be a {disfmarker} a very good thing to know .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact310	683.143	684.003	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right . Right .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact311	685.336	685.466	F	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact312	687.22	687.79	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact313	690.322	697.158	F	Professor	s^cs^t^tc	-1	0	Maybe before we do the meeting info organize thing , maybe you could say relevant stuff about where we are in transcriptions .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact314	697.744	703.442	A	Postdoc	fg|s	+1	1	OK . So , um , we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , the transcribers have continued to work past what I 'm calling " set one " ,
Bmr023.A.dialogueact315	703.442	708.065	A	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	which was the s the set that I 've been , uh {disfmarker} OK , talking about up to this point ,
Bmr023.A.dialogueact316	708.065	711.855	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	but , uh , they 've gotten five meetings done in that set .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact317	712.135	713.865	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Right now they 're in the process of being edited .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact318	714.355	716.055	A	Postdoc	fh|%--	-1	0	Um , the , um {disfmarker}
Bmr023.A.dialogueact319	716.335	717.135	A	Postdoc	s^co	-1	0	Let 's see ,
Bmr023.A.dialogueact320	717.195	720.265	A	Postdoc	s	+1	3	I hired two transcribers today . I 'm thinking of hiring another one ,
Bmr023.A.dialogueact321	720.265	722.155	A	Postdoc	s^df^e	+1	3	which will {disfmarker} because we 've had a lot of attrition .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact322	722.737	724.617	A	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	And that will bring our total to {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact323	724.807	726.477	F	Professor	s^j	-1	0	They die off after they do this for a while .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact324	725.715	726.735	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact327	728.364	729.694	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	Well , you know , it 's {disfmarker} it 's various things .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact325	727.888	728.218	D	PhD	s^j	-1	0	Burn - out .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact326	728.347	728.657	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact328	729.694	733.814	A	Postdoc	s^df.%-	-1	0	So , one of them had a baby . Um , you know , one of them really w wasn't planning {disfmarker}
Bmr023.C.dialogueact329	732.736	735.076	C	PhD	s^j.%-	-1	0	Oh , that was an unfor unforeseen side effect of {disfmarker}
Bmr023.A.dialogueact330	738.173	741.023	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	Eh , one of them , um , had never planned to work past January .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact331	741.023	742.393	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean , it 's th all these various things ,
Bmr023.A.dialogueact332	742.393	745.613	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	cuz we , you know , we presented it as possibly a month project back in January
Bmr023.A.dialogueact333	745.613	748.003	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} Um ,
Bmr023.A.dialogueact334	748.183	748.843	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so it makes sense .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact335	748.843	752.94	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Uh , through attrition we {disfmarker} we 've {disfmarker} we 're down to {disfmarker} to two , but they 're really solid .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact336	752.94	754.44	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	We 're really lucky the two that we kept .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact337	754.7	760.97	A	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	And , um {disfmarker} Well , I don't mean {disfmarker} I don't mean anything against the others . {comment} What I mean is we 've got a good cause {disfmarker} a good core . No . We had a good core {disfmarker}
Bmr023.G.dialogueact338	758.579	762.309	G	PhD	s^j	-1	0	Well , they won't hear this since they 're going . They won't be transcribing this meeting .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact339	762.531	765.631	A	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	Yeah , but still . I mean , I d it 's just a matter of we {disfmarker} w we 're {disfmarker} we 've got , uh ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact340	765.405	766.045	F	Professor	s^j	-1	0	No backs .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact341	766.041	772.661	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	two of the ones who {disfmarker} who , um , ha had been putting in a lot of hours up to this point and they 're continuing to put in a {disfmarker} a lot of hours ,
Bmr023.A.dialogueact342	772.661	774.021	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	which is wonderful , and excellent work .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact343	774.527	780.797	A	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	And so , then , in addition , um , I hired two more today and I 'm planning to h hire a third one with this {disfmarker} within this coming week ,
Bmr023.A.dialogueact344	780.797	789.183	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but the plan is {disfmarker} just as , uh , Morgan was saying we discussed this , and the plan right now is to keep the staff on the {disfmarker} on the leaner side ,
Bmr023.A.dialogueact345	789.183	789.513	A	Postdoc	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	you know ,
Bmr023.A.dialogueact346	789.793	792.113	A	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	rather than hiring , like , eight to ten right now ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact347	790.142	790.872	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact348	792.453	800.662	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because if the IBM thing comes through really quickly , then , um , we wouldn't wanna have to , uh , you know , lay people off and stuff .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact349	800.662	800.972	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact350	801.719	805.479	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	And this way it 'll {disfmarker} I mean , I got really a lot of response for {disfmarker} for my notice
Bmr023.A.dialogueact351	805.479	808.679	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and I think I could hire additional people if I {pause} wish to .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact352	809.052	813.435	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Yeah . An - and the other thing is , I mean , in the unlikely event {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact353	813.435	816.575	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and since we 're so far from this , it 's a little hard to plan this way {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact354	816.575	823.01	F	Professor	s	-1	0	in the unlikely event that we actually find {vocalsound} that we have , uh , transcribers on staff who are twiddling their thumbs
Bmr023.F.dialogueact355	823.01	833.434	F	Professor	s	-1	0	because , you know , there 's , you know , {vocalsound} all the stuff that {disfmarker} that was sitting there has been transcribed and they 're {disfmarker} and they 're faster {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the pipeline is faster than {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , than the generation ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact356	834.096	834.696	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact357	834.876	841.966	F	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	eh , i in {disfmarker} in the day {disfmarker} e event that that day actually dawns , uh , I {disfmarker} I bet we could find some other stuff for them to do .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact359	842.104	842.694	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Oh , yes .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact358	841.966	848.74	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So I {disfmarker} I think {vocalsound} that , eh , eh , a as we were talking , if we {disfmarker} if we hire twelve , then we could , you know , run into a problem later .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact360	848.74	851.11	F	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , we also just couldn't sustain that forever .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact361	851.11	853.44	F	Professor	s	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but , um {disfmarker} for all sorts of reasons {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact362	853.44	862.636	F	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	but if we hire f you know , f we have five on staff {disfmarker} five or six on staff at any given time , then {vocalsound} it 's a small enough number so we can be flexible either way .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact363	863.454	863.634	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Good .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact364	864.014	864.214	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact365	864.564	864.674	F	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Good .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact366	865.559	871.359	G	PhD	s^cs^rt	-1	0	It 'd be great , too , if , um , we can {disfmarker} we might need some help again getting the tighter boundaries
Bmr023.G.dialogueact367	871.359	878.68	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	or some hand {disfmarker} to experiment with , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know , to have a ground truth for this segmentation work ,
Bmr023.G.dialogueact368	878.68	883.28	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	which {disfmarker} I guess you have some already that was really helpful , and we could probably use more .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact369	883.536	892.076	E	PhD	fg|s^na.%-	-1	0	Mmm , yeah . That was a thing I {disfmarker} I planned working on , is , uh , to use the {disfmarker} the transcriptions which are done by now , and to {disfmarker} to use them as , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr023.G.dialogueact370	884.388	884.718	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact371	891.491	892.371	G	PhD	s^2	-1	0	Oh , the new ones
Bmr023.E.dialogueact372	892.206	892.456	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact373	892.371	893.751	G	PhD	s^2^e	-1	0	with the tighter boundaries . Yeah .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact374	893.507	893.687	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact375	893.987	897.377	E	PhD	s	-1	0	And to use them for {disfmarker} for training a {disfmarker} or for {disfmarker} fo whatever . Yeah .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact376	897.507	900.957	E	PhD	s	-1	0	To {disfmarker} to create some speech - nonspeech labels out of them ,
Bmr023.E.dialogueact377	901.507	907.127	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} Yeah , but that {disfmarker} that 's a thing w was {disfmarker} w what I 'm just looking into .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact378	907.461	907.741	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact379	908.72	912.17	A	Postdoc	s^ba^tc	+1	2	The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the pre - segmentations are so much {disfmarker} are s so extremely helpful .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact380	912.37	913.71	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	Now there was , uh , I g guess {disfmarker}
Bmr023.A.dialogueact381	913.71	919.68	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So , a couple weeks ago I needed some new ones and it happened to be during the time that he was on vacation {disfmarker}
Bmr023.A.dialogueact382	919.92	921.75	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	f for just very few days you were away .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact384	921.75	923.43	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But it happened to be during that time I needed one ,
Bmr023.E.dialogueact383	921.597	921.837	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact385	923.43	927.69	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so I started them on the non - pre - segmented and then switched them over to yours
Bmr023.A.dialogueact386	927.69	931.84	A	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	and , um , they , um {disfmarker} you know , they always appreciate that when they have that available .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact387	931.84	935.002	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And he 's , uh , usually , eh , uh , um {disfmarker} Um .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact388	935.322	936.232	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So they really appreciate it .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact389	936.232	938.552	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But I was gonna say that they do adjust it once in a while .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact390	938.622	940.132	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	You know , once in a while there 's something like ,
Bmr023.E.dialogueact391	939.171	939.571	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , sure .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact392	940.542	942.612	A	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	um , and e Actually you talked to them .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact393	942.612	942.902	A	Postdoc	qy^g	-1	0	Didn't you ?
Bmr023.A.dialogueact394	942.902	943.622	A	Postdoc	qy.%-	-1	0	Did you ? Have you {disfmarker} ?
Bmr023.E.dialogueact395	943.385	943.545	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact396	943.705	944.705	E	PhD	s^na	-1	0	I talked to Helen .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact397	945.435	946.775	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and she was {disfmarker}
Bmr023.A.dialogueact398	947.315	949.325	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And so , I asked her {disfmarker}
Bmr023.A.dialogueact399	949.325	950.545	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean , They 're very perceptive .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact400	950.545	952.765	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I really want to have this meeting of the transcribers .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact401	952.765	954.765	A	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	I haven't done it yet , but I wanna do that
Bmr023.A.dialogueact402	954.765	958.565	A	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	and she 's out of town , um , for a couple of weeks , but I wanna do that when she returns .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact403	959.035	966.585	A	Postdoc	fh|s^df	-1	0	Um , cuz she was saying , you know , in a {disfmarker} in a span of very short period {disfmarker} we asked {disfmarker} It seems like the ones that need to be adjusted are these {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} these things ,
Bmr023.A.dialogueact404	966.585	969.355	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and she was saying the short utterances , uh , the , um {disfmarker}
Bmr023.G.dialogueact405	966.933	967.443	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact406	967.469	967.739	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact407	968.811	969.011	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact408	969.805	971.385	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know , I mean , you 're {disfmarker} You 're aware of this .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact410	971.685	976.705	A	Postdoc	s^ba	+1	2	But {disfmarker} but actually i it 's so correct for so much of the time , that it 's an enormous time saver
Bmr023.E.dialogueact409	971.424	971.814	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact411	977.035	978.795	A	Postdoc	s	+1	2	and it just gets tweaked a little around the boundaries .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact413	979.255	979.575	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact412	979.117	979.677	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That 's great .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact414	980.342	982.832	A	Postdoc	fh|s^cs	-1	0	Um . Yeah . I think it 'd be interesting to combine these .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact415	982.837	983.017	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact416	984.352	987.542	G	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Is there actually a record of where they change ?
Bmr023.G.dialogueact417	987.542	989.542	G	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	I mean , you can compare , do a diff on the {disfmarker}
Bmr023.G.dialogueact418	989.732	991.932	G	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	just so that we {vocalsound} knew {disfmarker}
Bmr023.A.dialogueact419	991.015	991.535	A	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	You could do it .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact420	991.535	996.133	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} it 's complicated in that {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} hhh , i hhh , i
Bmr023.E.dialogueact421	991.789	992.109	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact422	995.099	1001.46	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Actually , when {disfmarker} when they create new {disfmarker} yeah , new segments or something , it will be , uh , not that easy
Bmr023.E.dialogueact423	1001.46	1003.87	E	PhD	s^na	-1	0	but {disfmarker} hmm . I think {pause} one could do that .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact424	1002.25	1004.91	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	I mean , if we keep a old copy of the old time marks
Bmr023.E.dialogueact425	1004.66	1004.83	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact426	1004.91	1008.17	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	just so that if we run it we know whether we 're {disfmarker} which ones were cheating
Bmr023.E.dialogueact427	1005.82	1006.0	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact428	1007.24	1007.36	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact430	1008.22	1009.65	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That would be great , yeah , to know that .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact429	1008.17	1008.38	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	and
Bmr023.A.dialogueact431	1008.73	1015.64	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	There is a {disfmarker} there is one problem with that and that is when they start part way through then what I do is I merge what they 've done with the pre - segmented version .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact432	1009.1	1010.1	G	PhD	s	-1	0	which one would be good .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact433	1010.04	1010.17	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact434	1015.64	1018.8	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So it 's not a pure {disfmarker} it 's not a pure condition .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact435	1018.8	1023.12	A	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	2	Wha - what you 'd really like is that they started with pre - segmented and were pre - segmented all the way through .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact436	1019.53	1019.95	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact437	1023.78	1027.05	A	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	And , um {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} {disfmarker} I , uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}
Bmr023.A.dialogueact438	1027.74	1029.83	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it wasn't possible for about four of the recent ones .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact439	1030.38	1031.65	A	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	But , it will be possible in the future
Bmr023.E.dialogueact440	1030.39	1030.79	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact441	1031.65	1032.59	A	Postdoc	s^df.%--	-1	0	because we {disfmarker} we 're , um .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact443	1033.83	1034.08	E	PhD	s^na	-1	0	It would .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact442	1033.75	1034.33	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Mmm , that 's great .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact444	1034.58	1034.81	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact445	1034.91	1045.89	G	PhD	s^cs	+1	2	Yeah . As long as we have a record , I guess , of the original {pause} automatic one , we can always find out how well {pause} we would do fr from the recognition side by using those boundaries .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact446	1036.37	1036.53	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact447	1041.16	1041.36	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact448	1047.02	1047.39	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact450	1048.23	1048.43	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact449	1048.09	1049.93	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	You know , a completely non - cheating version .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact451	1049.91	1050.11	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact452	1050.35	1054.21	G	PhD	s^cc.%--	-1	0	Also if you need someone to record this meeting , I mean , I 'm happy to {disfmarker} for the transcribers {disfmarker}
Bmr023.G.dialogueact453	1055.14	1056.98	G	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	I could do it , or Chuck or Adam .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact454	1057.45	1057.65	A	Postdoc	s^ft.%	-1	0	Thank you .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact455	1061.44	1061.81	F	Professor	fg	-1	0	OK .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact456	1063.31	1067.98	F	Professor	fh|qy^bu^rt^t^tc	-1	0	So , uh , u you were saying something about organizing the meeting info ?
Bmr023.D.dialogueact457	1068.03	1077.59	D	PhD	s^aa|s.%-	+1	3	Yeah . So , um , uh , Jane and Adam and I had a meeting where we talked about the reorganization of the {pause} directory structure for all of the meeting {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact458	1077.13	1077.75	F	Professor	qy^j^rt	-1	0	Did you record it ?
Bmr023.D.dialogueact459	1078.54	1078.73	D	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact460	1080.32	1081.48	D	PhD	s^e	+1	3	For all the Meeting Recorder data .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact461	1081.54	1081.89	D	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	We should have .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact462	1082.51	1086.4	D	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	Um . And so we 've got a plan for what we 're gonna do there .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact463	1086.4	1097.78	D	PhD	s	+1	1	And then , Jane also s prepared a {disfmarker} um , started getting all of the {disfmarker} the meetings organized , so she prepared a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a spreadsheet , which I spent the last couple of days adding to .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact464	1098.29	1102.94	D	PhD	s	-1	0	So I went through all of the data that we have collected so far , and have
Bmr023.D.dialogueact465	1102.94	1115.56	D	PhD	s	+1	1	been putting it into , uh , a spreadsheet {vocalsound} with start time , the date , the old meeting name , the new meeting name , the number of speakers , the duration of the meeting , comments , you know , what its transcription status is , all that kind of stuff .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact466	1115.94	1122.5	D	PhD	s^df	+1	0	And so , the idea is that we can take this and then export it as HTML and put it on the Meeting Recorder web page
Bmr023.D.dialogueact468	1122.5	1124.92	D	PhD	s^df	+1	1	so we can keep people updated about what 's going on .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact467	1122.29	1122.97	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Oh , great .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact469	1125.49	1127.52	D	PhD	fh|s^cc	-1	0	Um , I 've gotta get some more information from Jane
Bmr023.D.dialogueact470	1127.52	1131.26	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	cuz I have some {disfmarker} some gaps here that I need to get her to fill in ,
Bmr023.D.dialogueact471	1131.26	1143.53	D	PhD	s	+1	1	but {vocalsound} so far , um , {vocalsound} as of Monday , the fourteenth , um , we 've had a total number of meeting sixty - two hours of meetings that we have collected .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact472	1144.02	1145.07	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	And , um {disfmarker}
Bmr023.D.dialogueact473	1146.06	1149.53	D	PhD	s	+1	1	Uh , some other interesting things , average number of speakers per meeting is six .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact474	1151.02	1151.52	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bmr023.D.dialogueact475	1152.13	1155.49	D	PhD	s^cc	+1	1	and I 'm gonna have on here the total amount that 's been transcribed so far ,
Bmr023.D.dialogueact476	1155.49	1156.39	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but I 've got a bunch of {disfmarker}
Bmr023.D.dialogueact477	1156.64	1161.6	D	PhD	s	-1	0	uh , that 's what I have to talk to Jane about , figuring out exactly which ones have {disfmarker} have been completed and so forth .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact478	1162.1	1171.05	D	PhD	s	-1	0	But , um , {vocalsound} this 'll be a nice thing that we can put up on the {disfmarker} the web site and people can {vocalsound} be informed of the status of various different ones .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact479	1171.05	1179.06	D	PhD	s	+1	1	And {vocalsound} it 'll also list , uh , like under the status , if it 's at IBM or if it 's at ICSI , uh , or if it 's completed or which ones we 're excluding
Bmr023.D.dialogueact480	1179.06	1184.6	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and there 's a place for comments , so we can , {vocalsound} um , say why we 're excluding things and so forth .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact481	1184.81	1185.14	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact482	1184.88	1189.51	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Now would the ones that , um , are already transcribed {disfmarker} we h we have enough there that c
Bmr023.F.dialogueact483	1189.72	1192.04	F	Professor	s	-1	0	you know , we 've already done some studies and so forth
Bmr023.F.dialogueact484	1192.05	1192.23	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact485	1193.01	1205.91	F	Professor	fh|qy^cs	-1	0	um , shouldn't we go through and do the business - es u of {disfmarker} of having the , um , uh , participants approve it , uh , for {disfmarker} approve the transcriptions for distribution and so forth ?
Bmr023.A.dialogueact486	1206.46	1207.53	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Um , interesting idea .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact487	1207.53	1212.48	A	Postdoc	s^aap	-1	0	In principle , I {disfmarker} I would say yes , although I still am doing some {disfmarker} the final - pass editing ,
Bmr023.A.dialogueact488	1212.69	1216.83	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	trying to convert it over to the master file as the {disfmarker} being the channelized version
Bmr023.A.dialogueact489	1216.83	1221.68	A	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	and it 's {disfmarker} Yeah , it seems like I get into that a certain way and then something else intervenes {comment} and I have to stop .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact490	1222.02	1225.62	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Cleaning up the things like the , uh , uh , places where the transcriber was uncertain ,
Bmr023.A.dialogueact491	1225.62	1228.08	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and doing spot - checking here and there .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact492	1228.44	1233.69	A	Postdoc	fh|s^cs	-1	0	So , um , uh , I guess it would make sense to wait until th that 's done ,
Bmr023.A.dialogueact493	1234.12	1235.18	A	Postdoc	fh|%-	-1	0	um , but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact494	1234.54	1240.75	F	Professor	s^co	+1	1	Well , le let me put in another sort of a milestone kind of {disfmarker} as {disfmarker} as I did with the , uh , uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the pipeline .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact495	1236.52	1236.84	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact496	1241.31	1244.91	F	Professor	fh|s	+1	2	Um , we are gonna have this DARPA {pause} meeting in the middle of July ,
Bmr023.A.dialogueact498	1244.98	1245.32	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact497	1244.91	1246.15	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and I think it w it 'd be {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact499	1246.78	1254.71	F	Professor	s	+1	2	given that we 've been {disfmarker} we 've given a couple public talks about it already , spaced by months and months , I think it 'd be pretty bad if we continued to say none of this is available .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact500	1255.42	1256.03	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact501	1256.34	1257.95	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It 'll certainly be done by then . Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact502	1257.47	1262.78	F	Professor	fg|s^cs:s	+1	2	Right . So we can s we {disfmarker} we wanna be able to say " here is a subset that is available right now "
Bmr023.A.dialogueact503	1262.28	1262.43	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact504	1262.93	1263.31	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	That 's right .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact505	1263.37	1265.65	F	Professor	s^e	+1	2	and that 's has been through the legal issues and so forth .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact506	1263.93	1264.29	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	That 's right .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact507	1265.88	1266.29	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact508	1266.39	1267.42	A	Postdoc	s^aa|%-	-1	0	Yeah . That 's right . So that {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact509	1267.1	1267.37	F	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	OK ?
Bmr023.A.dialogueact510	1268.0	1268.36	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact511	1269.28	1270.99	F	Professor	fh|s^e	-1	0	So , by {disfmarker} before July .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact512	1269.81	1277.26	C	PhD	s	+1	2	And they don't have to approve , you know , th an edited version , they can just give their approval to whatever version
Bmr023.A.dialogueact513	1276.68	1277.07	A	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	Well , maybe {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact514	1277.11	1284.64	F	Professor	s^aap.%-	+1	2	Well , in principle , yes . But , I mean , i if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if somebody actually did get into some legal issue with it then we
Bmr023.C.dialogueact515	1283.7	1283.97	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	Bu
Bmr023.C.dialogueact516	1284.44	1289.14	C	PhD	s^arp	+1	2	Yeah . But th I mean , the editing will continue . Presumably if {disfmarker} if s errors are found , they will be fixed ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact517	1289.69	1292.97	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	but they won't change the {disfmarker} the content of the meetings .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact518	1291.1	1291.93	D	PhD	s^2	-1	0	Content , really .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact519	1292.94	1295.53	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Well , see , this is the {disfmarker} this is the issue . Subtleties .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact520	1293.32	1293.75	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact521	1293.62	1301.22	G	PhD	qh	-1	0	Well , i if Jane is clarifying question question , then , you know , how can they agree to it before they know her final version ?
Bmr023.A.dialogueact522	1301.49	1308.26	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	The other thing , too , is there can be subtleties where a person uses this word instead of that word , which @ @ {comment} could 've been transcribed in the other way .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact523	1302.07	1302.42	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact524	1302.3	1302.65	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	Thing {disfmarker}
Bmr023.A.dialogueact525	1308.95	1313.64	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And no and they wouldn't have {vocalsound} been slanderous if it had been this other word .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact526	1313.64	1314.03	A	Postdoc	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	You know ?
Bmr023.F.dialogueact527	1314.27	1318.03	F	Professor	s^na	+1	2	I it {disfmarker} you know , there there is a point at which I agree it becomes ridiculous
Bmr023.F.dialogueact528	1318.03	1323.84	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because , you know , you could do this final thing and then a year from now somebody could say , you know , that should be a period and not a question mark .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact529	1323.84	1324.11	F	Professor	qh^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr023.F.dialogueact530	1324.64	1330.47	F	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	And you don't {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} there 's no way that we 're gonna go back and ask everybody " do you approve this , uh , you know {disfmarker} this document now ? "
Bmr023.F.dialogueact531	1330.47	1330.74	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact532	1331.28	1344.44	F	Professor	s:s^co	-1	0	So I think what it is is that the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the thing that they sign {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I haven't looked at it in a while , but it has to be open enough that it sort of says " OK , from now on {disfmarker} you know , now that I 've read this , you can use {disfmarker} do anything you want with these data . "
Bmr023.A.dialogueact533	1344.91	1345.23	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact534	1345.29	1347.3	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And , uh {disfmarker} But , i I think we wanna {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact535	1347.3	1361.5	F	Professor	s^cs.%-	-1	0	So , assuming that it 's in that kind of wording , which I don't remember , {vocalsound} um , I think i we just wanna have enough confidence ourselves that it 's so close to the final form it 's gonna be in , a year from now that they 're {disfmarker}
Bmr023.A.dialogueact536	1360.04	1360.29	A	Postdoc	s^aa^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact537	1360.52	1360.89	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	I agree .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact538	1361.67	1362.4	A	Postdoc	s^aa^r	-1	0	Mmm . I totally agree .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact540	1362.71	1376.83	A	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	It 's just , uh , a question of , {vocalsound} uh , if {disfmarker} if the person is using the transcript as the way of them judging what they said and whether it was slanderous , {vocalsound} then it seems like it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} i it needs to be more correct than if we could count on them re - listening to the meeting .

Bmr023.F.dialogueact545	1383.97	1390.76	F	Professor	s	-1	0	but I remember my taking the position {vocalsound} of not making it so {disfmarker} so easy for everybody to observe everything
Bmr023.F.dialogueact546	1390.76	1397.85	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and Adam was taking the position of {disfmarker} of having it be really straightforward for people to check every aspect of it including the audio .

Bmr023.F.dialogueact556	1414.36	1416.74	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	that would give you access to the transcript and the audio .

Bmr023.G.dialogueact561	1420.0	1427.25	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	I mean , with the web interface it 's interesting , because you could allow the person who signs to be informed when their transcript changes ,
Bmr023.G.dialogueact562	1427.98	1428.8	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	or something like that .

Bmr023.G.dialogueact570	1455.32	1462.59	G	PhD	fg|s^cs	-1	0	Anyway . I mean , I agree that at some point people {vocalsound} probably won't care about typos but they would care about significant meaning changes
Bmr023.G.dialogueact571	1462.6	1467.51	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	and then they could be asked for their consent , I guess , if {disfmarker} if those change .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact572	1467.51	1473.3	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Cuz assumi {vocalsound} assuming we {disfmarker} we don't really distribute things that have any significant changes from what they sign anyway .

Bmr023.F.dialogueact601	1494.79	1500.42	F	Professor	fg|s^df	-1	0	anyway , haven't we {disfmarker} we 've gone down this path a number of times . I know this can lead to extended conversations and {disfmarker} and not really get anywhere ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact602	1500.42	1507.39	F	Professor	s^co	+1	2	so let {disfmarker} let me just suggest that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , off - line that , uh , the people involved figure it out and take care of it before it 's July .
Bmr023.A.dialogueact603	1507.53	1507.96	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact604	1507.85	1513.32	F	Professor	s^bk|s^df:s	-1	0	OK . So {disfmarker} so that in July we can tell people {vocalsound} " yes , we have this and you can use it " .

Bmr023.F.dialogueact609	1519.21	1519.89	F	Professor	s^co^t^tc	-1	0	So , let 's see .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact610	1519.89	1520.69	F	Professor	qo^t^tc	-1	0	What else we got ?
Bmr023.F.dialogueact611	1522.02	1526.46	F	Professor	fh|s^rt	-1	0	Uh . Don did {disfmarker} did a report about his project in class
Bmr023.F.dialogueact612	1526.46	1529.15	F	Professor	fh|s^e	-1	0	and , uh {disfmarker} an oral and written {disfmarker} written version .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact613	1528.39	1528.56	G	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Well .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact614	1529.15	1531.46	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	So that was stuff he was doing with you .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact616	1532.69	1532.84	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact615	1532.34	1534.94	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , it 's {disfmarker} I guess one thing we 're learning is that the amount {disfmarker}
Bmr023.G.dialogueact617	1534.94	1537.05	G	PhD	s	-1	0	We have eight meetings there
Bmr023.G.dialogueact618	1537.05	1539.94	G	PhD	s^df	+1	1	because we couldn't use the non - native {disfmarker} all non - native meetings
Bmr023.G.dialogueact619	1539.94	1546.28	G	PhD	s	+1	1	and {vocalsound} it 's , well , probably below threshold on enough data for us for the things we 're looking at
Bmr023.G.dialogueact620	1546.29	1551.94	G	PhD	s^df	+1	4	because the {vocalsound} prosodic features are {pause} very noisy and so you {disfmarker} you need a lot of data in order to model them .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact621	1552.44	1554.15	G	PhD	s	+1	3	Um , so we 're starting to see some patterns
Bmr023.G.dialogueact622	1554.15	1560.8	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and we 're hoping that maybe with , {vocalsound} I don't know , double or triple the data {disfmarker} with twenty meetings or so , that we would start to get better results .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact623	1560.8	1582.71	G	PhD	s	+1	3	But we did find that some of the features that , I gue Jane would know about , that are expressing sort of the {vocalsound} distance of , um , {vocalsound} boundaries from peaks in the utterance and {vocalsound} some {pause} local , um , range {disfmarker} pitch range effects , like how close people are to their floor , are showing up in these classifiers ,
Bmr023.G.dialogueact624	1583.28	1587.68	G	PhD	s^e	+1	1	which are also being given some word features that are cheating , cuz they 're true words .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact625	1588.02	1590.11	G	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	Um , so these are based on forced alignment .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact626	1590.53	1593.0	G	PhD	s	-1	0	Word features like , um , word frequency
Bmr023.G.dialogueact627	1593.55	1595.83	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and whether or not something 's a backchannel and so forth .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact628	1596.69	1600.34	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	So , we 're starting to see , I think , some interesting patterns .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact629	1599.1	1603.2	F	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	So the dominant features , including everything , were those {disfmarker} those quasi - cheating things .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact630	1603.2	1603.45	F	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr023.F.dialogueact631	1603.6	1604.27	F	Professor	s^e.%-	-1	0	Where these are {disfmarker}
Bmr023.B.dialogueact632	1604.25	1605.19	B	Grad	s^arp^rt	-1	0	Sometimes not .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact633	1604.45	1607.21	G	PhD	s^am	-1	0	I think it depends what you 're looking at , a actually .
Bmr023.B.dialogueact634	1606.71	1612.4	B	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah . Sometimes {pause} positions in sentences obviously , or in spurts , was helpful .
Bmr023.B.dialogueact636	1612.48	1613.86	B	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I don't know if that 's cheating , too .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact635	1612.09	1612.51	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact637	1614.71	1615.24	G	PhD	h	-1	0	Um ,

Bmr023.C.dialogueact639	1616.09	1616.31	C	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr023.G.dialogueact640	1616.15	1619.29	G	PhD	s^na	+1	1	spurts is not cheating except that of course you know the real words ,
Bmr023.B.dialogueact642	1619.35	1619.73	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact641	1619.29	1623.39	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	but roughly speaking , the recognized words are gonna give you a similar type of position .
Bmr023.B.dialogueact643	1623.36	1625.9	B	Grad	fg|qy^bu^rt	-1	0	Right . Would they give you the same number of words , though ?
Bmr023.F.dialogueact645	1623.74	1624.19	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact644	1623.52	1624.6	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	It 's either early or late .

Bmr023.C.dialogueact653	1631.7	1634.4	C	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Have you tried using just time , as opposed to number of words ?

Bmr023.B.dialogueact668	1645.77	1648.37	B	Grad	s^e	+1	1	Like , there 's a lot of different features you could just pull out .

Bmr023.C.dialogueact670	1647.62	1651.82	C	PhD	s	+1	1	I mean that wouldn't be cheating because you can detect pause {pause} pretty well within the time .

Bmr023.G.dialogueact677	1654.45	1656.86	G	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	Yeah . That 's actually why I didn't use it at first .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact679	1656.28	1656.44	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact681	1657.06	1657.67	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact680	1656.86	1658.69	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But we {disfmarker} one of the interesting things was
Bmr023.G.dialogueact682	1659.63	1662.39	G	PhD	qy^bu^rt	+1	1	I guess you reported on some te punctuation type {disfmarker}
Bmr023.B.dialogueact684	1662.7	1663.04	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact683	1662.65	1665.88	G	PhD	s^e	+1	1	finding sentence boundaries , finding disfluency boundaries ,
Bmr023.G.dialogueact685	1665.88	1673.05	G	PhD	s	+1	1	and then I had done some work on finding from the foreground speech whether or not someone was likely to interrupt ,
Bmr023.G.dialogueact686	1673.05	1682.26	G	PhD	s^e:qy	+1	1	so where {disfmarker} you know , if I 'm talking now and someone {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and Andreas is about to interrupt me , is he gonna choose a certain place in my speech , either prosodically or word - based .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact687	1682.68	1685.79	G	PhD	s	+1	2	And there the prosodic features actually showed up
Bmr023.G.dialogueact688	1686.43	1688.68	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and a neat thing {disfmarker}
Bmr023.G.dialogueact689	1688.68	1690.58	G	PhD	s^e	+1	1	even though the word features were available .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact690	1691.18	1694.81	G	PhD	s^r.%--	+1	1	And a neat thing there too is I tried some {disfmarker} {vocalsound} putting the speaker {disfmarker}
Bmr023.G.dialogueact691	1694.82	1698.35	G	PhD	s	+1	1	So , I gave everybody {vocalsound} a short version of their name .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact692	1698.35	1699.49	G	PhD	s	-1	0	So the real names are in there ,
Bmr023.G.dialogueact693	1699.49	1700.41	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which we couldn't use .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact694	1700.98	1702.88	G	PhD	fh|s^cs	-1	0	Uh , we should use I Ds or something .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact695	1703.68	1704.89	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	And those don't show up .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact696	1705.14	1711.59	G	PhD	s^bs	+1	1	So that means that overall , um , it wasn't just modeling Morgan , or it wasn't just modeling a single person ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact697	1711.75	1712.05	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact698	1712.33	1712.83	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bmr023.G.dialogueact699	1714.39	1718.79	G	PhD	s	-1	0	but was sort of trying to , {vocalsound} uh , get a general idea {disfmarker}
Bmr023.G.dialogueact700	1718.83	1723.95	G	PhD	s	-1	0	the model {disfmarker} the tree classifier was trying to find general locations that were applicable to different speakers ,
Bmr023.G.dialogueact701	1723.95	1726.18	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	even though there are huge speaker effects .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact702	1726.18	1726.46	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact703	1727.25	1738.82	G	PhD	s^co	-1	0	The {disfmarker} but the main limitation now is I {disfmarker} because we 're only looking at things that happen every {vocalsound} ten words or every twenty words , we need more {disfmarker} more data and more data per speaker .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact704	1740.02	1740.57	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact705	1741.22	1743.61	G	PhD	s^ba^cs	-1	0	It 'd also be interesting to look at the EDU meetings
Bmr023.G.dialogueact706	1743.61	1747.39	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because we did include meeting type as a feature ,
Bmr023.G.dialogueact707	1747.39	1747.73	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	so
Bmr023.G.dialogueact708	1748.42	1754.79	G	PhD	s	-1	0	whether you were in a r Meeting Recorder meeting or a Robustness meeting did matter {vocalsound} to {pause} interrupts
Bmr023.G.dialogueact709	1754.79	1757.59	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because there are just fewer interrupts in the Robustness meetings .
Bmr023.B.dialogueact710	1757.24	1757.72	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact711	1758.01	1762.98	G	PhD	s	-1	0	And so the classifier learns more about Morgan than it does about sort of the average person ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact712	1760.89	1761.19	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact713	1762.98	1764.4	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	which is {vocalsound} not bad .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact714	1764.56	1767.65	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	It 'd probably do better than {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um , but it wasn't generalizing .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact716	1768.07	1768.41	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact715	1767.97	1768.35	G	PhD	%--	-1	0	So it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr023.G.dialogueact717	1768.97	1774.41	G	PhD	s	-1	0	And I think Don , um {disfmarker} Well , we have a long list of things he 's starting to look at now over the summer ,
Bmr023.G.dialogueact718	1774.41	1774.99	G	PhD	%--	-1	0	where we can {disfmarker}
Bmr023.G.dialogueact719	1775.9	1778.56	G	PhD	s	-1	0	And he 'll be able to report on more things {pause} in the future .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact720	1778.56	1787.95	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	But it was great that we could at least go from the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know , Jane 's transcripts and the , {vocalsound} uh , recognizer output and get it {pause} to this point .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact721	1787.95	1792.3	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	And I think it 's something Mari can probably use in her preliminary report {disfmarker}
Bmr023.G.dialogueact722	1792.3	1795.69	G	PhD	s:s	-1	0	like , " yeah , we 're at the point where we 're training these classifiers
Bmr023.G.dialogueact723	1795.69	1804.47	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and we 're just {vocalsound} reporting very preliminary but suggestive results that {vocalsound} some features , both word and pro prosodic , work . "
Bmr023.G.dialogueact724	1805.3	1809.6	G	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	The other thing that was interesting to me is that the pitch features are better than in Switchboard .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact725	1810.23	1812.8	G	PhD	s	+1	1	And I think that really is from the close - talking mikes ,
Bmr023.G.dialogueact726	1812.8	1821.53	G	PhD	s^df	+1	1	cuz the pitch processing that was done has much cleaner behavior than {disfmarker} than the Switchboard telephone bandwidth .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact727	1820.15	1821.28	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	W wh wh wh
Bmr023.C.dialogueact728	1821.28	1822.13	C	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Better in what sense ?
Bmr023.G.dialogueact729	1822.83	1830.9	G	PhD	h|s^ba	+1	1	Um . Well , first of all , the pitch tracks are m have less , um , halvings and doublings than {disfmarker} than Switchboard
Bmr023.G.dialogueact730	1830.9	1832.37	G	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	and there 's a lot less dropout ,
Bmr023.G.dialogueact731	1832.43	1842.47	G	PhD	s	+1	1	so if you ask how many regions where you would normally expect some vowels to be occurring {vocalsound} are completely devoid of pitch information ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact732	1839.35	1840.14	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact733	1839.44	1839.94	F	Professor	b	-1	0	
Bmr023.G.dialogueact734	1842.47	1847.54	G	PhD	s	+1	1	in other words the pitch tracker just didn't get a high enough probability of voicing for words {disfmarker}
Bmr023.G.dialogueact735	1847.64	1849.43	G	PhD	s^e.%--	-1	0	for {disfmarker} for , you know , five word
Bmr023.F.dialogueact736	1848.41	1848.84	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact737	1849.49	1851.08	G	PhD	s	-1	0	there are much fewer than in Switchboard .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact738	1851.08	1855.35	G	PhD	s	-1	0	So the missing {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We had a big missing data problem in Switchboard
Bmr023.G.dialogueact739	1856.18	1858.55	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and , so the features weren't as reliable
Bmr023.G.dialogueact740	1858.55	1860.22	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	cuz they were often just not available .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact742	1860.64	1864.39	D	PhD	qy^rt	+1	1	Could it have to do with the {disfmarker} the lower frequency cut - off on the Switchboard ?
Bmr023.G.dialogueact741	1860.51	1861.38	G	PhD	s	-1	0	So that 's actually good .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact743	1864.59	1868.31	G	PhD	s^am|s	+1	1	Ma - maybe . I mean , the tele we had telephone bandwidth for Switchboard
Bmr023.G.dialogueact744	1868.71	1876.38	G	PhD	s	+1	1	and we had the an annoying sort of telephone handset movement problem that I think may also affect it .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact745	1876.47	1876.87	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact746	1877.09	1880.41	G	PhD	s^ba	+1	1	So we 're just getting better signals in {disfmarker} in this data .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact747	1881.78	1882.69	G	PhD	s	-1	0	Which is nice .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact748	1883.72	1883.87	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact749	1885.59	1885.85	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact750	1885.63	1887.46	G	PhD	s^tc|s^ba	-1	0	Anyway , Don 's been doing a great job
Bmr023.G.dialogueact751	1887.46	1893.98	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and we hope to continue with , um , Andreas 's help and also some of Thilo 's help on this ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact752	1888.57	1888.86	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Great .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact754	1894.51	1894.88	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	Y
Bmr023.G.dialogueact753	1894.24	1897.14	G	PhD	s^e	+1	1	to {disfmarker} to try to get a non - cheating version of how all this would work .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact755	1895.7	1896.32	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah . Sure .
Bmr023.E.dialogueact756	1897.04	1897.12	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact757	1900.65	1917.46	F	Professor	qy.%--	+1	3	Has {disfmarker} has , uh {disfmarker} ? We just {disfmarker} I think , just talked about this the other day , but h has {disfmarker} has anybody had a chance to try changing , uh , insertion penalty sort of things with the {disfmarker} with the , uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , using the tandem system input for the {disfmarker} ?
Bmr023.C.dialogueact758	1916.55	1917.88	C	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	Oh , yeah . I tried that .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact759	1917.88	1922.19	C	PhD	s	-1	0	It didn't , um , help dramatically .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact761	1925.37	1925.67	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	The {disfmarker}
Bmr023.D.dialogueact760	1924.88	1925.67	D	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Were they out of balance ?
Bmr023.D.dialogueact762	1925.66	1926.78	D	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I didn't {disfmarker} I didn't notice .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact763	1928.11	1929.23	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	There were a little {disfmarker}
Bmr023.C.dialogueact764	1929.23	1931.88	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	the relative number of {disfmarker}
Bmr023.C.dialogueact765	1933.45	1935.73	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I think there were a higher number of deletions , actually .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact766	1935.93	1936.11	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact768	1936.76	1943.7	C	PhD	s	-1	0	So , you , uh {disfmarker} So , actually it {disfmarker} it preferred to have a positive {disfmarker} er , negative insertion penalty ,
Bmr023.G.dialogueact767	1936.75	1937.46	G	PhD	qy^br^rt	-1	0	Deletions ?
Bmr023.C.dialogueact769	1943.7	1945.93	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	which means {vocalsound} that , um {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact770	1943.88	1944.29	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact771	1946.14	1949.46	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But , you know , it didn't change {vocalsound} th the {disfmarker}
Bmr023.C.dialogueact772	1949.46	1952.81	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	by adjusting that {disfmarker} the , um {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact773	1952.0	1952.34	F	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact774	1954.85	1957.01	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Yeah . The error changed by probably one percent or so .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact775	1957.01	1960.11	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	But , you know , given that that word error rate is so high , that 's not a {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact776	1957.5	1958.36	F	Professor	s^bk|%-	-1	0	OK . So that {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact777	1959.15	1960.56	F	Professor	s^2	-1	0	So that 's {disfmarker} So that 's not the problem .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact778	1960.45	1961.27	C	PhD	s^m^na	-1	0	That 's not the problem .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact780	1961.27	1961.49	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	No .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact779	1960.82	1960.99	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact781	1961.95	1963.7	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But , uh , we s just , um ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact782	1964.81	1965.54	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bmr023.C.dialogueact783	1966.34	1978.7	C	PhD	s	+1	2	you know , Chuck and I talked and the {pause} @ @ {comment} next thing to do is probably to tune the {disfmarker} um , the size of the Gaussian system , um , @ @ {comment} to {disfmarker} to this {disfmarker} to this feature vector , which we haven't done at all .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact784	1978.7	1983.97	C	PhD	s	+1	2	We just used the same {vocalsound} configuration as we used for the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} for the standard system .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact785	1982.53	1982.97	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact786	1983.97	1993.07	C	PhD	s	+1	2	And , {vocalsound} for instance , uh , Dan {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} Dan just sent me a message saying that CMU used , um , {vocalsound} something like ten Gaussians per cluster {disfmarker}
Bmr023.C.dialogueact787	1994.35	1997.35	C	PhD	s	+1	2	You know , each {disfmarker} each mixture has ten {pause} Gaussians
Bmr023.D.dialogueact788	1996.5	1997.01	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact789	1997.22	1998.43	D	PhD	s^bu	+1	2	Hmm . We 're using sixty - four ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact790	1997.94	1999.48	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and we 're using sixty - four ,
Bmr023.D.dialogueact791	1998.43	1998.66	D	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr023.C.dialogueact792	1999.49	2001.64	C	PhD	s	+1	2	so that 's {vocalsound} obviously a big difference
Bmr023.D.dialogueact793	1999.74	2000.05	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact794	2001.64	2002.76	C	PhD	s^am	-1	0	and it might be way off
Bmr023.C.dialogueact795	2002.76	2007.79	C	PhD	s^am	+1	2	and give very poorly trained , uh , you know , Gaussians that way ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact796	2005.27	2005.84	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact797	2008.47	2010.05	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	uh , an and poorly trained mixture weights .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact798	2010.05	2012.11	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so , we have {disfmarker}
Bmr023.C.dialogueact799	2013.13	2022.46	C	PhD	s	+1	2	The turn - around time on the training when we train only the {disfmarker} a male system with , uh , you know , our small training set , is {vocalsound} less than twenty - four hours ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact800	2022.46	2026.81	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	so we can run lots of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , basically just brute force ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact801	2026.81	2030.41	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	try a whole bunch of different um , settings .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact802	2029.31	2029.55	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact803	2030.41	2032.5	C	PhD	s	-1	0	And , uh , with the new machines it 'll be even better .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact804	2032.5	2032.76	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact805	2033.43	2035.12	F	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah . We get twelve of those ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact807	2035.3	2035.53	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact806	2035.12	2035.25	F	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	huh ?
Bmr023.C.dialogueact808	2038.16	2043.02	C	PhD	s.%--	+1	4	But the PLP features work {disfmarker} um , uh , you know , continue to improve the ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact809	2038.18	2038.77	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact810	2044.16	2045.01	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bmr023.C.dialogueact811	2046.05	2053.48	C	PhD	s	+1	3	As I said before , the {disfmarker} uh using Dan 's , uh , uh , vocal tract normalization option works very well .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact813	2053.9	2062.53	C	PhD	s	+1	1	So , um , @ @ {comment} I ran one experiment where we 're just {vocalsound} did the vocal tract le normalization only in the test data ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact812	2053.7	2054.01	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact814	2062.92	2065.81	C	PhD	s	+1	1	so I didn't bother to retrain {pause} the models at all ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact815	2066.49	2068.09	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and it improved by one percent ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact816	2068.22	2080.05	C	PhD	s	+1	1	which is about what we get with {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , with , you know , just @ @ {comment} actually doing both training and test normalization , um , with , um , {vocalsound} the , uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , with the standard system .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact817	2080.64	2087.57	C	PhD	s	+1	1	So , in a few hours we 'll have the numbers for the {disfmarker} for retraining everything with vocal tract length normalization
Bmr023.C.dialogueact818	2087.57	2089.33	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} So , that might even improve it further .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact819	2088.62	2088.83	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Great .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact820	2090.03	2097.3	C	PhD	s	+1	1	So , it looks like the P L - fea P features {comment} do very well now with {disfmarker} after having figured out all these little tricks to {disfmarker} to get it to work .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact821	2093.8	2094.14	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact822	2098.26	2098.46	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact824	2099.22	2099.39	F	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Good .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact823	2098.86	2104.34	G	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	Wait . So you mean you improve one percent over a system that doesn't have any V T L in it already ?
Bmr023.C.dialogueact825	2103.96	2105.03	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly . Yeah .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact826	2105.03	2105.18	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact827	2106.83	2107.06	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact828	2109.3	2114.68	F	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	OK . So then {disfmarker} then we 'll have our baseline to {disfmarker} to compare the currently hideous , uh , uh , new thing with .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact829	2113.82	2114.34	C	PhD	s^aa|%-	-1	0	Right . a
Bmr023.C.dialogueact831	2114.82	2123.24	C	PhD	fg|s	+1	1	Right . And {disfmarker} and what that suggests also is of course that the current Switchboard {pause} MLP isn't trained on very good features .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact830	2114.68	2114.95	F	Professor	%-	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact832	2116.39	2116.71	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact833	2124.82	2133.31	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Uh , because it was trained on whatever , you know , was used , uh , last time you did Hub - five stuff ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact834	2133.31	2134.42	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	which didn't have any of the {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact835	2135.42	2138.32	F	Professor	s^bk|s^df	-1	0	Right . But all of these effects were j like a couple percent .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact836	2135.98	2137.14	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	Uh .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact837	2139.08	2139.33	F	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr023.F.dialogueact838	2139.33	2140.49	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , y the {disfmarker}
Bmr023.C.dialogueact839	2140.08	2143.63	C	PhD	s^df^ng	+1	2	Well , but if you add them all up you have , uh , almost five percent difference now .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact840	2144.46	2146.15	F	Professor	s^m^t1.%--	-1	0	Add {pause} all of them .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact841	2146.15	2148.35	F	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	I thought one was one point five percent and one was point eight .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact842	2148.95	2151.12	C	PhD	s^aa|s^rt	-1	0	Yeah . And now we have another percent with the V T
Bmr023.F.dialogueact843	2151.54	2152.8	F	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's three point three .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact844	2152.92	2154.44	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Um , actually , and it 's ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact845	2154.62	2156.15	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	
Bmr023.C.dialogueact846	2155.32	2155.95	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact847	2157.28	2159.55	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	What 's actually qu interesting is that with {disfmarker}
Bmr023.C.dialogueact848	2160.61	2164.63	C	PhD	s	-1	0	um , well , you m prob maybe another half percent if you do the VTL in training ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact849	2165.42	2174.13	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and then interestingly , if you optimize you get more of a win out of rescoring the , um , {vocalsound} uh , the N best lists ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact850	2174.71	2176.27	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	uh , and optimizing the weights ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact851	2176.79	2178.0	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	um , uh than {disfmarker}
Bmr023.D.dialogueact852	2177.02	2177.98	D	PhD	qy^2^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Than you do with the standard ?
Bmr023.C.dialogueact853	2178.0	2178.35	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact855	2179.17	2179.69	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact854	2179.03	2185.17	F	Professor	s^bk|s	-1	0	Yeah . But the part that 's actually adjustment of the front - end per se as opposed to doing {disfmarker} putting VTLN in or something is {disfmarker} it was a couple percent .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact856	2181.97	2182.26	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact857	2185.65	2189.88	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Right ? It was {disfmarker} it was {disfmarker} there was {disfmarker} {vocalsound} there was one thing that was one and a half percent and one that was point eight .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact858	2190.16	2191.34	F	Professor	%--	-1	0	So {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact859	2191.52	2192.49	F	Professor	s	-1	0	let me see if I remember what they were .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact860	2192.49	2201.21	F	Professor	s	-1	0	One of them {vocalsound} was , uh , the change to , uh {disfmarker} because it did it all at once , {comment} to {disfmarker} uh , from bark scale to mel scale ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact861	2200.89	2201.42	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact862	2201.83	2203.63	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	which I really feel like saying in quotes ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact863	2203.62	2206.74	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because @ @ {comment} they 're essentially the same scale
Bmr023.F.dialogueact865	2206.74	2214.14	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but the {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but any i individual particular implementation of those things puts things in a particular place .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact864	2206.33	2207.41	G	PhD	fg|qw.%-	-1	0	Yeah . Why did that cha ?
Bmr023.C.dialogueact866	2214.23	2214.77	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact867	2214.63	2215.88	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So that 's why I wanted to look {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact868	2215.88	2216.86	F	Professor	s	-1	0	I still haven't looked at it yet .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact869	2216.99	2219.91	F	Professor	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I wanna look at exactly where the filters were in the two ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact870	2218.85	2219.22	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact871	2219.91	2226.29	F	Professor	s^am	-1	0	and it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's probably something like there 's one fewer or one more filter in the sub {vocalsound} one kilohertz band
Bmr023.C.dialogueact873	2226.52	2227.22	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact872	2226.29	2229.36	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and for whatever reason with this particular experiment it was better
Bmr023.F.dialogueact874	2229.36	2230.27	F	Professor	s	-1	0	one way or the other .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact875	2229.46	2229.76	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact876	2230.9	2233.24	F	Professor	s^am^bd^cs	-1	0	Um , it could be there 's something more fundamental
Bmr023.F.dialogueact877	2233.24	2234.91	F	Professor	s^bd^df^no	-1	0	but it {disfmarker} you know , I {disfmarker} I don't know it yet .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact878	2235.29	2237.68	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And the other {disfmarker} and the other {disfmarker} that was like one and a half or something ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact879	2237.68	2238.85	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and then there was point eight percent ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact880	2238.85	2239.69	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	which was {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact881	2239.69	2240.53	F	Professor	qw^t1	-1	0	what was the other thing ?
Bmr023.D.dialogueact882	2240.45	2241.91	D	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	Well , that was combined with the triangular .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact883	2241.91	2242.15	D	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr023.F.dialogueact884	2242.81	2244.07	F	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah . Those {disfmarker} those two were together .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact885	2243.88	2245.44	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah . Right .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact886	2244.07	2245.24	F	Professor	s	-1	0	We d weren't able to separate them out
Bmr023.F.dialogueact887	2245.24	2246.27	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	cuz it was just done in one thing .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact888	2246.27	2248.31	F	Professor	s	-1	0	But then there was a point eight percent which was something else .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact890	2248.62	2250.11	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	The low - frequency cut - off .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact889	2248.31	2248.88	F	Professor	qy.%-	-1	0	Do you remember the {disfmarker} ?
Bmr023.F.dialogueact891	2250.16	2255.46	F	Professor	s^bk|s	-1	0	Oh , yeah . So that was {disfmarker} that was , uh {disfmarker} that one I can claim credit for , uh , i in terms of screwing it up in the first place .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact892	2255.46	2256.83	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	So that someone e until someone else fixed it ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact893	2257.31	2259.03	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	which is that , um , I never put {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact894	2259.03	2259.49	F	Professor	%--	-1	0	when I u
Bmr023.F.dialogueact895	2259.95	2262.27	F	Professor	s	-1	0	We had some problems before with offsets .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact896	2262.34	2265.67	F	Professor	s	-1	0	This inf this went back to , uh , I think Wall Street Journal .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact898	2266.97	2267.49	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact897	2266.51	2267.7	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So we {disfmarker} we had , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact899	2268.01	2273.03	F	Professor	s	-1	0	ea everybody else who was doing Wall Street Journal knew that there were big DC offsets in th in these data {disfmarker} in those data
Bmr023.F.dialogueact900	2273.03	2275.09	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and nobody happened to mention it to us ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact901	2273.58	2274.48	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact902	2275.09	2277.09	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and we were getting these , like , really terrible results ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact903	2277.09	2279.07	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	like two , three times the error everybody else was getting .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact904	2279.83	2284.69	F	Professor	s:s	-1	0	And then in casual conversation someone ment mentioned " uh , well , I guess , you know , of course you 're taking care of the offsets . "
Bmr023.F.dialogueact905	2284.69	2285.54	F	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	I said " what offsets ? "
Bmr023.B.dialogueact907	2285.93	2286.62	B	Grad	b	-1	0	
Bmr023.C.dialogueact906	2285.89	2286.53	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact908	2286.14	2287.87	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And at that point , you know , we were pretty new to the data
Bmr023.F.dialogueact909	2287.87	2289.78	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and we 'd never really , like , looked at it on a screen
Bmr023.F.dialogueact910	2289.78	2291.64	F	Professor	s^fe	-1	0	and then when we just put it on the screen {comment} and wroop !
Bmr023.C.dialogueact912	2292.7	2293.25	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact911	2292.31	2293.31	F	Professor	s	-1	0	there 's this big DC offset .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact913	2293.69	2295.41	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	So , um , in PLP
Bmr023.G.dialogueact914	2294.53	2297.29	G	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	There was a {disfmarker} like a hum or some or {disfmarker} when they recorded it ?
Bmr023.F.dialogueact915	2297.21	2304.06	F	Professor	s^ar|s	-1	0	No . It 's just , it {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's not at all uncommon for {disfmarker} for recorded electronics to have different , um , DC offsets .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact916	2297.58	2298.0	G	PhD	qrr.%-	-1	0	Or just {disfmarker} ?
Bmr023.G.dialogueact917	2304.08	2304.46	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Huh .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact918	2304.9	2306.4	F	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} it 's , you know , no big deal .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact919	2306.4	2308.91	F	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} you know , you could have ten , twenty , maybe thirty millivolts , whatever ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact920	2308.91	2309.96	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and it 's consistently in there .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact921	2310.25	2314.73	F	Professor	s	-1	0	The thing is , most people 's front - ends have pre - emphasis with it , with zero at zero frequency ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact922	2315.09	2316.18	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so that it 's irrelevant .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact923	2316.93	2320.47	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh , but with P L P , we didn't actually have that .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact924	2320.58	2328.73	F	Professor	s	-1	0	We had {disfmarker} we had the equivalent of pre - emphasis in a {disfmarker} a , uh , Fletcher - Munson style weighting that occurs in the middle of P L
Bmr023.F.dialogueact925	2328.73	2331.85	F	Professor	s	-1	0	but it doesn't actually have a zero at zero frequency ,
Bmr023.G.dialogueact926	2331.15	2331.39	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact927	2331.85	2334.66	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	like , eh , uh , typical simple fr pre - emphasis does .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact928	2334.75	2335.71	F	Professor	s	-1	0	We had something more fancy .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact929	2335.71	2336.31	F	Professor	s	-1	0	It was later on
Bmr023.F.dialogueact930	2336.31	2336.98	F	Professor	s	-1	0	it didn't have that .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact931	2337.48	2340.87	F	Professor	s:s	-1	0	So at that point I reali " oh sh we better have a {disfmarker} have a high - pass filter "
Bmr023.F.dialogueact932	2340.87	2343.26	F	Professor	s	-1	0	just , you know {disfmarker} {vocalsound} just take care of the problem .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact933	2343.26	2350.53	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So I put in a high - pass filter at , uh , I think ninety {disfmarker} ninety hertz or so {vocalsound} uh , for a sixteen kilohertz sampling rate .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact934	2351.39	2356.8	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And I never put anything in to adjust it for different {disfmarker} different sampling rates .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact935	2357.37	2360.37	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And so {disfmarker} well , so , you know , the code doesn't know anything about that
Bmr023.F.dialogueact936	2360.37	2361.87	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and so this is all at eight kilohertz
Bmr023.F.dialogueact937	2361.87	2365.41	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and so it was at forty - five hertz instead of at {disfmarker} {vocalsound} instead of at ninety .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact938	2363.55	2364.16	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact939	2365.41	2366.46	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	So , um ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact940	2366.83	2371.99	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	I don't know if Dan fixed it or {disfmarker} or , uh , what he {disfmarker}
Bmr023.C.dialogueact941	2371.17	2372.55	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , he made it a parameter .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact942	2372.99	2373.89	F	Professor	s^m^na	-1	0	He made it a parameter .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact943	2373.89	2375.89	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So . Yeah , I guess if he did it right , he did fix it
Bmr023.F.dialogueact944	2375.89	2378.03	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and then {disfmarker} and then it 's taking care of sampling rate ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact945	2378.03	2378.77	F	Professor	s	-1	0	which is great .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact946	2378.8	2379.97	D	PhD	qw	-1	0	What {disfmarker} what is the parameter ?
Bmr023.F.dialogueact947	2379.09	2379.43	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	He had a {disfmarker}
Bmr023.D.dialogueact948	2379.97	2382.27	D	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Is it , uh , just the f lower cut - off that you want ?
Bmr023.C.dialogueact949	2382.8	2385.68	C	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	It 's called , uh , {vocalsound} H - HPF .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact950	2385.11	2385.41	F	Professor	%--	-1	0	H {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact951	2385.74	2387.97	F	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah . Does HPF on {disfmarker} on his feat feature .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact952	2386.36	2394.13	C	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	u And {disfmarker} but HPF , you know , when you put a number after it , uses that as the hertz value of the cut - off .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact953	2390.25	2390.57	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact955	2393.32	2393.71	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact954	2393.16	2393.42	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact956	2394.13	2394.28	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact957	2395.01	2397.89	F	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , frankly , we never did that with the RASTA filter either ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact959	2398.05	2398.59	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact958	2397.89	2403.06	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so the RASTA filter is actually doing a different thing in the modulation spectral domain depending on what sampling rate you 're doing ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact960	2403.06	2405.68	F	Professor	s	-1	0	which is {vocalsound} another old {disfmarker} old bug of mine .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact961	2403.6	2404.02	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact962	2406.49	2407.39	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	But , um {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact963	2408.58	2413.29	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Um . So that {disfmarker} that was the problem there was th we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we had always intended to cut off below a hundred hertz
Bmr023.C.dialogueact964	2413.15	2413.59	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact965	2413.29	2414.57	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and it just wasn't doing it ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact966	2414.57	2415.06	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so now it is .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact967	2415.06	2417.97	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So , {vocalsound} that hep that helped us by , like , eight tenths of a percent .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact968	2417.97	2419.28	F	Professor	s	-1	0	It {pause} still wasn't a big deal .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact969	2421.01	2421.26	C	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact970	2422.86	2431.71	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , but , um {disfmarker} Well , uh , again , after completing the {pause} current experiments , we 'll {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we can add up all the uh differences
Bmr023.F.dialogueact971	2430.94	2431.34	F	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	Oh , yeah .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact973	2431.71	2433.02	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and {disfmarker} an
Bmr023.F.dialogueact972	2431.34	2444.57	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but , I guess my {disfmarker} my point was that {disfmarker} that , um , the hybrid system thing that we did was , uh , primitive in many ways .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact974	2445.03	2445.11	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	Y
Bmr023.C.dialogueact975	2445.36	2445.6	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact976	2445.68	2452.49	F	Professor	s	+1	2	And I think I agree with you that if we fixed lots of different things and they would all add up , we would probably have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a competitive system .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact977	2452.84	2455.87	F	Professor	s^bd^df	+1	2	But I think not that much of it is due to the front - end per se .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact978	2455.87	2459.06	F	Professor	s	+1	2	I think maybe a couple percent of it is , as far as I can see from this .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact979	2459.16	2459.52	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact980	2459.7	2463.87	F	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	Uh , unless you call {disfmarker} well , if you call VTL the front - en front - end , that 's , uh , a little more .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact981	2463.87	2466.42	F	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	But that 's sort of more both , kind of .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact982	2466.35	2481.51	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	One experiment we should {disfmarker} we 'll probably need to do though when {disfmarker} um , at some point , is , since we 're using that same {disfmarker} the net that was trained on PLP without all these things in it , for the tandem system , we may wanna go back and retrain ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact983	2466.42	2466.55	F	Professor	s^f	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr023.F.dialogueact984	2466.73	2466.82	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	But .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact985	2481.8	2483.23	C	PhD	s^na|s^aa	-1	0	Well , that 's what I meant , in fact . Yeah .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact986	2482.76	2483.4	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah , yeah ,
Bmr023.D.dialogueact987	2483.54	2484.71	D	PhD	s^e|s^f	-1	0	for the tandem . You know ,
Bmr023.D.dialogueact988	2484.71	2488.46	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so we can see if it {disfmarker} what effect it has on the tandem processing .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact989	2488.29	2491.09	C	PhD	fg|qy.%--	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so , the thing is {disfmarker} is do we expect {disfmarker} ?
Bmr023.F.dialogueact990	2489.72	2490.13	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact991	2491.44	2504.2	C	PhD	qy^rt	+1	2	eh At this point I 'm as I mean , you know {disfmarker} e I 'm wondering is it {disfmarker} Can we expect , uh , a tandem system to do better than a properly trained {disfmarker} you know , a Gaussian system trained directly on the features with , you know , the right ch choice of {pause} parameters ?
Bmr023.F.dialogueact992	2504.86	2507.13	F	Professor	s^na|s^aa	-1	0	Well , that 's what we 're seeing in other areas . Yes .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact993	2508.46	2508.79	F	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr023.F.dialogueact994	2509.03	2510.41	F	Professor	%--	-1	0	So , it 's {disfmarker} so ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact995	2510.56	2513.08	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	um , um {disfmarker}
Bmr023.D.dialogueact996	2513.12	2517.22	D	PhD	s	-1	0	So , we {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} but we may not . I mean , if it doesn't perform as well , we may not know why .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact997	2517.52	2517.65	D	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr023.D.dialogueact998	2517.65	2520.63	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Cuz we need to do the exact experiment .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact999	2519.17	2519.47	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1000	2522.51	2530.77	F	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , the reason to think it should is because you 're putting in the same information and you 're transforming it to be more discriminative .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1001	2531.29	2533.95	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	So . Um .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1002	2534.27	2538.52	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Now the thing is , in some databases I wouldn't expect it to necessarily give you much
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1003	2538.52	2548.78	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and part of what I view as the real power of it is that it {pause} gives you a transformational capability {vocalsound} for taking all sorts of different wild things that we do ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1004	2548.78	2550.56	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	not just th the standard front - end ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1005	2550.56	2553.06	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	but other things , like with multiple streams and so forth ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1006	2553.2	2553.56	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1007	2553.49	2556.65	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and allows you to feed them to the other system with this {disfmarker} through this funnel .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1008	2557.42	2560.05	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Um , so I think {disfmarker} I think that 's the real power of it .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1009	2560.05	2562.29	F	Professor	s	-1	0	I wouldn't expect huge in huge improvements .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1010	2563.09	2568.07	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Um , but it should at least be roughly the same and maybe a little better .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1011	2567.69	2568.42	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1012	2568.07	2570.32	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	If it 's , you know , like way way worse then , you know {disfmarker}
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1013	2570.69	2570.89	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1014	2571.07	2573.74	D	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	So , Morgan , an another thing that Andreas and I were talking about was ,
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1015	2573.74	2580.48	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so @ @ {comment} in the first experiment that he did {vocalsound} we just took the whole fifty - six , uh , outputs
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1016	2580.48	2586.92	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and that 's , um , basically compared to a thirty - nine input feature vector from either MFCC or PLP .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1017	2582.22	2582.61	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1018	2584.96	2585.25	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1019	2587.6	2589.17	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	But one thing we could do is {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1020	2588.83	2590.2	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Let {disfmarker} let me {disfmarker} let me just ask you something .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1021	2590.2	2595.29	F	Professor	qy^bu^d	-1	0	When you say take the fifty - six outputs , these are the pre final nonlinearity {pause} outputs
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1022	2595.26	2597.28	D	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yeah . Through the regular tandem outputs .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1023	2595.38	2596.07	F	Professor	%-	-1	0	and they 're {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1024	2596.93	2598.0	F	Professor	qy^bu^d^e	-1	0	through the KLT .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1025	2597.81	2598.62	D	PhD	s^m^na	-1	0	Through the KLT .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1027	2598.8	2599.48	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	All that kinda stuff .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1026	2598.69	2599.07	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1028	2599.31	2602.68	F	Professor	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	And so {disfmarker} so then you u Do you use all fifty - six of the KLT
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1030	2602.97	2603.72	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	That 's what we did .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1029	2602.68	2602.79	F	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1031	2603.95	2604.19	D	PhD	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1033	2604.61	2611.89	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So one thing we were wondering is , if we did principal components and , say , took out just thirteen , and then did deltas and double - deltas on that {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1032	2604.45	2604.82	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1034	2608.11	2608.49	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1036	2611.89	2616.17	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so we treated the th first thirteen as though they were {vocalsound} standard features .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1035	2611.61	2612.0	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1037	2616.13	2616.42	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1038	2616.78	2618.93	D	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	I mean , did Dan do experiments like that to {disfmarker} ?
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1039	2619.47	2620.42	F	Professor	s^co	-1	0	Uh . Talk with Stephane .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1040	2621.98	2623.09	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	He did some things like that .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1041	2623.48	2624.6	F	Professor	s^bd^df	-1	0	It was either him or Carmen .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1042	2624.6	2625.08	F	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I forget .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1044	2625.27	2625.72	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1043	2625.24	2625.92	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1045	2626.3	2629.54	F	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean these were all different databases and different {disfmarker} you know , in HTK and all that ,
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1046	2628.17	2628.63	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1047	2629.54	2631.09	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so i it {disfmarker} it may not apply .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1048	2631.09	2635.35	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	But my recollection of it was that it didn't make it better but it didn't make it worse .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1049	2635.65	2636.17	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1050	2636.3	2643.46	F	Professor	s	-1	0	But , again , given all these differences , maybe it 's more important in your case that you not take a lot of these low - variance , uh , components .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1051	2644.52	2649.63	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Cuz in a sense , the net 's already got quite a bit of context in those features ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1052	2648.29	2648.59	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1053	2649.77	2657.0	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so if we did deltas and double - deltas on top of those , we 're getting sort of even more .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1054	2658.08	2659.31	F	Professor	s^2	-1	0	Which could be good or not .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1055	2659.07	2659.43	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1056	2659.46	2659.71	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1057	2663.07	2663.73	F	Professor	fg|s^cs	-1	0	Yeah . Worth trying .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1058	2665.28	2676.12	C	PhD	s	+1	1	But there the main point is that , um , you know , it took us a while but we have the procedure for coupling the two systems {vocalsound} debugged now
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1059	2676.12	2684.0	C	PhD	s	+1	1	and {disfmarker} I mean , there 's still conceivably some bug somewhere in the way we 're feeding the tandem features {disfmarker}
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1060	2684.0	2688.08	C	PhD	s^e	+1	1	uh , either generating them or feeding them to this {disfmarker} to the {vocalsound} SRI system ,
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1061	2684.68	2685.23	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1062	2686.71	2686.99	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1063	2688.08	2688.31	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	but
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1065	2689.46	2689.85	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1064	2689.09	2689.64	F	Professor	s^am	-1	0	There might be ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1066	2689.64	2691.13	F	Professor	s^ba^df	-1	0	cuz that 's a pretty big difference .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1067	2691.29	2691.88	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1069	2692.37	2695.95	C	PhD	s	-1	0	And I 'm wondering how we can {disfmarker} how we can debug that .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1068	2692.3	2692.53	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	But
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1070	2694.28	2694.69	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1071	2695.95	2696.37	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I mean how {disfmarker}
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1072	2697.9	2698.31	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1073	2701.01	2701.68	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1074	2704.09	2710.87	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I 'm actually f quite sure that the {disfmarker} feeding the {pause} features into the system and training it up ,

Bmr023.C.dialogueact1076	2710.87	2716.88	C	PhD	s	+1	1	that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} I think that 's {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} that 's essentially the same as we use with the ce with the P L P fe features .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1077	2717.41	2718.69	C	PhD	s	-1	0	And that 's obviously working great .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1078	2718.69	2721.75	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	So . I um .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1079	2720.93	2724.04	D	PhD	fg|s	+1	1	Yeah . There could be a bug in {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} somewhere before that .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1080	2722.69	2723.39	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	There {disfmarker} we could {disfmarker}
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1081	2723.39	2728.06	C	PhD	qh	-1	0	the {disfmarker} another degree of freedom is how do you generate the K L T transform ?
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1082	2728.21	2729.25	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1084	2729.37	2729.62	C	PhD	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Right ?

Bmr023.F.dialogueact1087	2730.14	2734.61	F	Professor	s	-1	0	well , and another one is the normalization of the inputs to the net .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1088	2730.7	2731.11	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1089	2736.44	2739.21	F	Professor	s	-1	0	These nets are trained with particular normalization
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1090	2739.21	2741.64	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and when that gets screwed up it {disfmarker} it can really hurt it .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1091	2741.57	2743.4	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I 'm doing what Eric {disfmarker}

Bmr023.D.dialogueact1093	2746.7	2748.63	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so I 'm pretty confident in that .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1094	2746.78	2747.04	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1095	2748.63	2755.96	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , the only slight difference is that I use normalization values that , um , Andreas calculated

Bmr023.D.dialogueact1103	2764.49	2766.59	D	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	Oh , we actually don't do that normalization for the PLP ,
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1104	2766.59	2766.9	D	PhD	qy^g^rt	-1	0	do we ?
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1105	2767.94	2770.08	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	For the st just the straight PLP features ?
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1106	2771.07	2772.96	C	PhD	s^ar|s	-1	0	No . The {disfmarker} the SRI system does it .

Bmr023.C.dialogueact1112	2776.91	2782.2	C	PhD	s	-1	0	So , there 's {disfmarker} there is {disfmarker} there is room for bugs that we might not have discovered ,
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1111	2776.44	2777.64	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So that 's {disfmarker} that 's another {disfmarker}
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1113	2778.04	2778.39	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1114	2780.15	2780.49	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1115	2780.72	2781.43	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1116	2781.02	2785.8	F	Professor	fg|s^cs	+1	2	Yeah . {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I would actually double check with Stephane at this point ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1117	2782.2	2782.61	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1118	2786.32	2787.9	F	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	cuz he 's probably the one here {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1119	2788.49	2792.55	F	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , he and Dan are the ones who are at this point most experienced with the tandem
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1120	2792.81	2793.67	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1121	2794.18	2799.72	F	Professor	s	-1	0	thing and there may {disfmarker} there may be some little bit here and there that is not {disfmarker} not being handled right .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1122	2801.17	2802.3	D	PhD	fg|s	+1	2	Yeah . It 's hard with features ,
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1123	2802.3	2804.28	D	PhD	s^df	+1	2	cuz you don't know what they should look like .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1124	2804.5	2810.38	D	PhD	s^df^e.%-	+1	2	I mean , you can't just , like , print the {disfmarker} the values out in ASCII and , you know , look at them , see if they 're {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1125	2810.17	2811.37	F	Professor	s^arp^j	+1	2	Not unless you had a lot of time
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1126	2810.7	2810.94	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1127	2811.37	2811.48	F	Professor	%-	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1128	2811.47	2817.44	G	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	eh , and also they 're not {disfmarker} I mean , as I understand it , you {disfmarker} you don't have a way to optimize the features for the final word error .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1129	2817.44	2817.71	G	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1130	2818.11	2818.39	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1131	2818.44	2820.33	G	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	I mean , these are just discriminative ,
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1132	2820.33	2823.5	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	but they 're not , um , optimized for the final {disfmarker}
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1133	2822.31	2824.21	C	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	They 're optimized for phone discrimination ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1135	2824.3	2824.82	C	PhD	s^e.%-	-1	0	not for {disfmarker}
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1134	2824.03	2835.05	G	PhD	s^bk|s.%-	-1	0	Right . So it {disfmarker} there 's always this question of whether you might do better with those features if there was a way to train it for the word error metric that you 're actually {disfmarker} that you 're actually {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1136	2825.05	2825.47	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	That 's right .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1137	2830.1	2830.84	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	Well , the other {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1138	2831.71	2832.33	F	Professor	fg|%-	-1	0	Yeah , th the {disfmarker}
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1139	2833.89	2834.31	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	Mm - Mmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1140	2834.07	2835.22	F	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	Well , you actually are .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1141	2835.37	2837.29	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but it {disfmarker} but in an indirect way .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1142	2837.42	2839.87	G	PhD	s^aa|s^df.%-	-1	0	Well , right . It 's indirect , so you don't know {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1143	2838.26	2840.87	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So wha w what {disfmarker} an and you may not be in this case ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1144	2840.87	2841.59	F	Professor	s	-1	0	come to think of it ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1145	2841.59	2845.42	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because , uh , you 're just taking something that 's trained up elsewhere .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1146	2845.42	2852.99	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So , what {disfmarker} what you {disfmarker} what you do in the full procedure {vocalsound} is you , um , uh , have an embedded training .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1147	2853.77	2863.18	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So in fact you {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the net is trained on , uh , uh , a , uh , Viterbi alignment of the training data that comes from your full system .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1148	2863.29	2867.86	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And so that 's where the feedback comes all around , so that it is actually discriminant .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1149	2868.24	2870.21	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	You can prove that it 's {disfmarker} it 's a ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1150	2870.98	2871.38	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1151	2872.01	2891.62	F	Professor	s	-1	0	If you believe in the Viterbi assumption that , uh , getting the best path , uh , is almost equivalent to getting the best , uh , total probability , um , then you actually do improve that by , uh {disfmarker} by training up on local {disfmarker} local , uh {disfmarker} local frames .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1152	2892.57	2894.85	F	Professor	s	-1	0	But , um , we aren't actually doing that here ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1153	2895.0	2897.99	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because we did {disfmarker} we did that for a hybrid system ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1154	2897.99	2899.87	F	Professor	s^df^e	-1	0	and now we 're plugging it into another system
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1155	2899.87	2903.01	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and so it isn't {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i i i it wouldn't quite apply here .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1157	2902.98	2904.24	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	Do y
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1156	2902.89	2914.83	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	So another huge experiment we could do would be to take the tandem features , uh , do SRI forced alignments using those features , and then re - do the net with those .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1158	2910.14	2910.74	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1159	2911.49	2913.45	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Mmm , uh {disfmarker} Exactly . Exactly .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1160	2912.54	2912.79	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1161	2913.82	2915.73	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	So that you can optimize it for the word error .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1163	2915.06	2915.41	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1162	2914.95	2921.56	F	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah . Another thing is since you 're not using the net for recognition per se but just for this transformation , it 's probably bigger than it needs to be .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1164	2915.82	2916.07	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1165	2922.53	2923.95	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So that would save a lot of time .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1166	2924.29	2925.86	C	PhD	s	-1	0	And there 's a mismatch in the phone sets .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1168	2928.06	2931.72	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So , you 're using a l a long a larger phone set than what {disfmarker}
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1167	2927.68	2928.05	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1169	2931.11	2935.37	F	Professor	s^aa|s^am	-1	0	Yeah . Actually all those things could {disfmarker} could {disfmarker} could {disfmarker} could , uh {disfmarker} could affect it as well .
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1170	2934.35	2935.5	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1171	2936.42	2941.3	F	Professor	s	+1	1	The other thing , uh , just to mention that Stephane {disfmarker} this was an innovation of Stephane 's , which was a pretty neat one ,
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1172	2941.97	2945.57	F	Professor	s	+1	1	uh , and might particularly apply {vocalsound} here , given all these things we 're mentioning .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1173	2946.18	2951.97	F	Professor	s	+1	1	Um , Stephane 's idea was that , um , discriminant , uh , approaches are great .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1174	2952.6	2959.67	F	Professor	s	+1	1	Even the local ones , given , you know , these potential outer loops which , you know , you can convince yourself turn into the global ones .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1175	2960.61	2964.54	F	Professor	s	+1	1	Um , however , there 's times when it {pause} is not good .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1176	2965.2	2972.89	F	Professor	s^e	+1	1	Uh , when {pause} something about the test set is different enough from the training set that {disfmarker} that , uh , the discrimination that you 're learning is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is not a good one .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1177	2971.83	2972.19	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1178	2973.85	2987.12	F	Professor	s	+1	1	So , uh , his idea was to take as the input feature vector to the , uh , Gaussian mixture system , {vocalsound} uh , a concatenation of the neural net outputs and the regular features .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1179	2987.46	2988.7	C	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	Oh , we already talked about that .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1180	2988.04	2988.74	G	PhD	fg|%-	-1	0	Yeah . That {disfmarker}
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1181	2988.87	2989.16	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1184	2989.45	2989.72	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	El
Bmr023.D.dialogueact1182	2989.03	2989.65	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1183	2989.09	2990.85	G	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Didn't you {disfmarker} did you {pause} do that already
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1185	2989.72	2990.13	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1187	2990.96	2999.55	C	PhD	s^ar|s	-1	0	No , but we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when we {disfmarker} when I first started corresponding with Dan about how to go about this , I think that was one of the things that we definitely went there .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1186	2990.85	2990.98	G	PhD	qrr.%-	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1188	2991.32	2993.15	G	PhD	s^bk|s^cs	-1	0	Oh . That makes a lot of sense .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1189	2993.3	2993.44	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Huh .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1190	2996.58	2996.86	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1191	2998.74	3001.17	F	Professor	fg|s^bd	-1	0	Yeah . I mean , I 'm sure that Stephane wasn't the first to think of it ,
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1192	3000.66	3001.06	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1193	3001.17	3002.28	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but actually Stephane did it
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1195	3002.56	3003.56	C	PhD	s^bk|qy^rt	-1	0	Uh - huh . And i does it help ?
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1194	3002.44	3004.43	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and {disfmarker} and it helped a lot .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1197	3004.63	3005.47	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1196	3004.43	3004.69	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1198	3004.9	3009.95	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So that 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that 's our current best {disfmarker} best system in the , uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , in the Aurora thing .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1199	3007.82	3008.44	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh . OK .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1200	3008.7	3009.75	G	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah . That makes sense .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1202	3010.45	3013.97	C	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	And do you do a KLT transform on the con on the combined feature vector ?
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1201	3010.08	3010.37	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr023.G.dialogueact1203	3010.58	3012.04	G	PhD	s	-1	0	As {disfmarker} you should never do worse .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1204	3013.91	3014.95	F	Professor	s^br	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I , uh , missed what you said .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1205	3015.17	3018.79	C	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Do you {disfmarker} d you do a KLT transform on the combined feature vector ?

Bmr023.F.dialogueact1209	3022.45	3024.38	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because he tried several different combinations .
Bmr023.C.dialogueact1210	3024.06	3029.86	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Because you end up with this huge feature vector , so that might be a problem , a unless you do some form of dimensionality reduction .
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1211	3028.97	3029.88	F	Professor	s^bk|%-	-1	0	Yeah . I , uh , th

Bmr023.D.dialogueact1220	3050.28	3054.82	D	PhD	qy^bu^d.%-	-1	0	So he always ended up with a feature vector that was {pause} twice as long as either one of the {disfmarker} ?
Bmr023.F.dialogueact1221	3055.08	3056.59	F	Professor	s^ar|s^no	-1	0	No . I don't know , i I {disfmarker} I don't know .
