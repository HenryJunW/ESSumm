One meeting recording has been channelized and pre-segmented for delivery to IBM.
A sample of digits data is being prepared for IBM.
Preliminary recognition results were obtained for a subset of digits data.
The error rate distribution was multimodal , reflecting differences in performance for native versus non-native speakers , and also possible pre-processing errors.
Future efforts will involve an attempt to get good forced alignments on digits data and generate a report for Eurospeech'01.
A program has been developed for replacing sections of recorded speech with editing bleeps.
The tightening of time bins for one NSA meeting was checked and judged to be highly accurate.
Efforts are ongoing to improve forced alignments for a subset of non-digits data , including acoustic adaptation manipulations.
