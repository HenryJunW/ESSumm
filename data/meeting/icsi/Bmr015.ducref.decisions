A small percentage of transcripts will be changed to reflect mis-read , uncorrected digits.
A speaker database will be compiled to establish consistent links between speakers and their corresponding identification tags.
Sections of densely overlapping speech will require hand-checking so that overlooked backchannels may be manually segmented and labelled.
The transcribers should only code audible breaths within a grouping of words , and not outside regions of continuous speech.
It was further determined that audible breaths are an important facet of recorded speech , and that removing them from the corpus would be contrary to the aims of the project.
Speaker mn005 will prepare his results for detecting speaker overlap and present them in the next meeting.
