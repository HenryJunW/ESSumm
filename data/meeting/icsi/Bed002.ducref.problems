Curent navigation systems do not provide for the user's particular intentions when asking for directions.
They always compute the shortest path between source and destination.
The SmartKom parser , for example , does not mark up data with features adequate for the inference of these intentions.
Although it is understandable that language , discourse and situation features will play a role in how they are weighed , the exact nature of those features is unclear.
Also hard to evaluate at this stage , is how the assumed features will combine in a belief-net , in order to provide the conditional probabilities of the users' intentions.
Even if these problems are solved , extracting the features from the data may prove to be a bottleneck.
The existing data are appropriate only for preliminary work , as they don't include intention-related information.
On the other hand , the details of the experiments that will have to be designed to get more appropriate data are not clearcut and are yet to be settled.
