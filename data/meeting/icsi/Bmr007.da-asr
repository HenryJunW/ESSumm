Bmr007.D.dialogueact75	143.172	154.162	D	Professor	s^bs^t^tc	-1	0	so it sounds like the the three main things that we have talked about our uh this list uh damon gin adam have sufficient items and other not anything unusual anything goes beyond that okay 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact76	155.019	158.799	D	Professor	s^bk|qh^co^t	-1	0	attain since since you were sort of cut off last time when we start with yours make sure 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact77	158.799	159.659	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	start with yours make sure to get to it okay 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact78	159.93	164.14	F	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	to get to it okay it's it's very it's very prefab and just let me just handy so 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact79	164.66	164.94	F	Postdoc	s^fe	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr007.H.dialogueact80	165.997	167.457	H	Grad	qr	-1	0	it's is this the same female are different 
Bmr007.C.dialogueact82	168.304	168.724	C	PhD	s^ft	-1	0	fun i guess 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact81	167.878	168.758	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it's fun i guess are different 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact83	168.858	171.288	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	same idea fun i guess basically the same 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact84	168.931	169.121	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	fun i guess 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact85	171.154	171.704	A	PhD	qy^2^d^rt	-1	0	same idea 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact86	171.428	172.648	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	same idea same idea so if people 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact87	172.648	173.988	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	same idea so if people today she seen it before so 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact88	173.988	180.878	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	today she seen it before so i basically um as you know um part of the in coding includes a mark that indicates an overlap 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact89	182.281	196.506	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	it's not indicated with um type precision is just indicated that so is indicated to it too so the people know what participate which which stretches the speech we're in the clear persisting overlapped by others or 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact90	196.506	202.256	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	by others or use this market and um and uh divided d. i read a script 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact91	202.586	210.106	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i read a script which divides things into individual minutes uh which we end up with forty five and a little bit and 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact92	210.856	216.276	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and um no minute zero courses the first minute up too sixty seconds and 
Bmr007.C.dialogueact93	215.78	215.89	C	PhD	b	-1	0	sixty seconds 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact94	217.025	224.622	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	um what you can see is the number of overlaps and then to the right whether they involved two speakers three speakers more than three speakers 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact95	225.371	233.811	F	Postdoc	fh|s	+1	0	and um and what i was looking for it's just specifically was the question of whether they're distributed evenly throughout or whether they're bursts of them 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact96	234.654	235.004	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	um and it looked to 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact97	235.204	236.684	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and it looked to me as though 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact98	237.321	248.478	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	uh you know you this is just if this would this is not physically verified but it did look to me as other burst throughout rather than being localized to a particular region the part 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact99	248.83	263.26	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	region the part down there where this maximum number of of uh overlaps is an area where we were discussing whether or not would be useful to and to to to code stress uh send stress as possible indication of uh information feel so it's like 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact100	263.38	265.91	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so it's like oh brother lively discussion there 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact101	266.313	271.733	D	Professor	qw	-1	0	what what's what's that that prophesy stuff that's is like the first one to six overlaps and then two point eight old as 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact102	269.602	269.822	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	like the first one to old 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact103	269.932	272.497	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	like the first one to six overlaps and then two point eight old as a percent six 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact104	272.023	272.173	D	Professor	b	-1	0	a percent six 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact105	272.597	277.227	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	a percent six is uh two point eight percent of the total number of overlaps in the session at the very 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact106	273.698	274.108	E	PhD	b	-1	0	is uh two point eight percent of the 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact107	276.294	276.934	D	Professor	b	-1	0	in the session 
Bmr007.C.dialogueact108	277.503	278.113	C	PhD	b	-1	0	at the very end this is when people 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact109	277.715	281.545	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	at the very end this is when people were you know packing up to go basically is 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact110	281.545	282.785	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	basically is final stuff i think 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact111	282.785	284.835	F	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	final stuff i think we i remember where they just thought have 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact112	284.835	285.575	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	they just thought have to look at that but 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact113	285.575	287.805	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	to look at that but the final three there no overlaps at all 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact114	288.78	290.69	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	ten couple times they're not so it it 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact116	290.977	291.437	E	PhD	b	-1	0	not so it it seems like it goes troopers 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact115	290.69	294.35	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	not so it it seems like it goes troopers but um that's kind of it now the 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact117	292.992	293.272	E	PhD	b	-1	0	but um that's 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact118	294.35	301.22	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	kind of it now the question is is there are there individual differences and whether you're likely to be overlap with or to overlap with others and 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact119	302.017	316.009	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	again i want to emphasize is just one particular um one particular meeting and also there's been no statistical testing involved but i um i took the coding up the you know my i 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact120	316.469	324.989	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	you know my i had the script figure out um who was the first bicker who's the second speaker involved in a two person overlap i didn't look at the ones involving three or more 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact121	325.789	333.289	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and um this is how it breaks down in the individual cells of who tended to be overlapping most often with whom who else and if 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact122	333.289	338.869	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and if you look at the marginal toes which is the ones on the right side across the bottom you get the totals for an individual so 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact123	338.929	350.117	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	for an individual so um if you look at the bottom of those are the um numbers of overlaps in which um adam was involved as the person doing the overlapping and if you look i'm sorry but you're alphabetical 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact124	350.117	352.087	F	Postdoc	s^fa	-1	0	i'm sorry but you're alphabetical subject juicing and then 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact125	352.752	360.482	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and then if you look across the right then that's where he was the person who was just the first speaker and a pair and got overlap overlapped with by somebody 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact126	358.4	359.11	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and got overlap overlapped with by somebody 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact127	359.808	360.138	E	PhD	b	-1	0	overlapped with by somebody 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact128	361.362	370.4	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and then if you look down a summary table then you see that um that they're differences in weather person got overlapped with her overlapped is this uh just rock 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact129	369.58	371.72	H	Grad	qr.%-	-1	0	rod counts is this uh just rock cancers it 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact130	371.72	372.31	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	rod counts cancers it would be interesting 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact131	372.398	375.47	H	Grad	s	-1	0	yes would be interesting to see how much each person spoke 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact132	375.726	375.996	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yes 
Bmr007.C.dialogueact135	376.122	376.322	C	PhD	b	-1	0	very true normalized 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact134	376.089	378.967	E	PhD	b	-1	0	very true very true because you normalized expected that now normalized to how much 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact133	375.923	377.483	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yes very true very true because you normalized normalized to how much 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact136	376.83	377.95	H	Grad	s^t1.%-	-1	0	very true very true because you normalized normalized to how much 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact137	377.483	378.893	F	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	very true because you normalized expected that now to how much 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact138	378.893	384.113	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	expected that now on the table i did take one step toward uh away from there are frequencies by putting uh percentages so that the percentage of 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact139	384.113	388.673	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	so that the percentage of time i but other times of the person spoke what percentage it so 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact140	388.773	397.806	F	Postdoc	qw	+1	1	it so other times the person spoke and furthermore was involved in the first two person overlap what percentage of the time where they they overlap or and what percent time or they the overlap the 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact141	398.454	400.424	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and there it looks like you see some differences um 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact142	400.894	406.774	F	Postdoc	s	+1	2	um that some people tend to be overlapped with more often and they're overlapped but of course 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact143	406.774	417.364	F	Postdoc	s	+1	2	so it it would be statistically incorrect overlapped but of course uh you this is just one meeting uh there's no statistical testing involved that would be required for for finding any kind of really 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact144	415.49	420.55	D	Professor	s^j	-1	0	so it it would be statistically incorrect to conclude that i'm talk too much or something kind of really no no no no actually that

Bmr007.F.dialogueact168	447.089	447.949	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	well fair enough 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact169	448.089	448.479	F	Postdoc	s^bk^r	-1	0	fair enough and actually 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact171	449.043	449.483	D	Professor	b	-1	0	know the point is not about 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact170	448.739	454.719	F	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	oh sure fair enough and actually know the point is not about it individuals point about tendencies toward you know different styles different speakers styles 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact172	454.456	454.816	D	Professor	b	-1	0	oh sure speakers styles 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact173	455.457	460.937	F	Postdoc	s	+1	2	and it would be you know of course there's also the question of what type of overlap was this and were were they 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact174	461.157	465.85	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and it and i and i know that i can distinguish at least three types and probably more mean 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact175	465.85	477.626	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	probably more mean the general cultural idea which uh the conversation alice originally star was in the seventies was that we have this strict model where politeness involves that you let person finished it before you start talking and 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact176	477.626	486.542	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	talking and and you know i mean we know that and and they've loosened up on that to too in the intervening time that that that's that's viewed as being culturally relative thing i mean do 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact177	486.542	493.418	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	thing i mean do you have behind bombing style from the east coast where people will overlap often as an indication of interest in what they the person thing and uhhuh 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact179	493.838	494.178	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	thing and yeah exactly uhhuh 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact178	493.618	493.868	H	Grad	b	-1	0	thing and uhhuh 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact181	494.823	495.353	B	PhD	s^fe.%	-1	0	yeah exactly there you see fine 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact180	494.518	495.358	F	Postdoc	s^fe	-1	0	yeah exactly there you see fine 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact183	495.519	495.729	E	PhD	b	-1	0	there you see fine 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact182	495.358	495.968	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	there you see fine 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact184	495.968	496.918	F	Postdoc	s^j	-1	0	there you see fine i'm sorry it's 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact185	497.311	501.131	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and and you know and contrast a different and all also ever tenants these she talked about differences 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact186	501.131	504.011	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	she talked about differences of these types that they're just different styles and it's uh you 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact187	504.011	508.991	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and it's uh you can't impose a model of their of the ideal being no overlaps 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact188	509.201	511.491	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know conversation us also agree with that since 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact189	511.491	513.811	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	agree with that since universe like i agree with and 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact190	513.991	514.771	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	i agree with and and also i can 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact191	514.771	516.171	F	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	and also i can i can say university but anyway the people who 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact192	516.171	520.621	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but anyway the people who used to say was strict um now uh don't i mean they 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact193	520.801	528.991	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	don't i mean they they also it you know uh uh acknowledge see influences it's a cultural norms and cross cultural norms and things 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact194	529.665	537.878	F	Postdoc	s	+1	2	so um then it becomes so so just just superficial you give um couple ideas of the types overlaps involved i have at the bottom several that i noticed though 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact195	537.878	540.626	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	several that i noticed though other back channels like what i just now and um 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact196	540.626	546.01	F	Postdoc	fh|s	+1	1	just now and um um anticipating the end of the question and simply answering earlier and there's several those 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact197	546.01	548.2	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and there's several those in this in these data work because we're 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact198	547.745	548.095	B	PhD	b	-1	0	in this in these data work because we're 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact199	548.42	550.37	F	Postdoc	s^df^rt	-1	0	because we're people who've talk to each other um 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact200	550.87	556.45	F	Postdoc	s^df^e	-1	0	other um we know basically what the topic is what the possibilities are and and we've spoken with each other so we know basically 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact201	556.45	558.97	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	other so we know basically what the the person style is likely to be and 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact202	558.97	563.075	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	is likely to be and so and to there are a number of places where someone just answered early the 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact203	563.98	564.35	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	the problem and places 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact204	564.729	571.18	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	problem and places also which i thought were interesting where two or more people gave exactly the same answer in unison different words of course but you know the basically 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact205	571.18	576.64	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but you know the basically you know everyone's saying yes or you know or you even more specific than that 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact206	577.223	588.253	F	Postdoc	s	+1	2	so uh the point is that um overlaps not necessarily a bad thing and that it would be a useful to subdivide these further and see if they're habitual differences in styles with respect the types involved that's all i want 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact207	588.373	590.713	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that's all i want to san less people question 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact208	591.548	604.452	D	Professor	s	+1	2	well of course the the biggest um results here which is one we've we've talked about many times in this new to us but i think would be interesting to show someone who isn't familiar with this just the sheer number overlaps oh yep 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact209	604.27	604.58	H	Grad	b	-1	0	oh yep 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact212	605.087	607.137	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	that do that right that that um here's a relatively interesting 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact210	604.741	605.131	E	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	that do that right oh interesting yep 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact211	604.84	605.94	F	Postdoc	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	that do that right oh interesting yep 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact213	605.516	605.996	E	PhD	b	-1	0	that do that right interesting 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact214	607.477	608.937	D	Professor	s	+1	0	here's a relatively short meetings 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact215	608.937	612.147	D	Professor	s	+1	1	short meetings uh forty forty plus minute meeting and not only hundred ninety 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact216	612.147	622.35	D	Professor	s^rt	+1	0	and not only were there two hundred and fifteen overlaps but uh i think there's one one minute there where there where where there wasn't any overlap i mean it's hundred ninety so 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact217	612.4	613.46	H	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	and not only were there two hundred and hundred ninety so 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact218	622.35	625.08	D	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	@reject@ i mean it's uh throughout this thing it's yeah well at the bottom you have the bottom

Bmr007.D.dialogueact268	732.413	732.823	D	Professor	s^cs.%	-1	0	own thing 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact269	734.203	734.363	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	used to to spend 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact270	734.339	743.518	G	PhD	s	-1	0	yes used to to spend minutes um so if an overlap travels the boundary between two minutes that counts towards both 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact271	735.972	736.392	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yes minutes um so if an overlap 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact272	740.882	741.182	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	two minutes that counts towards 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact273	744.114	749.813	F	Postdoc	s^ar	-1	0	actually um actually not 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact274	750.33	758.277	F	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	0	uh so it was it was think about the case where a. start speaking and then be overlaps with day and then the minute boundary happens and 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact275	758.837	766.117	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and let's say that after that minute boundary um be still speaking and a overlaps would be that would be a new 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact276	766.479	767.599	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	that would be a new overlap 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact277	768.499	775.519	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	but otherwise um let's say be comes to the conclusion of that turn without anyone overlapping with him or her in 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact278	776.024	778.424	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	which case there would be no overlap counted in the second minute but suppose they both 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact279	777.749	786.538	G	PhD	s	-1	0	overlap counted in the second minute but suppose they both talk simultaneously both a portion of it is a minute one 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact280	787.284	787.604	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	okay in that case 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact281	787.684	795.268	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	okay in that case um my the coding that i was using since we haven't uh incorporated adams uh coding overlap yet decoding of 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact282	797.019	798.119	F	Postdoc	s^t1	-1	0	it's not a word 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact283	798.445	806.681	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	because we have incorporated adams method of handling overeat or laps yet um then that would have fallen through the crap cracks it would be 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact284	806.681	813.471	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	cracks it would be an underestimates other number of overlaps because um i i wouldn't be able to pick it up from the way it was encoded so far we just haven't done 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact286	813.631	814.261	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	so far we just haven't done it the precise 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact285	813.541	818.071	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	i'm i'm i'm confused now so so far we just haven't done it the precise second to second i'll second a second coating of when they occur 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact287	816.507	817.037	D	Professor	%--	-1	0	i'm i'm second a second coating of when they occur 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact288	817.497	818.777	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i'm i'm i'm confused now so coating of when they occur 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact289	818.837	822.427	D	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	i'm confused now so let me restate what i thought interesting and and see uhhuh 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact290	820.993	821.283	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	thought interesting and and uhhuh 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact291	823.092	833.005	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	let's say that in in second fifty seven of one minute you start talking and i start talking and we ignore each other and keep on talking for six seconds so we go yep 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact292	826.163	826.353	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	of one minute yep 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact293	829.526	829.696	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	talking and 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact294	832.687	832.997	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	for six seconds 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact295	833.609	839.109	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so we go over so we were we were talking over one another and it's just in each case is just sort of one interval right uhhuh 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact297	839.489	839.729	D	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right uhhuh 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact296	839.482	839.702	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	right uhhuh 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact298	840.452	843.482	D	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	so um we talked over the minute boundary 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact299	844.26	849.03	D	Professor	qy	+1	0	is this considered as one overlap in each of the minutes away have done no i wouldn't 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact300	849.152	849.582	F	Postdoc	s^ar	+1	0	no i wouldn't 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact301	850.26	852.12	F	Postdoc	s^nd	+1	0	okay so that's it would be considers overlapping the first one 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact302	852.64	857.32	D	Professor	s	-1	0	that's good yeah because see overall ratings yeah okay so that's good and i think in this sense that i think andres meant the question yeah they're not double counting other otherwise you'd get statistical yep 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact303	853.62	856.35	B	PhD	s^aa|s^na.%--	-1	0	that's good yeah because see overall ratings yeah good and i think in this sense that i think andres meant the question statistical yep

Bmr007.B.dialogueact317	859.704	859.944	B	PhD	%	-1	0	yeah definitely 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact316	859.488	860.708	G	PhD	s	-1	0	i should also say yeah definitely harder 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact318	860.047	860.297	D	Professor	b	-1	0	i should also say harder 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact319	860.072	860.492	E	PhD	b	-1	0	i should also say harder 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact320	860.408	868.632	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i should also say i did a simple fine uh count in that if it was speaking be overlapped with a a and then a came back again overlapping be again i harder 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact321	868.782	874.652	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	be again i i didn't count that as a three person overlap i count that as a too personal relapse and it was eight being overlap with by d. 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact322	872.228	872.558	H	Grad	b	-1	0	relapse and it was 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact323	875.458	883.488	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	because the idea was the first speaker had the floor and the second person started speaking and then the first person race or the floor kind of thing these 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact325	884.346	884.676	B	PhD	b	-1	0	are simple thing assumptions 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact324	883.994	885.144	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	kind of thing these are simple thing assumptions didn't happen very often 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact326	885.144	886.054	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	didn't happen very often there maybe like three overlaps 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact327	886.054	888.614	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	there maybe like three overlaps affected that way the whole thing i 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact328	889.052	890.822	H	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	want to go back and listen to minute forty one 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact329	891.208	891.868	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yeah yeah 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact330	892.042	896.522	H	Grad	s	+1	0	because it i find it interesting that there were a large number of overlaps and they were all too speaker 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact331	892.68	892.86	D	Professor	b	-1	0	because it i 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact332	897.515	906.269	H	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah to interesting interesting know what i thought what i would have thought in is that when they were a large number of overlaps because everyone was talking at once but uh apparently not that's really neat 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact333	899.45	900.32	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	interesting interesting have thought in is that when they were 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact334	900.819	901.319	F	Postdoc	s^ba^r	-1	0	interesting is that when they were a large number of overlaps 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact335	903.572	903.842	E	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah talking at once 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact336	904.082	904.352	E	PhD	b	-1	0	to but uh 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact337	906.073	906.383	E	PhD	b	-1	0	that's really neat 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact338	906.269	906.989	H	Grad	s	-1	0	that's really neat 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact340	907.447	907.617	D	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah there's a lot of back this is 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact339	907.298	909.528	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	yeah there's a lot of back channel a lot of a lot of this is really interesting yeah 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact341	907.66	909.34	H	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah there's a lot of back channel a lot of a lot of this is really interesting yeah 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact342	910.178	910.558	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	i think yeah it is i think so too 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact344	910.834	920.541	B	PhD	s	-1	0	i think it's really interesting though is before saying yes meetings have a lot of overlaps is to actually find out how many more we have and to party because into party yeah it is i think so too 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact343	910.558	911.478	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	i think it's really interesting yeah it is i think so too 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact345	920.541	926.441	B	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	to party because into party conversation like switch where there's an awful lot too if you just look at that challenges you consider those overlaps 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact346	927.071	928.371	B	PhD	s	-1	0	it's also very it's huge it's just that 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact347	928.411	934.501	B	PhD	s	-1	0	it's just that people haven't been looking at that because they've been doing single channel processing speech recognition 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact348	932.536	932.936	H	Grad	b	-1	0	channel processing 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact349	933.468	933.788	D	Professor	b	-1	0	speech recognition 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact350	935.041	943.78	B	PhD	s	+1	2	the question is you know how many more overlaps do you have of say the two person typed by adding more people to a meeting and 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact351	944.01	946.99	B	PhD	s	-1	0	it may be a lot more about it it may it may not be well 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact352	946.866	949.676	D	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	it may not be so well but see i find it interesting even if it wasn't anymore because 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact353	948.142	948.502	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	so interesting even if it wasn't 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact354	949.676	956.547	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	anymore because since we were doing was full duplex sort of thing and switchboard where it was just all separated out we just everything was just nice so the city 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact355	954.973	955.263	B	PhD	b	-1	0	out we just everything was 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact356	956.547	959.997	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	well it's not really just nice so the city issue is in in a situation where the that's 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact357	959.209	960.729	B	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	well it's not really nice it depends where the that's 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact358	960.729	961.699	B	PhD	s	-1	0	nice it depends what you're doing so if you 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact359	961.699	964.129	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	what you're doing so if you were actually having 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact360	964.519	964.869	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr007.B.dialogueact361	965.389	966.349	B	PhD	s	-1	0	depends what you're doing it 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact362	966.349	970.474	B	PhD	s	-1	0	it right now where do we have individual on the people that's me so the question 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact364	970.824	977.255	B	PhD	s	-1	0	me so the question is you know are they really were overlaps happening then there would be in a two person probably and and there may but let let 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact363	970.699	971.019	D	Professor	b	-1	0	me so the question is you know are 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact366	977.255	978.815	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and and there may well be but let let me rephrase i'm saying something 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact365	977.078	980.078	D	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	and and there may well be but let let me rephrase i'm saying something and getting across what what what 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact367	980.078	983.378	D	Professor	s	-1	0	what what what should use words like nice it's to do besides what what i mean is 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact368	983.378	991.684	D	Professor	s	+1	0	what what i mean is that um in switchboard despite the many many other problems we have one problem that we're not considering is over 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact369	992.907	998.037	D	Professor	s	+1	2	and what we're doing now is besides and many other differences in task we are considering overlap and one of the reasons 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact370	998.446	1014.42	D	Professor	s	+1	0	and one of the reasons they were considering it you know one of them and all of them one of them is that uh at least you know i'm very interested in this scenario in which but people talking here pretty much equally audible from a single microphone 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact371	1015.24	1022.39	D	Professor	s	+1	0	and so in that case it does get mixed and and it's pretty hard to just to just ignore it just to processing on one and on the other 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact372	1023.12	1026.55	B	PhD	s	+1	0	i i agree that it's an issue here but it's also an issue for switchboard and if you 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact373	1026.55	1036.49	B	PhD	s	-1	0	switchboard and if you think of meetings being recorded over the telephone which i think you know this whole point of studying meetings isn't just that people in a room but to also have meetings over the phone line maybe 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact374	1030.68	1031.09	D	Professor	b	-1	0	you know this whole point of studying 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact375	1036.97	1040.54	B	PhD	s	-1	0	line maybe far from like people want interest in that but all the dialogue is just still apply that each 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact376	1040.31	1040.6	D	Professor	b	-1	0	apply that each 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact377	1040.86	1046.17	B	PhD	s	-1	0	apply that each of us was calling and having and 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact378	1047.01	1054.99	B	PhD	s	-1	0	just the question is even switchboard you would think that's the simplest case of a meeting more than one person and 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact379	1053.51	1053.84	D	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr007.B.dialogueact380	1054.99	1063.68	B	PhD	s	-1	0	more than one person and i'm wondering how much more overlap of the types that that she described happen with more people presence it maybe 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact381	1063.68	1068.85	B	PhD	s	+1	2	presence it maybe that having three people is very different from having two people or may not be 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact382	1069.12	1070.21	D	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	so that's important question to ask think secretive applause really 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact384	1070.58	1071.19	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	so think secretive applause really saying is that i don't 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact383	1070.21	1073.83	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so think secretive applause really saying is that i don't think we were considering that switchboard 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact385	1074.47	1075.37	B	PhD	s^arp	-1	0	not you but but where are you so it wasn't 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact388	1075.73	1076.64	B	PhD	fg	-1	0	but but but where are you so it wasn't in the design 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact386	1075.64	1075.88	D	Professor	qy.%-	-1	0	but but where are you so it wasn't 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact387	1075.72	1077.01	H	Grad	s	-1	0	but but but where are you where you where you where you so it wasn't in the design 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact389	1077.28	1078.85	D	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	where you where you where you are we measuring i mean 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact390	1078.85	1079.56	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	there there's are we measuring i mean 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact391	1079.47	1080.24	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	there there's 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact392	1081.35	1085.94	B	PhD	s^na.%--	-1	0	actually to tell you the truth the reason why it's hard to measure is because 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact393	1086.95	1094.91	B	PhD	s	+1	1	so from the point of view upsetting dialogue which in kendra so i had some projects on you want i know the sequence of turn 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact394	1092.19	1092.39	D	Professor	b	-1	0	you want i know 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact395	1095.54	1105.19	B	PhD	s	+1	0	so what happens is if you're talking and i have a back channel in the middle of your turn and then you keep going what it looks like in the dialogue model is your turn and then my back channel even though i've action 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact396	1099.51	1099.83	D	Professor	b	-1	0	and then you 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact397	1105.19	1107.79	B	PhD	s	+1	0	even though i've action like are completely inside your track 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact398	1108.08	1108.37	D	Professor	b	-1	0	so 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact399	1108.87	1115.07	B	PhD	s	+1	1	so for things like language smiling or die like modeling it's we know that that's wrong in real time but because 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact400	1114.23	1114.38	D	Professor	b	-1	0	in real time 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact401	1115.53	1124.84	B	PhD	s	+1	0	but because they crucifix imitations that were done and the fact that somebody could seagate in switchboard were missing people can study but that 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact402	1124.84	1127.48	B	PhD	s	-1	0	can study but that doesn't mean in the real world that people don't talk that way so yeah i was saying 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact404	1127.83	1129.57	B	PhD	fh|s.%-	-1	0	that way so it is um yeah i was saying that right i just saying that we're now we're 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact403	1127.49	1128.19	D	Professor	fg|s^ng	-1	0	that way so it is yeah i was saying that right i 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact405	1128.64	1128.91	D	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	it is that right i 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact406	1128.91	1130.61	D	Professor	s	-1	0	it is um that right i just saying that we're now we're looking at 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact407	1131.91	1132.59	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	well we've all right we're and and and 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact408	1131.91	1138.11	D	Professor	s	-1	0	well we've all right we're looking at here and and and you you maybe wanted to look at it before but for these various technical reasons terms other day it was you were so that's why 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact409	1132.68	1133.0	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	we've all right we're looking at here and and you you maybe wanted 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact410	1133.0	1134.04	B	PhD	s^na	-1	0	looking at here you you maybe wanted to look at it before 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact411	1138.71	1140.31	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so that's why coming to us is new even though 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact412	1140.65	1145.86	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	um even though it may well be you know if you're if you're classes are offering it right 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact413	1145.35	1145.67	B	PhD	b	-1	0	um it right 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact414	1145.86	1152.37	D	Professor	s	-1	0	um it right if it's an oprah hypothesis and it's actually you have as much overlap two person we don't know the answer to that threesome you don't know the 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact415	1152.37	1156.23	D	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah i meant is that that threesome you don't know the answer to is because it wasn't studied was the study because there some sort of 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact416	1155.19	1168.96	B	PhD	fg|s^df	-1	0	yeah i meant is that if you're asking the question from the point of view of what's different on a meeting studying meetings of see more than two people versus what kind of questions you can ask that the two person meeting because there some sort of 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact417	1161.3	1161.68	D	Professor	b	-1	0	studying 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact418	1169.7	1177.7	B	PhD	s	+1	0	it's important to distinguish that you know this project it's getting a lot of overlap but other projects for two but we just of study that may have 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact420	1177.87	1178.54	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	study that uh may have been may have been 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact419	1177.75	1178.3	D	Professor	s^am	-1	0	study that uh may have been may have been 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact421	1178.52	1179.06	D	Professor	s^am^r	-1	0	uh well been may have been and we don't we 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact422	1179.06	1179.34	D	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	well and we don't we 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact424	1179.7	1181.17	B	PhD	h|s	-1	0	well there is a higher rate so it's and we don't we don't know the numbers 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact423	1179.61	1180.88	D	Professor	s	-1	0	well there is a higher rate and we don't we don't know the numbers 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact425	1181.27	1181.59	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	so it's 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact426	1181.73	1183.79	B	PhD	s^no	-1	0	well if i so it's but i don't know how high in fact 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact427	1183.46	1184.78	A	PhD	s	-1	0	well if i have a question in fact that would be 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact428	1184.41	1186.12	B	PhD	s	-1	0	have a question that would be interesting i mean it that that made my 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact429	1185.07	1186.36	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	interesting i mean it that that made my 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact430	1186.86	1190.36	D	Professor	s	-1	0	that made my point was just if you want to say somebody what are we learned about overlaps here just 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact431	1190.83	1192.48	D	Professor	s^co	-1	0	here just never run comparison something else both 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact432	1192.54	1192.86	B	PhD	b	-1	0	else both 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact433	1192.84	1197.08	D	Professor	s	+1	2	else both learn about is over lessons situations that the first the first order thing i would say is that there's a lot of 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact435	1198.68	1198.82	D	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact434	1198.67	1198.98	E	PhD	b	-1	0	right 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact436	1199.27	1201.82	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah i i don't do @reject@ in in the sense that if you said it it it it 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact437	1200.66	1203.78	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah i i don't do @reject@ agree with that if you said it it it it well i guess what i'm comparing to is more the common sense 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact438	1201.82	1206.82	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i i don't do @reject@ agree with that it it it well i guess what i'm comparing to is more the common sense notion of how how much people over land 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact439	1207.34	1214.96	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh you know the fact that when when when uh and was looking for stretches of speech before the didn't have any overlaps and we use having such a hard time 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact440	1215.52	1218.14	D	Professor	s	-1	0	right that's also true switchboard and now i look at this think go well i can see life having such a hard time happening a lot 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact441	1217.42	1217.65	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right life having such a hard time 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact442	1218.09	1219.26	B	PhD	s	-1	0	that's also true switchboard it may happening a lot i was 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact443	1218.14	1218.84	D	Professor	s	-1	0	that's also true switchboard happening a lot 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact445	1219.79	1220.59	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	it may not be right i was a wasn't 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact444	1219.74	1220.43	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	it may not be right i was a wasn't 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact446	1220.89	1221.16	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	not be right so it's just a wasn't right 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact447	1221.16	1222.83	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so it's just uh right i was telling about that 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact448	1221.23	1221.45	D	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	so it's just right 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact449	1222.31	1223.21	D	Professor	s	-1	0	uh i i was telling about that 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact450	1223.85	1224.12	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i thing i say if i 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact452	1224.78	1226.13	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	thing is that @reject@ i say if i i say if i have this complicated thing in front 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact451	1224.49	1231.72	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	thing is that @reject@ i say if i i say if i have this complicated thing in front of me and we should which you know we're going to get much more sophisticated about when we get lots more data 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact453	1232.49	1240.82	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and i was going to describe somebody what did you learn right here about you know the the modest amount it was analyze and say well first order thing is there's a lot of overlaps in fact 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact454	1240.82	1249.45	D	Professor	s	+1	2	right lot of overlaps in fact it's not just an overlap bunch of overlap second order thing is it's not just a bunch of overlaps in one particular point but that there's overlaps uh throughout the thing and that's 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact455	1247.09	1247.39	H	Grad	b	-1	0	but that there's overlaps 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact457	1249.82	1250.18	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	right no i i agree with the thing and that's interesting 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact458	1250.18	1251.2	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	no i i agree with that i just interesting 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact456	1249.8	1250.4	D	Professor	s	-1	0	right no i i agree with the thing and that's interesting 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact459	1250.59	1250.82	D	Professor	s	-1	0	no i i agree with interesting 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact460	1251.46	1258.41	B	PhD	s	-1	0	that i just saying that it made the reason you get overlaps may or may not be due to sort of the number of people in the meeting 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact461	1257.72	1257.97	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	of people in the 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact463	1259.24	1260.55	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and that's all and and it would that was making statement about 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact462	1258.78	1258.98	D	Professor	s^aa^r	-1	0	meeting 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact464	1259.56	1260.91	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	and that's all and and it would that was making statement about 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact465	1260.55	1262.46	B	PhD	s	-1	0	that's all and and it would actually be interesting to find out because statement about 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact466	1261.0	1261.08	D	Professor	b	-1	0	actually be interesting to find 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact467	1262.46	1268.64	B	PhD	s	-1	0	out because data say switchboard which isn't exactly the same kind of contact me neither to 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact468	1268.64	1270.76	B	PhD	s	-1	0	of contact me neither to people who don't know each other and stuff 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact469	1271.64	1283.84	B	PhD	s	+1	2	but we should still be able to say what what is the outer construct contribution to serve overlap of each additional person @reject@ yeah that's a good to senility we can't no i could certainly see it going 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact470	1282.26	1282.5	H	Grad	b	-1	0	person @reject@ yeah i could 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact472	1282.89	1283.64	D	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	person @reject@ yeah that's a good to senility we can't no i could certainly see it going 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact474	1283.44	1283.6	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	that's a good to senility we can't no certainly see it going 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact475	1283.64	1284.02	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	that's a good to senility we can't no well yeah i certainly see it going either way 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact473	1283.33	1284.06	F	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	that's a good to senility we can't no well yeah i certainly see it going either way 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact471	1282.87	1284.66	H	Grad	s	-1	0	person @reject@ yeah that's a good to senility we can't no well yeah i i could certainly see it going either way 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact476	1284.44	1286.09	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	well yeah i i agree i agree them and the reason is because i either way 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact477	1285.07	1285.76	B	PhD	b	-1	0	i agree i agree them 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact478	1285.87	1286.35	E	PhD	b	-1	0	i agree i agree them and the reason is because i 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact479	1286.09	1292.24	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and the reason is because i think there's a limit there's an upper bound on how many can have simply from the standpoint of bought ability when we speak we 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact480	1292.24	1295.54	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	when we speak we we do make a judgment of can't as adults me children don't 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact482	1292.94	1293.31	B	PhD	b	-1	0	when we speak we we do make a judgment 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact481	1292.73	1293.0	D	Professor	b	-1	0	when we speak we we do make a judgment 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact483	1295.54	1296.7	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	adults me children don't address a well i mean 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact484	1296.82	1305.8	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	address a well i mean if a truck grows rolling past adults will depending but mostly self will will will hold off to what to finish seeing this until until the noises past and i fascinating 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact485	1299.36	1299.95	D	Professor	b	-1	0	adults will 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact486	1305.8	1310.72	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	the noises past and i fascinating we generally do monitor things like that about whether we whether our potters will be in the clear or not 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact487	1308.48	1308.74	B	PhD	b	-1	0	that about whether we 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact488	1311.05	1313.33	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and partly is related to rhythmic structure in conversation so you 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact489	1313.33	1324.0	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	well so you know you you it's also uh people tend to time they're they're they're um when they come into the conversation based on the overall rhythmic uh i andi i think so you don't want to be cross 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact490	1316.73	1316.91	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	well people tend 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact491	1323.21	1323.49	B	PhD	b	-1	0	i andi i think 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact492	1324.26	1325.41	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so you don't want to be cross cutting and and 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact493	1325.69	1336.14	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	cutting and and just to finish this that um that i think that there may be an upper bound on how many overlaps you can have simply from the standpoint of odd ability and how allow the other people are who are already in break but you know 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact494	1336.58	1337.84	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	but you know of certain types now if 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact495	1337.84	1345.58	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	of certain types now if it's just back channels people maybe doing that with less intention of being heard just sort of spontaneously doing back channels 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact496	1346.03	1349.47	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	in which case that those might i mean be no upper bound on the i i have a feeling 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact497	1349.11	1364.48	G	PhD	s	-1	0	people actually actually on the i i have a feeling that back channels which are the vast majority of overlaps switchboard i don't play it girl here because it's very unnatural i think too back channel it in a multi audience you know in a multi person 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact498	1363.64	1365.05	B	PhD	s	-1	0	people actually actually wasn't so if you 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact499	1365.23	1365.72	B	PhD	s	-1	0	wasn't so if you 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact500	1365.72	1369.38	B	PhD	s	-1	0	wasn't so if you watch people i'm i'm like right right like this here but 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact501	1366.07	1366.39	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	watch people i'm i'm 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact502	1367.83	1368.23	E	PhD	b	-1	0	like right right like this here 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact503	1369.38	1372.34	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	but but but it's a lot it's fun person speaking and 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact504	1370.18	1370.59	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	but but 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact505	1370.43	1374.09	G	PhD	s	-1	0	but but it's a lot it's fun person speaking and everybody's this thing 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact506	1374.09	1377.42	G	PhD	s	-1	0	actually unusual to have everybody going 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact507	1377.72	1379.77	D	Professor	s	-1	0	actually i think i've done it for a number of times today 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact509	1380.43	1380.83	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact508	1380.06	1380.18	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact510	1381.19	1382.91	B	PhD	s	-1	0	there's a lot of had not 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact511	1381.28	1381.74	H	Grad	b	-1	0	there's a lot of had not 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact512	1382.93	1383.35	G	PhD	b	-1	0	yep 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact513	1383.29	1385.09	H	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	in in the two person yep detractors track 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact514	1385.07	1386.15	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	in in the two person 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact515	1385.63	1385.83	E	PhD	b	-1	0	in in the two person 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact516	1387.0	1388.45	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	good good plus plus plus that 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact517	1387.03	1388.39	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	good good plus plus plus that 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact518	1388.86	1389.35	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	good that yeah so so actually 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact519	1389.35	1396.35	G	PhD	s	+1	0	yeah so so actually um that's in part because the nodding if you have visual contact the nodding have the same talks about on the phone 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact520	1396.35	1399.12	G	PhD	s	-1	0	about on the phone the switchboard you you that would work so yeah you don't have it 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact522	1399.12	1401.27	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so so you need to use the back so you don't have it yeah like this

Bmr007.A.dialogueact527	1410.88	1414.76	A	PhD	s	-1	0	the speech or because my guess is sometimes it happens when there's a pause take for example on your here thank you

Bmr007.A.dialogueact533	1415.37	1418.04	A	PhD	s	-1	0	you know like yeah you get a lot of back channel and somebody deposit 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact534	1415.87	1416.12	B	PhD	b	-1	0	you know like yeah you get a lot of back channel 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact535	1417.01	1417.37	B	PhD	b	-1	0	and somebody deposit

Bmr007.A.dialogueact539	1423.64	1423.76	A	PhD	qy^d^g^j	-1	0	do both 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact540	1424.32	1435.84	A	PhD	fh|s.%--	+1	0	um this know when when when there's back channel i mean just i was just listening and then there's two people talking and there's back channel it seems like um the back channel happens when you know the pitch drops and the first person 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact541	1425.15	1425.42	B	PhD	b	-1	0	know when when when 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact542	1436.43	1440.89	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and a lot of times the first person actually stopped talking and then there's the back channel and then they start up again so 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact543	1440.89	1444.14	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and then they start up again so i'm wondering about i just wonder how much overlap there is is there a lot 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact544	1444.39	1445.05	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	is there a lot i think there's 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact545	1445.59	1459.13	B	PhD	s^na	+1	0	i think there's a lot of the kind that has they was talking about where it's called precision timing and they come in overlapping but at a point where information is mostly oh you're 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact546	1459.7	1465.29	B	PhD	s	+1	0	uhhuh oh you're missing is um last syllables or something so technically 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact547	1462.88	1463.65	A	PhD	b	-1	0	or something 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact548	1465.38	1465.77	A	PhD	b	-1	0	uhhuh so technically 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact549	1465.75	1467.08	B	PhD	s	+1	0	uhhuh so technically it's an overlap 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact551	1468.12	1469.71	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	but maybe it's just a small overlapping 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact550	1468.09	1473.79	B	PhD	s	+1	0	but maybe it's just a small overlapping oh did you think it'd be interesting 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact552	1469.78	1470.49	E	PhD	b	-1	0	overlapping 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact553	1473.25	1475.34	H	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	oh did you think more in terms of alignment alignment it'd be interesting if we could do prediction 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact554	1473.75	1476.46	A	PhD	s	-1	0	oh did you think more in terms of alignment alignment over it'd be interesting if we could do prediction language 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact555	1476.55	1476.88	B	PhD	b	-1	0	over language 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact556	1476.93	1479.72	H	Grad	s	+1	1	over so so language model prediction of overlap that would be really interesting 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact557	1479.48	1480.55	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	well that's exactly so so interesting 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact559	1480.11	1487.26	B	PhD	s^na	+1	1	well that's exactly exactly why we wanted to say that precise timing of overlaps and and so so here's right 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact558	1479.72	1479.88	D	Professor	b	-1	0	so so interesting 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact560	1483.89	1484.14	G	PhD	b	-1	0	that precise timing of overlaps right 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact561	1484.46	1484.74	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	of overlaps right 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact563	1487.42	1488.53	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so so here's a here's the first 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact562	1487.4	1490.94	G	PhD	s	+1	0	so so here's a here's the first interesting labeling tasks 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact564	1491.22	1505.77	G	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	uh to distinguish between say back channels decision timing's those you know benevolent overlaps and and and and and so this um i don't know pasta i love the last for someone's trying to grab the floor from someone else pick a different word 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact565	1491.24	1491.6	H	Grad	b	-1	0	uh to distinguish 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact566	1499.25	1500.17	H	Grad	s^j^t3	-1	0	and and and so this um pick a different word 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact567	1505.39	1505.6	E	PhD	b	-1	0	from someone else 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact568	1506.55	1509.51	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	still takeovers yeah yeah uh that that might be an interesting um problem to look at 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact570	1509.04	1510.0	A	PhD	s^j	-1	0	still takeovers yeah yeah yeah well i mean you could do look at 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact569	1509.02	1509.31	E	PhD	b	-1	0	still takeovers yeah yeah look at 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact572	1509.93	1510.16	D	Professor	b	-1	0	still takeovers yeah yeah yeah well i mean you could do look at 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact571	1509.9	1510.16	E	PhD	b	-1	0	still takeovers yeah yeah yeah well i mean you could do look at 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact574	1510.57	1510.79	E	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah well i mean you could do 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact573	1510.4	1511.28	F	Postdoc	s^ng	-1	0	yeah well i mean you could do i i i think that 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact575	1511.28	1516.13	F	Postdoc	s^nd	-1	0	i i i think that in this meeting i really had the feeling that wasn't happening that that hostile hostile type these were these 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact576	1516.21	1521.32	F	Postdoc	s^nd	+1	2	these were these were benevolent types of people finishing each other's senses and i i could imagine that is that there's a fair 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact577	1516.31	1516.79	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	these were these 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact578	1517.03	1517.97	B	PhD	b	-1	0	were benevolent types 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact579	1520.01	1536.86	G	PhD	fg|s^df^nd	-1	0	and i could imagine that is that there's a fair number of um cases where i'm this is so it's not really hustle bustle of competitive where one person is finishing something and you have like two or three people jumping trying to trying to time true uh crap the next turn trying to get the floor 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact580	1533.9	1534.81	H	Grad	s^2	-1	0	people jumping trying to trying to time trying to get the floor 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact581	1537.22	1537.43	D	Professor	b	-1	0	and 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact582	1538.07	1542.66	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so it's not against the person who talk first because actually while waiting for that person to finish 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact583	1543.04	1544.5	G	PhD	s	-1	0	i have a but they all want to be next 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact584	1544.87	1554.99	D	Professor	s^na	+1	0	i have a feeling most of these things are that that are not well kind our our our uh um our our competitive as opposed to really really really hostile yeah next 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact585	1554.09	1554.46	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	really hostile yeah 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact588	1555.26	1556.94	A	PhD	qw^d	-1	0	wonder what determines who gets i agree i agree

Bmr007.D.dialogueact600	1569.61	1569.95	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact601	1571.05	1579.37	D	Professor	s	+1	1	yeah thinking thinking was that um these all these interesting questions are of course pretty hard to answer with uh you know a small amount of data 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact602	1579.83	1579.89	H	Grad	b	-1	0	data 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact603	1580.65	1593.27	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so um i wonder if what you're saying suggests that we should make a conscious attempt to have um a fair number of meetings a smaller number right 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact604	1593.89	1594.18	D	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	right i mean we 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact605	1594.18	1600.29	D	Professor	s	+1	0	i mean we most of our meetings are uh meetings currently with say five six seven eight people should we 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact606	1600.79	1610.49	D	Professor	qy^cs	+1	0	should we really try to have some two person meetings person to person meetings and they record them just to to to beef up the the statistics on this control 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact607	1608.54	1609.2	F	Postdoc	s^t3	-1	0	to beef up the the statistics this control 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact608	1611.79	1613.81	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	well it seems like there are two possibilities i mean 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact609	1613.81	1623.88	F	Postdoc	s^ng	-1	0	i mean it seems like if you have just two people it's not really like a meeting with is not a similar as the rest of the uh the sample it 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact610	1624.15	1625.65	F	Postdoc	s^arp	-1	0	it depends on what you're after course but 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact611	1625.65	1630.9	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	course but seems like that would be more case of the control condition compared to uh an experimental station with more than two 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact612	1628.56	1629.09	H	Grad	b	-1	0	compared to uh an experimental station 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact613	1631.38	1638.18	D	Professor	s	-1	0	well this is raising the question of of whether it's it's the number there's a relationship between the number of people in in number of overlaps type of overlaps and and uhhuh 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact614	1637.17	1637.46	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	type of overlaps uhhuh 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact615	1638.79	1643.85	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and and um if you had two people meeting in this kind of circumstance and you still have the visual c. wouldn't 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact616	1643.85	1648.39	D	Professor	s	-1	0	have the visual c. wouldn't have that difference also that half and intimate support 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact618	1649.18	1650.25	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah i'm just thinking that be more like i control condition 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact617	1648.82	1649.09	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	yeah i'm just thinking that be more 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact619	1649.21	1651.16	F	Postdoc	s^nd	-1	0	yeah i'm just thinking that be more like i control condition

Bmr007.E.dialogueact623	1652.44	1652.91	E	PhD	b	-1	0	well but from the acoustic 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact622	1652.36	1654.97	H	Grad	s	-1	0	well but from the acoustic point of view it's all good 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact624	1654.95	1655.63	E	PhD	s^2^aa	-1	0	because the same it's all good 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact625	1655.78	1656.72	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	because you can fine but the same if if 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact627	1656.72	1656.83	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	you can fine but if if 
Bmr007.G.dialogueact626	1656.65	1664.23	G	PhD	s	+1	0	you can fine but if if the goal or two just because at overlap you would you could service of save yourself a lot of time and not even trying to transcribe the words 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact629	1666.1	1671.08	B	PhD	s	+1	0	well i think you should be able to do this been working well that's the that was my

Bmr007.D.dialogueact643	1681.45	1683.2	D	Professor	fg|qo	-1	0	what what do you think about that do you think that would be useful 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact645	1683.2	1684.05	D	Professor	qy	-1	0	that do you think that would be useful to think this next item 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact646	1684.05	1687.92	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i guess my my first coming to think this next item if whether we should try to record some meetings meeting or something 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact647	1686.78	1696.81	B	PhD	s^co	+1	0	i guess my my first coming was um only that we should not not attribute overlaps only two meetings with maybe to record some meetings meeting or something 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact648	1696.81	1697.82	B	PhD	s	-1	0	two meetings with maybe that's obvious maybe 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact649	1697.95	1699.69	B	PhD	s	-1	0	that's obvious maybe everybody knew that but that 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact650	1698.88	1699.16	D	Professor	b	-1	0	everybody knew that but that 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact651	1699.69	1705.87	B	PhD	s	+1	0	knew that but that in normal conversation is two people there's an awful lot of the same kind of overlap 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact653	1706.15	1720.04	B	PhD	s	+1	2	now that would be interesting look at whether there are these kinds of constraints the chain mentioned that what maybe additional people add to this competition it happens right after term you know like at 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact652	1706.08	1706.32	D	Professor	b	-1	0	now that would be interesting 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact654	1720.18	1722.48	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	you know like at five people i'm grabbing turned out pretty

Bmr007.D.dialogueact788	1938.47	1941.54	D	Professor	s^t^tc	-1	0	speaking of taking control you said you had some research yeah yeah i've been playing with um 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact789	1940.74	1940.83	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	some research yeah 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact791	1941.32	1941.41	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	yeah i've been playing with um 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact790	1940.96	1946.08	H	Grad	s	+1	2	some research yeah yeah i've been playing with um uh using the close talking mike to do to try security speaking so my first 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact792	1946.69	1951.35	H	Grad	s	+1	2	so my first attempt was just using fresh holding in filtering that we talked about it about two weeks ago and 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact793	1951.91	1961.78	H	Grad	s	-1	0	ago and so i play without a little bit and it works okay except that it's very sensitive to your choice of your filter with and you are threshold 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact794	1962.33	1968.3	H	Grad	s	+1	1	so if you fiddle around with it a little bit you get good numbers you can actually do a pretty good job of segment thing when someone's talking and when they're not but if you 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact795	1968.78	1971.86	H	Grad	s	+1	1	not but if you try to use the same parameters on another speaker doesn't work anymore even 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact796	1971.86	1975.5	H	Grad	s	+1	0	but work anymore even if you normalize it based on the absolute last this 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact797	1975.98	1978.5	B	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	but doesn't work for that one cigarette throughout the whole meeting this it does work 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact798	1978.63	1980.64	H	Grad	s^na	+1	1	meeting it does work for the one speaker throughout the whole meeting um 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact799	1981.03	1982.51	H	Grad	fh|s^na	-1	0	pretty well pretty well 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact801	1982.78	1983.6	A	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	well pretty well how 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact800	1982.67	1983.09	H	Grad	s^na^r	-1	0	well pretty well how 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact802	1984.0	1984.62	H	Grad	qw^bu^rt	-1	0	did i do it what do you mean 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact804	1984.75	1984.95	A	PhD	b	-1	0	did i do it what do you mean 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact803	1984.62	1985.15	H	Grad	qw^bu	-1	0	oh what what was the did i do it what do you mean 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact805	1985.34	1986.29	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	oh what what was the 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact806	1986.91	1994.87	H	Grad	s	+1	0	the rhythm was you uh take every frame that's over the threshold and then median filter it and then look for runs 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact807	1987.72	1988.01	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	the rhythm was you uh 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact808	1993.41	1993.76	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and then 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact809	1996.88	1998.2	H	Grad	s	+1	0	every frame that's over so there was a minimum run like so 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact810	1998.15	1999.66	A	PhD	qw^d^rt	-1	0	every frame that's over one special so the 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact811	1998.2	1998.44	H	Grad	%-	-1	0	every frame that's over so 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact812	2000.01	2001.07	H	Grad	s	-1	0	in terms of energy threshold that you pick 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact813	2001.54	2002.32	A	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	in terms of energy uh yeah 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact815	2002.71	2002.9	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh yeah 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact814	2002.37	2002.53	H	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	uh yeah 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact816	2003.07	2003.23	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr007.F.dialogueact817	2004.14	2004.63	F	Postdoc	s^br	-1	0	say that again came 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact818	2004.93	2006.12	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	say that again came over from so you take h. each frame 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact819	2005.82	2008.29	H	Grad	s	+1	0	over from so you take h. each frame and you compute d. n. or g. and if it's over the threshold 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact820	2008.29	2014.52	H	Grad	s	+1	0	okay or g. and if it's over the threshold you said it to one end of it under the threshold you said to zero then i have a bit stream of zeros and ones and 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact821	2012.25	2012.42	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	then i have a bit 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact822	2013.85	2014.15	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	okay stream of zeros and ones and 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact823	2014.94	2019.65	H	Grad	s	+1	0	and ones and then i me and filtered that using um a fairly long filter likes 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact824	2020.87	2025.14	H	Grad	fh|s	+1	0	uh well actually i just depends on what you mean by long you know tenth of a second sorts of numbers um 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact825	2025.74	2031.74	H	Grad	fh|s	+1	0	um and that's the average out you know pitch you know the bitch chocolates and things like that 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact826	2032.39	2034.92	H	Grad	s	+1	0	and then uh look for long runs 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact827	2035.99	2036.17	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr007.H.dialogueact828	2038.63	2046.72	H	Grad	s	+1	1	and that works okay if you feel if you tune the filter parameters if you tune how long you're median filter is and how high you're looking for your threshold is 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact829	2047.82	2051.2	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	did you ever try running the filter but for you pick a special no certainly 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact830	2051.36	2051.57	H	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	no certainly 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact831	2052.03	2052.68	H	Grad	s	-1	0	could though 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact832	2054.65	2058.68	H	Grad	s	-1	0	but this is just i had the program mostly written already so it was easy to do 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact833	2059.06	2068.13	H	Grad	s	+1	2	it and then the other thing i did was i took hobby years speaker change detector acoustic change detector and i implemented that with a close talking mikes and 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact834	2068.7	2073.32	H	Grad	s.%--	+1	1	and unfortunately that's not working real well and it looks like it's the problem 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact835	2073.74	2075.61	H	Grad	s	+1	0	the problem is he does into passes the first pass 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact836	2075.61	2078.69	H	Grad	s	+1	0	passes the first pass it defined candidate places to do a break 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact837	2079.58	2087.61	H	Grad	s	+1	0	and he does that using on underworld that doing broad phone classification he has uh be uh one of the phone classes of silence 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact838	2088.15	2090.81	H	Grad	s	-1	0	and so the possible breaks or where silence starts and ends 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact839	2091.4	2094.87	H	Grad	s	+1	0	and then he has a second pass which is a model laying down an extra model 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact840	2095.4	2102.84	H	Grad	fh|s	+1	0	um looking for uh whether it improves or or degrades to split at one of those particular places 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact841	2103.73	2111.59	H	Grad	s	+1	1	and what looks like it's happening is that the e. even on the close talking mike the broad phone class class or is doing a really bad job 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact842	2112.74	2113.49	A	PhD	qw	-1	0	was the train i have 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact843	2113.78	2114.52	H	Grad	h|s^no	-1	0	i have no idea i don't remember 
Bmr007.A.dialogueact845	2114.82	2115.23	A	PhD	b	-1	0	no idea i don't remember his 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact844	2114.75	2115.34	H	Grad	s^no	-1	0	no idea i don't remember his 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact846	2116.01	2117.13	H	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	do you remember morgan was it broadcast news 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact847	2117.13	2118.22	H	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	i think was it broadcast news 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact848	2118.72	2119.48	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	i think so yeah um 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact849	2119.83	2130.3	H	Grad	fg|s	+1	2	so yeah um so what area my next attempt which i am in the midst of it haven't quite finished yet was actually using b. uh fresh holding as a way of generating the candidates because 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact850	2131.04	2135.51	H	Grad	s	-1	0	one of the things that definitely happens is you put the threshold low you get lots of breaks all 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact851	2135.88	2138.11	H	Grad	s	-1	0	breaks all of which are definitely acoustic events there definitely 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact852	2138.66	2140.91	H	Grad	s	-1	0	there definitely someone talking 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact853	2141.33	2146.12	H	Grad	s	-1	0	but like it could be someone who isn't the person here but the person over there or can be the person breathing and 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact854	2146.9	2149.02	H	Grad	s	+1	0	and then feeding that into the acoustic change detector 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact855	2150.89	2151.96	H	Grad	s	-1	0	and so i think that might work 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact856	2152.79	2154.18	H	Grad	s	-1	0	but i haven't gotten very far on that 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact857	2155.71	2157.6	H	Grad	s	+1	2	but all of this is close talking mike so 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact858	2157.79	2158.11	H	Grad	fh	-1	0	mike so 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact859	2159.07	2162.18	H	Grad	s	-1	0	do you think we set up but it's uh just uh just trying to get some ground truth 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact860	2159.6	2162.07	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	do you think we set up but it's uh just uh just trying to get some ground truth 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact861	2162.19	2172.33	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but i i i i seen it when when you i. d. i. shows of this of the the speech phone p. d. a. and then garage coconut ice yeah 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact862	2172.33	2176.98	E	PhD	s	-1	0	coconut ice yeah they'll use it it could be different and it inducing uh oh absolutely 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact863	2176.76	2177.34	H	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	inducing uh um oh absolutely so 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact865	2177.47	2192.67	E	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	um but that that's it i i i mean the to you it in do makes it fun to go find to it sewn with it a good idea for them to notice energy so my intention to this isn't as an aid for ground truth not 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact864	2177.34	2181.02	H	Grad	s	+1	0	um but that that's it so my intention to this isn't as an aid for ground truth not 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact866	2181.55	2181.87	H	Grad	%-	-1	0	that's it not 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact867	2193.65	2206.63	E	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um i i seem to fuller and i wouldn't bicycle in the energy into mm and more or less like to it and it and so sun and the detective 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact868	2207.11	2207.6	H	Grad	qy^br^d^rt	-1	0	and say again 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact869	2207.83	2208.34	E	PhD	h	-1	0	and when say again 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact870	2208.65	2215.79	E	PhD	s	-1	0	when you did did the to the and the and the fess up to d. until all of the that the polson in michigan which

Bmr007.E.dialogueact959	2549.51	2568.01	E	PhD	s	-1	0	well i but i i'm going to you do and to take to a club right that's the is but you when i so pulled up or into the p. d. a. is peach find that i seen you were supporting because the the the the can show you you were needs and i suppose we we need to put we think oh absolutely this is this is not what i was suggesting to do 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact961	2562.12	2564.4	D	Professor	fg|s.%-	-1	0	well i the the the the can show you you were needs and absolutely this is this is not what i was suggesting to do 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact960	2562.0	2562.57	H	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	well i the the the the can absolutely this is this is 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact962	2562.57	2564.4	H	Grad	s^na	-1	0	well i the the the the can show you you were needs and absolutely this is this is not what i was suggesting to do 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact963	2564.48	2570.03	D	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	but i i think this is a one which you you were needs and i suppose we we need to put we think to do 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact965	2570.03	2575.79	D	Professor	s	-1	0	one which it's uh i used to look like i'm voice voice sounds that action and since this kind of thing 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact964	2569.68	2569.94	E	PhD	qy^bh	-1	0	i think this is a 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact966	2574.99	2575.23	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and since this kind of thing 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact967	2576.4	2585.65	D	Professor	s	-1	0	um if you have somebody who has some experience this sort of thing and they were kind of for a couple months they can come up with something that gets most of the cases fairly easily 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact968	2586.12	2589.41	D	Professor	s	-1	0	then you say okay i don't want to skip most of the cases i wanted to really accurate i it gets really 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact969	2589.41	2591.15	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i it gets really hard to matter what you do so 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact970	2591.9	2602.48	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so the the problem is is that if you say well i have these other data over here that i learned things from either explicit train of their own that sort of cussing mixture models or whatever 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact971	2597.46	2597.73	E	PhD	b	-1	0	that i learned 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact972	2603.12	2604.95	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh so you don't use any of those things you 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact973	2604.95	2606.72	D	Professor	s	-1	0	use any of those things you say you have look for clues to change what does 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact974	2606.72	2607.72	D	Professor	qw	-1	0	clues to change what does that mean 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact975	2608.18	2610.5	D	Professor	s	-1	0	that that means you said some threshold somewhere or something 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact976	2608.2	2608.58	E	PhD	b	-1	0	that that means you said 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact977	2610.5	2610.69	D	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	or something 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact979	2611.41	2614.02	D	Professor	qw	-1	0	and and so where do you get your threshold from from something that 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact978	2611.14	2611.38	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and and so 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact980	2614.14	2615.76	D	Professor	s	-1	0	from something that you look that so 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact981	2615.76	2618.38	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	you look that so you always have this problem you're going to new data um 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact982	2618.9	2626.8	D	Professor	fh|qw	+1	0	um how are you going to adapt to whatever you can very quickly learn about the new day uh if it's going to be different from all day that you have i think 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact983	2626.8	2628.73	D	Professor	s	+1	0	day that you have i think that's a problem well also what i'm 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact984	2628.1	2633.66	H	Grad	fg|s	+1	0	well also what i'm doing right now is not intended to be an acoustic changed it actor for far field likes what i'm doing 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact985	2633.66	2644.96	H	Grad	s	+1	2	if candidate like marking here a candidate actually actually actually uh field likes what i'm doing is trying to use the close talking mike and just use canned and just generate and and just try to get a first pass that something that's sort of works 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact986	2636.88	2637.15	E	PhD	b	-1	0	mike and just use

Bmr007.G.dialogueact996	2647.55	2650.8	G	PhD	s	-1	0	i um i first have to run but intending to spend a lot of time on it so

Bmr007.G.dialogueact998	2650.8	2667.44	G	PhD	s	+1	0	have to run but um i can't imagine uh building a um model of sneaker change detection that takes into account both the far field and uh uh actually not just because talked to mike for that speaker about actually follows follows the speakers um yep everyone else 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact999	2662.06	2662.28	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	uh actually yep

Bmr007.D.dialogueact1050	2800.59	2812.17	D	Professor	s	+1	0	harder but i i think that what i was noting just when he under race that was that there's other information to be gained from looking at all all the microphones you may not need to look at very sophisticated things because if there's

Bmr007.D.dialogueact1063	2827.05	2834.76	D	Professor	s^cs^j	-1	0	i thought i had an idea it was watching chuck nodding a lot of these things that we could all wear little bells and hence so that he you know that thing um name huh 
Bmr007.E.dialogueact1064	2832.68	2832.82	E	PhD	b	-1	0	hence so 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact1065	2833.19	2835.55	H	Grad	s^j	-1	0	i think would that he you know that thing um name huh

Bmr007.B.dialogueact1069	2835.53	2838.21	B	PhD	s^cs^na	-1	0	i think would be really interesting too with a blindfold 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1071	2839.69	2839.9	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	then nodding with blindfold 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact1070	2839.41	2840.46	H	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	then yeah then nodding with blindfold whether you know 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1072	2840.46	2840.83	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah then whether you know 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1074	2840.83	2842.86	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah then weather well whether you know nothing about

Bmr007.F.dialogueact1084	2856.55	2857.39	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	just like that yeah 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1087	2857.85	2858.15	D	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	that it's very 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1088	2858.65	2864.07	B	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	it's very difficult if you try while you're trying to say to convince somebody on the phone it's difficult not to ever have not 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1089	2864.89	2867.31	B	PhD	s	-1	0	not you know if you watch people that actually do these things so 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1090	2865.12	2865.6	D	Professor	b	-1	0	you know if you watch people 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1091	2867.31	2867.59	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	things so 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1092	2868.72	2871.39	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	i still think we should try it meeting or two with the blindfold at least of this meeting 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1093	2871.39	2873.68	B	PhD	s	-1	0	at least of this meeting that we have lots of recordings of

Bmr007.B.dialogueact1096	2874.52	2877.36	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	um maybe for part of the meeting we don't have to yeah i think it's a great idea 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1095	2874.27	2875.09	D	Professor	s^aa.%-	-1	0	um maybe for part of the meeting yeah i think 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1097	2877.45	2878.28	D	Professor	s^ba^na	-1	0	it could be fun it's a great idea 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1098	2878.05	2878.66	B	PhD	s	-1	0	it could be fun 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1099	2879.0	2882.61	B	PhD	s	+1	0	to be too hard to make barriers i was thinking because they have to go all the way 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1100	2879.05	2882.77	D	Professor	b	-1	0	to be too hard to make barriers i was thinking because they have to go all the way 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1101	2883.19	2885.59	B	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	and i can see chuck even if put a barrier here actually but we could just turn out the lights 
Bmr007.H.dialogueact1102	2884.37	2886.24	H	Grad	fg|s^cs	-1	0	even if put a barrier here actually well also but we could just turn out the lights 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact1103	2885.61	2894.36	F	Postdoc	fg|s^rt	-1	0	here actually well also i can say i made better barriers third so that the stuff i assume and i've which just used um this kind of foam board writ really inexpensive could just turn out the lights 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1104	2889.94	2890.62	B	PhD	qy^bh^d^rt	-1	0	so that the stuff i assume and i've 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact1105	2894.46	2895.47	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	board writ really inexpensive you can you can 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact1106	2895.47	2897.27	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	you can you can masking tape it together these are you 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact1107	2897.27	2899.74	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	then we also have these these are you know pretty large partitions 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1108	2898.03	2898.29	D	Professor	b	-1	0	then we also know pretty large 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1109	2898.53	2901.47	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	then we also have these nice is the other thing i think we need a barrier know pretty large partitions 
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1110	2901.47	2905.04	B	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	i think we need a barrier that doesn't disturb this town is um it's true would disturb d. m. though the long range two sticks 
Bmr007.F.dialogueact1112	2903.67	2906.12	F	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	this town is um @reject@ i'm supposed to be good and it's true would disturb d. m. though the long range it would two sticks i think the blindfold

Bmr007.B.dialogueact1117	2907.48	2915.36	B	PhD	s	-1	0	@reject@ but so you know it's cheap and interesting that the camera going probably should wait till after adam set up the mikes but 
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1118	2907.51	2909.67	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	@reject@ but so you know probably should wait till after adam set up the mikes but
