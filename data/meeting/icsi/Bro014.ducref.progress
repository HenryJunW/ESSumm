Me018 has been attempting to make experimentation faster by reducing the iterations in the HTK training.
These will can be reset once the system is finalised.
He then wants to try and improve accuracy may increasing the number of Gaussian mixtures in the models.
Mn007 reported OGI's work on spectral subtraction , as well as his testing his new filter.
The latency is reduced , and improvement increased on well matched case , though decreased on mis-matched.
Along with fn002 he has been looking into voiced/unvoiced detection , and they are still looking for features.
So far they are using features which approximate important details , and they seem reasonably robust on noise.
Me026 has decided against using the exact method of reverberation cancellation he previously discussed , because its output does not fit the current system.
Me006 has been reading on a slight tangent looking at classic work on modulation spectrum , which has inspired some ideas for input.
