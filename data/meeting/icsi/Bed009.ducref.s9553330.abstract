The ICSI group working on a tourism dialogue manager met with visitors from the group behind the software they are using.
The basic aim of the meeting was to discuss the development of the tool , and explain the groups application of it.
The system is to be used to create , and deliver route plans , but will need to be able to come back and ask for further information.
They discussed with their visitors where this application fits into the original system.
They also discussed where the system was going , and arranged another meeting to discuss at greater length.
