Any set of inputs will provide either the whole range of output values of the Bayes-net or an a priori selection of those outputs.
In both cases , what is needed is a way to single out the appropriate outputs for any given context.
For example , in the case of a "where is" question , whether the prevalent output should be "Go-there" or "Info-on" or even a third option has to be computed somehow.
In any case , there are many input values that have not been entered in the Bayes-net at this stage.
Furthermore , no inputs for the Ontology and Discourse can be built in yet , as they involve research that will be carried out in the future.
Finally , there has been a problem with adding probabilities in a net created with the Hugin software , but this should be overcome very shortly.
