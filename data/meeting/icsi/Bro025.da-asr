Bro025.B.dialogueact49	132.432	141.295	B	Professor	s	-1	0	one that has the smallest smaller overall number is actually better on the finish and spanish 
Bro025.B.dialogueact50	142.427	148.238	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh but it is uh worse on the uh or uh i mean in the yeah it's worse some

Bro025.B.dialogueact57	158.141	160.981	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so probably doesn't matter that much either way 
Bro025.B.dialogueact58	161.161	166.171	B	Professor	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	but um when you see uh unified do you mean it's one piece of software now or so no 
Bro025.B.dialogueact59	166.171	166.381	B	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	or so no 
Bro025.E.dialogueact60	166.25	168.75	E	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	or so no we are you accepting of the software

Bro025.E.dialogueact62	169.562	173.022	E	PhD	h|s	-1	0	should be ready 
Bro025.E.dialogueact63	174.095	175.795	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	so what's what's happened 
Bro025.A.dialogueact64	175.24	176.29	A	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	so what's what's happened i think i've missed 
Bro025.A.dialogueact65	176.29	177.58	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i think i've missed something 
Bro025.B.dialogueact66	178.37	179.41	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	okay so we go maybe weren't 
Bro025.B.dialogueact67	179.59	182.88	B	Professor	s^rt.%--	-1	0	go maybe weren't around when when when he making concern i any close you 
Bro025.C.dialogueact68	181.93	182.55	C	PhD	s^2	-1	0	when he making concern i any close you 
Bro025.A.dialogueact69	183.065	183.695	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah i didn't oh 
Bro025.B.dialogueact70	183.97	185.55	B	Professor	s^bk|s^cc	+1	0	yeah i didn't oh okay so you haven't summarize um 
Bro025.B.dialogueact71	185.55	188.52	B	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	um and then if i summarize somebody can tell me if i'm wrong also be 
Bro025.B.dialogueact72	188.52	190.24	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	if i'm wrong also be possibly helpful religious pressure 
Bro025.B.dialogueact73	190.24	191.38	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	religious pressure just 
Bro025.B.dialogueact74	191.38	192.36	B	Professor	s	-1	0	just working 
Bro025.E.dialogueact75	194.454	194.524	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro025.B.dialogueact76	195.982	198.582	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	we uh we looked at uh 
Bro025.B.dialogueact77	198.972	203.962	B	Professor	s	+1	1	uh we after coming back from qualcomm we had you know very strong feedback 
Bro025.B.dialogueact78	204.072	214.223	B	Professor	s	+1	1	and uh i think it was hitting contenders in my opinion also is that um you know we sort of spread out to look at a number of different ways of doing the expression but given 
Bro025.B.dialogueact79	214.675	218.92	B	Professor	s	+1	1	but given limited time uh it was sort of time to choose one 
Bro025.A.dialogueact80	216.17	216.54	A	PhD	b	-1	0	uh it 
Bro025.A.dialogueact81	219.2	219.68	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro025.B.dialogueact82	220.265	226.624	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	2	uh and so uh the two series had really worked out that much uh the 
Bro025.B.dialogueact83	226.624	230.824	B	Professor	s	+1	2	much uh the sub stay stuff uh it had happened work with so much 
Bro025.B.dialogueact84	231.396	235.686	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	2	um so it sort of came down to spectra subtraction versus winter filtering 
Bro025.A.dialogueact85	235.91	236.39	A	PhD	b	-1	0	filtering uh we had a long 
Bro025.B.dialogueact86	236.319	240.689	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	2	uh we had a long discussion about how they were the same and how they were completely different 
Bro025.A.dialogueact87	240.963	241.333	A	PhD	b	-1	0	different and uh 
Bro025.B.dialogueact88	241.529	244.349	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and uh i mean if annoyed at the same sort of thing but the math is a little 
Bro025.B.dialogueact89	244.349	245.609	B	Professor	s^df^e	-1	0	thing but the math is a little different so that there's 
Bro025.B.dialogueact90	245.609	249.84	B	Professor	s	-1	0	different so that there's uh there's an excellent difference in anything 
Bro025.B.dialogueact91	249.84	251.47	B	Professor	s	-1	0	in anything what's the ideal filtering and depending 
Bro025.B.dialogueact92	251.47	254.98	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and depending on construct a problem 
Bro025.A.dialogueact93	255.25	255.55	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and uh 
Bro025.B.dialogueact94	255.494	259.694	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and uh i guess it's you know laughter that's ending sort of made more sense to me because 
Bro025.B.dialogueact95	259.694	267.023	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	more sense to me because um if you're dealing with power spectra then how are you going to choose your error and typically you do choose 
Bro025.B.dialogueact96	267.023	269.233	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and typically you do choose something like a variance and so 
Bro025.B.dialogueact97	269.83	272.26	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so i mean at least something like the square the power specter whereas 
Bro025.B.dialogueact99	272.938	280.123	B	Professor	s	-1	0	whereas when you're when you're doing that any uh looking at it the other way you're going to be dealing with signals and you're going to end up looking 
Bro025.C.dialogueact98	272.626	272.986	C	PhD	b	-1	0	whereas 
Bro025.B.dialogueact100	280.123	283.383	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and you're going to end up looking at power of noise power that you're trying to reduce and so it so 
Bro025.B.dialogueact101	283.383	289.783	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so it so there should be a difference of happens actually of of uh factor too any the expo it 
Bro025.A.dialogueact102	290.041	290.451	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro025.B.dialogueact103	291.084	301.38	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but there's so many different little factors that you adjust in terms of over subtraction and and and and and so forth um 
Bro025.B.dialogueact104	301.51	306.219	B	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	um that arguably your kid and and the choice 
Bro025.B.dialogueact105	306.219	312.199	B	Professor	s	-1	0	kid and and the choice of do do operate on the metal bands already operate on the fifty before hand there's 
Bro025.B.dialogueact106	312.945	323.815	B	Professor	s	-1	0	there's so many other choices to make that are almost well it's not independent certainly in addition to the choice of whether you uh destructive subtraction irwin filtering 
Bro025.B.dialogueact107	324.542	330.418	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	that um again we sort of felt the gang she just sort of figure out which it is they want to do and then it's 
Bro025.B.dialogueact108	330.418	331.558	B	Professor	s^cs^e	+1	1	to do and then it's tickets go forward 
Bro025.B.dialogueact109	331.558	332.378	B	Professor	s^cs^e	-1	0	tickets go forward with it so that's that 
Bro025.B.dialogueact110	332.378	334.128	B	Professor	s	-1	0	with it so that's that was that was last week and and 
Bro025.B.dialogueact111	334.128	338.466	B	Professor	s^co^j	-1	0	and and uh we said uh take a week go arm wrestle you know 
Bro025.B.dialogueact112	338.726	338.916	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	wrestle you know 
Bro025.D.dialogueact113	339.558	339.858	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro025.B.dialogueact114	340.095	340.525	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	figure it out i mean in 
Bro025.B.dialogueact115	340.525	343.835	B	Professor	s	-1	0	figure it out i mean in the joke there was that each of them had specialize in one of them and 
Bro025.A.dialogueact117	344.313	345.263	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay and so they and instead they 
Bro025.B.dialogueact116	343.835	344.755	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	oh okay in one of them and and so they 
Bro025.B.dialogueact118	345.415	350.015	B	Professor	s	+1	2	and instead they went to yosemite and bonded and then they came out with a single single piece of software so 
Bro025.B.dialogueact119	350.015	354.707	B	Professor	s^j	+1	2	another another victory for international collaboration so 
Bro025.B.dialogueact120	354.707	354.847	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro025.A.dialogueact122	357.93	361.17	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	+1	2	so so you guys have combined or you're going to be combining software uh but 
Bro025.B.dialogueact121	357.457	357.707	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so uh 
Bro025.C.dialogueact124	361.893	364.923	C	PhD	s^df	+1	2	but the piece of software that's like plenty of options like 
Bro025.E.dialogueact123	361.845	362.455	E	PhD	s^fe.%	-1	0	but the piece of software 
Bro025.C.dialogueact125	364.923	366.733	C	PhD	s^df^e	-1	0	of options like your grandpa's skyline man argument said 
Bro025.C.dialogueact126	366.923	370.743	C	PhD	s	+1	2	uh okay man argument said depending on that he'd he'd because i that take pick this up action on i mean if anything 
Bro025.A.dialogueact127	369.753	371.123	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	uh okay they're close enough well that's fine take pick this up action on i mean if anything

Bro025.B.dialogueact131	372.01	376.68	B	Professor	s	+1	2	but the thing is the poured thing is that there is a piece of software that you that we all be using yeah yes yeah yeah 
Bro025.C.dialogueact132	376.39	377.18	C	PhD	s^aa^m	-1	0	be using yeah yes yeah yeah there's just one monkeys or

Bro025.E.dialogueact149	403.278	407.178	E	PhD	s	+1	1	of the system it's just one percent of this proposal it's between 
Bro025.C.dialogueact150	406.175	407.245	C	PhD	s^2	-1	0	the system this proposal it's between 
Bro025.E.dialogueact151	407.358	410.298	E	PhD	s	+1	1	okay yeah it's between we are sick of trendy thing 
Bro025.A.dialogueact155	410.96	411.28	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay compared to last yeah but 
Bro025.B.dialogueact154	410.661	410.851	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	okay yeah 
Bro025.C.dialogueact153	410.631	410.871	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	okay yeah 
Bro025.E.dialogueact152	410.368	410.568	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	okay yeah 
Bro025.A.dialogueact156	411.45	413.17	A	PhD	s^2	+1	1	compared to last evaluation numbers but which we sort 
Bro025.B.dialogueact157	411.509	411.909	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	compared to last but 
Bro025.B.dialogueact160	413.111	414.581	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	which we sort of were before but we were considerably 
Bro025.C.dialogueact159	412.865	413.085	C	PhD	s^aa	+1	1	evaluation numbers which we sort 
Bro025.E.dialogueact158	412.623	413.123	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	evaluation numbers which we sort 
Bro025.B.dialogueact161	414.581	416.211	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	of were before but we were considerably far behind and the thing is this doesn't 
Bro025.B.dialogueact162	416.211	419.261	B	Professor	s^df^e	-1	0	and the thing is this doesn't have their own opinion transcends you know so 
Bro025.B.dialogueact164	419.391	419.781	B	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	you know so 
Bro025.E.dialogueact163	419.16	419.46	E	PhD	b	-1	0	you know so 
Bro025.A.dialogueact165	419.99	420.41	A	PhD	b	-1	0	you know so it's so 
Bro025.B.dialogueact166	420.051	426.061	B	Professor	s^df	+1	1	it's so um it's it's it's not using our full a bag of tricks if you will and uh 
Bro025.A.dialogueact167	426.07	426.73	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and uh 
Bro025.B.dialogueact168	426.231	430.901	B	Professor	s	+1	1	and uh and it is uh very close to performance of the best thing was there before 
Bro025.B.dialogueact169	431.63	439.762	B	Professor	s	+1	1	uh but you know looking another way maybe more importantly uh we didn't have any explicit noise uh handling stationary 
Bro025.B.dialogueact170	439.762	441.312	B	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	handling stationary dealing with we didn't explicitly 
Bro025.B.dialogueact171	441.312	444.242	B	Professor	s^bc	+1	1	we didn't explicitly have anything to do with stationary nice 
Bro025.A.dialogueact172	444.43	445.09	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and that was good 
Bro025.B.dialogueact173	445.321	445.951	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and that was good 
Bro025.A.dialogueact174	446.76	454.59	A	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	so we'll be narrowing that operate on the output from either the winner filtering or the spectra subtraction 
Bro025.A.dialogueact176	455.537	457.347	A	PhD	qrr	-1	0	or will it operates on the original well so uh so so argue arguably 
Bro025.B.dialogueact175	455.423	458.943	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	or will it operates on the original well so uh so so argue arguably what we should do and 
Bro025.B.dialogueact177	458.943	463.593	B	Professor	s	+1	1	what we should do and i guess you have it sounds like you're a few more days of nailing things down with the software and so on but 
Bro025.B.dialogueact178	463.593	472.743	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	and so on but but um arguably what we should do is even though the softer can do many things we should for now pick a set of things that these 
Bro025.B.dialogueact179	472.743	474.093	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	set of things that these things i would guess and 
Bro025.B.dialogueact181	474.809	475.879	B	Professor	s^cs^e	+1	1	and not change that and 
Bro025.E.dialogueact180	474.456	474.656	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bro025.B.dialogueact182	475.949	478.689	B	Professor	s^cs^e	+1	1	not change that and then focus on everything that's left 
Bro025.B.dialogueact183	479.567	491.531	B	Professor	s^cs^t	+1	1	and i think you know that our goal should be by next week when he comes back uh two uh really just to have a firm pass uh for the for the time has gone 
Bro025.B.dialogueact184	492.106	494.306	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	of of uh what things will be attacked but i would i 
Bro025.B.dialogueact185	494.668	500.208	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	but i would i would i would so i think that's what we want to do is not such of the stuff for a while because 
Bro025.B.dialogueact186	500.676	504.066	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because what'll happen is will change many other things in the system and then we'll 
Bro025.A.dialogueact187	503.511	504.231	A	PhD	b	-1	0	in the system and then we'll 
Bro025.B.dialogueact188	504.567	507.897	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and then we'll probably want to come back to this and possibly make some of the choices but 
Bro025.B.dialogueact189	507.897	508.607	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but some of the choices but uh 
Bro025.A.dialogueact190	508.909	510.979	A	PhD	qw	-1	0	but just conceptual e. where the center and i go uh 
Bro025.A.dialogueact191	511.209	514.619	A	PhD	qy^bu	-1	0	do do you want to run it on the output of the especially subtract well depending on 
Bro025.E.dialogueact192	512.254	512.334	E	PhD	b	-1	0	run it on the output 
Bro025.B.dialogueact193	514.478	515.908	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	well depending on the size 
Bro025.B.dialogueact194	515.998	520.998	B	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	the size well one question is is is on the um server side or is is on the terminal side 
Bro025.B.dialogueact195	521.75	525.33	B	Professor	s^df^rt	-1	0	uh if it's on the server side it probably don't have to worry too much about science so 
Bro025.A.dialogueact196	525.442	525.922	A	PhD	b	-1	0	so 
Bro025.B.dialogueact197	525.933	527.523	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so that's kind of an argument for that we 
Bro025.B.dialogueact198	528.053	530.433	B	Professor	s	+1	1	do still however have to considers latency so the issue 
Bro025.B.dialogueact199	530.433	535.864	B	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	so the issue is is um for instance could we have an aroma that only looked at the past 
Bro025.A.dialogueact200	535.951	536.271	A	PhD	b	-1	0	at the past um what we've 
Bro025.B.dialogueact201	536.52	545.697	B	Professor	s	-1	0	um what we've done in in the past is use in their own that um to transform um all of the features that we so this 
Bro025.B.dialogueact202	545.697	547.107	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we so this is done early on this is essentially 
Bro025.B.dialogueact203	547.107	553.936	B	Professor	s	-1	0	this is essentially i guess it's it's more or less like a speak speech enhanced meant technique here 
Bro025.A.dialogueact205	554.083	554.563	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and we were just kind of creating 
Bro025.B.dialogueact204	553.936	554.166	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	meant technique here and we were just kind of creating 
Bro025.B.dialogueact206	554.166	559.07	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and we were just kind of creating new if not new speech at least knew new fifties that that have 
Bro025.B.dialogueact207	559.07	561.74	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	that that have could be turned into speech 
Bro025.B.dialogueact209	562.409	564.539	B	Professor	fh|s^e	-1	0	uh that that have some of noise removed 
Bro025.E.dialogueact208	562.075	562.325	E	PhD	b	-1	0	uh that 
Bro025.A.dialogueact210	564.698	565.248	A	PhD	b	-1	0	removed um after 
Bro025.B.dialogueact211	565.047	569.547	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	right um after that we still do a of other things to to produce of teachers and 
Bro025.A.dialogueact212	568.018	568.368	A	PhD	b	-1	0	to produce of teachers 
Bro025.B.dialogueact213	570.002	574.398	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	the teachers are not now currently transformed by in their on that and then 
Bro025.B.dialogueact214	574.853	582.492	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that and then the the way that we had it in our proposal to before we had an aroma transform features and we had the un transform features which 
Bro025.B.dialogueact215	582.972	586.922	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	which i guess you you actually get linearly nearly transform a scale tape it 
Bro025.E.dialogueact216	586.009	586.719	E	PhD	b	-1	0	a scale tape it 
Bro025.B.dialogueact217	586.922	589.342	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	a scale tape it but but uh we're talking lies in but 
Bro025.B.dialogueact218	589.342	592.782	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	in but they were not uh process turn around that and 
Bro025.B.dialogueact219	592.782	600.449	B	Professor	s	-1	0	turn around that and stephens idea where that is a recall was that if you have one part of the future factor that was very discriminating another part that wasn't 
Bro025.A.dialogueact220	600.702	601.082	A	PhD	b	-1	0	wasn't uh which would 
Bro025.B.dialogueact221	601.053	608.563	B	Professor	fh|s^e	-1	0	uh which would smooth things bits for those occasions when uh the testing set was quite different than what you change are just commit features for 
Bro025.B.dialogueact222	609.58	613.63	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	so um all that is is uh still seems like a good idea 
Bro025.B.dialogueact223	614.087	616.847	B	Professor	s	-1	0	thing is now we know some other constraints 
Bro025.B.dialogueact224	617.277	619.567	B	Professor	s	+1	1	we can't have unlimited amounts latency 
Bro025.B.dialogueact225	620.123	624.333	B	Professor	s	+1	1	uh he you know that's still being debated by uh by people in europe but 
Bro025.B.dialogueact226	624.423	629.268	B	Professor	s^df	+1	1	europe but uh no matter how they end up there it's not going to be on limited amount so we have to be a little 
Bro025.A.dialogueact228	629.313	629.693	A	PhD	b	-1	0	so we have to be a little 
Bro025.B.dialogueact227	629.268	631.018	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so we have to be a little conscious of that um 
Bro025.B.dialogueact229	631.813	632.573	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro025.B.dialogueact230	633.224	635.164	B	Professor	s	+1	1	this others there's there on that issue there's the v. a. 
Bro025.B.dialogueact231	635.354	637.374	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	there's the v. a. d. issue and 
Bro025.B.dialogueact232	637.971	641.991	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	and uh there's the second stream 
Bro025.B.dialogueact233	642.371	647.971	B	Professor	s	-1	0	what was the issue and i think those are we last time we agreed that those are the three things that have to get uh focused on 
Bro025.A.dialogueact234	647.552	648.852	A	PhD	qw	+1	1	what was the issue with the v. a. d. focused on 
Bro025.B.dialogueact235	649.819	651.959	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well um better ones are good 
Bro025.A.dialogueact236	653.6	660.415	A	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	and so the what the default um boundaries that they provide or they're okay but they're not all that great i guess they still 
Bro025.B.dialogueact237	660.339	663.509	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	great i guess they still allow to two hundred no seconds anita sinuses that 
Bro025.B.dialogueact239	663.509	664.559	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	that so 
Bro025.E.dialogueact238	663.303	663.713	E	PhD	b	-1	0	that 
Bro025.E.dialogueact240	664.51	670.97	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	outside the beginnings so they um they keep doing in mesa comes beginning and and the speech and they keep hold it

Bro025.C.dialogueact327	858.39	861.63	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so the n. b. a. and to eighty bullet had hundred music industry 
Bro025.C.dialogueact328	862.15	863.65	C	PhD	s	-1	0	sunday we're in past lives which means 
Bro025.C.dialogueact329	863.65	865.51	C	PhD	s	-1	0	in past lives which means you because it one of them is the 
Bro025.A.dialogueact330	865.7	866.45	A	PhD	b	-1	0	of them is the biggest of 
Bro025.C.dialogueact331	865.8	866.91	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	of them is the biggest of

Bro025.A.dialogueact336	870.202	870.752	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay and they didn't 
Bro025.B.dialogueact337	870.633	872.563	B	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	oh okay and they didn't seem to be any a penalty for that 
Bro025.B.dialogueact339	873.45	876.28	B	Professor	qy^bu^d^r^rt	-1	0	there didn't seem to be any penalty for making a causal oh

Bro025.C.dialogueact340	877.016	881.246	C	PhD	s^ar|s^ng	-1	0	okay no it actually made it like find one person back into something something

Bro025.B.dialogueact343	882.293	883.243	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well i saw that he says wiener them 
Bro025.C.dialogueact342	882.176	883.046	C	PhD	s	-1	0	well i saw that he says wiener them 
Bro025.B.dialogueact345	883.243	886.453	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that he says wiener filters is forty millisecond store yeah 
Bro025.C.dialogueact344	883.046	883.156	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	that he says wiener 
Bro025.B.dialogueact348	887.213	887.643	B	Professor	qy.%-	-1	0	so that's the one 
Bro025.C.dialogueact346	886.817	889.627	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	store this moving yeah so that's the one that stefan find those disgusting like yeah 
Bro025.E.dialogueact347	887.191	887.421	E	PhD	b	-1	0	so that's the one 
Bro025.B.dialogueact349	889.476	890.186	B	Professor	s^2	-1	0	this moving like yeah the you 
Bro025.C.dialogueact350	890.017	893.087	C	PhD	s^na.%-	+1	1	the you they'd and then did a decision by 
Bro025.C.dialogueact351	894.263	894.683	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro025.B.dialogueact352	895.033	895.373	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro025.B.dialogueact353	895.713	896.073	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	so 
Bro025.B.dialogueact354	897.008	898.968	B	Professor	s^ba	+1	1	that's that's really not not that so 
Bro025.B.dialogueact355	898.968	907.377	B	Professor	s	+1	1	not that so we may in fact we will see what they decide we may in fact have be uh latency time available for two having their own that i mean sounds 
Bro025.B.dialogueact356	907.417	908.937	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	own that i mean sounds like we probably will 
Bro025.B.dialogueact358	909.467	909.777	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro025.C.dialogueact357	909.085	909.495	C	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro025.B.dialogueact359	910.689	911.189	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	it 
Bro025.B.dialogueact360	911.579	913.939	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	it it certainly always help this before 
Bro025.B.dialogueact361	914.199	914.469	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro025.A.dialogueact363	917.16	919.38	A	PhD	qw	+1	1	what amount of latency are you thinking about when you it 
Bro025.B.dialogueact362	916.975	917.315	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	what amount of latency 
Bro025.B.dialogueact364	920.15	921.84	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well they're you know they're disputing it you 
Bro025.A.dialogueact366	922.115	922.485	A	PhD	b	-1	0	know they're saying uh 
Bro025.B.dialogueact365	921.97	928.25	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	disputing it you know they're saying uh one group is saying a hundred and thirty no seconds and other could two hundred and fifty no seconds to the fifties 
Bro025.B.dialogueact367	928.61	930.72	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	to the fifties what it was before actually so 
Bro025.B.dialogueact368	930.72	931.07	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	actually so some people 
Bro025.A.dialogueact369	931.27	931.61	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	some people 
Bro025.B.dialogueact370	931.628	934.168	B	Professor	s	-1	0	some people are a lot loving lobbying to make it shorter 
Bro025.A.dialogueact371	934.354	934.824	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro025.B.dialogueact372	934.906	935.686	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro025.B.dialogueact373	937.135	938.055	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	were you thinking of 
Bro025.A.dialogueact374	938.47	942.41	A	PhD	qr^rt	-1	0	were you thinking of the two fifty or the one thirty when you said we should have enough for the now i'm not 
Bro025.B.dialogueact375	943.095	946.955	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well it just it when we find that out it might change exactly how we do it so 
Bro025.A.dialogueact377	947.11	947.85	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay i mean how much 
Bro025.B.dialogueact376	946.955	950.055	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	oh okay we do it so i mean how much effort do we put into making a call so i mean i think 
Bro025.B.dialogueact378	950.055	954.559	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	i mean i think in their own that will probably do better if it looks a little bit of the future 
Bro025.A.dialogueact379	954.734	955.144	A	PhD	b	-1	0	the future but um 
Bro025.B.dialogueact380	955.404	959.054	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	but um it will probably work to some extent to look only at the past and we 
Bro025.B.dialogueact381	959.625	964.355	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	and we hit you know limited machine human time and effort and you know how 
Bro025.B.dialogueact382	964.355	968.891	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	and you know how how much time should be put into into that so 
Bro025.B.dialogueact383	968.891	974.731	B	Professor	s	-1	0	into that so it would be helpful if we find out from the the standards folks whether you know they're going to restrict that or not 
Bro025.A.dialogueact384	973.132	973.742	A	PhD	b	-1	0	know they're going to restrict 
Bro025.B.dialogueact385	975.631	976.491	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	i 
Bro025.B.dialogueact386	976.93	980.32	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i think you know at this point our major concern is making the performance better and and 
Bro025.B.dialogueact387	980.32	989.475	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and and um yes uh something has to take a little longer and latency in order do it that's a secondary issue but 
Bro025.A.dialogueact388	989.568	989.918	A	PhD	b	-1	0	issue but 
Bro025.B.dialogueact389	989.755	993.565	B	Professor	s	-1	0	issue but if we get told otherwise then you may have to clamp down a bit more

Bro025.C.dialogueact391	1003.3	1010.91	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so is one one one different that close there is like we died computing today time and doing the same topic 
Bro025.D.dialogueact392	1003.4	1003.74	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	so is one one one 
Bro025.E.dialogueact393	1011.2	1011.41	E	PhD	b	-1	0	the video 
Bro025.C.dialogueact394	1011.75	1015.52	C	PhD	s.%--:s^co	-1	0	the video system was the frame dropping and incumbent today found uh 
Bro025.B.dialogueact395	1013.41	1013.76	B	Professor	b	-1	0	the frame dropping 
Bro025.C.dialogueact396	1016.85	1018.09	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	which could be kind of a funny delta so this 
Bro025.A.dialogueact397	1017.79	1019.27	A	PhD	s^2^bu	-1	0	which could be kind of a funny delta right this yeah 
Bro025.A.dialogueact398	1019.27	1019.59	A	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right yeah 
Bro025.C.dialogueact399	1019.55	1020.02	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right oh so that's six yeah 
Bro025.B.dialogueact400	1020.11	1020.35	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	oh so that's six 
Bro025.B.dialogueact401	1020.35	1020.46	B	Professor	s^fe	-1	0	oh so that's six 
Bro025.B.dialogueact402	1020.46	1021.57	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	oh so that's six tennis any type yeah 
Bro025.B.dialogueact403	1021.57	1022.55	B	Professor	s	-1	0	tennis any type of thing yeah so we have no 
Bro025.C.dialogueact404	1021.76	1022.05	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	tennis any type of thing yeah so we have no 
Bro025.C.dialogueact406	1022.31	1023.83	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	of thing so we have no death and then the 
Bro025.E.dialogueact405	1022.3	1022.93	E	PhD	b	-1	0	of thing so we have no 
Bro025.B.dialogueact407	1023.28	1023.6	B	Professor	b	-1	0	death and then the 
Bro025.C.dialogueact408	1023.97	1025.76	C	PhD	s	+1	1	death and then the same dropping is the last thing that they do 
Bro025.C.dialogueact409	1027.95	1030.73	C	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	so yeah what do they come to the sinus probably the minority 
Bro025.C.dialogueact410	1030.91	1032.6	C	PhD	s^e^rt	-1	0	probably the minority do that by any flak and 
Bro025.B.dialogueact411	1031.86	1032.55	B	Professor	b	-1	0	do that by any flak and 
Bro025.C.dialogueact412	1032.92	1038.37	C	PhD	s^e.%-	-1	0	did that help and flak and then and and you up if somebody do match the finer features number of 
Bro025.E.dialogueact413	1032.97	1033.1	E	PhD	b	-1	0	flak and then and and you 
Bro025.A.dialogueact414	1038.2	1039.02	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	did that help and number of it seems 
Bro025.C.dialogueact415	1039.77	1041.82	C	PhD	s^df^na	-1	0	it seems we had a thing on the that match condition so that's 
Bro025.C.dialogueact416	1041.82	1045.04	C	PhD	s	-1	0	match condition so that's why this and boom and i caught from the last isn't so i actually 
Bro025.C.dialogueact417	1045.2	1048.62	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	so i actually they do they do it on the high mismatch so defiantly 
Bro025.C.dialogueact418	1048.62	1050.85	C	PhD	s	-1	0	mismatch so defiantly the back made age it's bad everywhere 
Bro025.C.dialogueact419	1050.85	1052.69	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	bad everywhere that i might just have a bit more than 
Bro025.B.dialogueact420	1053.95	1056.73	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	so i mean you were doing a lot of changes did you happen 
Bro025.B.dialogueact421	1056.73	1062.2	B	Professor	qy^rt	+1	1	a lot of changes did you happen to notice how much uh the change was due to justice frame dropping from illness these you 
Bro025.B.dialogueact422	1062.2	1062.79	B	Professor	qo	-1	0	illness these you 
Bro025.C.dialogueact423	1062.31	1064.05	C	PhD	s	-1	0	illness these you had something on right just

Bro025.E.dialogueact425	1064.94	1066.16	E	PhD	s^na	+1	1	right just the friend dripping from yeah but 
Bro025.E.dialogueact426	1066.16	1068.95	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	yeah but it's difficult 
Bro025.E.dialogueact427	1069.97	1072.08	E	PhD	s	-1	0	sometime we we change to do things together but it's 
Bro025.E.dialogueact428	1072.08	1076.12	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but it's a raw maybe you'd said on one person

Bro025.E.dialogueact443	1102.37	1104.28	E	PhD	s^bsc	-1	0	to do the same kind of 
Bro025.B.dialogueact444	1106.21	1108.1	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	might be hard if it's that the server side and

Bro025.A.dialogueact453	1129.57	1131.82	A	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	uh maybe i don't quite understand how this works but 
Bro025.A.dialogueact454	1131.82	1136.14	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	how this works but um can you just send all of the things but mark the ones that are supposed to be dropped because 
Bro025.A.dialogueact455	1136.87	1138.91	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because you have a bunch more bandwidth right 
Bro025.A.dialogueact456	1138.91	1139.18	A	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	bandwidth right well 
Bro025.B.dialogueact457	1139.81	1140.58	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	well you could yeah 
Bro025.B.dialogueact458	1140.76	1148.95	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	you could yeah i mean it it always seemed to us that it would be kind of nice too in addition to reducing intuitions actually is a plus band with 
Bro025.A.dialogueact459	1149.23	1150.15	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah yeah but nobody seems to 
Bro025.B.dialogueact460	1149.98	1154.64	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah yeah and that way than that but nobody seems to care about that in this valuation 
Bro025.A.dialogueact461	1154.4	1156.16	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and that way than that could 
Bro025.B.dialogueact462	1154.64	1154.97	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and that way than that 
Bro025.A.dialogueact463	1157.8	1160.93	A	PhD	s	-1	0	if and that's on the server side then they could use all of the 
Bro025.C.dialogueact464	1162.3	1163.65	C	PhD	s^am	-1	0	yes it could be 
Bro025.C.dialogueact465	1164.03	1166.01	C	PhD	s	-1	0	like me i mean you just i said everything and then if i needed 
Bro025.C.dialogueact466	1166.01	1168.63	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and then if i needed help the frames of new right right 
Bro025.A.dialogueact468	1168.95	1169.59	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	new right right yeah that's 
Bro025.C.dialogueact467	1168.63	1168.82	C	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	new right right 
Bro025.C.dialogueact470	1169.56	1171.43	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	but you could even mark yeah that's that's one thing which 
Bro025.E.dialogueact469	1169.12	1169.36	E	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah that's 
Bro025.A.dialogueact471	1171.24	1174.14	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	but you could even mark them before they get to the server which yeah but right now we but i 
Bro025.C.dialogueact472	1172.68	1173.72	C	PhD	fg|s.%-	-1	0	them before they get to the server yeah but right now we 
Bro025.C.dialogueact473	1174.53	1174.96	C	PhD	s^aa.%--	-1	0	but i 
Bro025.C.dialogueact474	1174.96	1183.36	C	PhD	s	-1	0	uh oh okay but i know what what what we did like we just mop we just have this audition a beat which goes out on the features saying it's got to do it just be on on speech so 
Bro025.A.dialogueact475	1183.59	1183.97	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay so 
Bro025.A.dialogueact476	1183.97	1184.23	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay so there's no friend topping 
Bro025.C.dialogueact477	1183.98	1188.02	C	PhD	s	-1	0	oh okay i see so there's no friend topping thing to find those features like in getting the does does the computer and after 
Bro025.A.dialogueact478	1188.36	1188.92	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i see and after 
Bro025.C.dialogueact479	1188.61	1193.92	C	PhD	s	-1	0	i see i see and after that i got a computer you just pick up the ones that i mocked assignments and and help them 
Bro025.A.dialogueact480	1191.61	1192.15	A	PhD	b	-1	0	that i mocked assignments 
Bro025.A.dialogueact481	1193.36	1193.85	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i see and and help them 
Bro025.A.dialogueact484	1194.38	1194.65	A	PhD	b	-1	0	i see so the more or less the same 
Bro025.B.dialogueact482	1194.17	1197.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i see so the more or less the same thing with in their own mind i guess so yeah that's work 
Bro025.E.dialogueact483	1194.33	1194.71	E	PhD	b	-1	0	i see so the more or less the same 
Bro025.C.dialogueact485	1196.94	1200.27	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	i see okay i guess so yeah that's work toward that sort of this is doing right now 
Bro025.A.dialogueact486	1198.35	1198.71	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i see toward that 
Bro025.A.dialogueact487	1200.2	1200.56	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay now 
Bro025.B.dialogueact488	1200.92	1201.17	B	Professor	b	-1	0	okay now

Bro025.B.dialogueact494	1214.7	1217.45	B	Professor	s^ba.%-	+1	1	that's that's good so to work that there's one more thing 
Bro025.C.dialogueact495	1217.26	1218.16	C	PhD	s^t^tc	+1	1	there's one more thing like should we do 
Bro025.C.dialogueact496	1218.16	1221.12	C	PhD	qy	+1	1	like should we do something more for the nicest commission movies too 
Bro025.C.dialogueact497	1221.12	1221.83	C	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	movies too 
Bro025.B.dialogueact498	1222.08	1223.57	B	Professor	s^aa	+1	1	yeah i was wondering about that that 
Bro025.B.dialogueact501	1223.57	1225.64	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that that and written it down there 
Bro025.C.dialogueact499	1223.5	1223.87	C	PhD	b	-1	0	that that

Bro025.E.dialogueact503	1226.5	1229.14	E	PhD	s	-1	0	actually i did the first experiment it's just 
Bro025.E.dialogueact504	1229.14	1231.55	E	PhD	s^e	-1	0	it's just we've just fifteen frames 
Bro025.E.dialogueact505	1232.41	1233.08	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	we think the first 
Bro025.E.dialogueact506	1233.61	1235.82	E	PhD	s	-1	0	we think the first thing a feature turns

Bro025.B.dialogueact521	1272.07	1286.05	B	Professor	s^ba^cs	-1	0	it does seem like yeah really some compromise between always depending on the first fifteen frames and always depending on pauses this is a good idea 
Bro025.B.dialogueact522	1286.97	1294.69	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	maybe have to wait estimates and the first thing fifteen frames more heavily than than was done first attempts

Bro025.B.dialogueact550	1357.47	1359.35	B	Professor	s^2	-1	0	and and see how much better gets 
Bro025.C.dialogueact551	1359.37	1360.51	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	it's it's yeah 
Bro025.B.dialogueact552	1360.15	1364.4	B	Professor	s^ba.%--	-1	0	it's it's yeah especially not better then it's probably not worth 
Bro025.E.dialogueact553	1364.67	1364.88	E	PhD	b	-1	0	worth 
Bro025.B.dialogueact554	1365.77	1366.01	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	yeah but the game 
Bro025.C.dialogueact555	1366.53	1369.12	C	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah but the game does uh demand is slightly different it's like even 
Bro025.C.dialogueact556	1369.12	1375.1	C	PhD	s	-1	0	it's like even even if i use the times a lot i'm just averaging though the spa spectrum by 
Bro025.C.dialogueact557	1375.92	1381.14	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	by the game does i guess it like like a in on stationery segment and he doesn't update i spectrum so he's 
Bro025.C.dialogueact558	1381.81	1384.86	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so he's like you guys got generally the station any part and so 
Bro025.C.dialogueact559	1384.86	1390.71	C	PhD	s	-1	0	any part and so the averaging is like different from updating the nice spectrum when any dating stationary segments 
Bro025.C.dialogueact560	1393.55	1399.58	C	PhD	s	-1	0	begin go jogging that i mean even if you have any would be eighty averaging it's like all of the whole thing is not a good idea 
Bro025.B.dialogueact562	1400.53	1400.9	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	because you have 
Bro025.C.dialogueact561	1400.5	1404.21	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because you have anything to station attendant on station in fine you end up getting something it's not 
Bro025.C.dialogueact563	1404.71	1410.57	C	PhD	s	-1	0	it's not pretty this because you anyway you condom with a stationary bike for i mean on stationary apart from the figment so 
Bro025.B.dialogueact565	1411.35	1413.17	B	Professor	s^2^na	-1	0	not using these methods anyway yeah so you just update only 
Bro025.C.dialogueact564	1410.95	1411.32	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	not using these figment so 
Bro025.C.dialogueact566	1412.29	1416.74	C	PhD	s	-1	0	methods anyway yeah so you just update only doing our updating the decision of the components 
Bro025.C.dialogueact567	1418.11	1422.78	C	PhD	s	-1	0	that's so that's too slight different from what is trying and 
Bro025.C.dialogueact568	1420.78	1423.57	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	well so that's too slight different from what is trying and 
Bro025.B.dialogueact569	1423.71	1427.65	B	Professor	s^aap|s.%--	-1	0	well yeah and and also there's just the fact that um 
Bro025.B.dialogueact570	1428.82	1436.28	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	although we're trying to do very well on this evaluation um we actually would like to have something that worked on general 
Bro025.B.dialogueact572	1437.12	1441.95	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	and um relying on having fifteen frames at the front or something it's it's pretty

Bro025.B.dialogueact573	1442.88	1444.14	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean you might you might not

Bro025.B.dialogueact651	1633.51	1642.86	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	ends because you know there's more than five hundred miles seconds of uh of non speech figure it's end of it or something like that so 
Bro025.A.dialogueact652	1640.68	1641.16	A	PhD	b	-1	0	figure it's end of it or something 
Bro025.B.dialogueact653	1642.86	1643.1	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	like that so

Bro025.D.dialogueact716	1859.21	1862.5	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and uh some things tended to cluster 
Bro025.A.dialogueact717	1862.7	1863.09	A	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	and you know stop 
Bro025.D.dialogueact718	1863.17	1866.41	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and you know stop stop consonants plastic really well um 
Bro025.A.dialogueact719	1866.35	1866.76	A	PhD	b	-1	0	well um 
Bro025.D.dialogueact720	1867.0	1869.02	D	Grad	s	-1	0	silence was by its own self and

Bro025.A.dialogueact725	1878.47	1883.7	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	so you're now you're sort of looking to try to gather a set of these types of features things right
