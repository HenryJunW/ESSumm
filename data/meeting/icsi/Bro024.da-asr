Bro024.F.dialogueact29	52.361	52.951	F	PhD	qw^co	+1	1	okay don't you had ahead 
Bro024.C.dialogueact30	53.01	53.27	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	um 
Bro024.C.dialogueact31	53.67	54.05	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um so 
Bro024.C.dialogueact32	54.79	66.021	C	Grad	fh|s	+1	2	so yeah the this past week i've been name mainly occupied with um getting some results from the sri system trained on the short how five training set for the mean subtraction method and um 
Bro024.C.dialogueact33	66.021	66.991	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bro024.C.dialogueact34	68.83	70.43	C	Grad	s	+1	1	i ran some tests last night but um 
Bro024.C.dialogueact35	70.43	71.63	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	but um 
Bro024.C.dialogueact36	71.63	71.74	C	Grad	%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.C.dialogueact37	72.144	73.554	C	Grad	s	+1	1	there's also suspicious um it's 
Bro024.C.dialogueact38	73.554	81.295	C	Grad	fh|s^df	+1	1	um it's um because they're the baseline results are worse than um andreas theirself andrea's caught previously and 
Bro024.C.dialogueact39	81.765	84.785	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	and it could have something to do with um that's 
Bro024.F.dialogueact40	84.95	85.72	F	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	um that's on digits 
Bro024.C.dialogueact41	86.45	87.21	C	Grad	s^m^na	-1	0	it's on did you think it it could it 
Bro024.C.dialogueact42	87.21	91.166	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	you think it it could it could have something to do with um down south thing that's that's worth looking 
Bro024.F.dialogueact43	87.254	87.454	F	PhD	b	-1	0	you think it it could it 
Bro024.C.dialogueact44	91.166	92.616	C	Grad	s^ba^cs	-1	0	that's that's worth looking into 
Bro024.C.dialogueact45	93.524	94.104	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro024.C.dialogueact46	95.334	96.424	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bro024.C.dialogueact47	96.906	105.352	C	Grad	s	+1	1	if a part of and i i guess the the main thing out that tied to talk about is um where i'm fine to go over the next week um 
Bro024.C.dialogueact48	105.352	105.772	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro024.C.dialogueact49	106.293	110.553	C	Grad	s	+1	1	so i've been working on integrating this means attraction approach into the smart comm system 
Bro024.C.dialogueact50	111.318	119.428	C	Grad	s	+1	1	and there's this question of well so um me and my test before where they you can't find it worked it worked the best with about twelve seconds of doubt i used to estimate i mean but 
Bro024.C.dialogueact51	119.428	122.901	C	Grad	s^rt	+1	1	mean but well often have less and the smart comm system 
Bro024.C.dialogueact52	123.541	124.031	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um so 
Bro024.C.dialogueact53	124.542	129.132	C	Grad	s	+1	1	so i think we use as much data as we have at a particular time animal 
Bro024.C.dialogueact54	129.132	135.792	C	Grad	s	+1	1	animal woke uncanny outer insist together um to get as much done as we possibly count from the user but 
Bro024.C.dialogueact55	135.882	142.072	C	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	from the user but um there's a question of how to set up the models so um we could train the models if we think well seconds 
Bro024.C.dialogueact56	142.072	150.204	C	Grad	s	+1	1	if we think well seconds is ideal we could train the models using twelve seconds to calculate i mean to means attracted training data or we could um 
Bro024.C.dialogueact57	150.204	154.549	C	Grad	s	+1	1	or we could um use some other amount so 
Bro024.C.dialogueact58	154.959	160.7	C	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	so like i didn't experiment where i um was using six seconds and passed 
Bro024.C.dialogueact59	161.737	166.054	C	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um but for i tried twelve seconds in train and i tried 
Bro024.C.dialogueact60	166.054	171.32	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and i tried to um um the same in trained i'm i 
Bro024.C.dialogueact61	171.32	173.25	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i'm i said six seconds untrained and six seconds 
Bro024.C.dialogueact62	173.25	176.82	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and six seconds and train was about point three percent better 
Bro024.C.dialogueact63	177.95	184.205	C	Grad	fh|s^no	-1	0	um and um it's not clear to me yet whether that's something significant so i want 
Bro024.C.dialogueact64	184.538	194.38	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so i want to do some tests and um actually make some plots of um for a particular amount of dying test what happens if you vary the amount of that in train 
Bro024.F.dialogueact65	196.626	196.976	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.D.dialogueact66	197.794	210.354	D	Professor	s	-1	0	uh good there i don't know if you'd follow this stuff but this is uh they uh um long term long term window the fifties yeah he yeah we 
Bro024.D.dialogueact68	210.699	210.769	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah he yeah we 
Bro024.D.dialogueact69	210.769	211.909	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah he talk about oh yeah we just talk about it i mean 
Bro024.G.dialogueact67	210.592	210.792	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah he yeah we 
Bro024.G.dialogueact70	210.792	212.012	G	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah he talk about oh okay yeah we just talk about it i mean 
Bro024.D.dialogueact71	211.909	212.289	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	talk about oh okay just talk about it i mean 
Bro024.D.dialogueact73	212.399	213.019	D	Professor	s	-1	0	it's okay 
Bro024.G.dialogueact72	212.012	212.142	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bro024.D.dialogueact74	213.019	213.529	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	it's 
Bro024.C.dialogueact75	213.892	216.882	C	Grad	s	-1	0	it's so was actually around the experiments mostly how 
Bro024.C.dialogueact76	216.882	219.852	C	Grad	s	-1	0	mostly how i was i was hoping to have the plots with me today i just 
Bro024.C.dialogueact77	219.852	220.982	C	Grad	s	-1	0	plots with me today i just and get to it 
Bro024.C.dialogueact78	221.332	222.062	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	but um 
Bro024.C.dialogueact79	223.79	226.32	C	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah i would i would be curious about people's feedback on this because i'm 
Bro024.C.dialogueact80	226.32	233.033	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	this because i'm i i think there is um i think is is kind of like a bit of a tricky engineering problem trying to figure out what's 
Bro024.C.dialogueact81	233.033	236.106	C	Grad	s	-1	0	trying to figure out what's the optimal away to set this up so um 
Bro024.C.dialogueact82	236.106	241.116	C	Grad	fh|s^cc	-1	0	so um if i make the plots and then put some postscript up on my on my webpage and i mentioned 
Bro024.C.dialogueact83	241.516	244.066	C	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	and i mentioned my status report if people want to take the lead 
Bro024.D.dialogueact84	245.499	246.879	D	Professor	s^co	-1	0	you could clarify something for you're 
Bro024.D.dialogueact85	246.879	248.429	D	Professor	s	-1	0	something for you're saying point three percent 
Bro024.D.dialogueact86	249.015	255.383	D	Professor	qy^bu^d	-1	0	take a point three percent hit when the and testing links aren't don't match or something so 
Bro024.E.dialogueact87	249.598	249.848	E	PhD	z	-1	0	take a point three percent 
Bro024.D.dialogueact88	255.383	256.003	D	Professor	qy	-1	0	well it so 
Bro024.C.dialogueact90	256.082	256.772	C	Grad	%--	-1	0	well it 
Bro024.D.dialogueact89	256.003	256.143	D	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	well it 
Bro024.C.dialogueact91	257.93	262.25	C	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	i i don't think it it's just for any mismatch you take a hit in some 
Bro024.D.dialogueact92	261.45	261.73	D	Professor	b	-1	0	you take a hit 
Bro024.C.dialogueact93	262.56	266.929	C	Grad	s	-1	0	in some cases it might be better to have a mismatch 
Bro024.C.dialogueact95	267.289	279.764	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	like i think i saw something like like if you only have two seconds in test or um maybe was something four seconds you actually do a little better if you um train on six seconds and if you train on four seconds 
Bro024.D.dialogueact94	266.95	267.42	D	Professor	b	-1	0	a mismatch like i think i saw 
Bro024.D.dialogueact96	278.65	279.08	D	Professor	b	-1	0	and if you train on four seconds 
Bro024.C.dialogueact97	280.404	280.874	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro024.C.dialogueact98	281.36	290.84	C	Grad	s	-1	0	but the case that with the point three percent it was it using six seconds and test um comparing train on twelve seconds versus train on six seconds 
Bro024.D.dialogueact99	291.275	292.015	D	Professor	qw^rt	-1	0	the train on which was worse 
Bro024.C.dialogueact100	292.253	293.873	C	Grad	s	-1	0	the train on twelve seconds 
Bro024.D.dialogueact101	294.28	294.53	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay but twenty three 
Bro024.D.dialogueact102	294.53	297.21	D	Professor	qw^d	-1	0	okay but twenty three percent uh well from what what this point 
Bro024.D.dialogueact103	297.776	298.876	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	this point three percent 
Bro024.C.dialogueact104	299.03	310.176	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	um did d. d. accuracy is when from it was something vaguely like ninety five point six accuracy um improve tonight farce point nine one when i so four point four to four 
Bro024.D.dialogueact105	309.81	311.85	D	Professor	s	-1	0	one when i so four point four to four point one 
Bro024.C.dialogueact106	312.19	312.5	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	so yeah 
Bro024.D.dialogueact107	312.623	313.183	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	so yeah so about thought 
Bro024.D.dialogueact108	313.183	317.972	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so about thought an eight percent uh seven or eight percent relative 
Bro024.C.dialogueact109	318.39	318.65	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bro024.D.dialogueact110	318.932	319.592	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	okay 
Bro024.D.dialogueact111	320.78	321.19	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah well i think in a you 
Bro024.D.dialogueact112	321.19	325.37	D	Professor	s	-1	0	well i think in a you know if you if you're going for an evaluation system you care but if you 
Bro024.D.dialogueact113	325.37	330.66	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but if you were doing uh life system that people are actually using nobody would notice it's 
Bro024.D.dialogueact114	330.66	334.77	D	Professor	s	-1	0	well that's that's interesting notice it's uh i think the thing is to get something it's practical it really is 
Bro024.C.dialogueact115	333.71	333.8	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	well that's it 
Bro024.C.dialogueact116	333.8	334.98	C	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	well that's that's interesting it really is 
Bro024.C.dialogueact117	335.66	337.42	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	i i i see your point i guess i was thinking 
Bro024.C.dialogueact118	337.42	342.494	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	your point i guess i was thinking of it as um an interesting research problem but 
Bro024.C.dialogueact120	342.938	353.94	C	Grad	s	-1	0	but i was i was thinking for the it's are you paper we could have a section saying for smart com we we indie tried this approach and uh interactive system which i don't think is being done before 
Bro024.D.dialogueact119	342.54	342.76	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	but 
Bro024.D.dialogueact121	351.537	351.807	D	Professor	b	-1	0	interactive 
Bro024.C.dialogueact123	354.477	357.227	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and and then there was two research questions from that and one is like 
Bro024.D.dialogueact122	354.13	354.52	D	Professor	b	-1	0	and and 
Bro024.C.dialogueact124	357.227	360.647	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	that and one is like does it still work if you just use the past history 
Bro024.D.dialogueact125	360.711	361.231	D	Professor	b	-1	0	history and the 
Bro024.C.dialogueact126	361.65	361.86	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	and the 
Bro024.C.dialogueact127	361.86	365.394	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and the other was this question of um that was just talking about now so i guess that's 
Bro024.C.dialogueact128	365.394	367.154	C	Grad	s	-1	0	now so i guess that's why i thought it was interesting i mean short time 
Bro024.D.dialogueact129	367.32	377.349	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean short time at fifty short time kept from calculation uh i mean i mean calculation work that people have in commercial systems they do this all the time they but they 
Bro024.D.dialogueact130	377.479	381.567	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	they but they calculated from previous occurrences and use it you know but 
Bro024.C.dialogueact131	380.52	380.72	C	Grad	b	-1	0	occurrences and use 
Bro024.C.dialogueact132	380.72	381.14	C	Grad	b	-1	0	occurrences and use it you know but 
Bro024.D.dialogueact133	381.567	382.707	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	it you know but but uh 
Bro024.D.dialogueact134	383.264	388.067	D	Professor	s	-1	0	oh okay as you say there hasn't been that much of this long long time uh specter work 
Bro024.C.dialogueact136	388.425	389.325	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay so that's that's 
Bro024.D.dialogueact135	388.277	388.707	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	oh okay 
Bro024.C.dialogueact137	389.325	390.985	C	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	so that's that's that's standard 
Bro024.C.dialogueact138	391.155	391.535	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um pretty 
Bro024.D.dialogueact139	391.3	391.55	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	um pretty 
Bro024.D.dialogueact140	391.91	392.45	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	um okay pretty calm yeah 
Bro024.C.dialogueact142	392.87	393.16	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay calm yeah um 
Bro024.D.dialogueact141	392.45	392.69	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	okay calm yeah 
Bro024.D.dialogueact143	393.55	393.81	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro024.D.dialogueact144	394.1	395.11	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	but uh yeah so it is interesting 
Bro024.D.dialogueact145	395.11	395.37	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah so it is interesting 
Bro024.D.dialogueact146	395.37	396.22	D	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	yeah so it is interesting and the other thing is i 
Bro024.D.dialogueact147	396.22	401.964	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and the other thing is i mean there's two sides to these really small uh gradations in performance um 
Bro024.D.dialogueact148	401.964	411.121	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	in performance um me on the one hand in a practical system if something is uh four point four percent error four point one percent error people really tell people tell the difference on the other hand 
Bro024.D.dialogueact149	411.519	426.422	D	Professor	s	-1	0	on the other hand when you're doing uh research you may it you might find that the way that you build up a change from uh ninety five percent accurate system to ninety eight percent accurate system is to ten or twelve little things that you do the teacher point three percent so 
Bro024.D.dialogueact150	426.422	430.87	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so so they they they if i don't mean to say that they're they're irrelevant 
Bro024.D.dialogueact151	431.417	432.777	D	Professor	s	-1	0	uh they are relevant but 
Bro024.D.dialogueact152	433.067	436.811	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um for a demo you don't see it 
Bro024.C.dialogueact153	436.338	436.728	C	Grad	b	-1	0	you don't see it 
Bro024.C.dialogueact154	437.743	438.053	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right okay 
Bro024.C.dialogueact155	438.053	438.363	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bro024.D.dialogueact156	438.927	439.147	D	Professor	b	-1	0	okay 
Bro024.C.dialogueact157	441.17	442.11	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	and um 
Bro024.C.dialogueact158	443.42	444.21	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	but let's see um 
Bro024.C.dialogueact159	444.21	444.67	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro024.C.dialogueact160	446.21	446.42	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay and then and does 
Bro024.C.dialogueact161	446.42	454.7	C	Grad	s^tc	+1	1	okay and then and does um uh thing i want to start looking at um we we is um the choice of the analysis window links i've just 
Bro024.C.dialogueact162	454.7	456.32	C	Grad	s	-1	0	window links i've just been using two seconds just because 
Bro024.C.dialogueact163	456.673	458.863	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	just because that's the carlos that before 
Bro024.C.dialogueact164	459.353	462.903	C	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	uh i wrote to him asking about how he chose to two seconds 
Bro024.C.dialogueact165	463.432	465.942	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and it seemed like he chose to debate informally 
Bro024.C.dialogueact166	466.442	467.762	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bro024.C.dialogueact167	468.54	474.166	C	Grad	s	+1	1	but it h. d. case setup i should be able to do some experiments um just staring got lang say between one and three 
Bro024.C.dialogueact168	474.166	478.406	C	Grad	s^e	+1	1	say between one and three seconds in a few different reverberations conditions um 
Bro024.C.dialogueact169	478.406	484.886	C	Grad	fh|s^e	-1	0	um say this room and also a a few of the artificial impulse responses we have fervor variation 
Bro024.C.dialogueact170	485.679	488.269	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	just i'm making some plots and seeing how they look 
Bro024.C.dialogueact171	489.186	490.006	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um so 
Bro024.C.dialogueact172	490.006	490.616	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro024.C.dialogueact173	492.75	501.027	C	Grad	s	-1	0	with it does something great i was using one second or two seconds or four seconds is that a power of two um number of samples and um although 
Bro024.C.dialogueact174	501.027	504.737	C	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	and um although just for the for the once in between i guess i'll the syrup i'd 
Bro024.D.dialogueact175	504.887	505.337	D	Professor	b	-1	0	i'd 
Bro024.D.dialogueact176	506.94	514.998	D	Professor	s	+1	1	i guess one thing that might also be an issue um part of what you're doing is you're getting uh spectrum over a bunch of different kinds of speech sounds 
Bro024.D.dialogueact177	515.888	516.488	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	um and 
Bro024.D.dialogueact178	516.488	521.02	D	Professor	s	+1	1	and so it might matter how fast someone was talking 
Bro024.C.dialogueact179	521.27	521.49	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.D.dialogueact180	521.638	528.379	D	Professor	s	+1	1	if there's a lot of phones and one second maybe you'll get a really good sampling all these different things and 
Bro024.D.dialogueact181	528.379	532.719	D	Professor	s	+1	1	and and uh on the other hand some stalking slowly maybe be more so 
Bro024.D.dialogueact182	532.769	533.099	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	be more so i don't know if 
Bro024.C.dialogueact184	533.748	534.098	C	Grad	b	-1	0	i don't know if you have some samples 
Bro024.D.dialogueact183	533.65	537.428	D	Professor	s^no	-1	0	i don't know if you have some samples faster slower speech but 
Bro024.D.dialogueact185	537.428	539.248	D	Professor	s	-1	0	speech but it might make a difference i 
Bro024.D.dialogueact186	539.338	539.698	D	Professor	s^no	-1	0	i 
Bro024.C.dialogueact187	541.003	541.643	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah i don't 
Bro024.C.dialogueact188	541.643	549.04	C	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	yeah i don't i don't think that t. i. digits doubted that i have um it we is would be appropriate for that 
Bro024.D.dialogueact189	548.57	549.17	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	for that 
Bro024.D.dialogueact190	549.4	549.56	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.C.dialogueact191	550.984	557.893	C	Grad	qw^cs	-1	0	what what are you what about if i i fed it through some kind of um speech processing algorithm the change the speech right 
Bro024.D.dialogueact192	559.32	565.1	D	Professor	s^bk|s^nd	-1	0	you have to have the segregation of of uh whatever you do uh had on i thought maybe yeah 
Bro024.D.dialogueact193	565.1	565.54	D	Professor	s^am	-1	0	thought maybe yeah 
Bro024.D.dialogueact194	565.82	566.05	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	thought maybe yeah maybe feet 
Bro024.D.dialogueact195	566.14	570.318	D	Professor	s^am^df	-1	0	yeah maybe feet it's something that sounds that that's that's pretty good job of that 
Bro024.C.dialogueact196	570.79	571.1	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah well i just if you think 
Bro024.C.dialogueact197	571.1	573.02	C	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	well i just if you think it's worth looking into i mean it 
Bro024.D.dialogueact198	571.421	572.181	D	Professor	s	-1	0	well i just if you think it's worth looking into 
Bro024.C.dialogueact199	573.02	575.88	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	i mean it it's getting a little away from reverberations 
Bro024.D.dialogueact200	576.337	577.227	D	Professor	h|s^aa	-1	0	um yeah it's just that you're 
Bro024.D.dialogueact201	577.417	579.137	D	Professor	s	-1	0	it's just that you're making a choice was 
Bro024.D.dialogueact202	579.825	589.31	D	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	yeah was thinking more in the system aspect if you're making a choice for spark on that that that it might be that it's it just the opposite number could be different depending on 
Bro024.C.dialogueact203	581.581	581.941	C	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah if you're making a choice 
Bro024.C.dialogueact204	588.48	588.95	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	different depending 
Bro024.D.dialogueact205	590.37	590.65	D	Professor	s^am	-1	0	could be 
Bro024.D.dialogueact206	591.03	591.38	D	Professor	s^no.%	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.C.dialogueact207	595.67	603.839	C	Grad	s^tc	-1	0	and then the third thing um i is um barry explained l. d. a. filtering to me yesterday 
Bro024.C.dialogueact208	604.349	614.168	C	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and so um like sirens thesis um today a series of experiments um training how the filters and um different conditions and you were 
Bro024.C.dialogueact209	614.168	617.118	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and you were interested in having me repeat this for 
Bro024.C.dialogueact210	618.332	619.952	C	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	so this means infection approaches 
Bro024.C.dialogueact211	619.952	620.612	C	Grad	qy	-1	0	approaches is that right or for these 
Bro024.C.dialogueact212	620.612	623.252	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	is that right or for these long analysis windows i guess is the right way to put it i guess 
Bro024.D.dialogueact213	623.77	643.126	D	Professor	s	-1	0	it i guess the the the issue is the generally shows prenup was that if you're have them moving moving window uh uh that that set of weights times things that uh move along shift along in time that you have in fact a linear time and green filter and you just happen 
Bro024.D.dialogueact214	643.667	647.637	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and you just happen to pick the particular one by all the ways to be equal 
Bro024.D.dialogueact215	648.331	655.377	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and so the issue is what are some other filters that you could use uh in that sense a filter and 
Bro024.C.dialogueact216	653.585	654.165	C	Grad	b	-1	0	uh in that sense a filter 
Bro024.D.dialogueact217	655.547	656.477	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bro024.D.dialogueact218	657.065	665.637	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	as the same i think the simplest thing to do is not to train anything but just do some sort of uh uh and handing uh kind of window kind of thing to sort 
Bro024.C.dialogueact219	663.584	663.894	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	handing uh 
Bro024.C.dialogueact220	664.094	664.404	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	kind of window 
Bro024.D.dialogueact221	665.637	667.727	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	kind of thing to sort of to de emphasized germs i think 
Bro024.D.dialogueact222	667.727	669.617	D	Professor	s	-1	0	germs i think that would sort of be the first thing to do 
Bro024.D.dialogueact223	670.243	679.331	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but then you have the l. d. a. yeah uh uh is interesting because it's sort of say well suppose you actually train this up to do the best you could buy some criterion over the 
Bro024.D.dialogueact224	679.679	681.119	D	Professor	qw	-1	0	over the filter look like that uh 
Bro024.C.dialogueact225	681.706	682.326	C	Grad	b	-1	0	uh and 
Bro024.D.dialogueact226	681.896	682.406	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh and 
Bro024.D.dialogueact227	682.406	683.786	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bro024.D.dialogueact228	684.669	686.849	D	Professor	s	-1	0	that's sort of we're doing in this ever our stuff 
Bro024.D.dialogueact229	687.259	687.999	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	and uh 
Bro024.D.dialogueact230	688.381	700.922	D	Professor	s^no	-1	0	it's still not clear to me in the long run with it the best thing to do would be to do that or to have some style eyes version of the filter that looks like these things you've trained up because you always have the problem a strained it for one condition isn't quite ready for another so 
Bro024.D.dialogueact231	701.032	701.362	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.D.dialogueact232	702.268	708.131	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	uh that's that's why that's why the roster filled is actually ended up lasting a long time people still using a quite 
Bro024.D.dialogueact233	708.131	711.382	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	people still using a quite a bit because you don't change it so it 
Bro024.D.dialogueact234	711.382	711.702	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	it so it 
Bro024.D.dialogueact235	712.46	713.32	D	Professor	s	-1	0	doesn't get any worse 
Bro024.D.dialogueact236	717.503	717.773	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.C.dialogueact237	718.224	718.444	C	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.D.dialogueact238	718.869	719.129	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	okay 
Bro024.C.dialogueact239	719.815	720.385	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	okay so um 
Bro024.C.dialogueact240	720.385	721.205	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	so um actually 
Bro024.C.dialogueact241	721.61	730.042	C	Grad	s	+1	1	actually i was just thinking about i was asking earlier which is about having less than say twelve seconds in this mark on system to do the means attraction you said and 
Bro024.C.dialogueact242	730.042	735.279	C	Grad	s^bu	+1	1	you said and systems are use caps i mean subtraction they can cat in a tighter and says and you 
Bro024.C.dialogueact243	735.339	740.639	C	Grad	qy^rt	+1	1	and you know how they address this issue of um testing versus training and 
Bro024.C.dialogueact244	740.839	741.189	C	Grad	%--	-1	0	training and 
Bro024.D.dialogueact246	744.843	745.123	D	Professor	s^co.%	-1	0	i think what they do is they do it's always 
Bro024.G.dialogueact245	744.694	746.834	G	Professor	s	+1	1	i think what they do is they do it's always online i mean 
Bro024.G.dialogueact247	746.834	749.814	G	Professor	s	+1	1	online i mean the you just take what you from the pasta 
Bro024.G.dialogueact248	750.557	752.957	G	Professor	s	+1	1	that you cut too it's i mean it's just subtract i mean 
Bro024.C.dialogueact249	753.7	754.08	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay um 
Bro024.C.dialogueact250	754.62	755.11	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um and then you 
Bro024.G.dialogueact251	755.72	763.103	G	Professor	s	-1	0	okay and then you can yeah you can increase your window what i but why do i get the more samples 
Bro024.C.dialogueact252	764.01	764.41	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	um 
Bro024.C.dialogueact253	764.41	764.82	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro024.C.dialogueact254	765.472	773.939	C	Grad	fh|qw	+1	1	and um so it's in that in that case what what did they do when they're um performing the capsule mean subtraction on the training that 
Bro024.C.dialogueact255	774.63	776.68	C	Grad	s^df	+1	1	the because you'd have hours and hours of training goddess do they 
Bro024.C.dialogueact256	776.68	779.248	C	Grad	qy^rt	+1	1	training goddess do they cut it off and start over at intervals 
Bro024.C.dialogueact257	779.77	780.44	C	Grad	s^e^rt	-1	0	at intervals or 
Bro024.C.dialogueact258	780.44	780.77	C	Grad	qrr.%--	-1	0	or 
Bro024.G.dialogueact259	782.32	787.355	G	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	oh well so do the have uh you you mean you have finals which are oh the follow slow or 
Bro024.G.dialogueact260	787.355	787.625	G	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	oh well or 
Bro024.C.dialogueact261	787.9	788.51	C	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	oh well no i guess not or 
Bro024.C.dialogueact262	788.51	789.22	C	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	no i guess not but yeah i mean 
Bro024.C.dialogueact264	789.29	789.57	C	Grad	%--	-1	0	but yeah i mean 
Bro024.G.dialogueact263	789.24	789.49	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	but yeah i mean 
Bro024.G.dialogueact265	789.79	793.47	G	Professor	s	-1	0	but yeah i mean usually have some of the training setris some of the conditions i mean 
Bro024.G.dialogueact266	793.47	799.113	G	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	i mean filings are i guess the same odor on the same size what this they tell on 
Bro024.G.dialogueact267	799.924	800.314	G	Professor	qy^g^rt	-1	0	on t. v. 
Bro024.C.dialogueact268	801.87	802.2	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay that is it okay so 
Bro024.C.dialogueact269	802.2	802.56	C	Grad	%--	-1	0	that is it okay so 
Bro024.C.dialogueact270	802.56	802.9	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	that is it okay so 
Bro024.C.dialogueact271	802.9	810.05	C	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	that is it okay so someone's interacting with the system though um morgan i morning said that you would tend to um chain outer insist together 
Bro024.C.dialogueact272	811.165	811.805	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um or well i think what i wish 
Bro024.D.dialogueact273	811.17	819.584	D	Professor	s	-1	0	um or well i think what i wish safeco what i was saying was that um at any given point you are going to start off with what you had from before 
Bro024.C.dialogueact274	813.18	813.37	C	Grad	b	-1	0	was that um 
Bro024.D.dialogueact275	820.184	820.414	D	Professor	%--	-1	0	from and so if 
Bro024.D.dialogueact276	820.414	822.654	D	Professor	s	+1	1	from and so if you're splitting things up into other insists if it's 
Bro024.D.dialogueact277	822.654	830.181	D	Professor	s^df	+1	1	other insists if it's in a dialogue system where are you going to be asking uh you it for some information there's some initial something and you 
Bro024.D.dialogueact278	830.321	834.345	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	and you know the first time out you you might have some general average but you you you 
Bro024.D.dialogueact279	834.345	836.535	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but you you you don't have very much information that 
Bro024.D.dialogueact280	837.075	839.615	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but that after they've given one daughter and she's got something you can 
Bro024.D.dialogueact281	839.755	841.745	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	something you can computer mean kester from that 
Bro024.C.dialogueact282	842.0	842.37	C	Grad	b	-1	0	and then can use it for 
Bro024.D.dialogueact283	842.202	844.422	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and then can use it for the next thing that they say uh 
Bro024.D.dialogueact284	844.632	845.022	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	say uh so that you know the 
Bro024.D.dialogueact285	845.475	848.275	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	so that you know the performance should be better the second time um 
Bro024.D.dialogueact286	848.942	849.432	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	um and 
Bro024.D.dialogueact287	849.47	849.712	D	Professor	%	-1	0	and 
Bro024.D.dialogueact288	849.752	856.736	D	Professor	s	+1	1	and i think the jury six of exactly how people handle that and how they handle the training i'm sure vary from place to place but i think 
Bro024.D.dialogueact289	856.736	863.725	D	Professor	s	-1	0	to place but i think the ideally it seems to me anyway that you you would want to do the same thing in training is she doing test 
Bro024.D.dialogueact290	864.589	866.619	D	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	but that's that's just uh a prejudiced i think anybody 
Bro024.D.dialogueact291	866.619	870.53	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i a prejudiced i think anybody working on this with some particular task we experiment 
Bro024.C.dialogueact292	868.042	868.452	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	on this with some 
Bro024.C.dialogueact293	870.86	881.876	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i guess the question i had was um amount did @reject@ was the amount of data that you give it to um up they just him because 
Bro024.C.dialogueact294	881.876	888.559	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	they just him because so you if you have say five thousand audiences in your training set um and you keep the means in the last outer instead of trying to get 
Bro024.C.dialogueact295	888.559	890.949	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	outer instead of trying to get to the five thousand items no but those 
Bro024.D.dialogueact296	890.66	893.82	D	Professor	s^ar|s.%--	-1	0	items no but those are all different people with different i mean indie 
Bro024.D.dialogueact297	894.358	897.848	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	so for instance in in that telephone past these are different phone calls so you 
Bro024.D.dialogueact298	897.848	900.923	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	phone calls so you don't want to change it together from a from a different phone call 
Bro024.C.dialogueact299	901.54	901.89	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay so 
Bro024.C.dialogueact300	901.89	902.88	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	okay so so so they would 
Bro024.C.dialogueact302	903.244	903.864	C	Grad	%	-1	0	so it's within speaker 
Bro024.D.dialogueact301	903.18	904.28	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so it's within speaker or within phone calls 
Bro024.D.dialogueact304	904.28	905.16	D	Professor	s	-1	0	or within phone calls to dialogue system 
Bro024.G.dialogueact303	904.124	904.374	G	Professor	b	-1	0	or within phone calls 
Bro024.D.dialogueact305	905.16	911.72	D	Professor	s	-1	0	right to dialogue system it's within whatever this characteristic you're trying to get rid of is expected to be consistent over 
Bro024.G.dialogueact306	905.246	905.516	G	Professor	b	-1	0	to dialogue system 
Bro024.C.dialogueact307	911.98	913.38	C	Grad	%--	-1	0	right and right okay so over right 
Bro024.D.dialogueact308	912.29	912.41	D	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	and right 
Bro024.C.dialogueact309	913.38	913.66	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right okay so 
Bro024.C.dialogueact310	913.66	913.96	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right okay so 
Bro024.C.dialogueact311	913.96	919.19	C	Grad	s	+1	1	right okay so you do you in sewing training you would start over at every new phone call or every you speak yeah okay yeah 
Bro024.C.dialogueact313	919.3	919.45	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	yeah okay yeah 
Bro024.D.dialogueact312	918.905	919.265	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	you speak yeah okay yeah 
Bro024.C.dialogueact314	919.53	919.8	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah okay yeah 
Bro024.D.dialogueact315	919.926	920.156	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah okay yeah now you know maybe 
Bro024.D.dialogueact316	920.156	922.356	D	Professor	s	-1	0	now you know maybe you something from the others just because at the beginning 
Bro024.D.dialogueact317	922.356	925.546	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	others just because at the beginning of the call you don't know anything in 
Bro024.D.dialogueact318	925.546	929.422	D	Professor	s	-1	0	in she might have some kind of general thing that's your best guess to start with but 
Bro024.D.dialogueact319	929.422	929.662	D	Professor	%--	-1	0	with but 
Bro024.D.dialogueact320	930.41	931.43	D	Professor	%--	-1	0	so i i 
Bro024.D.dialogueact321	931.994	933.374	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i a lot of these things are proprietary so we're doing a little 
Bro024.D.dialogueact322	933.374	934.874	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so we're doing a little bit of guesswork here i mean 
Bro024.D.dialogueact323	934.874	938.154	D	Professor	qw	-1	0	bit of guesswork here i mean what a couple of the people do who really face these problems in the field well they have companies 
Bro024.D.dialogueact324	938.154	939.194	D	Professor	s	-1	0	well they have companies they don't tell the people 
Bro024.D.dialogueact325	939.194	941.114	D	Professor	s	-1	0	they don't tell the people exactly what they do but but i 
Bro024.C.dialogueact327	941.141	941.761	C	Grad	b	-1	0	but but i 
Bro024.D.dialogueact326	941.114	947.601	D	Professor	s	-1	0	right but but i mean when you that the hints that you get from what they let me talk about it or that they do y'all do something like that 
Bro024.C.dialogueact328	947.97	948.23	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right okay i see like that 
Bro024.C.dialogueact329	948.23	948.62	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay i see 
Bro024.C.dialogueact330	948.62	948.97	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay i see 
Bro024.C.dialogueact331	949.26	955.0	C	Grad	s	-1	0	because because i it's so this smart contacts for stuff it's just t. v. movie information system and yeah but you might have somebody 
Bro024.D.dialogueact332	955.07	956.92	D	Professor	s^bk|s	-1	0	and yeah but you might have somebody who's using it 
Bro024.C.dialogueact333	955.84	956.2	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	and yeah but you might have somebody who's using it 
Bro024.C.dialogueact335	957.37	957.59	C	Grad	b	-1	0	and then the lady 
Bro024.D.dialogueact334	957.33	959.52	D	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah right and then the lady mind in somebody else's using it and so 
Bro024.C.dialogueact336	958.944	959.304	C	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah right mind in somebody else's using it and so 
Bro024.C.dialogueact338	959.722	960.042	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right right i see i was i was using it and so it's like yeah 
Bro024.C.dialogueact339	960.042	960.202	C	Grad	s^bk^r	-1	0	right i see i was i was it's like yeah 
Bro024.C.dialogueact340	960.202	960.682	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right i see i was i was it's like yeah 
Bro024.D.dialogueact337	959.71	961.02	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	right right i see i was i was about to say so if if using it and so it's like yeah 
Bro024.C.dialogueact341	960.682	964.912	C	Grad	s:qw	-1	0	right i see i was i was about to say so if if you ask you what what movies are on t. v. tonight if it's like yeah 
Bro024.D.dialogueact342	961.02	961.17	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	about to say so if if 
Bro024.D.dialogueact343	962.076	962.496	D	Professor	b	-1	0	you ask you what 
Bro024.C.dialogueact344	964.912	968.097	C	Grad	s	-1	0	on t. v. tonight if i look at my worse watch when i say that it's about two seconds the way i currently 
Bro024.C.dialogueact346	968.347	973.808	C	Grad	s	-1	0	the way i currently have the means attraction um set up do it you know it's it's windows two seconds so 
Bro024.D.dialogueact345	968.22	968.56	D	Professor	b	-1	0	the way i currently 
Bro024.C.dialogueact347	973.808	978.428	C	Grad	s	-1	0	two seconds so what you just said about what do you start with raises the question of what do i start with that i guess it 
Bro024.D.dialogueact348	975.219	975.369	D	Professor	b	-1	0	what do you start with 
Bro024.C.dialogueact349	978.428	979.398	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	with that i guess it because 
Bro024.D.dialogueact350	980.37	980.65	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	well okay 
Bro024.D.dialogueact351	980.65	981.16	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	well okay so in that situation 
Bro024.D.dialogueact352	981.16	987.302	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so in that situation though do it's a little different there is i think you're talking about there's only one 
Bro024.D.dialogueact353	988.518	990.108	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it it it also depends we're getting a little off track 
Bro024.D.dialogueact354	990.108	991.358	D	Professor	s	-1	0	oh right we're getting a little off track here but but 
Bro024.C.dialogueact355	991.428	991.658	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	oh right here but but 
Bro024.C.dialogueact357	991.658	991.928	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	oh right here but but 
Bro024.D.dialogueact356	991.528	992.498	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	oh right here but but but 
Bro024.D.dialogueact358	993.98	1001.16	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um there's been some discussion about whether the work we're doing in that project is going to be for the kiosk or for the mobile or for both and i think for this 
Bro024.D.dialogueact359	1001.27	1003.36	D	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	and i think for this kind of discussion it matters it's 
Bro024.D.dialogueact360	1003.95	1007.19	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	it's in the chaos and the physical situation is the same 
Bro024.D.dialogueact361	1008.19	1012.76	D	Professor	s	-1	0	it's kind of you know the exact interaction with a microphone is going to differ depending on the person and so forth but at least 
Bro024.D.dialogueact362	1012.76	1015.24	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and so forth but at least the basic acoustics are going to be the same so 
Bro024.D.dialogueact363	1015.83	1024.05	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so if if it's really and one kiosk then i think that you could just chained together and and you know as much as much speeches possible to because 
Bro024.D.dialogueact364	1024.66	1028.91	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	yeah because what you're really trying to get at is the is reverberations characteristic 
Bro024.C.dialogueact365	1028.74	1029.32	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah characteristic but in in 
Bro024.D.dialogueact366	1029.5	1035.69	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but in in the case of the mobile uh presumably the acoustics changing all over the place 
Bro024.C.dialogueact367	1035.72	1036.08	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	the place and in that case 
Bro024.D.dialogueact368	1036.22	1048.44	D	Professor	s	-1	0	right and in that case you probably don't want to have it be enlisted you want to have some sort of it's it's not a question of how long do you think it's you can get an approximation to stationary something given that's not really station 
Bro024.C.dialogueact369	1043.06	1043.78	C	Grad	%	-1	0	do you think it's you can 
Bro024.C.dialogueact370	1047.04	1047.45	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	given that's not really station 
Bro024.C.dialogueact372	1048.85	1049.21	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right and i 
Bro024.D.dialogueact373	1048.91	1048.98	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	right 
Bro024.G.dialogueact371	1048.76	1049.46	G	Professor	b	-1	0	right and i 
Bro024.C.dialogueact374	1049.62	1052.73	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and i i i guess that's just started thinking of another question which is 
Bro024.C.dialogueact375	1052.73	1058.41	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	question which is for for the very first frame what what do i do if i'm if 
Bro024.C.dialogueact376	1058.41	1063.61	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i do if i'm if i take if they use that for any calculate the mean then i'm just going to get nothing right 
Bro024.D.dialogueact377	1061.32	1061.79	D	Professor	b	-1	0	then i'm 
Bro024.C.dialogueact379	1064.45	1064.85	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro024.D.dialogueact378	1063.98	1064.25	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	nothing um right 
Bro024.C.dialogueact380	1065.17	1070.04	C	Grad	s^bu^cs	-1	0	so i should probably have some kind of default mean for the first couple friends okay 
Bro024.D.dialogueact381	1067.62	1067.9	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	mean 
Bro024.D.dialogueact382	1069.38	1069.7	D	Professor	s^aa^r	-1	0	couple friends 
Bro024.C.dialogueact383	1070.04	1070.3	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bro024.D.dialogueact384	1070.78	1070.99	D	Professor	s^aa^r	-1	0	okay 
Bro024.D.dialogueact385	1071.15	1072.07	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	or subtract nothing i mean it's 
Bro024.D.dialogueact386	1072.18	1073.49	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	worth a try nothing i mean it's 
Bro024.C.dialogueact387	1073.52	1074.31	C	Grad	s^bk^m	-1	0	worth a try nothing and that's that's 
Bro024.C.dialogueact388	1074.31	1079.61	C	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	and that's that's i guess that's something that's be people have figured out how to deal with in caps immune subtraction as well 
Bro024.D.dialogueact389	1074.45	1075.13	D	Professor	b	-1	0	and that's that's i guess that's something 
Bro024.D.dialogueact390	1080.3	1081.43	D	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	yeah people do something they they 
Bro024.D.dialogueact391	1081.5	1084.37	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	they they uh they have some um 
Bro024.D.dialogueact392	1086.03	1086.48	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.D.dialogueact393	1087.06	1097.86	D	Professor	s	-1	0	in in castro means subtraction for short term window analysis windows this is usually done you're trying to get rid of some very general characteristic and 
Bro024.D.dialogueact394	1097.86	1104.96	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and so uh if you have any other information about what a gen kind of characteristic would be then you you can do it there you can also 
Bro024.F.dialogueact395	1104.07	1104.74	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	you can do it there can also 
Bro024.F.dialogueact396	1105.08	1106.89	F	PhD	s^cs^r	-1	0	you can also reflect the data 
Bro024.F.dialogueact397	1107.49	1108.48	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so you take uh you 
Bro024.F.dialogueact398	1109.01	1109.29	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	know i'm not sure 
Bro024.F.dialogueact399	1109.49	1111.27	F	PhD	s^no	-1	0	know i'm not sure how many frames you need but you take that 
Bro024.C.dialogueact401	1111.4	1111.68	C	Grad	b	-1	0	but you take that 
Bro024.F.dialogueact400	1111.27	1116.27	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but you take that many from the front flip around as the negative values so you can always 
Bro024.D.dialogueact402	1114.87	1115.13	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	as the negative values 
Bro024.D.dialogueact403	1115.13	1115.35	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	as the negative values 
Bro024.D.dialogueact405	1116.39	1116.7	D	Professor	b	-1	0	so you can always 
Bro024.F.dialogueact404	1116.27	1117.08	F	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	so you can always 
Bro024.D.dialogueact406	1118.41	1133.25	D	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah the thing is that that and uh i remember b. b. n. doing is is that if you have a multi pass system um if the first say it takes most of the complication the second or third pass could be very very quick just looking at a relatively 
Bro024.C.dialogueact408	1133.42	1133.85	C	Grad	b	-1	0	just looking at a relatively 
Bro024.D.dialogueact407	1133.25	1137.47	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	just looking at a relatively small a small uh space of prophecies 
Bro024.C.dialogueact409	1137.69	1137.95	C	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.D.dialogueact410	1138.25	1141.98	D	Professor	s	-1	0	then you can do your first pass without any subtraction at all 
Bro024.C.dialogueact411	1142.37	1142.44	C	Grad	b	-1	0	and 
Bro024.D.dialogueact412	1142.93	1154.0	D	Professor	s	-1	0	okay and then your second pass uh uh eliminates those most of those policies by uh by having improved version the analysis so 
Bro024.C.dialogueact413	1153.26	1153.46	C	Grad	b	-1	0	the analysis 
Bro024.C.dialogueact414	1154.1	1154.34	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay so 
Bro024.D.dialogueact415	1154.11	1154.5	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	okay so 
Bro024.C.dialogueact416	1155.99	1156.21	C	Grad	b	-1	0	so that was all that 
Bro024.C.dialogueact417	1156.36	1157.52	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so that was all that 
Bro024.D.dialogueact418	1157.44	1157.73	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.F.dialogueact419	1158.73	1159.33	F	PhD	qy^co^rt^tc	+1	1	yeah going to go bare

Bro024.A.dialogueact426	1182.19	1188.78	A	Grad	fh|qy	-1	0	and i should i should explain um more about what what i'm proposing to do stuff 
Bro024.D.dialogueact427	1188.33	1189.9	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	stuff they brief 
Bro024.F.dialogueact428	1189.29	1189.85	F	PhD	s^na	-1	0	they brief 
Bro024.A.dialogueact429	1190.06	1190.36	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay um 
Bro024.A.dialogueact430	1190.84	1191.37	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	okay um so briefly 
Bro024.A.dialogueact431	1191.37	1209.45	A	Grad	s	+1	1	so briefly i'm proposing to do uh and new approach to speech recognition using um a combination of uh most p. p. and ideas and idea is um about the uh acoustics enact phonetic approach to speech recognition um 
Bro024.A.dialogueact432	1209.88	1231.5	A	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	um so i'll be using these graphical models that um that implement the multi band approach to recognize set of intermediate categories that my involve um things like phonetic features or uh other other feature and things that are more closely related to the acoustic signal itself 
Bro024.A.dialogueact433	1232.12	1247.61	A	Grad	fh|s^df	+1	1	um and i hope in all this is that by going multi banning by going into these um intermediate classifications that we can get a system that's more robust to done seen noises and situations like that um 
Bro024.A.dialogueact434	1247.94	1248.68	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	like that um 
Bro024.A.dialogueact435	1249.15	1250.05	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	and so some of the 
Bro024.A.dialogueact436	1250.59	1258.81	A	Grad	s	-1	0	some of the research issues involved in this are um one what kind of intermediate categories do we need to classify 
Bro024.A.dialogueact437	1259.4	1273.41	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um another one is um what what other types of structures in these multi band graphical models should we consider in order to um combined evidence from the sub bands and 
Bro024.A.dialogueact438	1274.0	1288.13	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	uh the third one is how do we how do we merged all of the uh information from individual um multi being classes fires to come up with the word word recognition or our phone recognition um 
Bro024.A.dialogueact439	1288.82	1289.57	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	um so basically 
Bro024.A.dialogueact440	1289.57	1292.14	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so basically that's that's what i've been doing and we've got two weeks 
Bro024.A.dialogueact442	1292.31	1292.76	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	and we've got two weeks 
Bro024.F.dialogueact441	1292.28	1293.32	F	PhD	s^bu|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	and i we've got two weeks huh 
Bro024.A.dialogueact443	1294.02	1298.06	A	Grad	s^na	-1	0	got two weeks to brush up on on presentations stuff and um 
Bro024.A.dialogueact444	1298.06	1299.54	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um i 
Bro024.D.dialogueact445	1299.91	1301.6	D	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	i say finishing cases and to me 
Bro024.A.dialogueact446	1300.65	1300.8	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	say finishing cases 
Bro024.A.dialogueact447	1302.41	1303.07	A	Grad	s^bk|s^na	-1	0	oh that too yeah yeah

Bro024.F.dialogueact474	1331.91	1332.72	F	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah i i to go see down and just everything 
Bro024.B.dialogueact475	1332.48	1332.72	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah i i and just everything 
Bro024.B.dialogueact476	1332.72	1337.23	B	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	yeah i i actually felt most of busy know it was meeting with can do um and just everything 
Bro024.B.dialogueact477	1337.77	1338.22	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	do um but i just 
Bro024.B.dialogueact478	1338.22	1338.91	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but i just 
Bro024.B.dialogueact479	1339.13	1339.44	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	um so the last 
Bro024.B.dialogueact480	1339.44	1343.92	B	PhD	s	+1	2	um so the last week uh i showed some to visit or you speech the i just 
Bro024.B.dialogueact481	1343.92	1345.56	B	PhD	s^e	+1	1	speech the i just like some physics pleasant 
Bro024.B.dialogueact482	1346.31	1347.57	B	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	and um i didn't i mean i 
Bro024.B.dialogueact483	1347.57	1349.05	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i didn't i mean i i've wanted to this is on and i wasn't 
Bro024.B.dialogueact484	1349.16	1352.51	B	PhD	s	+1	1	on and i wasn't getting that is is on the the idea gets those like 
Bro024.B.dialogueact485	1352.51	1355.41	B	PhD	s	+1	2	idea gets those like looking into while what is wrong with the kids it's why why i was 
Bro024.B.dialogueact486	1355.49	1356.69	B	PhD	s	-1	0	it's why why i was not getting it and everyone 
Bro024.B.dialogueact487	1356.69	1363.06	B	PhD	s	+1	2	not getting it and everyone had uh no i system age ten is a reason for the idea that you perform was in the basement so 
Bro024.B.dialogueact488	1363.87	1366.15	B	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	so uh i actually take time and the first thing i did 
Bro024.B.dialogueact489	1366.15	1376.04	B	PhD	s	-1	0	time and the first thing i did was i just gave the nauseous to me by a factor which is less than wanted to see that but i found it on the arms and uh and uh program for the kid it's and i used as a approach so the first thing i 
Bro024.B.dialogueact490	1376.04	1378.57	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so the first thing i did go to just kids in our system it i've formed 
Bro024.B.dialogueact491	1378.72	1379.3	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	system it i've formed so 
Bro024.B.dialogueact492	1379.77	1384.38	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so that the prisoners that i've shown here at uh uh abuses using then you wouldn't 
Bro024.B.dialogueact493	1384.38	1388.58	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	you wouldn't then you take me nothing but the not just to make skated by in fact points like 
Bro024.B.dialogueact494	1389.1	1390.58	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so it's just i'd hawk i mean something 
Bro024.B.dialogueact495	1390.58	1393.26	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	hawk i mean something to me to visit because it's our too much for anything 
Bro024.B.dialogueact496	1394.1	1407.09	B	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	so does this that and i don't either and i could see some those are those are was like the uh the the patterns knowledge is to mission although uh culmination scheme is looking good for like the odd noise type of thing because i've tony 
Bro024.B.dialogueact497	1407.09	1414.31	B	PhD	s	-1	0	because i've tony tony reserved indicated is a nice thought nice condition for the test daily just like 
Bro024.B.dialogueact498	1414.31	1417.08	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	daily just like the best i could see that uh many 
Bro024.B.dialogueact499	1417.62	1427.53	B	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	uh many non stationary any noise like bible at all or sell they are any street because i'm western always it's like it's our performing of the u. s. 
Bro024.B.dialogueact500	1428.22	1428.56	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro024.B.dialogueact501	1429.67	1434.76	B	PhD	s	-1	0	uh so that that's the first thing i'd uh i could make out from this stuff 
Bro024.B.dialogueact502	1435.6	1436.07	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah i think but disappointing 
Bro024.G.dialogueact503	1436.17	1440.75	G	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	yeah i think but disappointing to see is that there is a big difference between the training modes 
Bro024.B.dialogueact505	1441.51	1441.77	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	or if you 
Bro024.G.dialogueact504	1441.32	1441.52	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	or if you 
Bro024.G.dialogueact506	1441.76	1445.32	G	Professor	s	-1	0	or if you have clean training you've got to also a fifty percent improvement 
Bro024.B.dialogueact507	1443.48	1443.7	B	PhD	b	-1	0	you've got to also 
Bro024.G.dialogueact508	1446.19	1449.52	G	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah but if if my condition training and get the only fifty percent 
Bro024.B.dialogueact509	1448.33	1448.61	B	PhD	b	-1	0	fifty 
Bro024.B.dialogueact510	1449.73	1449.86	B	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah percent 
Bro024.E.dialogueact511	1449.91	1450.37	E	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah i mean percent 
Bro024.B.dialogueact513	1450.67	1455.89	B	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean that go into the knives or that sort of that it's very inconsistent across different knowledge condition so 
Bro024.G.dialogueact512	1450.28	1450.67	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	i mean 
Bro024.G.dialogueact514	1455.32	1455.68	G	Professor	b	-1	0	knowledge condition so 
Bro024.B.dialogueact515	1455.89	1459.13	B	PhD	s	-1	0	knowledge condition so i have like at forty five but in for on noise and then there's mine minus 
Bro024.B.dialogueact516	1459.13	1461.29	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and then there's mine minus five was for the bible under this 
Bro024.G.dialogueact517	1460.96	1461.29	G	Professor	b	-1	0	five was for the bible under this 
Bro024.B.dialogueact518	1461.71	1463.73	B	PhD	s	-1	0	under this study before the station 
Bro024.B.dialogueact519	1464.24	1467.6	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and so it's it's hard it's hard actually at a constant it's also 
Bro024.B.dialogueact520	1467.6	1467.93	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	it's also 
Bro024.B.dialogueact521	1468.71	1476.03	B	PhD	s	-1	0	though when the correlation between the speech that caught and do spot moment eased up station addity off the knowledge that is that in these conditions and the speech that uh and 
Bro024.G.dialogueact522	1475.92	1476.14	G	Professor	b	-1	0	and the speech that uh and 
Bro024.B.dialogueact523	1476.9	1477.51	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	and up 
Bro024.B.dialogueact524	1478.18	1478.46	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro024.B.dialogueact525	1479.46	1481.65	B	PhD	s	-1	0	it is like in the last stages like 
Bro024.B.dialogueact526	1481.65	1482.89	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	in the last stages like fuck they said i knew just 
Bro024.B.dialogueact527	1482.89	1488.79	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	fuck they said i knew just to they about it but i like it did expose them to be stuck identify posting on the gate it's 
Bro024.B.dialogueact528	1489.53	1489.94	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	and 
Bro024.B.dialogueact529	1490.51	1490.7	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bro024.B.dialogueact530	1490.7	1495.3	B	PhD	s	-1	0	uh the fifties expose and it's like about what do what the french was on pets but uh that 
Bro024.B.dialogueact531	1495.3	1497.07	B	PhD	s	-1	0	pets but uh that that person is they all 
Bro024.D.dialogueact532	1498.98	1500.27	D	Professor	s	-1	0	sort of but this 
Bro024.D.dialogueact533	1500.27	1500.53	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	but this 
Bro024.D.dialogueact534	1500.76	1501.01	D	Professor	%--	-1	0	but this and looking on the second page 
Bro024.D.dialogueact535	1501.01	1502.38	D	Professor	s	-1	0	um and looking on the second page 
Bro024.B.dialogueact536	1502.24	1502.69	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	um 
Bro024.B.dialogueact537	1503.0	1503.23	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yep and it's uh it's 
Bro024.D.dialogueact538	1503.2	1506.79	D	Professor	s	-1	0	yep and it's uh it's fifty percent 
Bro024.D.dialogueact539	1507.46	1509.2	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	looking in the lower right hand corner fifty percent 
Bro024.D.dialogueact540	1509.37	1512.06	D	Professor	s	-1	0	fifty percent relative performance it clean training 
Bro024.G.dialogueact541	1512.26	1513.32	G	Professor	s	-1	0	it clean training 
Bro024.D.dialogueact542	1514.38	1514.97	D	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	is that 
Bro024.G.dialogueact543	1514.45	1514.59	G	Professor	%	-1	0	is that 
Bro024.G.dialogueact544	1515.61	1516.51	G	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	said the fifty and if you if you look 
Bro024.D.dialogueact545	1516.61	1518.38	D	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	yeah said the fifty percent improvement you look 
Bro024.B.dialogueact546	1518.53	1518.69	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah 
Bro024.B.dialogueact548	1519.11	1522.64	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	that's fifteen training and the see testing for the the idea it's 
Bro024.G.dialogueact547	1518.75	1518.96	G	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah 
Bro024.D.dialogueact549	1523.71	1526.79	D	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	such improvement over the baseline no custom 
Bro024.B.dialogueact550	1525.75	1526.08	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	no custom 
Bro024.B.dialogueact551	1526.73	1526.95	B	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	custom 
Bro024.D.dialogueact552	1527.57	1532.03	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but the baseline mel cap strum and are those training doesn't do as well 
Bro024.D.dialogueact553	1533.33	1535.67	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i'm not trying to say whites it's eighty percent that's inaccuracy 
Bro024.D.dialogueact554	1535.74	1537.47	D	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	yeah yeah that's inaccuracy number i guess right 
Bro024.B.dialogueact555	1537.43	1538.4	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah yeah yeah i guess right so that's not 
Bro024.D.dialogueact556	1537.47	1537.93	D	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	yeah yeah i guess right 
Bro024.D.dialogueact557	1538.48	1540.46	D	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah no so that's not as good as the one up above 
Bro024.B.dialogueact558	1540.76	1540.94	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	no 
Bro024.D.dialogueact559	1541.74	1543.96	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but the fifties better than the one up above 
Bro024.B.dialogueact560	1544.0	1544.23	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	so i'm confused 
Bro024.D.dialogueact561	1544.1	1545.05	D	Professor	s	-1	0	uh actually the so i'm confused 
Bro024.B.dialogueact562	1545.31	1551.16	B	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	uh actually the nice colonization order uh you know put any plugs the u. s. for the high mismatch condition 
Bro024.B.dialogueact563	1551.78	1553.26	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	in the speech that car that i 
Bro024.B.dialogueact564	1553.89	1556.82	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	that car that i and and uh maintaining also accuses by this 
Bro024.B.dialogueact565	1556.82	1563.15	B	PhD	s	-1	0	also accuses by this stupid and is is that the the high me so much of a moment to cluttered jaime special moments in the speech since so since the high 
Bro024.F.dialogueact566	1562.8	1568.63	F	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	moments in the speech yeah yeah yeah so since so since the high mismatch performance is much worse to begin with it's easier to get a better relative improvement

Bro024.B.dialogueact715	1814.18	1814.49	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	that's it that's the 
Bro024.G.dialogueact716	1814.5	1824.04	G	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah so we that's it that's the uh fourties seven point one percent you know no it's already uh remarkable improvement in comparison to z. propose proposal 
Bro024.B.dialogueact717	1824.48	1824.66	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah so we 
Bro024.B.dialogueact718	1824.83	1827.75	B	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah so we have to walk before wasn't in the first couple propose yeah 
Bro024.G.dialogueact719	1827.12	1827.43	G	Professor	b	-1	0	couple propose yeah 
Bro024.B.dialogueact721	1827.91	1828.3	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	couple propose yeah they have 
Bro024.G.dialogueact720	1827.78	1828.06	G	Professor	b	-1	0	couple propose yeah they have 
Bro024.B.dialogueact722	1828.72	1829.58	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	they have the big and so 
Bro024.B.dialogueact723	1829.65	1833.52	B	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	the big and so that made him come in that regard wasn't all the high me so much cases because all 
Bro024.B.dialogueact724	1833.52	1836.29	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	cases because all those numbers and sixties and seventies because you know hiding 
Bro024.B.dialogueact725	1836.29	1838.3	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because you know hiding you know it's competitions so 
Bro024.G.dialogueact726	1836.39	1836.67	G	Professor	b	-1	0	because you know hiding 
Bro024.B.dialogueact727	1838.87	1840.97	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so that's the the biggest improvement came apart 
Bro024.B.dialogueact728	1841.02	1845.65	B	PhD	s	-1	0	much and uh but imagine them medium much and the idea it's also right now 
Bro024.B.dialogueact729	1846.75	1850.34	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so this is to deal for was an improvement over the whisper was 
Bro024.G.dialogueact730	1848.34	1848.5	G	Professor	b	-1	0	deal for was an improvement 
Bro024.G.dialogueact731	1850.5	1850.89	G	Professor	b	-1	0	was 
Bro024.D.dialogueact732	1851.27	1851.91	D	Professor	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	and so that's good 
Bro024.B.dialogueact733	1852.32	1852.61	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.B.dialogueact734	1853.1	1853.56	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.D.dialogueact735	1854.8	1857.68	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	if we can prove the noise estimation should get better yeah i i started thinking 
Bro024.G.dialogueact736	1857.13	1857.35	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	should get better yeah i i started thinking 
Bro024.G.dialogueact737	1857.35	1858.9	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	should get better yeah i i started thinking about those i mean 
Bro024.G.dialogueact738	1858.9	1867.02	G	Professor	s	-1	0	about those i mean you i just kind of it's the same problem and i started working on um i'm just i'll write to us almost two years ago that you have a problem with 
Bro024.G.dialogueact739	1867.02	1868.57	G	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	that you have a problem with this at at the 
Bro024.G.dialogueact740	1868.57	1872.05	G	Professor	s^df	-1	0	this at at the beginning we don't eat as much condition training of c. t. i. digits and 
Bro024.B.dialogueact741	1872.41	1872.63	B	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bro024.G.dialogueact742	1872.78	1874.66	G	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and uh i i felt the same problem just taking 
Bro024.G.dialogueact743	1874.66	1883.91	G	Professor	s^df	-1	0	same problem just taking um what do you use to use use i mean uh some type of texas affectionate you've got even worse results in the bases and 
Bro024.B.dialogueact744	1883.77	1884.01	B	PhD	b.%	-1	0	the bases and to 
Bro024.B.dialogueact746	1884.33	1884.71	B	PhD	b.%	-1	0	to 
Bro024.G.dialogueact745	1883.91	1884.51	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	the bases and to 
Bro024.B.dialogueact747	1884.71	1884.99	B	PhD	b.%	-1	0	to 
Bro024.G.dialogueact748	1885.52	1887.47	G	Professor	s	-1	0	i tried to find an explanation for it so 
Bro024.D.dialogueact750	1887.79	1888.04	D	Professor	b	-1	0	for it so 
Bro024.G.dialogueact749	1887.47	1887.88	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	for it so 
Bro024.B.dialogueact751	1890.4	1890.64	B	PhD	fg	-1	0	lou yes 
Bro024.B.dialogueact752	1890.93	1891.36	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	lou yes the i was 
Bro024.B.dialogueact753	1891.36	1894.81	B	PhD	s|qy^d^g	-1	0	the i was a it's the same experience of using this because the person or 
Bro024.G.dialogueact754	1892.98	1893.28	G	Professor	b	-1	0	a it's the same experience of using this because 
Bro024.E.dialogueact755	1895.03	1895.36	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.B.dialogueact756	1895.54	1895.74	B	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.B.dialogueact758	1896.63	1901.09	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so here yeah i mean i've flown that it's affecting the nicest i mean i could get any improvement so that's 
Bro024.E.dialogueact757	1896.17	1896.38	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	so here 
Bro024.B.dialogueact759	1901.27	1905.41	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so that's so it's something that i can actually pose you is the nicest to me 
Bro024.G.dialogueact760	1901.74	1902.16	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	so that's so it's something that i can 
Bro024.B.dialogueact761	1907.29	1907.75	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.G.dialogueact762	1909.95	1925.39	G	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	yeah i think what you do is in it when when you have that that is not condition training mode um then you have then you can train modal slows this beach for the what the center for the process where you really s. on information about the noises they don't 
Bro024.B.dialogueact763	1925.86	1926.12	B	PhD	b	-1	0	don't 
Bro024.G.dialogueact764	1927.26	1927.53	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	and 
Bro024.G.dialogueact765	1928.73	1930.0	G	Professor	s	-1	0	it us surprising at the beginning for 
Bro024.G.dialogueact766	1930.43	1934.38	G	Professor	s	-1	0	at the beginning for the surprising to me that you get rid of the best results in doing it this way i mean in comparison 
Bro024.G.dialogueact767	1934.38	1940.15	G	Professor	s^df	-1	0	way i mean in comparison to any time off training and clean date aren't any type of process thing like this 
Bro024.G.dialogueact768	1940.6	1941.12	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	like this so 
Bro024.G.dialogueact769	1941.92	1942.94	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro024.G.dialogueact770	1943.38	1948.06	G	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	it it seems to be the best what local what what they can do in the moment as much conditioned training and then when 
Bro024.G.dialogueact771	1948.72	1957.67	G	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	and then when we know stopped introducing some some noise reduction technique we we introduce also somehow artificial distortions 
Bro024.B.dialogueact772	1958.41	1958.59	B	PhD	b	-1	0	and decide 
Bro024.G.dialogueact773	1958.66	1965.05	G	Professor	s	+1	1	and decide decision distortions and i have fittings is they are the reason why i guess the problems in as much petition training means 
Bro024.G.dialogueact774	1965.79	1969.36	G	Professor	s	+1	1	means age immensely trains they uh they uh based on goshen 
Bro024.B.dialogueact775	1970.16	1970.35	B	PhD	b	-1	0	i'm wondering 
Bro024.G.dialogueact776	1970.52	1971.57	G	Professor	s^e	-1	0	i'm wondering auctions 
Bro024.G.dialogueact777	1972.11	1972.92	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and if he 
Bro024.G.dialogueact778	1973.22	1974.35	G	Professor	qy^t3	-1	0	came over to the questions 
Bro024.G.dialogueact779	1974.35	1974.51	G	Professor	s^bk^t3	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.G.dialogueact780	1980.06	1984.28	G	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	and usually introduce noticed this cycle subjectional we know drink stuff so 
Bro024.G.dialogueact781	1984.8	1987.17	G	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	so usually what you have is maybe um i'm i'm 
Bro024.G.dialogueact782	1987.53	1989.95	G	Professor	s	-1	0	i'm i'm showing no an envelope 
Bro024.G.dialogueact783	1991.13	1991.56	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	um maybe 
Bro024.G.dialogueact784	1991.91	1993.31	G	Professor	s^am	-1	0	um maybe you for this time so 
Bro024.G.dialogueact785	1993.95	1999.08	G	Professor	s	-1	0	so usually last maybe clean condition you know something which looks like this and if it just noisy it's 
Bro024.G.dialogueact786	1999.08	2001.38	G	Professor	s	-1	0	and if it just noisy it's so they're here 
Bro024.G.dialogueact787	2004.55	2007.49	G	Professor	s	-1	0	and then you tried to subtract a dog we have such oh whatever and what 
Bro024.G.dialogueact788	2007.84	2013.67	G	Professor	s	-1	0	whatever and what you get is your phone is just problems that you have to see these these it was in there 
Bro024.B.dialogueact789	2012.8	2013.07	B	PhD	b	-1	0	in there 
Bro024.G.dialogueact790	2014.04	2016.3	G	Professor	s	-1	0	just to do something if you get this negative decisions i mean just you know 
Bro024.G.dialogueact791	2016.3	2020.69	G	Professor	s	+1	1	i mean just you know the a teammate and you somehow subtract it onto what a 
Bro024.G.dialogueact792	2021.41	2022.14	G	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	uh and then you have insane 
Bro024.G.dialogueact793	2022.69	2028.02	G	Professor	s	+1	1	have insane i think what you do is you introduce some some i'd if he shows distribution in this um 
Bro024.G.dialogueact794	2028.77	2029.18	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	um and 
Bro024.G.dialogueact795	2029.59	2030.72	G	Professor	s^e	+1	1	and in someone else i mean if 
Bro024.G.dialogueact796	2030.72	2032.75	G	Professor	s	-1	0	in someone else i mean if you you're of thought that is the way 
Bro024.G.dialogueact797	2033.12	2038.36	G	Professor	s	-1	0	but uh it some of there is uh that that is no longer uh goshen distribution it to some all 
Bro024.G.dialogueact798	2038.36	2042.65	G	Professor	s	-1	0	it to some all the strange distribution betray introduced this this decision distortions 
Bro024.G.dialogueact799	2043.27	2051.32	G	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah that's true and and i was thinking that that might be the reason why you get this problems in the especially the much the condition training mode 
Bro024.B.dialogueact801	2050.01	2050.63	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah training 
Bro024.D.dialogueact800	2050.0	2050.35	D	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah training 
Bro024.B.dialogueact802	2052.23	2052.44	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah the the 
Bro024.B.dialogueact803	2052.5	2057.92	B	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah the the is on our complex enough to absorb that additionally anybody i didn't do doing 
Bro024.G.dialogueact804	2052.95	2053.2	G	Professor	%	-1	0	yeah the the is on our complex 
Bro024.F.dialogueact805	2056.17	2056.65	F	PhD	s^ft^t3	-1	0	anybody 
Bro024.G.dialogueact806	2057.18	2057.38	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	i didn't do doing 
Bro024.G.dialogueact807	2058.16	2058.48	G	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.B.dialogueact808	2059.3	2060.21	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.B.dialogueact809	2061.16	2061.33	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah so i also deceiving 
Bro024.B.dialogueact810	2061.33	2061.62	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah so i also deceiving 
Bro024.E.dialogueact811	2061.44	2071.23	E	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah so i also deceiving that's um the reason you wages and work is yeah that the mothers are much that's um that's complex you know if because i 
Bro024.E.dialogueact812	2071.65	2076.13	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	if because i i kitty o.'s always had a good experience expect worship action just 
Bro024.E.dialogueact813	2076.7	2087.44	E	PhD	s^e	-1	0	just the straight six inspection i greet when i was using your on that works big new run it's works which maybe i'm more able to muddle strange distribution 
Bro024.E.dialogueact815	2087.44	2087.58	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.G.dialogueact814	2087.25	2087.54	G	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.E.dialogueact816	2088.81	2089.03	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	but yeah 
Bro024.E.dialogueact817	2089.72	2089.92	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah 
Bro024.E.dialogueact818	2091.1	2095.74	E	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	and i tried the same exact it seems the construction i greet mondays or uh tasks and 
Bro024.E.dialogueact819	2095.8	2097.84	E	PhD	s	-1	0	uh tasks and you simply doesn't work 
Bro024.E.dialogueact821	2098.6	2101.41	E	PhD	s	-1	0	it's even it uh arts even so 
Bro024.G.dialogueact820	2098.54	2098.94	G	Professor	b	-1	0	it's even 
Bro024.E.dialogueact822	2101.41	2101.75	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	even so 
Bro024.D.dialogueact823	2102.13	2108.94	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	we probably should at some point here try the tandem that that that system to kind of stuff with this with this was attraction for that reason because 
Bro024.G.dialogueact824	2102.25	2102.59	G	Professor	b	-1	0	we probably should at some point 
Bro024.D.dialogueact826	2108.94	2114.3	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	for that reason because again i should do a transformation to them anymore maybe looks more gushing 
Bro024.G.dialogueact825	2108.91	2109.23	G	Professor	b	-1	0	for that reason because again i should 
Bro024.E.dialogueact827	2115.07	2115.51	E	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bro024.G.dialogueact828	2115.07	2115.27	G	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bro024.G.dialogueact829	2116.03	2116.37	G	Professor	fg	-1	0	i i was going 
Bro024.G.dialogueact830	2116.37	2117.74	G	Professor	%--	-1	0	i i was going well just 
Bro024.G.dialogueact831	2117.74	2125.9	G	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	well just yesterday when i was thinking about it um what the could they could just trying to do uh do about it i mean 
Bro024.G.dialogueact832	2125.9	2146.74	G	Professor	s	-1	0	do about it i mean if you if you get this just this situation that you get this this negative facing he was sympathetic to zero of two a concern or whatever if we if we with you was there that somehow um random generate a which which has a sudden distribution a notice sudden yeah especially distribution we should say we we have to think about it 
Bro024.B.dialogueact833	2130.757	2131.253	B	PhD	%	-1	0	he was sympathetic to zero 
Bro024.B.dialogueact834	2132.79	2133.12	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	of two a concern or whatever 
Bro024.G.dialogueact835	2147.23	2153.3	G	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and that the so introduce again some metro behavior in this project three 
Bro024.D.dialogueact836	2151.99	2152.68	D	Professor	b	-1	0	in this project 
Bro024.B.dialogueact837	2153.97	2154.21	B	PhD	b	-1	0	very different from three 
Bro024.B.dialogueact838	2154.35	2155.47	B	PhD	s	-1	0	very different from speech 
Bro024.B.dialogueact839	2156.36	2158.87	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	too and shouldn't confuse the yeah i mean 
Bro024.G.dialogueact840	2158.53	2164.7	G	Professor	s^bk|s	-1	0	the okay yeah i mean similar to what what you see really uh in in the real um my situation 
Bro024.B.dialogueact841	2160.88	2161.21	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay see really uh in in the real 
Bro024.B.dialogueact842	2165.93	2166.28	B	PhD	b	-1	0	or it 
Bro024.G.dialogueact843	2166.45	2168.46	G	Professor	s^e	-1	0	or it indicate situation but but somehow 
Bro024.G.dialogueact844	2168.46	2171.13	G	Professor	s^df	-1	0	there's but but somehow unnatural distribution 
Bro024.D.dialogueact845	2171.91	2174.76	D	Professor	qy^bu	-1	0	there's that's again sort of the idea of the additives thing is to 
Bro024.D.dialogueact846	2174.76	2177.46	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	thing is to is we had in the j. so yeah basically 
Bro024.D.dialogueact847	2177.62	2186.65	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	so yeah basically if if you're random date uh um in in uh time to maine then they look at this spectrum it's going to be thirty five 
Bro024.D.dialogueact849	2188.27	2189.19	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	and then 
Bro024.G.dialogueact848	2188.12	2188.5	G	Professor	b	-1	0	and then 
Bro024.D.dialogueact850	2191.63	2191.91	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.D.dialogueact851	2194.92	2198.7	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so just that something everywhere rather than just enough places 
Bro024.D.dialogueact852	2198.78	2200.59	D	Professor	s|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	places constant 
Bro024.E.dialogueact853	2198.81	2199.35	E	PhD	b	-1	0	places constant 
Bro024.G.dialogueact854	2199.56	2199.84	G	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	constant

Bro024.D.dialogueact882	2240.87	2242.75	D	Professor	s^cs^j	-1	0	i think it's noisy people should speak up

Bro024.B.dialogueact885	2250.4	2250.86	B	PhD	%	-1	0	if you look 
Bro024.E.dialogueact886	2250.66	2256.05	E	PhD	s	-1	0	if you look at the front they can propose and they use some kind of noise edition they have a random 
Bro024.E.dialogueact887	2256.4	2258.27	E	PhD	s|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	they have a random number generate right 
Bro024.E.dialogueact888	2259.12	2265.51	E	PhD	s|qy^d^g	-1	0	c. seafood or and so and and they had no he's and uh trajectory of so they're like energy on mean right 
Bro024.D.dialogueact889	2261.37	2261.81	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	and 
Bro024.B.dialogueact891	2262.97	2263.09	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	uh trajectory of so 
Bro024.D.dialogueact890	2262.94	2262.97	D	Professor	b	-1	0	uh trajectory 
Bro024.B.dialogueact892	2264.19	2266.66	B	PhD	s^na	-1	0	c. seafood or and so and was yeah they're like energy on mean right 
Bro024.B.dialogueact894	2266.66	2267.02	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	was yeah um 
Bro024.E.dialogueact893	2266.36	2266.53	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	was yeah 
Bro024.E.dialogueact895	2267.9	2268.84	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro024.E.dialogueact896	2270.2	2272.57	E	PhD	s^no	-1	0	but i don't know much effected this and 
Bro024.E.dialogueact897	2272.57	2274.18	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and they do it 
Bro024.B.dialogueact898	2273.64	2273.96	B	PhD	qy^d	-1	0	they do 
Bro024.E.dialogueact899	2274.18	2274.32	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	it 
Bro024.B.dialogueact901	2274.95	2275.27	B	PhD	b	-1	0	it so it's 
Bro024.G.dialogueact900	2274.53	2274.77	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	it 
Bro024.D.dialogueact902	2275.05	2275.27	D	Professor	b	-1	0	so it's 
Bro024.G.dialogueact903	2275.31	2277.72	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so it's it's almost another to it 
Bro024.E.dialogueact904	2278.7	2280.99	E	PhD	s^df^na^rt	-1	0	i think because they have to like energy 
Bro024.E.dialogueact905	2281.26	2281.42	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and then just 
Bro024.E.dialogueact906	2281.42	2283.74	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	and then just generate random number they have 
Bro024.E.dialogueact907	2283.74	2286.17	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	number they have some kind of mean in koreans and they 
Bro024.E.dialogueact908	2286.77	2291.73	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	and they add this number two that they're going to jason 
Bro024.E.dialogueact909	2292.23	2292.61	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah 
Bro024.B.dialogueact911	2292.84	2293.05	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah the the all going to do 
Bro024.B.dialogueact912	2293.05	2295.83	B	PhD	s	-1	0	the the all going to do the if the team cleaning up so 
Bro024.D.dialogueact910	2292.74	2293.76	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	yeah the the all going to do 
Bro024.B.dialogueact914	2295.99	2297.99	B	PhD	s	-1	0	cleaning up so that i'm kind of nice to it 
Bro024.E.dialogueact913	2295.89	2296.3	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	cleaning up so that i'm 
Bro024.D.dialogueact915	2298.65	2302.04	D	Professor	qr^d	-1	0	no well needed at all in english to the just the energy or to them another to the mail filter only yeah 
Bro024.B.dialogueact916	2301.6	2301.77	B	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	no well mail filter 
Bro024.B.dialogueact917	2301.77	2303.2	B	PhD	s	-1	0	no well needed at all in english mail filter only yeah 
Bro024.E.dialogueact918	2302.58	2302.94	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	needed at all in english only yeah 
Bro024.E.dialogueact919	2302.94	2303.19	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	needed at all in english only yeah

Bro024.G.dialogueact921	2303.84	2304.12	G	Professor	b	-1	0	so because 
Bro024.D.dialogueact922	2304.73	2308.31	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	so because i mean i think this is most interesting for the no filters 
Bro024.D.dialogueact924	2309.28	2309.59	D	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.G.dialogueact923	2308.98	2309.27	G	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.D.dialogueact925	2309.76	2311.33	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	our fifties the other 
Bro024.D.dialogueact926	2311.33	2311.82	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	the other 
Bro024.G.dialogueact927	2315.7	2319.62	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but they do not apply filtering also kind of g. what 
Bro024.B.dialogueact928	2321.2	2322.6	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	like uh like like the second 
Bro024.G.dialogueact929	2322.31	2323.95	G	Professor	s^e	-1	0	like like the second protection or 
Bro024.G.dialogueact930	2323.95	2324.11	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	no that's the protection or 
Bro024.B.dialogueact931	2324.55	2326.09	B	PhD	s^ar|s	-1	0	no that's the reason that i'm doing 
Bro024.B.dialogueact933	2327.51	2330.0	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so they did figure the time signet and then yeah i 
Bro024.G.dialogueact932	2327.43	2327.64	G	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	so they yeah i 
Bro024.G.dialogueact934	2327.84	2328.12	G	Professor	%-	-1	0	so they did figure the time yeah i 
Bro024.B.dialogueact935	2330.0	2332.5	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and then florida and then they catch it from just looking at you know 
Bro024.G.dialogueact936	2331.17	2332.99	G	Professor	s	-1	0	florida and then they catch it from just looking at you know 
Bro024.B.dialogueact938	2333.14	2333.36	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah and then after that 
Bro024.B.dialogueact939	2333.48	2337.16	B	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah and then after that it's it's almost the same as the baseline system and 
Bro024.G.dialogueact937	2332.99	2333.11	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah and then after that from just looking at you know 
Bro024.G.dialogueact940	2337.45	2337.6	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	and 
Bro024.B.dialogueact941	2338.04	2343.42	B	PhD	s	-1	0	then the final all going to do that it had to get that that that that dad some random noise yeah but again 
Bro024.D.dialogueact942	2343.53	2347.92	D	Professor	s^bk|s^ng	-1	0	noise it's it's on the matter you know it's on the message yeah but again it's just like energy as opposed to filter back energy yeah 
Bro024.B.dialogueact943	2345.99	2346.28	B	PhD	b	-1	0	it's it's on the matter opposed to filter 
Bro024.B.dialogueact945	2346.37	2347.4	B	PhD	s	-1	0	it's it's on the matter you know it's on the message filter back energy yeah 
Bro024.G.dialogueact944	2346.27	2346.64	G	Professor	b	-1	0	it's it's on the matter filter 
Bro024.B.dialogueact946	2347.4	2349.09	B	PhD	s	-1	0	you know it's on the message about back energy yeah 
Bro024.D.dialogueact947	2347.92	2348.13	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	you know it's on the message about back energy yeah

Bro024.D.dialogueact1004	2453.69	2454.27	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	this is so so it's 
Bro024.D.dialogueact1005	2454.27	2464.45	D	Professor	fg|s	+1	1	so so basically our our position is that um we shouldn't be on duly can straining the latency at this point because we're 
Bro024.D.dialogueact1006	2464.54	2469.32	D	Professor	s^df	+1	1	point because we're all still experimenting was trying to make the performance better in the presence noise uh 
Bro024.D.dialogueact1007	2469.95	2480.57	D	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	uh there's a minority in that group who is arguing or arguing for uh having a further can straining of the latency so 
Bro024.D.dialogueact1008	2481.03	2490.41	D	Professor	fh|s^df	+1	1	weird stirs continuing to keep aware of what the trade offs are and you know what what do we gain from having longer or shorter latency is but 
Bro024.G.dialogueact1009	2486.25	2486.45	G	Professor	b	-1	0	know what what 
Bro024.D.dialogueact1010	2490.41	2499.7	D	Professor	s	-1	0	is but since we always seem to at least get something out of longer latency is not being so constrained we're tending to go with that if we're not told we can't do it where 
Bro024.F.dialogueact1012	2500.1	2504.88	F	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	where was the um the smallest latency of all the systems last time 
Bro024.G.dialogueact1011	2500.09	2500.66	G	Professor	b	-1	0	where was the 
Bro024.B.dialogueact1013	2505.53	2506.85	B	PhD	s	-1	0	was a frenchman well it's 
Bro024.D.dialogueact1014	2506.7	2509.65	D	Professor	s	+1	1	frenchman well it's telecom was was was very short latency and they had what 
Bro024.G.dialogueact1015	2507.9	2508.25	G	Professor	%	-1	0	telecom was was was very short 
Bro024.D.dialogueact1016	2509.65	2510.81	D	Professor	s	-1	0	latency and they had a very good reason is what what was it 
Bro024.F.dialogueact1017	2510.0	2510.7	F	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	a very good reason is what was it 
Bro024.D.dialogueact1018	2510.81	2511.85	D	Professor	s	-1	0	a very good reason is thirty five what was it spend in order 
Bro024.G.dialogueact1019	2511.13	2513.36	G	Professor	s	+1	1	thirty five thirteen spend in order of sucking the second so

Bro024.B.dialogueact1075	2580.18	2581.52	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	with it i know they changed it 
Bro024.B.dialogueact1076	2582.16	2582.87	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	the compression they

Bro024.E.dialogueact1354	3135.08	3135.82	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so we might yeah 
Bro024.B.dialogueact1356	3136.3	3137.8	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	into realignment it's 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1355	3135.82	3136.01	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	into so we might yeah 
Bro024.B.dialogueact1357	3137.8	3138.21	B	PhD	s	-1	0	realignment it's true these went to retrain 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1358	3138.0	3140.95	E	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	true these went to retrain um these indictments which 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1359	3140.95	3143.8	E	PhD	s^e	-1	0	these indictments which should be better because they come from okay yeah that 
Bro024.G.dialogueact1360	3143.46	3143.65	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah that 
Bro024.G.dialogueact1361	3143.65	3144.69	G	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah that was my idea i mean 
Bro024.G.dialogueact1362	3144.69	3148.31	G	Professor	s^df	-1	0	yeah plus was my idea i mean if if it if it's not the same neighboring which stigmas basis 
Bro024.B.dialogueact1363	3145.43	3145.68	B	PhD	b	-1	0	if if it if 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1364	3145.79	3145.99	E	PhD	b	-1	0	if if it if 
Bro024.B.dialogueact1365	3148.37	3149.05	B	PhD	s^am	-1	0	yeah plus

Bro024.B.dialogueact1368	3150.25	3150.65	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i mean this is the system 
Bro024.B.dialogueact1370	3150.65	3151.5	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i mean this is the system so the 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1369	3150.34	3150.58	E	PhD	b	-1	0	i mean this is the system 
Bro024.B.dialogueact1371	3151.5	3155.73	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so the eighty was spain or maybe different if it was advertised times it on channel on it 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1372	3154.9	3155.29	E	PhD	b	-1	0	it was advertised times it on channel on it 
Bro024.B.dialogueact1373	3155.73	3155.87	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	on channel on it 
Bro024.G.dialogueact1374	3155.98	3156.23	G	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	on channel on it was 
Bro024.B.dialogueact1376	3156.94	3161.86	B	PhD	s	-1	0	was the alignments but different certainly different to go there independent anything 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1375	3156.59	3156.92	E	PhD	b	-1	0	was 
Bro024.B.dialogueact1377	3162.07	3164.34	B	PhD	s	-1	0	we didn't copy that towns it on minister china one 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1378	3164.44	3164.74	E	PhD	b	-1	0	one 
Bro024.G.dialogueact1379	3164.57	3164.68	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	one

Bro024.E.dialogueact1381	3167.16	3167.52	E	PhD	b	-1	0	but 
Bro024.B.dialogueact1382	3167.85	3172.4	B	PhD	s^bu|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	but with the new i mean what you generated it just copy the times that are town on right yeah right 
Bro024.B.dialogueact1385	3172.76	3172.94	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	on right yeah right 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1383	3172.34	3172.59	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	on right yeah right 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1384	3172.74	3172.84	E	PhD	b.%	-1	0	on right yeah right 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1386	3175.66	3176.23	E	PhD	fg	-1	0	um and 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1387	3176.78	3177.18	E	PhD	fg	-1	0	and 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1388	3178.18	3183.85	E	PhD	s	-1	0	actually when we look at and uh e. d. for some restaurants around it's almost perfect i mean 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1389	3183.85	3186.48	E	PhD	s^e	-1	0	perfect i mean just coupling framing 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1390	3187.9	3189.19	E	PhD	s^e	-1	0	the first frame of speech are there 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1391	3189.19	3189.33	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	are there 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1392	3189.8	3195.56	E	PhD	s	-1	0	are there are some it this where it's almost one person beauty performance 
Bro024.G.dialogueact1393	3194.05	3194.76	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	beauty performance 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1394	3196.22	3196.92	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh but 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1395	3196.92	3197.58	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh but 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1396	3201.84	3202.41	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	mm 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1397	3203.75	3203.91	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yep 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1398	3204.55	3210.89	E	PhD	s^rt^tc	-1	0	so um the next thing is had the spreadsheets for three different system 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1399	3211.36	3217.02	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but for these you only have to look rhino on the speech that car from performance 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1400	3218.49	3219.85	E	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	uh because they didn't test so 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1401	3219.85	3223.44	E	PhD	fh|s^df	-1	0	they didn't test so i can attest just construction m. k. g. you can't 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1402	3224.56	3226.33	E	PhD	fh|s^rt	-1	0	uh so you have three she cheats one he's 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1403	3226.42	3229.82	E	PhD	s^e	-1	0	one he's the um propose i want system 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1404	3230.19	3232.16	E	PhD	s	-1	0	activates the t. v. with and once the system that 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1405	3232.16	3234.91	E	PhD	s	-1	0	once the system that so i mean i just described 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1406	3236.28	3237.31	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	um but we 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1407	3237.43	3244.2	E	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	but we uh we wiener figuring from um friends say come included 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1408	3246.64	3256.94	E	PhD	s	-1	0	um so did you get sick fifty seven point seven percent it's uh her introduction on the speech that car they 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1409	3259.38	3259.84	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1410	3260.42	3264.27	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and then they've two sheets where it's for uh c-span where 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1411	3265.14	3265.82	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh so it's 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1412	3265.82	3267.16	E	PhD	s	-1	0	uh so it's again the same system but 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1413	3267.16	3270.32	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but in this case we have spectra subtraction 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1414	3271.21	3273.8	E	PhD	s^e	-1	0	we a maximum over commission sector of two point five 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1415	3274.65	3280.43	E	PhD	s	-1	0	uh there's smoking if the game trajectory we some kind of uh the procedure 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1416	3281.17	3283.49	E	PhD	s^e^rt	-1	0	which has fourteen many seconds vacancy 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1417	3284.96	3291.54	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and then after subtraction um i had a constants to that energies 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1418	3292.13	3300.63	E	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	and i have two cases where uh the first case where the cost of these twenty five d. b. b. d. o. demean speech energy and the other 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1419	3300.72	3302.31	E	PhD	s	-1	0	energy and the other i start to d. you 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1420	3303.34	3304.07	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.E.dialogueact1421	3305.14	3311.35	E	PhD	s	-1	0	forties through see stan we have like fifty five punk uh five percent improvement 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1422	3312.2	3314.65	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and fifty eight point one 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1423	3316.21	3319.1	E	PhD	s	-1	0	so again it's around fifty six fifty seven 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1424	3320.36	3320.69	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro024.D.dialogueact1425	3324.29	3328.03	D	Professor	s	-1	0	because i know it's the t. i. digits numbers exactly the same but it's nice to yeah because i 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1426	3328.54	3329.56	E	PhD	s^aa|s^df.%--	-1	0	yeah because i didn't for 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1427	3329.93	3337.34	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	didn't for the for us to come inspect inspection including uh oh system that did it just number uh the right one but not 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1428	3337.34	3339.49	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	one but not forty other assistant because i didn't 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1429	3339.49	3345.33	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	assistant because i didn't that didn't get the system including respect reflection um the cat did you take 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1430	3346.17	3348.08	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	uh so so that means i just i stated on speech the car uhhuh so so so 
Bro024.D.dialogueact1432	3347.94	3348.22	D	Professor	s^bk^fe	-1	0	uh so so that means on speech the car uhhuh so so so

Bro024.G.dialogueact1467	3412.06	3413.54	G	Professor	s	-1	0	it's not it's it's i i think what you do is is it when when 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1469	3412.57	3413.46	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	it's not it's it's i i think what you do is is it when when 
Bro024.G.dialogueact1470	3413.54	3422.66	G	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	it's do is is it when when you have this i subtract it it i mean can you get something with this uh they said because i just to zero and then 
Bro024.G.dialogueact1471	3422.66	3425.95	G	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	i just to zero and then you simply acting it it just and again 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1472	3425.71	3425.78	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	it just and again 
Bro024.G.dialogueact1473	3426.72	3427.88	G	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so you just it somehow just 
Bro024.G.dialogueact1474	3427.88	3429.64	G	Professor	s	-1	0	right just it somehow just this little curve shifted again 
Bro024.D.dialogueact1476	3430.23	3433.71	D	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	but you did you do that before the threshold thing too zero or 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1475	3429.79	3429.98	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right again 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1477	3430.67	3431.02	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	but you did you do that before the threshold 
Bro024.D.dialogueact1478	3433.77	3433.98	D	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	zero or 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1479	3434.18	3436.1	E	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	oh so you really but it's after the crucial think so maybe 
Bro024.G.dialogueact1480	3434.23	3434.73	G	Professor	%	-1	0	but it's after 
Bro024.D.dialogueact1482	3436.51	3436.64	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	oh so you really so maybe 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1481	3436.1	3436.4	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	oh so you really so maybe 
Bro024.D.dialogueact1483	3436.64	3438.41	D	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	oh so you really want to do it before right so maybe maybe 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1484	3437.02	3437.41	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	want to do it before 
Bro024.D.dialogueact1485	3438.62	3439.04	D	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right maybe i might do it before 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1486	3438.97	3440.22	E	PhD	s^am	-1	0	right yeah because then maybe i might do it before you 
Bro024.D.dialogueact1488	3440.45	3440.6	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah because then you 
Bro024.D.dialogueact1489	3440.6	3442.93	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	yeah because then they then you would have less of that phenomenon you 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1487	3440.44	3440.62	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah because then you

Bro024.E.dialogueact1538	3527.87	3536.87	E	PhD	s	-1	0	it gets worse assign it seems that right no this this is a constant that does not depend on um on anything that you can learn from the parents it's 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1539	3536.87	3539.06	E	PhD	s^e	-1	0	from the parents it's just constant nice addition

Bro024.D.dialogueact1546	3547.55	3548.85	D	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	you think it does depend on the other and so i 
Bro024.D.dialogueact1547	3548.85	3553.83	D	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	depend on the other and so i thought you were adding amount that was twenty five d. p. down from the signal energy yeah so

Bro024.E.dialogueact1549	3553.83	3558.73	E	PhD	s^df^rt	-1	0	signal energy yeah so the way they did it i just measured their average speech energy of the old italian data 
Bro024.D.dialogueact1550	3559.24	3559.83	D	Professor	s^bk^fe	-1	0	oh and then

Bro024.E.dialogueact1562	3585.58	3591.55	E	PhD	s	-1	0	good but for finish you have a degradation already when you go from thirty five to thirty and then from

Bro024.E.dialogueact1564	3594.84	3602.72	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	at deceiving that's maybe it's because just finish finishes i mean energy that's lower than than the other database 
Bro024.E.dialogueact1565	3603.23	3605.52	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and you'd reduce the threshold should be
