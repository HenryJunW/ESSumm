The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group discussed efforts to train and test the Aurora group's HTK-based recognition system on ICSI's digits corpus.
Members also discussed efforts to produce forced alignments from a selection of Meeting Recorder data.
Performance in both tasks was adversely affected by the manner of recording conditions implemented and difficulties attributing utterances to the appropriate speakers.
While debugging efforts resulted in improved forced alignments , dealing with mixed channel speech and speaker overlap remains a key objective for future work.
The group is additionally focused on a continued ability to feed different features into the recognizer and then train the system accordingly.
