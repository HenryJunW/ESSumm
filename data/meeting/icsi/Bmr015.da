Bmr015.B.dialogueact43	46.197	46.767	B	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I have no idea
Bmr015.B.dialogueact44	46.767	48.147	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	but I just got it a few minutes ago .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact45	46.915	47.075	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact47	48.458	49.898	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	Right when you were in my office it arrived .

Bmr015.B.dialogueact50	55.724	58.164	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I actually have one more also which is to talk about the digits .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact51	58.642	63.472	A	Professor	h|s^na	+1	1	Uh , right , so {disfmarker} so I {disfmarker} I was just gonna talk briefly about the NSF ITR .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact52	59.186	59.796	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact53	63.982	64.392	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Oh , great .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact54	64.61	65.29	A	Professor	h	-1	0	Uh ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact55	66.064	66.894	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and then , you have {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact56	66.128	66.358	F	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	Can w
Bmr015.A.dialogueact57	67.074	67.874	A	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	I mean , I won't say much ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact58	67.874	70.513	A	Professor	qy^bu^d	-1	0	but {disfmarker} {comment} uh , but then , uh , you said {disfmarker} wanna talk about digits ?
Bmr015.B.dialogueact59	70.761	72.121	B	Grad	s^na	+1	1	I have a short thing about digits
Bmr015.B.dialogueact60	72.121	74.731	B	Grad	s	+1	2	and then uh I wanna talk a little bit about naming conventions ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact61	74.731	77.531	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	although it 's unclear whether this is the right place to talk about it .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact62	78.43	80.34	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	So maybe just talk about it very briefly
Bmr015.B.dialogueact63	80.34	83.18	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and take the details to the people who {disfmarker} for whom it 's relevant .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact64	83.487	83.697	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact65	84.219	84.349	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact66	85.013	86.873	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	I could always say something about transcription .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact67	86.933	88.703	F	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	I 've been {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} uh , well {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact68	88.611	91.565	A	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	Well if we {disfmarker} Yeah , we shouldn't add things in just to add things in .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact69	91.565	92.855	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	I 'm actually pretty busy today ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact70	91.909	92.189	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact71	92.855	94.07	A	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	so if we can {disfmarker} {comment} {vocalsound} we {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact72	93.503	93.953	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact73	94.07	94.99	A	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	a short meeting would be fine .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact74	94.231	95.661	F	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	This does sound like we 're doing fine ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact75	95.661	95.781	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact76	96.031	96.981	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	That won't do .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact77	97.06	101.65	B	Grad	s^t^tc	+1	2	So the only thing I wanna say about digits is , we are pretty much done with the first test set .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact78	101.65	106.902	B	Grad	s	-1	0	There are probably forms here and there that are marked as having been read that weren't really read .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact79	106.962	110.272	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So I won't really know until I go through all the transcriber forms
Bmr015.B.dialogueact80	110.272	112.202	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and extract out pieces that are in error .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact81	112.728	114.148	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So I wa Uh . Two things .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact82	114.148	117.282	B	Grad	qw	+1	0	The first is what should we do about digits that were misread ?
Bmr015.B.dialogueact83	118.211	122.481	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	My opinion is , um , we should just throw them out completely ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact84	123.012	124.952	B	Grad	s^cs^e	-1	0	and have them read again by someone else .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact85	125.412	126.952	B	Grad	s	-1	0	You know , the grouping is completely random ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact86	125.496	125.866	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact87	126.952	130.062	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so it {disfmarker} it 's perfectly fine to put a {disfmarker} a group together again
Bmr015.B.dialogueact88	130.426	130.906	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	of errors
Bmr015.B.dialogueact89	130.906	131.816	B	Grad	s^cs.%--	-1	0	and have them re - read ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact90	132.139	133.469	B	Grad	s	-1	0	just to finish out the test set .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact91	134.442	136.252	F	Postdoc	s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Oh ! By {disfmarker} throw them out completely ?
Bmr015.B.dialogueact92	135.28	140.236	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	Um , the other thing you could do is change the transcript to match what they really said .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact93	141.381	142.981	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So those are {disfmarker} those are the two options .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact95	141.618	141.808	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact94	141.394	141.634	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact96	142.614	144.854	A	Professor	s	-1	0	But there 's often things where people do false starts .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact97	144.854	147.114	A	Professor	s^df.%-	-1	0	I know I 've done it , where I say {disfmarker} say a {disfmarker}
Bmr015.B.dialogueact98	146.703	153.412	B	Grad	s	+1	0	What the transcribers did with that is if they did a correction , and they eventually did read the right string , {comment} you extract the right string .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact99	152.995	155.565	G	PhD	s^bu	+1	0	Oh , you 're talking about where they completely read the wrong string and didn't correct it ?
Bmr015.E.dialogueact100	154.13	154.38	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact101	154.647	156.134	B	Grad	s^aa|s^e	-1	0	Yeah . And didn't notice .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact104	156.659	157.879	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	Which happens in a few places .
Bmr015.E.dialogueact103	156.226	156.436	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact102	156.135	156.565	G	PhD	s^bk^fe	-1	0	Ah .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact105	156.988	157.198	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact107	159.488	160.088	B	Grad	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact106	159.296	160.816	F	Postdoc	fg|s	-1	0	Well , and s and you 're talking string - wise ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact108	160.816	162.206	F	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	you 're not talking about the entire page ?
Bmr015.B.dialogueact110	162.309	162.739	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Correct .
Bmr015.E.dialogueact109	161.908	162.128	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact111	162.813	163.003	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	I get it .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact112	164.75	168.71	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	And so the {disfmarker} the two options are change the transcript to match what they really said ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact113	168.71	173.007	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	but then {disfmarker} but then the transcript isn't the Aurora test set anymore .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact114	173.514	174.724	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I don't think that really matters
Bmr015.B.dialogueact115	174.724	176.104	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because the conditions are so different .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact116	177.509	178.709	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	And that would be a little easier .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact117	178.525	180.445	G	PhD	qw	-1	0	Well how many are {disfmarker} how {disfmarker} how often does that happen ?
Bmr015.B.dialogueact118	180.68	181.77	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	Mmm , five or six times .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact119	182.252	183.632	G	PhD	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	Oh , so it 's not very much .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact120	183.37	184.26	B	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	No , it 's not much at all .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact121	184.809	186.409	G	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	Seems like we should just change the transcripts
Bmr015.E.dialogueact122	186.334	186.524	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact123	187.782	188.022	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact124	188.006	188.606	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	to match .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact125	189.076	191.806	A	Professor	fg|qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Yeah , it 's five or six times out of {pause} thousands ?
Bmr015.C.dialogueact126	189.474	189.644	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact127	191.57	192.2	B	Grad	s^bc	-1	0	Four thousand .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact129	192.299	192.999	A	Professor	qh^bk	-1	0	Four thousand ?
Bmr015.C.dialogueact128	192.18	193.37	C	PhD	s^bc	-1	0	Four thous Ah ! Four thousand .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact130	192.349	192.799	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr015.G.dialogueact131	192.799	193.139	G	PhD	%--	-1	0	it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact132	193.588	196.258	A	Professor	fg|s^cs	-1	0	Yeah , I would , uh , {vocalsound} tak do the easy way ,
Bmr015.G.dialogueact133	196.284	196.644	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact135	196.848	197.118	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact134	196.36	196.65	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact136	196.97	197.2	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact137	197.922	198.782	A	Professor	s^ba.%-	-1	0	It {disfmarker} it 's kinda nice {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact139	198.782	203.443	A	Professor	qh	-1	0	I mean , wh who knows what studies people will be doing on {disfmarker} on speaker - dependent things
Bmr015.C.dialogueact138	198.312	198.622	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact140	203.443	205.273	A	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	and so I think having {disfmarker} having it all {disfmarker}
Bmr015.C.dialogueact141	204.394	204.634	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact142	206.051	209.526	A	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	the speakers who we had is {disfmarker} is at least interesting .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact143	209.744	212.968	G	PhD	fg|qw	+1	1	So you {disfmarker} um , how many digits have been transcribed now ?
Bmr015.B.dialogueact144	213.247	214.217	B	Grad	s	+1	1	Four thousand lines .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact145	214.487	217.667	B	Grad	s	+1	1	And each line is between one and about ten digits .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact146	215.082	215.952	G	PhD	qh^bk^d	-1	0	Four thousand lines ?
Bmr015.B.dialogueact147	217.667	219.337	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I didn't {disfmarker} I didn't compute the average .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact148	219.337	220.847	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I think the average was around four or five .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact149	221.191	224.021	A	Professor	s	+1	0	So that 's a couple hours of {disfmarker} of , uh , speech , probably .

Bmr015.G.dialogueact155	227.234	227.644	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact156	229.432	234.172	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And , Jane , I do have a set of forms which I think you have copies of somewhere .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact157	234.165	234.985	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm . Yeah , true .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact158	234.881	235.401	B	Grad	s^bk|qy^bu^d	-1	0	Oh you do ?
Bmr015.B.dialogueact160	235.611	236.421	B	Grad	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	Oh OK , good , good .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact159	235.348	235.788	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact161	236.708	237.348	B	Grad	s^df.%--	-1	0	Yeah , I was just wond
Bmr015.B.dialogueact162	237.468	239.368	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I thought I had {disfmarker} had all of them back from you .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact164	239.778	245.371	B	Grad	s	+1	1	And then the other thing is that , uh , the forms in front of us here that we 're gonna read later , were suggested by Liz
Bmr015.F.dialogueact163	239.431	239.961	F	Postdoc	s^ar|s^na	-1	0	No , not yet .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact165	245.371	248.681	B	Grad	s^df	+1	1	because she wanted to elicit some different prosodics from digits .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact168	249.162	252.495	B	Grad	s^co	-1	0	And so , uh , I just wanted people to , take a quick look at the instructions
Bmr015.C.dialogueact166	249.008	249.342	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact167	249.048	249.298	C	PhD	b	-1	0	
Bmr015.E.dialogueact169	249.35	250.06	E	PhD	s.%	-1	0	Eight eight two two two nine .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact170	252.495	254.885	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and the way it wa worked and see if it makes sense
Bmr015.B.dialogueact171	254.885	256.665	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and if anyone has any comments on it .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact172	260.802	261.242	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact173	264.302	272.49	A	Professor	s^bu	+1	0	And the decision here , uh , was to continue with uh the words rather than the {disfmarker} the numerics .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact174	273.514	274.364	B	Grad	h|s^aa^rt	-1	0	Uh , yes ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact175	274.814	276.214	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	although we could switch it back .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact176	276.214	277.544	B	Grad	s	+1	0	The problem was O and zero .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact177	279.198	283.178	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	Although we could switch it back and tell them always to say " zero " or always to say " O " .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact178	279.225	279.415	F	Postdoc	s^bk.%	-1	0	Oh {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact179	283.234	284.144	A	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	Or neither .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact180	283.531	283.781	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact181	284.585	286.835	A	Professor	s^bu	+1	0	But it 's just two thing {disfmarker} ways that you can say it .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact182	286.352	286.742	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact183	287.5	287.85	A	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr015.B.dialogueact185	288.832	289.012	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Sure .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact184	288.797	289.377	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact187	289.512	292.132	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um {disfmarker} um ,
Bmr015.E.dialogueact186	289.391	289.611	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact188	292.132	293.182	A	Professor	s	-1	0	that 's the only thought I have
Bmr015.A.dialogueact189	293.182	295.642	A	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	because if you t start talking about these , you know u tr
Bmr015.A.dialogueact190	296.341	298.241	A	Professor	s	+1	0	She 's trying to get at natural groupings ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact192	298.752	303.218	A	Professor	s	+1	0	but it {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's nothing natural about reading numbers this way .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact191	298.712	298.982	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact193	303.388	306.318	A	Professor	s^df^e	-1	0	I mean if you saw a telephone number you would never see it this way .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact194	306.162	308.582	B	Grad	s	-1	0	The {disfmarker} the problem also is she did want to stick with digits .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact195	308.582	310.582	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	I mean I 'm speaking for her since she 's not here .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact196	309.919	310.169	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact197	311.018	317.84	B	Grad	s	+1	1	But , um , the other problem we were thinking about is if you just put the numerals , {comment} they might say forty - three instead of four three .
Bmr015.E.dialogueact198	314.992	315.182	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact199	315.22	315.76	G	PhD	s^bk^fe	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact200	315.736	316.036	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.E.dialogueact201	316.881	317.061	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact202	318.863	319.103	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact203	320.066	321.456	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	Well , if there 's space , though , between them .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact204	321.546	322.056	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , you can {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact205	322.176	325.158	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	With {disfmarker} when you space them out they don't look like , uh , forty - three anymore .
Bmr015.E.dialogueact206	324.388	324.538	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact207	325.635	327.235	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , she and I were talking about it ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact208	327.011	327.491	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact209	327.235	332.971	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and she felt that it 's very , very natural to do that sort of chunking .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact210	332.164	334.054	A	Professor	s^na|s^ba	-1	0	She 's right . It 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it 's a different problem .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact211	334.465	336.295	A	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} it 's an interesting problem {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact212	336.295	338.805	A	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , we 've done stuff with numbers before ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact213	338.805	339.915	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and yeah sometimes people {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact214	339.915	344.291	A	Professor	s	-1	0	If you say s " three nine eight one " sometimes people will say " thirty - nine eighty - one "
Bmr015.A.dialogueact215	344.291	346.231	A	Professor	s	-1	0	or " three hundred {disfmarker} three hundred eighty - nine one " ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact217	346.231	347.331	A	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	or {disfmarker} I don't think they 'd say that ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact216	345.819	345.969	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact218	347.371	347.501	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact220	347.691	347.961	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	but th
Bmr015.B.dialogueact219	347.447	348.257	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Not very frequently
Bmr015.A.dialogueact221	347.961	348.261	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	no {disfmarker}
Bmr015.B.dialogueact222	348.257	349.527	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	but , {vocalsound} they certainly could .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact223	348.795	349.025	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact224	349.482	349.922	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact225	350.578	353.734	A	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh , th thirty - eight ninety - one is probably how they 'd do it .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact226	353.473	356.123	B	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	So . I mean , this is something that Liz and I spoke about
Bmr015.A.dialogueact227	354.051	354.321	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact229	356.403	356.713	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact228	356.123	362.876	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	and , since this was something that Liz asked for specifically , I think we need to defer to her .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact230	361.038	361.538	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact231	361.814	362.024	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact232	363.295	365.505	A	Professor	s^bk|s	+1	0	OK . Well , we 're probably gonna be collecting meetings for a while
Bmr015.A.dialogueact233	365.505	369.715	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and if we decide we still wanna do some digits later we might be able to do some different ver different versions ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact234	368.492	369.272	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Do something different ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact236	369.715	371.265	A	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	but this is the next suggestion ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact235	369.272	369.502	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact237	371.265	371.415	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	so .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact238	372.566	372.816	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact239	378.573	383.873	A	Professor	fg|s^t^tc	+1	1	OK , so uh e l I guess , let me , uh , get my {disfmarker} my short thing out about the NSF .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact240	384.328	384.868	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I sent this {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact241	385.266	386.926	A	Professor	s	-1	0	actually this is maybe a little side thing .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact242	386.926	395.162	A	Professor	s	-1	0	Um , I {disfmarker} I sent to what I thought we had , uh , in some previous mail , as the right joint thing to send to ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact244	395.162	399.121	A	Professor	s	-1	0	which was " M {disfmarker} MTG RCDR hyphen joint " .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact243	395.07	395.54	B	Grad	s	-1	0	It was .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact245	397.269	397.559	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Joint .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact246	399.112	399.332	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact247	400.707	404.597	A	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	But then I got some sort of funny mail saying that the moderator was going to {disfmarker}
Bmr015.B.dialogueact248	402.469	402.919	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker}
Bmr015.B.dialogueact250	404.581	406.811	B	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's because they set the one up at UW {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact249	404.347	404.666	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	
Bmr015.B.dialogueact251	406.811	408.721	B	Grad	s	-1	0	that 's not on our side , that 's on the U - dub {comment} side .

Bmr015.B.dialogueact257	416.091	417.581	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	so you might just wanna mail to Mari
Bmr015.A.dialogueact258	417.703	422.243	A	Professor	s^ar|s^df	-1	0	No {disfmarker} no , th I got {disfmarker} I got , uh , little excited notes from Mari and Jeff and so on ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact259	418.005	418.265	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact261	422.243	422.673	A	Professor	%--	-1	0	so it 's {disfmarker}

Bmr015.B.dialogueact266	426.478	428.608	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Actually the same thing happened to me {disfmarker} I had sent one earlier .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact267	428.768	430.768	B	Grad	s:s	-1	0	The message says , " You 'll be informed "
Bmr015.B.dialogueact268	430.768	431.968	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and then I was never informed
Bmr015.B.dialogueact269	431.968	434.748	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but I got replies from people indicating that they had gotten it ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact270	434.878	434.958	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	so .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact271	435.442	435.812	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact272	435.79	436.73	B	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's just to prevent spam .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact273	437.662	438.192	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact274	439.272	442.272	A	Professor	fg|s^tc	-1	0	Yeah so O {disfmarker} OK . Well , anyway , I guess {disfmarker} everybody here {disfmarker} Are y are {disfmarker}

Bmr015.A.dialogueact284	456.477	458.077	A	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	from {disfmarker} I guess higher level from my point of view .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact285	458.847	461.097	A	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh , {vocalsound} and , uh , meeting mappings ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact286	461.347	462.287	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	and , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact287	462.702	467.062	A	Professor	s	+1	2	so is i for {disfmarker} it was a {vocalsound} proposal for the ITR program ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact288	467.062	471.952	A	Professor	s	-1	0	uh , Information Technology Research program 's part of National Science Foundation .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact289	472.52	476.78	A	Professor	s	+1	0	It 's the {pause} second year of their doing , uh , these grants .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact290	476.78	477.37	A	Professor	%--	-1	0	They 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact291	477.637	478.287	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	a lot of them are {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact292	478.703	482.903	A	Professor	s	-1	0	some of them anyway , are larger {disfmarker} larger grants than the usual , small NSF grants ,

Bmr015.A.dialogueact443	705.38	706.58	A	Professor	s^aap	+1	1	It 's extending the research ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact444	706.58	706.84	A	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right ?
Bmr015.A.dialogueact446	706.84	707.72	A	Professor	s^df.%-	-1	0	Because the other {disfmarker}
Bmr015.G.dialogueact445	706.629	706.879	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact447	707.21	710.652	B	Grad	fg|s	+1	0	Yeah it 's go higher level stuff than we 've been talking about for Meeting Recorder .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact448	709.988	710.318	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact449	710.797	716.869	A	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah the other things that we have , uh , been working on with , uh , the c with Communicator {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact450	716.959	718.839	A	Professor	s	-1	0	uh , especially with the newer things {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact451	718.839	723.299	A	Professor	s	-1	0	with the more acoustically - oriented things are {disfmarker} are {disfmarker} are {disfmarker} are lower level .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact452	723.624	723.914	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	And ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact453	723.974	729.461	A	Professor	s	+1	0	this is dealing with , uh , mapping on the level of {disfmarker} of , um , the conversation {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact455	729.77	731.15	A	Professor	s^e	+1	0	of mapping the conversations
Bmr015.G.dialogueact454	729.688	730.008	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact456	730.969	731.559	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Right , right .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact457	732.149	733.902	A	Professor	s^e	+1	0	to different kind of planes .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact458	734.513	738.881	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	So . Um . But , um .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact459	738.961	741.301	A	Professor	s	-1	0	So it 's all it 's all stuff that none none of us are doing right now ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact460	741.598	742.598	A	Professor	s	-1	0	or none of us are funded for ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact461	742.598	744.268	A	Professor	s	-1	0	so it 's {disfmarker} so it 's {disfmarker} it would be new .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact462	744.219	750.55	G	PhD	qo^rt	-1	0	So assuming everybody 's completely busy now , it means we 're gonna hafta , hire more students , or , something ?
Bmr015.A.dialogueact463	750.72	752.76	A	Professor	s^j	-1	0	Well there 's evenings , and there 's weekends ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact464	752.76	755.039	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker} Uh .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact465	755.67	757.45	A	Professor	s^aa|s.x	+1	0	Yeah , there {disfmarker} there would be {disfmarker} there would be new hires ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact466	757.45	759.23	A	Professor	s^e	+1	0	and {disfmarker} and there {disfmarker} there would be expansion ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact467	759.23	759.42	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	but ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact468	760.035	763.843	A	Professor	s	-1	0	also , there 's always {disfmarker} {vocalsound} for everybody there 's {disfmarker} there 's always things that are dropping off ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact469	763.843	764.703	A	Professor	s	-1	0	grants that are ending ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact470	764.703	765.723	A	Professor	s	-1	0	or other things that are ending ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact472	765.723	766.103	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	so ,
Bmr015.G.dialogueact471	765.48	766.1	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact474	766.414	769.81	A	Professor	s	-1	0	there 's {disfmarker} there 's a {vocalsound} continual need to {disfmarker} to bring in new things .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact473	766.038	766.348	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact476	768.482	768.752	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact475	768.472	768.952	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact478	769.81	773.53	A	Professor	s	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but there definitely would be new {disfmarker} new {disfmarker} new , uh , students ,
Bmr015.G.dialogueact477	769.688	770.118	G	PhD	b.x	-1	0	I see .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact479	773.53	775.59	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and so forth , both at {disfmarker} at UW and here .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact480	774.932	777.705	B	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Are there any students in your class who are {vocalsound} expressing interest ?
Bmr015.A.dialogueact481	779.177	781.347	A	Professor	h|s^no	-1	0	Um , not {pause} clear yet .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact483	782.329	783.009	A	Professor	s^r	-1	0	Not clear yet .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact482	782.095	783.205	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	Other than the one who 's already here .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact484	783.099	784.519	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean we got {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we have {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact485	785.169	788.179	A	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	yeah , two of them are {disfmarker} two in the c There 're {pause} two in the class already here ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact486	788.179	788.459	A	Professor	%--	-1	0	and then {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact487	788.599	790.983	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and , uh {disfmarker} uh ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact488	790.983	793.343	A	Professor	s	-1	0	then there 's a third who 's doing a project here ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact490	793.641	796.321	A	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	who , uh {disfmarker} But he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he won't be in the country that long ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact489	793.241	793.511	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact491	796.321	796.441	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	and ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact492	797.692	799.245	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	maybe another will end up .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact493	798.788	798.948	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact494	799.502	801.832	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Actually there is one other guy who 's looking {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that 's that
Bmr015.A.dialogueact495	802.176	802.716	A	Professor	%--	-1	0	guy , uh ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact496	802.926	803.916	A	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	Jeremy ? {comment} I think .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact497	804.945	805.327	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact498	805.025	805.285	C	PhD	b	-1	0	
Bmr015.A.dialogueact499	806.738	809.978	A	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Anyway , yeah that 's {disfmarker} that 's all I was gonna say is that {disfmarker} that that 's {disfmarker} you know , that 's nice
Bmr015.A.dialogueact500	809.978	811.428	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and we 're sorta preceding to the next step ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact501	811.428	815.721	A	Professor	s	+1	0	and , {vocalsound} it 'll mean some more work , uh , you know , in {disfmarker} in March in getting the proposal out ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact502	815.721	819.275	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and then , it 's , uh , you know {disfmarker} We 'll see what happens .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact503	821.309	824.259	A	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt^t^tc	+1	2	Uh , the last one was {disfmarker} that you had there , {comment} was about naming ?
Bmr015.B.dialogueact504	824.51	824.81	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact505	825.253	831.15	B	Grad	s	-1	0	It just , uh {disfmarker} we 've been cutting up sound files , in {disfmarker} for ba both digits and for , uh , doing recognition .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact506	831.713	833.483	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And Liz had some suggestions on naming
Bmr015.B.dialogueact507	833.483	837.54	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and it just brought up the whole issue that hasn't really been resolved about naming .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact508	838.005	842.595	B	Grad	s	+1	1	So , uh , one thing she would like to have is for all the names to be the same length
Bmr015.B.dialogueact509	843.128	844.308	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	so that sorting is easier .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact511	845.733	846.223	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact510	845.386	845.596	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact512	847.366	848.316	B	Grad	s^e	+1	1	same number of characters
Bmr015.B.dialogueact513	848.316	852.132	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	so that when you 're sorting filenames you can easily extract out bits and pieces that you want .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact514	852.132	853.222	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	And that 's easy enough to do .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact515	853.554	856.924	B	Grad	s	+1	0	And I don't think we have so many meetings that that 's a big deal just to change the names .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact516	857.24	863.116	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So that means , uh , instead of calling it " MR one " , " MR two " , you 'd call it " MRM zero zero one " ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact517	863.116	864.996	B	Grad	s	-1	0	" MRM zero zero two " , things like that .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact518	865.928	867.668	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Just so that they 're {disfmarker} they 're all the same length .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact519	868.092	871.5	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	But , you know , when you , do things like that you can always {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact520	871.855	872.495	F	Postdoc	s^df.%--	-1	0	as long as you have {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact521	872.981	875.611	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	uh , you can always search from the beginning or the end of the string .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact523	875.906	877.646	B	Grad	s	-1	0	The problem is that they 're a lot of fields .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact522	875.701	877.061	F	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	You know , so " zero zero two " {disfmarker}
Bmr015.B.dialogueact525	878.855	879.065	B	Grad	s^f	-1	0	Alright ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact524	878.454	878.674	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact526	879.065	881.585	B	Grad	s^df^e	-1	0	so we {disfmarker} we have th we 're gonna have the speaker ID ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact527	881.938	882.558	B	Grad	s	-1	0	the session ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact528	883.118	885.095	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker} uh ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact530	885.245	886.785	B	Grad	s	-1	0	information on the microphones ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact529	884.907	886.217	F	Postdoc	s^bk|s^ba.%-	-1	0	Yeah , well , your example was really {disfmarker}
Bmr015.B.dialogueact533	886.785	889.685	B	Grad	s	-1	0	information on the speak on the channels and all that .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact532	886.772	887.162	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact531	886.681	886.901	F	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	i
Bmr015.B.dialogueact535	890.044	893.344	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	And so if each one of those is a fixed length , the sorting becomes a lot easier .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact534	889.867	890.147	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr015.D.dialogueact536	894.014	897.398	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	She wanted to keep them {vocalsound} the same lengths across different meetings also .
Bmr015.D.dialogueact537	897.458	901.783	D	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	So like , the NSA meeting lengths , {comment} all filenames are gonna be the same length as the Meeting Recorder meeting names ?
Bmr015.B.dialogueact538	901.045	901.255	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact539	902.655	906.236	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	And as I said , the it 's {disfmarker} we just don't have that many that that 's a big deal .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact540	902.667	903.527	G	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Cuz of digits .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact541	906.879	911.651	B	Grad	s^cs.%--	-1	0	And so , uh , um , at some point we have to sort of take a few days off ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact542	912.224	913.854	B	Grad	s^cs^e	-1	0	let the transcribers have a few days off ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact543	913.854	915.064	B	Grad	s^cs^e	-1	0	make sure no one 's touching the data
Bmr015.B.dialogueact544	915.064	916.744	B	Grad	s^cs^e	-1	0	and reorganize the file structures .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact545	917.038	919.488	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And when we do that we can also rationalize some of the naming .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact546	920.209	925.379	F	Postdoc	s^ng	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I would think though that the transcribe {disfmarker} the transcripts themselves wouldn't need to have such lengthy names .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact548	926.34	926.53	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact547	926.241	930.061	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So , I mean , you 're dealing with a different domain there , and with start and end times and all that ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact549	930.061	931.516	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and channels and stuff ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact551	931.814	934.314	B	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Right . So the only thing that would change with that is just the directory names ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact550	931.516	933.39	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so , it 's a different {pause} set .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact552	934.314	935.474	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I would change them to match .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact553	935.474	938.134	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So instead of being MR one it would be MRM zero zero one .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact554	938.324	939.344	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	But I don't think that 's a big deal .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact555	938.895	939.778	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Fine . Fine .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact556	940.304	943.434	B	Grad	s	+1	0	So for {disfmarker} for m the meetings we were thinking about three letters and three numbers
Bmr015.B.dialogueact557	944.002	944.942	B	Grad	s	-1	0	for meeting I Ds .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact558	945.418	948.498	B	Grad	s	+1	0	Uh , for speakers , M or F and then three numbers ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact559	949.71	951.5	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	For , uh {disfmarker} and , uh ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact560	951.67	956.4	B	Grad	s^cs	+1	1	that also brings up the point that we have to start assembling a speaker database so that we get those links back and forth
Bmr015.B.dialogueact561	956.88	957.93	B	Grad	s	+1	1	and keep it consistent .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact562	958.823	959.423	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact563	961.344	963.344	B	Grad	s	+1	0	and then , uh , the microphone issues .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact564	963.344	975.033	B	Grad	s	+1	2	We want some way of specifying , more than looking in the " key " file , what channel and what mike . What channel , what mike , and what broadcaster .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact565	975.033	976.393	B	Grad	s^df^no	-1	0	Or {disfmarker} I don't know how to s say it .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact566	976.393	982.29	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So I mean with this one it 's this particular headset with this particular transmitter w {pause} as a wireless .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact567	981.725	981.945	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.E.dialogueact568	982.129	982.309	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact569	982.73	985.14	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And you know that one is a different headset and different channel .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact570	985.978	987.948	B	Grad	s	+1	0	And so we just need some naming conventions on that .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact571	987.444	987.604	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact572	988.469	989.049	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	And , uh ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact573	988.517	988.997	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact574	991.146	995.296	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	that 's gonna become especially important once we start changing the microphone set - up .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact575	995.296	997.826	B	Grad	s	-1	0	We have some new microphones that I 'd like to start trying out ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact576	997.996	998.476	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact577	998.636	999.446	B	Grad	s	-1	0	once I test them .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact578	999.932	1002.27	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And then we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll need to specify that somewhere .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact579	1002.43	1007.22	B	Grad	s	+1	0	So I was just gonna do a fixed list of , uh , microphones and types .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact580	1007.1	1007.3	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact582	1008.39	1009.42	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	So , as I said {disfmarker}
Bmr015.E.dialogueact581	1008.04	1008.27	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact583	1008.77	1009.48	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That sounds good .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact584	1010.4	1010.57	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact585	1012.12	1016.63	A	Professor	fh|qw^t^tc	+1	1	Um , {pause} {vocalsound} since we have such a short agenda list I guess I wi I will ask how {disfmarker} how are the transcriptions going ?
Bmr015.A.dialogueact586	1017.59	1017.79	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact587	1017.77	1019.39	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	The {disfmarker} the news is that I 've {disfmarker} I uh {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact588	1019.39	1020.86	F	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	s So {disfmarker} in s um {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact589	1021.13	1022.23	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	So I 've switched to {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact590	1022.83	1023.65	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Start my new sentence .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact591	1024.48	1033.18	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	I {disfmarker} I switched to doing the channel - by - channel transcriptions to provide , uh , the {disfmarker} uh , tighter time bins for {disfmarker} partly for use in Thilo 's work
Bmr015.F.dialogueact592	1033.18	1035.41	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and also it 's of relevance to other people in the project .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact593	1036.1	1041.28	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And , um , I discovered in the process a couple of {disfmarker} of interesting things ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact594	1041.28	1041.91	F	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	which , um ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact595	1042.67	1048.44	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	one of them is that , um , it seems that there are time lags involved in doing this ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact596	1048.75	1050.3	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	uh , uh ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact597	1050.93	1053.89	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	using an interface that has so much more complexity to it .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact598	1054.35	1058.83	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	And I {disfmarker} and I wanted to maybe ask , uh , Chuck to help me with some of the questions of efficiency .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact599	1058.83	1064.15	F	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	1	Maybe {disfmarker} I was thinking maybe the best way to do this in the long run may be to give them single channel parts
Bmr015.F.dialogueact600	1064.33	1065.49	F	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	1	and then piece them together later .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact601	1065.61	1066.45	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	And I {disfmarker} I have a script ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact602	1066.45	1067.32	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	I can piece them together .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact603	1067.32	1071.49	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean , so it 's like , I {disfmarker} I know that I can take them apart and put them together and I 'll end up with the representation
Bmr015.F.dialogueact604	1071.49	1073.39	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	which is where the real power of that interface is .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact606	1073.96	1074.35	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact605	1073.71	1083.23	F	Postdoc	s^am^ba	+1	0	And it may be that it 's faster to transcribe a channel at a time with only one , uh , sound file and one , uh , set of {disfmarker} of , uh , utterances to check through .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact607	1081.03	1081.17	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact608	1083.7	1084.55	A	Professor	s	-1	0	I 'm a little confused .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact609	1084.55	1097.05	A	Professor	s	-1	0	I thought that {disfmarker} that one of the reason we thought we were so much faster than {disfmarker} than , uh , the {disfmarker} the other transcription , uh , thing was that {disfmarker} that we were using the mixed {pause} file .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact610	1096.64	1097.52	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , yes . OK .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact611	1097.52	1105.97	F	Postdoc	s^ng	+1	1	But , um , with the mixed , when you have an overlap , you only have a {disfmarker} a choice of one start and end time for that entire overlap ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact612	1106.07	1111.72	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	which means that you 're not tightly , uh , tuning the individual parts th of that overlap by different speakers .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact613	1109.22	1109.5	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact615	1112.02	1112.41	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact614	1111.72	1115.31	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So someone may have only said two words in that entire big chunk of overlap .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact616	1115.41	1115.81	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact617	1115.77	1118.56	F	Postdoc	s.%--	+1	0	And for purposes of {disfmarker} of , uh , things like {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact618	1119.58	1123.62	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	well , so things like training the speech - nonspeech segmentation thing .
Bmr015.E.dialogueact619	1121.49	1121.68	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact620	1123.62	1126.12	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	Th - it 's necessary to have it more tightly tuned than that .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact621	1124.34	1124.65	A	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact622	1126.53	1134.8	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	And w and w and , you know , is a It would be wonderful if , uh , it 's possible then to use that algorithm to more tightly tie in all the channels after that
Bmr015.F.dialogueact623	1135.34	1137.74	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	but , um , you know , I 've {disfmarker} th the {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact624	1137.74	1138.15	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact625	1138.15	1140.71	F	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	I I don't know exactly where that 's going at this point .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact626	1141.19	1144.2	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But m I was experimenting with doing this by hand
Bmr015.F.dialogueact627	1144.2	1144.55	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and
Bmr015.F.dialogueact628	1145.1	1148.05	F	Postdoc	s^ba	+1	0	I really do think that it 's wise that we 've had them start the way we have
Bmr015.F.dialogueact629	1148.05	1150.68	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	with , uh , m y working off the mixed signal ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact630	1151.08	1151.46	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact631	1151.88	1160.43	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	having the interface that doesn't require them to do the ti uh , the time bins for every single channel at a t uh , through the entire interaction .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact632	1158.18	1158.48	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact633	1161.17	1163.37	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Um , I did discover a couple other things by doing this though ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact634	1163.37	1164.3	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and one of them is that ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact635	1164.37	1165.89	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	um , um ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact636	1166.17	1169.53	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	once in a while a backchannel will be overlooked by the transcriber .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact638	1170.06	1170.34	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact637	1169.65	1170.53	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	As you might expect ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact640	1170.87	1171.13	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Sure .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact639	1170.53	1171.35	F	Postdoc	s^df.%--	-1	0	because when it 's
Bmr015.F.dialogueact641	1171.71	1175.13	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	a b backchannel could well happen in a very densely populated overlap .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact642	1175.54	1177.44	F	Postdoc	s.%--	+1	0	And if we 're gonna study types of overlaps ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact643	1177.44	1178.34	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	which is what I wanna do ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact644	1178.34	1179.14	F	Postdoc	s^e.%--	-1	0	an analysis of that ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact645	1179.41	1184.85	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	then that really does require listening {comment} to every single channel all the way through the entire {comment} length for all the different speakers .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact646	1185.08	1187.75	F	Postdoc	s^ba^bd	-1	0	Now , for only four speakers , that 's not gonna be too much time ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact647	1187.75	1191.05	F	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	but if it 's nine speakers , then that i that is more time .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact648	1191.05	1192.33	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	So it 's li you know , kind of wondering {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact649	1192.48	1197.33	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	And I think again it 's like this {disfmarker} it 's really valuable that Thilo 's working on the speech - nonspeech segmentation
Bmr015.F.dialogueact650	1197.33	1205.34	F	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	because maybe , um , we can close in on that wi without having to actually go to the time that it would take to listen to every single channel from start to finish through every single meeting .
Bmr015.E.dialogueact651	1205.63	1208.49	E	PhD	s^bk|s^ba^ng	+1	1	Yeah , but those backchannels will always be a problem I think .
Bmr015.E.dialogueact652	1208.63	1211.2	E	PhD	s	+1	1	Uh especially if they 're really short
Bmr015.E.dialogueact653	1211.2	1212.8	E	PhD	s^e^rt	+1	1	and they 're not very loud
Bmr015.E.dialogueact654	1212.9	1219.28	E	PhD	s	+1	1	and so it {disfmarker} it can {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it will always happen that also the automatic s detection system will miss some of them ,
Bmr015.E.dialogueact655	1219.28	1219.57	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	so .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact656	1219.33	1219.59	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact657	1220.21	1226.3	F	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	1	Well so then {disfmarker} then , maybe the answer is to , uh , listen especially densely in places of overlap ,
Bmr015.E.dialogueact659	1226.56	1226.7	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact658	1226.45	1229.19	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	just so that they 're {disfmarker} they 're not being overlooked because of that ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact660	1229.19	1231.88	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and count on accuracy during the sparser phases .
Bmr015.E.dialogueact661	1229.8	1229.97	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact662	1231.88	1233.36	F	Postdoc	s^df.%--	-1	0	Cuz there are large s spaces of the {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact663	1233.48	1234.08	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	That 's a good point .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact664	1234.29	1236.18	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	There are large spaces where there 's no overlap at all .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact665	1236.18	1237.43	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Someone 's giving a presentation ,
Bmr015.E.dialogueact666	1237.36	1237.49	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact667	1237.43	1238.35	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	or whatever .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact668	1238.68	1239.88	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker} that 's a good {disfmarker} that 's a good thought .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact669	1240.57	1242.72	F	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	And , um , let 's see , there was one other thing I was gonna say .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact670	1243.42	1245.46	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I think it 's really interesting data to work with ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact671	1245.46	1246.94	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I have to say , it 's very enjoyable .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact672	1247.21	1249.54	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I really , not {disfmarker} not a problem spending time with these data .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact673	1249.81	1250.34	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Really interesting .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact674	1251.16	1252.15	F	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	And not just because I 'm in there .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact675	1255.17	1255.9	F	Postdoc	s^ba^r	-1	0	No , it 's real interesting .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact676	1258.94	1262.0	A	Professor	fg|s^ba^t^tc	-1	0	Uh , well I think it 's a short meeting .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact677	1262.65	1267.09	A	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh , you 're {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} you 're still in the midst of what you 're doing from what you described last time , I assume ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact678	1262.74	1262.93	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Is true .

Bmr015.A.dialogueact746	1476.53	1479.2	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} I haven't worked with that either
Bmr015.A.dialogueact747	1479.2	1479.95	A	Professor	s^no	-1	0	so I 'm not sure {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact748	1479.95	1485.4	A	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	The way {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the simple - minded way I suggested was what Chuck was just saying , is that you could make a {disfmarker} a sieve .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact750	1486.28	1488.56	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	You know , y you actually say that here is {disfmarker}

Bmr015.A.dialogueact754	1494.74	1501.79	A	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	maybe you {disfmarker} maybe you could use some other cute methods to , uh , short cut it by {disfmarker} by uh , making some guesses ,

Bmr015.A.dialogueact757	1508.65	1512.97	A	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	I mean you could make some guesses from , uh {disfmarker} from the auto - correlation or something
Bmr015.A.dialogueact758	1512.97	1515.89	A	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	but {disfmarker} but then , given those guesses , try ,

Bmr015.G.dialogueact769	1530.67	1534.42	G	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	Do you hafta do some kind of , uh , low - pass filter before you do that ?
Bmr015.C.dialogueact770	1536.73	1537.41	C	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	I don't use .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact771	1537.32	1537.55	G	PhD	qrr.%-	-1	0	Or {disfmarker}
Bmr015.C.dialogueact772	1538.72	1545.01	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	But , I {disfmarker} I know many people use , eh , low - pass filter to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to get , eh , the pitch .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact773	1539.48	1539.96	A	Professor	qy^br^m^rt	-1	0	No .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact774	1545.48	1546.72	A	Professor	s^na|s^aa	-1	0	To get the pitch , yes .

Bmr015.G.dialogueact779	1547.71	1547.88	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	But i
Bmr015.G.dialogueact780	1548.57	1550.03	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But the harmonics are gonna be ,
Bmr015.G.dialogueact781	1551.1	1553.25	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh , uh ,
Bmr015.G.dialogueact782	1554.73	1555.76	G	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I don't know what the right word is .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact783	1555.9	1556.38	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bmr015.G.dialogueact784	1557.28	1561.72	G	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	they 're gonna be dampened by the uh , vocal tract ,
Bmr015.G.dialogueact785	1561.72	1562.03	G	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr015.G.dialogueact786	1563.14	1564.35	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	The response of the vocal tract .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact787	1563.82	1564.51	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bmr015.C.dialogueact788	1564.36	1564.53	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bmr015.G.dialogueact789	1564.97	1570.73	G	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	And so {disfmarker} just looking at the energy on those {disfmarker} at the harmonics , is that gonna {disfmarker} ?
Bmr015.A.dialogueact790	1571.52	1573.36	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Well so the thing is that the {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact791	1574.4	1575.36	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	This is for ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact792	1575.36	1577.94	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh , a , um {disfmarker}
Bmr015.G.dialogueact793	1578.09	1581.75	G	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	I m what you 'd like to do is get rid of the effect of the vocal tract .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact794	1581.75	1581.99	G	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr015.E.dialogueact795	1582.61	1583.11	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact796	1582.61	1588.66	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	And just look at the {disfmarker} at {disfmarker} at the signal coming out of the glottis .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact797	1586.49	1587.0	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact798	1587.41	1589.15	A	Professor	h	-1	0	Uh , well ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact799	1589.33	1590.05	A	Professor	s^aa|s^ba	-1	0	yeah that 'd be good .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact800	1589.41	1589.72	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact801	1591.05	1593.28	A	Professor	s^arp^df	-1	0	But , uh {disfmarker} but I {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but I don't know that you need to {disfmarker}
Bmr015.B.dialogueact802	1592.82	1593.65	B	Grad	s^co^fe^j	-1	0	Open wide !
Bmr015.A.dialogueact803	1594.52	1596.21	A	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	but I don't need you {disfmarker} know if you need to get rid of it .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact804	1596.21	1597.1	A	Professor	s^ba^bd	-1	0	I mean that 'd {disfmarker} that 'd be nice
Bmr015.A.dialogueact805	1597.1	1598.77	A	Professor	s^no	-1	0	but I don't know if it 's ess if it 's essential .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact806	1598.82	1604.26	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Um , I mean {disfmarker} cuz I think the main thing is that , uh , you 're trying {disfmarker}
Bmr015.G.dialogueact807	1598.89	1599.16	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact808	1604.26	1605.46	A	Professor	qw^t1	-1	0	wha what are you doing this for ?
Bmr015.A.dialogueact809	1605.75	1614.36	A	Professor	s	+1	2	You 're trying distinguish between the case where there is , uh {disfmarker} where {disfmarker} where there are more than {disfmarker} uh , where there 's more than one speaker
Bmr015.A.dialogueact810	1616.39	1618.14	A	Professor	s	+1	2	and the case where there 's only one speaker .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact811	1616.41	1616.76	B	Grad	s^fa^t3	-1	0	Sorry .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact812	1618.94	1620.66	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So if there 's more than one speaker ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact813	1621.74	1622.4	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact814	1624.04	1625.19	A	Professor	s^aa|s^am.%--	-1	0	yeah I guess you could {disfmarker} I guess {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact815	1625.48	1627.59	A	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah you 're {disfmarker} so you 're not distinguished between voiced and unvoiced ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact816	1627.59	1630.9	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so {disfmarker} so , i if you don't {disfmarker} if you don't care about that {disfmarker}
Bmr015.C.dialogueact817	1628.35	1628.54	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact818	1631.02	1638.48	A	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	See , if you also wanna {vocalsound} just determine {disfmarker} if you also wanna determine whether it 's unvoiced , {vocalsound} then I think you want to {pause} look {disfmarker} look at high frequencies also ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact819	1638.48	1645.29	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because the f the fact that there 's more energy in the high frequencies is gonna be an ob sort of obvious cue that it 's unvoiced .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact820	1642.32	1642.62	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact821	1646.28	1648.03	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But , i i uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean i i
Bmr015.A.dialogueact822	1648.35	1649.33	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	but , um ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact823	1650.0	1657.52	A	Professor	s	+1	0	other than that I guess as far as the one person versus two persons , it would be {pause} primarily a low frequency phenomenon .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact824	1658.26	1662.9	A	Professor	s	+1	0	And if you looked at the low frequencies , yes the higher frequencies are gonna {disfmarker} there 's gonna be a spectral slope .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact825	1663.58	1665.45	A	Professor	s	+1	0	The higher frequencies will be lower energy .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact826	1666.05	1666.45	A	Professor	qh	-1	0	But so what .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact827	1669.0	1671.68	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that 's {disfmarker} that 's w
Bmr015.C.dialogueact828	1671.09	1675.72	C	PhD	s^cc	+1	1	I will prepare for the next week eh , all my results about the harmonicity
Bmr015.C.dialogueact829	1675.72	1678.01	C	PhD	s^e.%--	-1	0	and {pause} will {disfmarker} will try to come in
Bmr015.C.dialogueact830	1678.74	1679.61	C	PhD	s^e.%--	-1	0	and to discuss here ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact831	1680.0	1689.49	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because , eh , I haven't enough feeling to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to u {vocalsound} many time to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to understand what happened with the {disfmarker} with , eh , so many peaks ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact832	1689.64	1690.35	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	eh , eh ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact833	1690.87	1693.36	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I see the harmonics there many time
Bmr015.C.dialogueact834	1693.36	1695.17	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	but , eh , {vocalsound} there are a lot of peaks ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact835	1695.81	1697.98	C	PhD	s	-1	0	eh , that , eh , they are not harmonics .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact837	1698.61	1698.88	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact836	1698.48	1698.87	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact838	1699.25	1705.1	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I have to discover what {disfmarker} what is the {disfmarker} the w the best way to {disfmarker} to {comment} {disfmarker} to {comment} c to use them
Bmr015.A.dialogueact839	1705.62	1708.94	A	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	Well , but {disfmarker} yeah I don't think you can {disfmarker} I mean you 're not gonna be able to look at every frame ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact840	1708.94	1709.37	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so I mean {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact841	1709.86	1714.62	A	Professor	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I mean I {disfmarker} I really {disfmarker} I I really thought that the best way to do it ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact842	1714.62	1717.24	A	Professor	s^bd^df	-1	0	and I 'm speaking with no experience on this particular point ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact843	1717.47	1728.71	A	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	but , {vocalsound} my impression was that the best way to do it was however you {disfmarker} You 've used instantaneous frequency , whatever . {comment} However you 've come up {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} with your candidates , you wanna see how much of the energy is in that
Bmr015.C.dialogueact844	1723.15	1723.44	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact845	1725.25	1725.51	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact846	1729.27	1732.52	A	Professor	s	-1	0	as coppo as opposed to all of the {disfmarker} all {disfmarker} the total energy .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact847	1733.32	1735.43	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And , um , if it 's voiced ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact848	1736.28	1739.84	A	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	I guess {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} so y I think maybe you do need a voiced - unvoiced determination too .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact849	1739.9	1740.84	A	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	But if it 's voiced ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact850	1740.44	1740.65	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact851	1741.48	1743.68	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	um , and the , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact852	1744.34	1753.84	A	Professor	s	+1	1	e the fraction of the energy that 's in the harmonic sequence that you 're looking at is relatively low , then it should be {disfmarker} then it 's more likely to be an overlap .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact853	1750.23	1750.75	C	PhD	s^2	-1	0	Is height .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact854	1754.82	1754.99	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact855	1756.04	1758.74	C	PhD	s	-1	0	This {disfmarker} this is the idea {disfmarker} the idea I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I had
Bmr015.C.dialogueact856	1759.4	1767.16	C	PhD	s	-1	0	to {disfmarker} to compare the {disfmarker} the ratio of the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the energy of the harmonics with the {disfmarker} eh , with the , eh , total energy in the spectrum
Bmr015.C.dialogueact857	1767.58	1771.87	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and try to get a ratio to {disfmarker} to distinguish between overlapping and speech .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact858	1772.51	1772.75	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact859	1773.12	1774.49	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But you 're looking a y you 're looking at {disfmarker}

Bmr015.C.dialogueact883	1818.9	1820.8	C	PhD	z	-1	0	And another {disfmarker} another algorithm I have
Bmr015.C.dialogueact884	1820.92	1822.71	C	PhD	z	-1	0	is the {disfmarker} in the {pause} instantaneous frequency ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact885	1823.34	1824.44	C	PhD	z	-1	0	based on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker}

Bmr015.C.dialogueact889	1830.53	1831.14	C	PhD	z	-1	0	Eh , uh n the d
Bmr015.C.dialogueact890	1831.63	1833.55	C	PhD	z	-1	0	I mean I {disfmarker} I have two {disfmarker} two algorithms .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact891	1832.33	1832.68	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact892	1833.98	1838.08	C	PhD	z	-1	0	But , eh , in m {pause} i in my opinion the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the instantaneous frequency ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact893	1838.65	1839.62	C	PhD	z	-1	0	the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the behavior ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact894	1840.27	1840.83	C	PhD	z	-1	0	eh , was {disfmarker}
Bmr015.C.dialogueact895	1841.15	1842.71	C	PhD	z	-1	0	th it was very interesting .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact896	1842.87	1847.18	C	PhD	z	-1	0	Because I {disfmarker} I saw {vocalsound} eh , how the spectrum {pause} concentrate , eh ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact897	1846.25	1846.45	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Oh !
Bmr015.C.dialogueact898	1847.64	1848.67	C	PhD	z	-1	0	around the {disfmarker} the harmonic .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact899	1849.18	1849.52	C	PhD	z	-1	0	But then
Bmr015.C.dialogueact900	1849.95	1852.63	C	PhD	z	-1	0	when I apply the {disfmarker} the rule ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact901	1852.63	1857.89	C	PhD	z	-1	0	eh , of the {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} {pause} the instantaneous frequency of the ne of the continuous filter in the {disfmarker} the near filter ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact902	1858.47	1861.54	C	PhD	z	-1	0	the {disfmarker} the rule that , eh , people propose in the paper
Bmr015.C.dialogueact903	1862.1	1862.7	C	PhD	z	-1	0	doesn't work .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact904	1862.99	1863.79	C	PhD	z	-1	0	And I don't know
Bmr015.C.dialogueact905	1864.14	1864.48	C	PhD	z	-1	0	why .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact906	1865.3	1866.89	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But the instantaneous frequency ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact907	1866.89	1874.63	A	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	wouldn't that give you something more like the central frequency of the {disfmarker} you know , of the {disfmarker} where most of the energy is ?
Bmr015.A.dialogueact908	1874.63	1875.98	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , I think if you {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact909	1876.15	1878.51	A	Professor	qw	-1	0	Does i does it {disfmarker} Why would it correspond to pitch ?
Bmr015.C.dialogueact910	1879.58	1879.82	C	PhD	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact911	1880.13	1881.3	C	PhD	z	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I not sure .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact912	1881.37	1882.62	C	PhD	z	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I try to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact913	1882.77	1883.06	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact914	1883.49	1888.51	C	PhD	z	-1	0	When {vocalsound} first I {disfmarker} {pause} {vocalsound} I calculate , eh , using the FFT ,

Bmr015.C.dialogueact918	1891.49	1896.0	C	PhD	z	-1	0	I get the {disfmarker} {pause} the spectrum ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact919	1897.04	1897.36	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact920	1897.86	1898.78	C	PhD	z	-1	0	and I represent
Bmr015.C.dialogueact921	1900.8	1901.63	C	PhD	z	-1	0	all the frequency .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact922	1902.12	1902.39	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact923	1902.2	1902.96	C	PhD	z	-1	0	And {disfmarker} when ou
Bmr015.C.dialogueact924	1902.96	1904.88	C	PhD	z	-1	0	I obtained the instantaneous frequency .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact925	1904.97	1907.35	C	PhD	z	-1	0	And I change {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the @ @ ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact926	1909.54	1910.25	C	PhD	z	-1	0	using the
Bmr015.C.dialogueact927	1911.74	1913.38	C	PhD	z	-1	0	instantaneous frequency , here .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact928	1915.99	1920.7	A	Professor	s^bk|s^bu	-1	0	Oh , so you scale {disfmarker} you s you do a {disfmarker} a scaling along that axis according to instantaneous {disfmarker}
Bmr015.C.dialogueact929	1916.25	1916.64	C	PhD	z	-1	0	I use {disfmarker}
Bmr015.C.dialogueact930	1919.47	1919.76	C	PhD	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact932	1920.7	1921.96	A	Professor	s^bu^e	-1	0	It 's a kinda normalization .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact931	1920.6	1920.94	C	PhD	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact933	1921.64	1921.94	C	PhD	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact934	1922.13	1922.93	C	PhD	z	-1	0	Because when {disfmarker} when {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact935	1923.23	1923.89	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact936	1923.55	1924.12	C	PhD	z	-1	0	eh , when i
Bmr015.C.dialogueact937	1924.21	1925.84	C	PhD	z	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I use these {disfmarker} these frequency ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact938	1926.17	1929.83	C	PhD	z	-1	0	eh , the range is different , and the resolution is different .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact939	1930.05	1930.54	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact940	1930.68	1931.11	C	PhD	z	-1	0	And
Bmr015.C.dialogueact941	1931.38	1932.08	C	PhD	z	-1	0	I observe
Bmr015.C.dialogueact942	1938.11	1938.41	C	PhD	z	-1	0	more {disfmarker}
Bmr015.C.dialogueact943	1938.8	1939.29	C	PhD	z	-1	0	more or less ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact944	1939.91	1940.66	C	PhD	z	-1	0	thing like this .

Bmr015.C.dialogueact946	1941.8	1943.34	C	PhD	z	-1	0	the paper said that , eh ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact947	1943.93	1944.94	C	PhD	z	-1	0	these frequencies
Bmr015.C.dialogueact948	1946.0	1946.94	C	PhD	z	-1	0	are probably ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact949	1947.22	1948.25	C	PhD	z	-1	0	eh , harmonics .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact950	1948.47	1948.78	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	I see .

Bmr015.C.dialogueact951	1950.92	1952.05	C	PhD	z	-1	0	But , eh , they used ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact953	1952.49	1953.25	C	PhD	z	-1	0	eh , a rule ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact954	1953.75	1954.21	C	PhD	z	-1	0	eh ,
Bmr015.C.dialogueact955	1954.51	1955.86	C	PhD	z	-1	0	based in the {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker}
Bmr015.C.dialogueact956	1956.77	1957.32	C	PhD	z	-1	0	because

Bmr015.A.dialogueact984	2009.74	2012.42	A	Professor	s^bk|s	-1	0	OK , yeah well I {disfmarker} I guess I 'm not following it enough .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact985	2012.58	2014.23	A	Professor	s	-1	0	I 'll {comment} probably gonna hafta look at the paper ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact986	2014.23	2016.72	A	Professor	s	-1	0	but {disfmarker} which I 'm not gonna have time to do in the next few days ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact987	2016.82	2019.12	A	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm curious about it .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact988	2016.94	2017.18	C	PhD	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact989	2019.37	2021.54	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um , uh ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact990	2023.98	2024.23	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact991	2025.32	2028.16	F	Postdoc	s^t^tc	+1	0	I I did i it did occur to me that this is {disfmarker} uh , the return to the transcription ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact992	2028.15	2031.51	F	Postdoc	s^t^tc	+1	1	that there 's one third thing I wanted to {disfmarker} to ex raise as a to as an issue
Bmr015.F.dialogueact993	2031.52	2033.92	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	which is , um , how to handle breaths .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact994	2034.19	2041.88	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So , I wanted to raise the question of whether people in speech recognition want to know where the breaths are .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact995	2041.88	2043.35	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And the reason I ask the question is ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact996	2043.8	2047.13	F	Postdoc	s.%--	+1	1	um , aside from the fact that they 're obviously very time - consuming to encode ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact997	2047.63	2049.42	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	uh , the fact that there was some {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact998	2049.45	2053.1	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I had the indication from Dan Ellis in the email that I sent to you ,
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1000	2053.26	2053.47	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact999	2053.24	2053.97	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and you know about ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1001	2054.46	2062.48	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	that in principle we might be able to , um , handle breaths by accessi by using cross - talk from the other things ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1002	2062.48	2063.2	F	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	be able that {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1003	2063.3	2064.86	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	in principle , maybe we could get rid of them ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1004	2064.86	2065.26	F	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	so maybe {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1005	2065.65	2065.98	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And I was {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1006	2065.98	2066.49	F	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I don't know ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1007	2066.49	2067.28	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	I mean we had this an
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1008	2067.28	2068.77	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and I didn't {disfmarker} couldn't get back to you ,
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1009	2068.33	2068.53	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1010	2068.77	2072.36	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	but the question of whether it 'd be possible to eliminate them from the audio signal ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1011	2072.36	2073.96	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	which would be the ideal situation ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1013	2074.38	2076.0	A	Professor	s^nd	+1	1	I don't know {disfmarker} think it 'd be ideal .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1012	2073.96	2074.32	F	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	cuz {disfmarker}
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1014	2076.09	2076.15	G	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	Uh - uh .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1015	2077.1	2078.8	A	Professor	s^df	+1	0	We - See , we 're {disfmarker} we 're dealing with real speech
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1016	2078.8	2080.56	A	Professor	s^df	+1	0	and we 're trying to have it be as real as possible
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1017	2079.14	2079.33	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1018	2080.56	2082.05	A	Professor	s^df^e	+1	1	and breaths are part of real speech .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1019	2080.88	2083.84	F	Postdoc	s^nd.%--	-1	0	Well , except that these are really truly {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1020	2083.84	2086.19	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , ther there 's a segment in o the one I did {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1021	2086.41	2088.46	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	n the first one that I did for {disfmarker} i for this ,
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1022	2087.79	2087.98	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1023	2088.72	2092.9	F	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	where truly w we 're hearing you breathing like {disfmarker} as if we 're {disfmarker} you 're in our ear ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1024	2092.95	2093.94	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	you know , and it 's like {disfmarker} it 's like {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1025	2094.24	2094.58	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr015.F.dialogueact1027	2094.81	2096.53	F	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	I mean , breath is natural ,

Bmr015.A.dialogueact1029	2098.3	2100.63	A	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	It is {disfmarker} but it is if you record it .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact1030	2099.1	2099.33	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1031	2101.17	2102.83	F	Postdoc	s^nd.%--	-1	0	Except that we 're {disfmarker} we 're trying to mimic {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1032	2103.44	2104.19	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , I see what you 're saying .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1033	2104.19	2108.83	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	You 're saying that the PDA application would have {disfmarker} uh , have to cope with breath .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1034	2109.35	2109.58	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact1035	2109.94	2110.21	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	Well
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1038	2110.65	2110.85	E	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1036	2110.26	2110.44	F	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	But {disfmarker}

Bmr015.B.dialogueact1039	2111.35	2112.84	B	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	The P D A might not have to ,
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1040	2111.46	2112.25	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	No {disfmarker} i
Bmr015.B.dialogueact1041	2112.84	2117.34	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	but more people than just PDA users are interested in this corpus .
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1042	2112.97	2113.22	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact1044	2118.0	2119.09	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so mean you 're right
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1043	2117.67	2119.81	F	Postdoc	s^bk|s	-1	0	OK , then the {disfmarker} then {disfmarker} I have two questions .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact1045	2119.09	2120.04	B	Grad	s	-1	0	we could remove it ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1046	2120.42	2120.6	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bmr015.B.dialogueact1047	2121.05	2127.01	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	but I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} we don't wanna w remove it from the corpus , {pause} in terms of delivering it
Bmr015.B.dialogueact1048	2127.01	2128.41	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because the {disfmarker} people will want it in there .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1050	2128.92	2130.03	A	Professor	fg|%-	-1	0	Yeah . If it gets {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1049	2128.79	2130.63	F	Postdoc	s^bk|s^cs	-1	0	OK , so maybe the question is notating it .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1051	2130.63	2130.75	F	Postdoc	qw	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1052	2131.36	2132.17	A	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah {disfmarker} i Right .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1053	2132.17	2139.61	A	Professor	s	+1	0	If {disfmarker} if it gets in the way of what somebody is doing with it then you might wanna have some method which will allow you to block it ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1054	2139.61	2140.66	A	Professor	s^df	+1	0	but you {disfmarker} it 's real data .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1055	2141.29	2142.09	A	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	You don't wanna b but you don't {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1056	2141.82	2142.61	F	Postdoc	s^bk|%-	-1	0	OK , well {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1057	2142.42	2149.77	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	If s you know , if there 's a little bit of noise out there , and somebody is {disfmarker} is talking about something they 're doing , that 's part of what we accept as part of a real meeting ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1058	2149.99	2150.51	A	Professor	%--	-1	0	even {disfmarker} And
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1059	2150.97	2155.05	A	Professor	s	-1	0	we have the f uh {disfmarker} the uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the fan and the {disfmarker} in the projector up there ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1060	2155.67	2161.11	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and , uh , this is {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} this is actual stuff that we {disfmarker} we wanna work with .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1061	2161.44	2162.73	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Well this is in very interesting
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1062	2161.99	2162.12	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1063	2162.73	2169.99	F	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	because i it basically has a i it shows very clearly the contrast between , uh , speech recognition research and discourse research
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1064	2169.99	2174.55	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	because in {disfmarker} in discourse and linguistic research , what counts is what 's communit communicative .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1065	2170.37	2170.92	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1066	2175.06	2176.02	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And {disfmarker} breath ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1067	2176.02	2176.86	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know , everyone breathes ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1068	2176.86	2177.7	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	they breathe all the time .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1069	2177.7	2179.32	F	Postdoc	s^bd^df	-1	0	And once in a while breath is communicative ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1070	2179.32	2180.8	F	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	but r very rarely .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1071	2181.04	2183.5	F	Postdoc	fg|s	+1	0	OK , so now , I had a discussion with Chuck about the data structure
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1072	2183.29	2183.64	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1073	2183.5	2187.23	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and the idea is that the transcripts will {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} get stored as a master
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1074	2187.3	2188.5	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	there 'll be a master transcript
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1075	2188.5	2191.21	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	which has in it everything that 's needed for both of these uses .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1076	2191.54	2191.95	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1077	2191.57	2195.42	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	And the one that 's used for speech recognition will be processed via scripts .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1078	2195.47	2197.16	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	You know , like , Don 's been writing scripts
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1080	2197.64	2197.96	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1079	2197.16	2197.71	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1081	2198.02	2200.36	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	uh , to process it for the speech recognition side .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1082	2200.58	2201.9	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	Discourse side will {vocalsound} have
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1083	2201.9	2204.41	F	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	this {disfmarker} this side over he the {disfmarker} we we 'll have a s ch
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1084	2204.58	2205.68	F	Postdoc	s^fa|s	-1	0	Sorry , not being very fluent here .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1085	2205.82	2206.56	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	But , um ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1086	2206.72	2211.51	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	this {disfmarker} the discourse side will have a script which will stri strip away the things which are non - communicative .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1087	2212.01	2218.58	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	OK . So then the {disfmarker} then {disfmarker} let 's {disfmarker} let 's think about the practicalities of how we get to that master copy with reference to breaths .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1088	2218.72	2224.78	F	Postdoc	qy	+1	0	So what I would {disfmarker} r r what I would wonder is would it be possible to encode those automatically ?
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1089	2224.78	2226.47	F	Postdoc	qy	+1	0	Could we get a breath detector ?
Bmr015.B.dialogueact1090	2227.9	2230.64	B	Grad	s^bk|s^bu	-1	0	Oh , just to save the transcribers time .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1091	2230.72	2231.87	F	Postdoc	s^df^na	-1	0	Well , I mean , you just have no idea .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1092	2231.87	2234.41	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean , if you 're getting a breath several times every minute ,
Bmr015.B.dialogueact1093	2234.56	2234.93	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1094	2234.92	2242.27	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and just simply the keystrokes it takes to negotiate , to put the boundaries in , to {disfmarker} to type it in , i it 's just a huge amount of time .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact1095	2239.95	2240.44	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1096	2240.54	2240.77	E	PhD	s^t1.%	-1	0	Oops .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1098	2242.26	2242.76	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	Wh - what {disfmarker}
Bmr015.C.dialogueact1097	2242.24	2242.49	C	PhD	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1099	2242.33	2243.59	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	And you wanna be sure it 's used ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1100	2243.59	2245.37	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and you wanna be sure it 's done as efficiently as possible ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1101	2245.37	2247.32	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and if it can be done automatically , that would be ideal .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1102	2247.82	2250.33	A	Professor	qh	+1	0	what if you put it in but didn't put the boundaries ?
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1103	2252.09	2252.86	F	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	Well , but {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1104	2254.42	2256.19	A	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	So you just know it 's between these other things ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1105	2254.43	2257.05	F	Postdoc	fg|s	-1	0	Well , OK . So now there 's {disfmarker} there 's another {disfmarker} another possibility
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1106	2256.19	2256.43	A	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1107	2257.05	2262.06	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	which is , um , the time boundaries could mark off words {comment} from nonwords .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1108	2262.87	2265.43	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And that would be extremely time - effective , if that 's sufficient .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1109	2266.15	2272.17	A	Professor	fg|s	+1	0	Yeah I mean I 'm think if it 's too {disfmarker} if it 's too hard for us to annotate the breaths per se , {vocalsound} we are gonna be building up models for these things
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1110	2272.17	2274.07	A	Professor	s	+1	0	and these things are somewhat self - aligning ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1111	2274.11	2282.23	A	Professor	s	+1	0	so if {disfmarker} so , {vocalsound} we {disfmarker} i i if we say there is some kind of a thing which we call a " breath " or a " breath - in " or " breath - out " , {vocalsound} the models will learn that sort of thing .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1112	2282.37	2288.03	A	Professor	s	+1	0	Uh , so {disfmarker} but you {disfmarker} but you do want them to point them at some region where {disfmarker} where the breaths really are .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1114	2288.85	2289.27	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1113	2288.37	2290.98	F	Postdoc	s^bk|s	-1	0	OK . But that would maybe include a pause as well ,
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1115	2289.13	2289.82	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	Well , there 's a there 's {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1116	2290.98	2296.39	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and that wouldn't be a problem to have it , uh , pause plus breath plus laugh plus sneeze ?
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1117	2292.55	2292.92	A	Professor	fg|%-	-1	0	Yeah , i
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1118	2294.11	2299.27	A	Professor	s	-1	0	You know there is {disfmarker} there 's this dynamic tension between {disfmarker} between marking absolutely everything , as you know ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1119	2299.27	2300.35	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1120	2300.46	2303.02	A	Professor	s	-1	0	marking just a little bit and counting on the statistical methods .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1121	2303.5	2305.15	A	Professor	s	-1	0	Basically the more we can mark the better .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1122	2305.58	2309.04	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But if there seems to be a lot of effort for a small amount of reward in some area ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1123	2309.04	2310.45	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and this might be one like this {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1124	2310.79	2314.62	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Although I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'd be interested to h get {disfmarker} get input from Liz and Andreas on this to see if they {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1125	2314.62	2319.18	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Cuz they 've - they 've got lots of experience with the breaths in {disfmarker} in , uh , uh , their transcripts .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact1127	2318.43	2319.81	B	Grad	qy^bu^d^j^rt	-1	0	They have lots of experience with breathing ?
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1126	2318.22	2318.44	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	I {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1128	2319.18	2319.56	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	Actually {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1129	2320.34	2321.97	A	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	Well , {vocalsound} yes they do ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1130	2321.97	2323.84	A	Professor	s	-1	0	but we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we can handle that without them here .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1131	2323.84	2325.2	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but , uh ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1132	2325.2	2326.45	A	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	you were gonna say something about {disfmarker}
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1133	2326.24	2330.66	G	PhD	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah , I {disfmarker} I think , um , one possible way that we could handle it is that ,
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1134	2331.21	2331.67	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1135	2332.25	2337.12	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	you know , as the transcribers are going through , and if they get a hunk of speech that they 're gonna transcribe ,
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1136	2338.47	2341.1	G	PhD	s	-1	0	u th they 're gonna transcribe it because there 's words in there or whatnot .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1137	2341.5	2345.12	G	PhD	s	-1	0	If there 's a breath in there , they could transcribe that .
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1138	2343.33	2343.56	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1140	2345.91	2346.08	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1139	2345.44	2346.21	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	That 's what they 've been doing .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1142	2346.69	2349.14	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So , within an overlap segment , they {disfmarker} they do this .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1141	2346.31	2346.49	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1143	2347.11	2347.3	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1144	2348.4	2356.22	G	PhD	fg|s^cs	-1	0	Right . But if there 's a big hunk of speech , let 's say on Morgan 's mike where he 's not talking at all , um , don't {disfmarker} don't worry about that .
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1145	2354.11	2354.25	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1146	2356.22	2360.43	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So what we 're saying is , there 's no guarantee that , um {disfmarker}
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1147	2361.05	2363.83	G	PhD	s	-1	0	So for the chunks that are transcribed , everything 's transcribed .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1148	2364.25	2367.55	G	PhD	s	-1	0	But outside of those boundaries , there could have been stuff that wasn't transcribed .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1149	2367.99	2372.07	G	PhD	s	-1	0	So you just {disfmarker} somebody can't rely on that data and say " that 's perfectly clean data " .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1150	2373.04	2374.31	G	PhD	qy	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker} do you see what I 'm saying ?
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1151	2374.38	2376.33	F	Postdoc	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yeah , you 're saying it 's {disfmarker} uncharted territory .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1152	2374.42	2379.61	G	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	So I would say don't tell them to transcribe anything that 's outside of a grouping of words .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1153	2378.03	2381.1	A	Professor	s^na	-1	0	That sounds like a reasonable {disfmarker} reasonable compromise .
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1154	2382.1	2387.98	E	PhD	fg|s	+1	0	Yeah , and that 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that quite co corresponds to the way I {disfmarker} I try to train the speech - nonspeech detector ,
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1155	2387.98	2392.06	E	PhD	s	-1	0	as I really try to {disfmarker} not to detect those breaths
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1156	2392.26	2398.28	E	PhD	s	-1	0	which are not within a speech chunk but with {disfmarker} which are just in {disfmarker} in a silence region .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1157	2398.69	2398.94	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1158	2398.91	2403.85	E	PhD	s	-1	0	And they {disfmarker} so they hopefully won't be marked in {disfmarker} in those channel - specific files .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1161	2405.42	2409.85	A	Professor	s	-1	0	u I {disfmarker} I wanted to comment a little more just for clarification about this business about the different purposes .
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1160	2405.12	2405.29	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1159	2405.08	2405.5	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	Yeah , so {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1162	2407.87	2408.21	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1163	2410.41	2412.84	A	Professor	s	-1	0	See , in a {disfmarker} in a way this is a really key point ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1164	2412.96	2415.54	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	that for speech recognition , uh , research ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1165	2416.63	2417.81	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh , um ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1166	2418.92	2420.52	A	Professor	s	-1	0	e a {disfmarker} it 's not just a minor part .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1167	2420.52	2433.39	A	Professor	s	+1	0	In fact , the {disfmarker} I think I would say the core thing that we 're trying to do is to recognize the actual , meaningful components in the midst of other things that are not meaningful .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1168	2433.82	2434.67	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So it 's critical {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1169	2435.01	2435.97	A	Professor	s^e	-1	0	it 's not just incidental
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1170	2435.97	2440.98	A	Professor	s	+1	0	it 's critical for us to get these other components that are not meaningful .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1171	2441.25	2443.57	A	Professor	s^df	+1	0	Because that 's what we 're trying to pull the other out of .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1172	2443.57	2444.24	A	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's our problem .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1173	2444.76	2445.83	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	If we had nothing {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1174	2444.8	2445.02	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1175	2446.29	2448.53	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	if we had only linguistically - relevant things {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1176	2448.54	2454.31	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	if {disfmarker} if we only had changes in the spectrum that were associated with words , with different spectral components ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1177	2454.85	2457.14	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and , uh , we {disfmarker} we didn't have noise ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1178	2457.14	2458.64	A	Professor	s	-1	0	we didn't have convolutional errors ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1179	2458.64	2461.62	A	Professor	s	-1	0	we didn't have extraneous , uh , behaviors , and so forth ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1180	2461.62	2462.86	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and {vocalsound} moving your head
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1181	2462.86	2463.99	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and all these sorts of things ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1182	2464.51	2468.88	A	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	then , actually speech recognition i i isn't that bad right now .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1183	2468.88	2469.41	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean you can
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1185	2469.82	2472.96	A	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	you know it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker} the technology 's come along pretty well .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact1184	2469.79	2470.2	C	PhD	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1186	2472.96	2479.09	A	Professor	s	-1	0	The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the reason we still complain about it is because is {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when you have more realistic conditions then {disfmarker} then things fall apart .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1187	2479.49	2479.99	F	Postdoc	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	OK , fair enough .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1188	2479.99	2486.42	F	Postdoc	qw	-1	0	I guess , um , I {disfmarker} uh , what I was wondering is what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} at what level does the breathing aspect enter into the problem ?
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1189	2486.52	2495.59	F	Postdoc	s^df.%--	-1	0	Because if it were likely that a PDA would be able to be built which would get rid of the breathing , so it wouldn't even have to be processed at thi at this computational le
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1190	2495.59	2497.97	F	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	well , let me see , it 'd have to be computationally processed to get rid of it ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1191	2497.97	2502.35	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	but if there were , uh , like likely on the frontier , a good breath extractor
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1192	2503.42	2505.21	F	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	then , um , and then you 'd have to {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1193	2504.19	2505.48	A	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	But that 's a research question ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1194	2505.77	2505.95	A	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	you know ?
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1195	2506.21	2506.5	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	And so {disfmarker}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1196	2506.31	2507.55	F	Postdoc	s^bk|s^df	-1	0	Yeah , well , see and that 's what I wouldn't know .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1197	2507.64	2507.79	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	that {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1198	2508.22	2508.9	A	Professor	s	-1	0	And we don't either .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1199	2508.9	2510.36	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean so {disfmarker} so the thing is it 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1200	2510.36	2512.61	A	Professor	s	-1	0	right now it 's just raw d it 's just data that we 're collecting ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1201	2512.61	2517.73	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and so {vocalsound} we don't wanna presuppose that people will be able to get rid of particular degradations
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1202	2517.73	2519.82	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because that 's actually the research that we 're trying to feed .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1204	2520.45	2524.33	A	Professor	s	-1	0	So , you know , an and maybe {disfmarker} maybe in five years it 'll work really well ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1203	2520.27	2520.42	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1205	2524.33	2526.94	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and it 'll only mess - up ten percent of the time ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1206	2526.94	2529.0	A	Professor	s	-1	0	but then we would still want to account for that ten percent ,
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1208	2529.0	2529.19	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	so .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1207	2528.96	2529.98	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I guess there 's another aspect
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1209	2529.98	2536.23	F	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	which is that as we 've improved our microphone technique , we have a lot less breath in the {disfmarker} in the more recent , uh , recordings ,
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1210	2536.41	2539.82	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	so it 's {disfmarker} in a way it 's an artifact that there 's so much on the {disfmarker} on the earlier ones .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1211	2537.1	2537.7	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1212	2540.38	2540.77	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1213	2540.94	2541.61	G	PhD	%--	-1	0	One of the {disfmarker}
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1214	2541.71	2542.93	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	um , just to add to this {disfmarker}
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1215	2542.93	2547.09	G	PhD	s	-1	0	one of the ways that we will be able to get rid of breath is by having models for them .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1216	2547.21	2548.64	G	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , that 's what a lot of people do nowadays .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1218	2548.66	2548.9	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact1217	2548.48	2548.78	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact1220	2549.13	2549.29	C	PhD	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1219	2548.95	2551.87	G	PhD	s	-1	0	And so in order to build the model you need to have some amount of it marked ,
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1221	2552.72	2554.02	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	so that you know where the boundaries are .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact1222	2553.33	2553.45	C	PhD	z	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1223	2554.42	2554.61	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1224	2554.86	2555.03	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1225	2555.42	2561.84	G	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , I don't think we need to worry a lot about breaths that are happening outside of a , you know , conversation .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1226	2561.9	2564.68	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	We don't have to go and search for them to {disfmarker} to mark them at all ,
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1227	2564.68	2570.57	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	but , I mean , if they 're there while they 're transcribing some hunk of words , I 'd say put them in if possible .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1228	2571.24	2574.11	F	Postdoc	s^bk|s	-1	0	OK , and it 's also the fact that they differ a lot from one channel to the other
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1229	2574.11	2575.89	F	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because of the way the microphone 's adjusted .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact1230	2574.9	2575.1	C	PhD	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1231	2575.98	2576.44	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1232	2580.09	2580.39	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1233	2581.41	2582.17	A	Professor	qy^rt^t^tc	-1	0	Should we do the digits ?
Bmr015.B.dialogueact1234	2582.27	2582.52	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr015.B.dialogueact1235	2966.7	2967.23	B	Grad	z	-1	0	OK .
Bmr015.C.dialogueact1236	2967.59	2968.06	C	PhD	z	-1	0	OK .
Bmr015.D.dialogueact1237	2968.21	2968.56	D	Grad	z	-1	0	Mmm . Alright .
