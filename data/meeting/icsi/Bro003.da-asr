Bro003.G.dialogueact199	764.419	769.662	G	PhD	s	-1	0	what what you want to do is first was number each uh task 
Bro003.G.dialogueact200	771.21	777.7	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so is that um did did you task they to that different task and finished ask so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact201	777.963	778.203	F	Professor	b	-1	0	ask so that's numbers 
Bro003.G.dialogueact202	778.027	784.777	G	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	that's numbers with uh stems i mean i mean you're on the truck strain on the past they don't 
Bro003.G.dialogueact203	786.856	799.483	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and then to see three times with your the road train home uh they come from the same language it's possible but we're we're using a more generic that today's which is funny could predict about on some 
Bro003.G.dialogueact204	799.483	802.381	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	on some 
Bro003.F.dialogueact206	806.017	811.327	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so we had talked i guess we had talked at one point about maybe the language id corpus 
Bro003.G.dialogueact205	805.997	806.537	G	PhD	%	-1	0	so so we had talked 
Bro003.F.dialogueact207	812.448	813.878	F	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	it's a possibility for that yeah but 
Bro003.G.dialogueact208	812.685	818.415	G	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	it's a possibility for that yeah but uh uh these corpus there's a coleman the close friends so 
Bro003.G.dialogueact209	819.015	822.645	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	uh quote friends language and identification what 
Bro003.G.dialogueact210	822.645	826.206	G	PhD	s	-1	0	what anyway these corporate saw one speech so um 
Bro003.G.dialogueact211	826.206	834.34	G	PhD	qw^d	-1	0	so um this could be uh a program or because uh 
Bro003.G.dialogueact212	834.34	839.99	G	PhD	s	-1	0	because uh the and uh speech type database on the telephone speech

Bro003.F.dialogueact246	908.344	911.004	F	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	i mean we're the band shouldn't be such an issue right because 
Bro003.F.dialogueact247	911.004	911.254	F	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	because 
Bro003.F.dialogueact248	911.254	914.434	F	Professor	s	-1	0	because this is down samples and and filtered right so it's just 
Bro003.F.dialogueact249	914.434	914.704	F	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right so it's just 
Bro003.F.dialogueact250	914.704	916.664	F	Professor	s	-1	0	right so it's just the fact that it's not telephone 
Bro003.F.dialogueact251	917.489	922.689	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and there are so many other differences between these different databases i mean some 
Bro003.F.dialogueact252	922.689	924.889	F	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean some of the stuff's recorded in the car and some 
Bro003.F.dialogueact253	924.889	925.459	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	the car and some of it's i mean there's there's 
Bro003.F.dialogueact254	925.459	927.519	F	Professor	s	-1	0	of it's i mean there's there's many different krisak differences so i'm not sure 
Bro003.F.dialogueact256	927.519	938.54	F	Professor	s^no	-1	0	so i'm not sure you know if we're going to include a bunch of car recordings in the in the training database i'm not sure if it's completely rules out for 
Bro003.G.dialogueact255	927.022	927.382	G	PhD	b	-1	0	so i'm not sure 
Bro003.F.dialogueact257	938.854	951.48	F	Professor	qy	-1	0	out for if we if our major goal is to have fanatic context and you figure that there's going to be a mismatch an acoustic conditions doesn't make it much worse too sort of had another mismatch if you were 
Bro003.G.dialogueact258	943.581	944.031	G	PhD	x	-1	0	and you figure that there's going to be 
Bro003.F.dialogueact259	952.196	959.75	F	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh i i guess the question is how important is it to forced to get multiple languages

Bro003.F.dialogueact267	979.68	982.93	F	Professor	qy^d	-1	0	so that's what you're thinking of using sort of the maltese equivalent of the multiple what yeah sort of meet anyone 
Bro003.G.dialogueact268	979.958	980.168	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	so that's what you're thinking of using sort what 
Bro003.G.dialogueact269	982.069	982.449	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	of the multiple yeah sort of meet anyone 
Bro003.G.dialogueact270	982.449	986.189	G	PhD	s^na^rt	-1	0	of the multiple and for the yeah sort of meet anyone cause we were thinking about using the street database but 
Bro003.F.dialogueact271	986.69	992.942	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and for the difference in another context too but this uh actually they just treated they just um generic the 
Bro003.G.dialogueact272	986.76	987.29	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	and for the difference in another but this 
Bro003.G.dialogueact273	989.956	993.626	G	PhD	h|s^rt	+1	1	too uh actually they just treated they just um generic the base so

Bro003.G.dialogueact275	994.032	1007.11	G	PhD	s^e	+1	1	for for uh eight i am which because the spanish french and it uh it it gets if well uh the kids training is that and also more generic and it doesn't 
Bro003.G.dialogueact276	1007.11	1009.56	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	well we also 
Bro003.F.dialogueact277	1009.7	1016.47	F	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	well we also have this broadcast news they were talking about taking off the disk which is this microphone data for yeah perhaps 
Bro003.G.dialogueact278	1014.4	1014.93	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	this microphone data 
Bro003.G.dialogueact279	1016.55	1019.13	G	PhD	s^bk|s^cs	+1	1	yeah perhaps yeah there's so that maybe we

Bro003.G.dialogueact291	1037.48	1046.27	G	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	yeah and perhaps um we were thinking that perhaps the across language issue is that the biggest issue whether you're retribution 
Bro003.G.dialogueact292	1046.27	1051.01	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	whether you're retribution that focus too much on that christian great stuff i mean 
Bro003.G.dialogueact293	1051.68	1056.38	G	PhD	s^cs^df	-1	0	i mean uh training training and that's on the language and this thing up for another language 
Bro003.F.dialogueact294	1052.36	1052.81	F	Professor	b	-1	0	uh training 
Bro003.F.dialogueact295	1058.57	1059.26	F	Professor	%-	-1	0	but that's press the most important issue as you're 
Bro003.G.dialogueact296	1058.59	1067.34	G	PhD	s^cs^rt	-1	0	but that's press the most important issue as you're on the two extremes on the i think languages but uh we generally that today's general databases 
Bro003.G.dialogueact297	1068.1	1077.25	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	uh it depends it depends it depends so that uh well the the guy was to get up a petition with what language can use then it cleaned up on that language or generic and that's but not trying 
Bro003.F.dialogueact298	1076.49	1079.68	F	Professor	fg|s^aap	-1	0	uh it depends it depends it depends how you mean using the net so if you're or generic and that's but not trying to 
Bro003.G.dialogueact299	1077.25	1078.31	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	it depends it depends how you mean using that's but not trying to 
Bro003.F.dialogueact300	1079.68	1083.94	F	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	the net so if you're talking about for producing these descriptive into features of time but you can't do 
Bro003.G.dialogueact301	1082.29	1082.7	G	PhD	b	-1	0	of time but 
Bro003.F.dialogueact302	1084.91	1089.8	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because because see what they're asking for is is a feature set 
Bro003.F.dialogueact303	1090.55	1090.8	F	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right and 
Bro003.F.dialogueact304	1090.87	1096.26	F	Professor	s	-1	0	right and so uh we were the ones who have been weird by by doing this training if we say 
Bro003.F.dialogueact306	1096.63	1101.33	F	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	if we say no you have to have a different features set for each language i think this is very very bad 
Bro003.G.dialogueact305	1096.48	1096.71	G	PhD	b	-1	0	if we say 
Bro003.C.dialogueact307	1101.48	1101.95	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro003.G.dialogueact309	1102.17	1102.65	G	PhD	s^t3	-1	0	so uh oh you think so 
Bro003.C.dialogueact311	1102.71	1103.03	C	Grad	s^t3.%-	-1	0	so uh oh yeah yeah i mean you think so 
Bro003.E.dialogueact310	1102.23	1102.51	E	PhD	%	-1	0	so uh oh you think so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact308	1102.12	1102.62	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	so uh oh you think so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact313	1102.87	1103.3	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	so uh oh yeah yeah i mean you think so 
Bro003.G.dialogueact312	1102.81	1102.98	G	PhD	b	-1	0	so uh oh you think so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact314	1103.47	1110.68	F	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah yeah i mean in principle i mean can sexually it's sort of like they want every uh well they want replacement for mel caster 
Bro003.G.dialogueact315	1106.13	1106.35	G	PhD	b	-1	0	can sexually it's 
Bro003.F.dialogueact316	1111.05	1113.01	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so i say okay this is the year two thousand we've got something much better 
Bro003.F.dialogueact317	1113.01	1114.84	F	Professor	s	-1	0	we've got something much better than outcast right it's 
Bro003.F.dialogueact318	1114.84	1116.07	F	Professor	s	-1	0	than outcast right it's you know gobbled look okay and so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact319	1116.38	1119.02	F	Professor	s	-1	0	okay and so we give them they got all the good teachers but he's got to go creatures 
Bro003.F.dialogueact320	1119.02	1121.72	F	Professor	s	-1	0	he's got to go creatures is supposed to be good friend of mine 
Bro003.G.dialogueact321	1121.93	1122.22	G	PhD	b	-1	0	of mine because you don't 
Bro003.F.dialogueact322	1122.67	1124.06	F	Professor	s^df	+1	1	because you don't know who's going to call and you know i mean so it's 
Bro003.F.dialogueact323	1124.06	1126.59	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and you know i mean so it's it's it's uh 
Bro003.F.dialogueact324	1127.32	1128.71	F	Professor	fh|qw	+1	1	uh how do you know what languages 
Bro003.F.dialogueact325	1129.86	1130.82	F	Professor	s	+1	1	so pick up the phone 
Bro003.F.dialogueact326	1131.43	1132.43	F	Professor	s	+1	1	so this is their image someone picks up but uh

Bro003.F.dialogueact329	1133.89	1135.57	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	the phone right and and he he picks up the yeah but do you get vacation 
Bro003.G.dialogueact330	1135.06	1136.74	G	PhD	fg|s.%-	-1	0	up the yeah but do you get vacation you see 
Bro003.G.dialogueact331	1137.17	1139.08	G	PhD	s	-1	0	there's target english but petition so is it 
Bro003.F.dialogueact333	1139.14	1139.86	F	Professor	fg	-1	0	so is it

Bro003.F.dialogueact334	1140.44	1141.01	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	but no you 
Bro003.F.dialogueact336	1141.34	1143.46	F	Professor	s	-1	0	but no you you you pick up the phone you talk 
Bro003.G.dialogueact335	1140.87	1141.05	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	but no you 
Bro003.F.dialogueact338	1143.93	1144.62	F	Professor	s	-1	0	phone you talk on the phone it ten 
Bro003.G.dialogueact337	1143.54	1143.84	G	PhD	s^bk^rt	-1	0	phone you talk 
Bro003.F.dialogueact339	1144.62	1145.82	F	Professor	s	-1	0	on the phone it ten features that 
Bro003.F.dialogueact340	1146.75	1147.03	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	okay so the phone doesn't 
Bro003.F.dialogueact341	1147.03	1151.2	F	Professor	s	+1	1	so the phone doesn't know what uh what what your languages yeah yeah if it's 
Bro003.G.dialogueact342	1149.61	1150.01	G	PhD	b	-1	0	what uh what what your languages yeah yeah 
Bro003.G.dialogueact343	1150.01	1150.08	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	what your languages yeah 
Bro003.G.dialogueact344	1150.29	1150.52	G	PhD	b	-1	0	what your languages yeah 
Bro003.G.dialogueact345	1151.64	1152.62	G	PhD	s^aap	-1	0	if it's in the phone but 
Bro003.G.dialogueact346	1152.62	1152.76	G	PhD	%--	-1	0	in the phone but 
Bro003.F.dialogueact348	1153.61	1154.97	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but that's the image that they have it they they could be that 
Bro003.G.dialogueact347	1153.2	1156.56	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	but that's the image that they have it could it they they could be that the service side 
Bro003.F.dialogueact350	1156.68	1157.16	F	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	it could be but that seems they have side 
Bro003.G.dialogueact349	1156.56	1158.75	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	it could be but that seems they have right so side 
Bro003.F.dialogueact351	1157.16	1158.11	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	be but that seems they have right so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact352	1158.45	1158.76	F	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact353	1159.04	1160.29	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	that's that's i mean one could 
Bro003.F.dialogueact354	1160.29	1164.71	F	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean one could argue all over the place about how things really will be in ten years 
Bro003.F.dialogueact355	1165.13	1179.08	F	Professor	s	+1	1	but the particular image that the cellular industry has right now is that it's distributed speech recognition where as the uh uh probably stick part and and semantics and so forth are all on the servers and you compute features that uh on the phone so that's 
Bro003.F.dialogueact356	1179.73	1181.48	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so that's that's what we're involved in might might 
Bro003.F.dialogueact357	1181.48	1184.34	F	Professor	s	+1	1	in might might or might not agree that that's the way it will be in ten years but that's 
Bro003.F.dialogueact358	1184.34	1187.08	F	Professor	s	+1	1	years but that's that's that's what they're asking for so so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact359	1187.47	1192.94	F	Professor	s	+1	1	so so i think that that the it is an important issue whether works cross language 
Bro003.F.dialogueact360	1193.34	1199.42	F	Professor	s	-1	0	now it's c. o g. i uh folks perspective right now they're probably that's not the biggest deal that 
Bro003.F.dialogueact361	1199.9	1205.07	F	Professor	s	-1	0	deal that the biggest deal is the um you know our acoustic environment mismatch and they may very 
Bro003.F.dialogueact362	1205.42	1206.68	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and they may very well be right but i 
Bro003.F.dialogueact363	1206.68	1210.91	F	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	well be right but i i was hoping we could just do a test and determine if that was true 
Bro003.F.dialogueact364	1211.31	1212.77	F	Professor	s	-1	0	that's true we don't need to worry so much maybe 
Bro003.F.dialogueact365	1212.77	1220.87	F	Professor	s	-1	0	worry so much maybe they we have a couple languages and the train sets and they can just enough rats uh that that is that the rest does matter 
Bro003.F.dialogueact366	1221.39	1232.62	F	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	the other thing is uh this notion of training to uh which i i guess they're starting to look it up there training to something more like articulate tory features 
Bro003.F.dialogueact367	1233.26	1240.7	F	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh if you have something that's just good for distinguishing different articulate very features that should just be good across you know range of languages 
Bro003.G.dialogueact368	1240.37	1240.61	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro003.F.dialogueact369	1240.93	1241.81	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro003.F.dialogueact370	1242.36	1245.44	F	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	yes i don't i know force fortunate i i see what you're coming where you're coming from i think but i think we can 
Bro003.F.dialogueact371	1245.44	1246.66	F	Professor	s	-1	0	i think but i think we can ignore 
Bro003.G.dialogueact372	1247.55	1253.21	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so we we really ask who do tests with uh riyadh coarse language i mean 
Bro003.G.dialogueact373	1253.21	1256.56	G	PhD	s^e^rt	-1	0	i mean for instance training on english and i think any time you know 
Bro003.G.dialogueact374	1256.56	1269.14	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	time you know oh we can train or has so can retrain and that um uh arranger languages and which to too dependent the to talk in english oh 
Bro003.C.dialogueact375	1266.5	1267.59	C	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	which to too dependent the 
Bro003.G.dialogueact376	1269.53	1269.94	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	oh 
Bro003.F.dialogueact377	1270.37	1270.65	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact378	1270.72	1271.7	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah so um 
Bro003.F.dialogueact379	1272.13	1274.05	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	there's there's uh this is complex 
Bro003.F.dialogueact380	1274.52	1275.37	F	Professor	s	-1	0	this is complex so ultimately 
Bro003.F.dialogueact381	1275.37	1282.72	F	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	so ultimately uh is this thing i think it doesn't fit within their image that she switch it's based on language 
Bro003.F.dialogueact383	1283.21	1287.54	F	Professor	qy	-1	0	now can you include uh that the target language 
Bro003.G.dialogueact382	1282.86	1283.05	G	PhD	b	-1	0	language now 
Bro003.F.dialogueact384	1288.2	1292.52	F	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	from a purist standpoint it be nice not too because 
Bro003.F.dialogueact385	1293.03	1295.02	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	then you can say when because shirley 
Bro003.F.dialogueact386	1295.25	1300.58	F	Professor	s	-1	0	because shirley someone who's going to say at some point okay so you put in the german and the finish 
Bro003.G.dialogueact387	1298.12	1298.72	G	PhD	b	-1	0	okay so you put 
Bro003.F.dialogueact388	1301.05	1305.94	F	Professor	fh|qw	-1	0	uh now what do you do uh when somebody has portuguese 
Bro003.F.dialogueact389	1306.45	1306.79	F	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro003.F.dialogueact390	1307.36	1315.66	F	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um and uh however you are it isn't actually a constraint in this evaluation 
Bro003.F.dialogueact391	1316.18	1324.18	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so i would say if it looks like there's a big difference to put it in then we make note of it and then we probably put in the other because we so many other 
Bro003.F.dialogueact392	1324.18	1331.96	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	other because we so many other problems in trying to get things to work well here that that you know it's not so bad as long as we we know that we say look we did do this 
Bro003.G.dialogueact393	1327.2	1327.66	G	PhD	%	-1	0	that that 
Bro003.A.dialogueact394	1332.62	1340.81	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	so ideally what you want to do is you want to with and without the target language and the training set for a wide range of languages and yeah pressing 
Bro003.F.dialogueact395	1332.74	1333.05	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	so ideally what you want to do 
Bro003.F.dialogueact396	1338.45	1338.73	F	Professor	b	-1	0	language and the training set yeah pressing 
Bro003.G.dialogueact397	1338.59	1339.23	G	PhD	s^am	-1	0	language and the training set for a wide range yeah pressing 
Bro003.G.dialogueact398	1339.23	1339.4	G	PhD	b	-1	0	for a wide range 
Bro003.A.dialogueact401	1340.98	1346.46	A	PhD	s	-1	0	of languages and that way you can say well you know we're going to build it for what we think are the most common ones but if 
Bro003.F.dialogueact400	1340.94	1341.26	F	Professor	b	-1	0	of languages and that way you can say well 
Bro003.G.dialogueact399	1340.85	1341.06	G	PhD	b	-1	0	of languages and that way you can say well 
Bro003.A.dialogueact402	1346.5	1352.27	A	PhD	s	-1	0	ones but if that somebody is it with a different language you know here's what you're like there's less likely to have yeah 
Bro003.F.dialogueact403	1352.88	1361.76	F	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	yeah because the truth is is that it's it's not like there are you know although there are thousands of languages uh from uh uh the point of your cellular companies aren't stairs 
Bro003.A.dialogueact405	1361.91	1362.12	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	aren't stairs yeah this fifty 
Bro003.F.dialogueact404	1361.84	1363.89	F	Professor	s	-1	0	aren't stairs yeah this fifty or something you know 
Bro003.F.dialogueact406	1363.88	1364.18	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	or something you know so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact407	1364.17	1364.47	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact408	1365.08	1370.96	F	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh and and they aren't you know the exception finish which i guess is pretty different from most most things 
Bro003.F.dialogueact409	1371.57	1376.85	F	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh it's it's uh most of them are like at least some of the others 
Bro003.F.dialogueact410	1377.16	1382.11	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so i guess the spanish is like italian 
Bro003.F.dialogueact411	1383.02	1386.57	F	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	it's fish is is is a little bit like on gary and supposedly right

Bro003.A.dialogueact510	1611.09	1620.67	A	PhD	s	+1	1	i i think you're doing this test because you want to determine whether or not uh having general speech performs as well as having specific speech that's right 
Bro003.C.dialogueact511	1620.57	1621.13	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	that's right well especially when you 
Bro003.F.dialogueact512	1621.39	1623.85	F	Professor	s^na	-1	0	well especially when you go over the different languages and again because 
Bro003.F.dialogueact513	1623.85	1628.47	F	Professor	s	-1	0	i was yeah and again because you would different languages have different words for different that just so it's

Bro003.A.dialogueact517	1629.04	1629.29	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so i was just wondering 
Bro003.A.dialogueact518	1629.29	1637.72	A	PhD	s	+1	1	so i was just wondering if the fact that commit using the hand able stuff from tenet might be confuse the results i 
Bro003.F.dialogueact519	1638.04	1638.96	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	i think it would 
Bro003.F.dialogueact520	1638.96	1641.47	F	Professor	s	-1	0	i think it would but but on the other hand they might be better 
Bro003.A.dialogueact521	1643.16	1646.4	A	PhD	s^bk|s^df	-1	0	but it's it's better it may be better because oh yeah but so probably isn't 
Bro003.F.dialogueact522	1645.21	1645.61	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	oh yeah but 
Bro003.F.dialogueact523	1645.75	1647.01	F	Professor	s	-1	0	oh yeah but so probably isn't

Bro003.F.dialogueact526	1648.99	1651.25	F	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean you i i i guess i'm trying to cavalier but i mean i think 
Bro003.F.dialogueact527	1651.25	1657.89	F	Professor	s	-1	0	but i mean i think the point is you have uh a bunch of labels and and their hand and uh and marked 
Bro003.F.dialogueact528	1658.46	1661.09	F	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh i guess actually and it was not entirely him it was automatically first 
Bro003.F.dialogueact529	1661.09	1663.61	F	Professor	s	-1	0	was automatically first then and and corrected but 
Bro003.A.dialogueact531	1663.86	1664.89	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	corrected but but um 
Bro003.F.dialogueact530	1663.75	1671.65	F	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	corrected but but um uh it it it might be a better source 
Bro003.F.dialogueact532	1672.15	1672.83	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so it's it you're

Bro003.C.dialogueact654	1918.99	1919.08	C	Grad	%--	-1	0	basically he's other 
Bro003.C.dialogueact655	1919.08	1922.38	C	Grad	s	+1	1	basically the the cube we'll have three dimensions first other 
Bro003.F.dialogueact653	1918.64	1919.46	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	basically he's other 
Bro003.C.dialogueact656	1922.68	1926.56	C	Grad	s^e	+1	1	first i mentioned is uh the features that we 
Bro003.C.dialogueact657	1928.32	1934.41	C	Grad	s^e^rt	+1	1	and the second dimension um is the training corpus 
Bro003.C.dialogueact658	1935.56	1938.39	C	Grad	s^e	+1	1	and that's uh training on that discriminate knowing that

Bro003.C.dialogueact661	1942.69	1945.33	C	Grad	s^e.%-	-1	0	the last dimension happens yeah again yes so the 
Bro003.F.dialogueact662	1944.82	1945.44	F	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	happens yeah again yes so the 
Bro003.F.dialogueact663	1945.44	1951.31	F	Professor	s^bk|s^bu	-1	0	again yes so the the training for h. t. cage is always that's always set up for the individual test right that there's some training 
Bro003.F.dialogueact664	1951.31	1951.48	F	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	right that there's some training 
Bro003.F.dialogueact665	1951.48	1953.35	F	Professor	s	-1	0	right that there's some training didn't intestines that's different 
Bro003.F.dialogueact666	1953.35	1954.71	F	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	right right this that's different than this yeah 
Bro003.C.dialogueact667	1954.27	1955.0	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right right this is this is than this yeah 
Bro003.C.dialogueact668	1955.0	1959.03	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	is this is for 
Bro003.C.dialogueact669	1960.73	1967.21	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and at the training for the h. k. models it's always six four whatever language or testing

Bro003.C.dialogueact671	1968.83	1970.78	C	Grad	s	+1	1	and there's the testing corpus 
Bro003.C.dialogueact672	1978.29	1984.56	C	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	so then i think it's probably instructed to go and and and show you the features that we were talking about

Bro003.C.dialogueact887	2364.37	2369.29	C	Grad	fh|s^bu	-1	0	um i don't think we were given d. um the unseen noise conditions

Bro003.F.dialogueact889	2370.53	2382.47	F	Professor	s^arp	-1	0	i think they were saying was that um for this next test there's going to be some of the cases where they have the same type of noises you were given before hand in some cases where you're not 
Bro003.C.dialogueact890	2371.59	2371.75	C	Grad	%	-1	0	were saying was that 
Bro003.C.dialogueact891	2381.03	2381.57	C	Grad	b	-1	0	in some cases where

Bro003.F.dialogueact894	2384.23	2391.67	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so presumably that'll be part of the topic of analysis of the the test results is how well you do when it's matching noise and how we do it 
Bro003.C.dialogueact895	2392.78	2393.14	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	i think that's right 
Bro003.F.dialogueact896	2392.89	2393.6	F	Professor	s	-1	0	i think that's right 
Bro003.C.dialogueact897	2394.14	2398.46	C	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	so i guess we can't train on and uh and seen noise conditions well it's not 
Bro003.F.dialogueact898	2398.59	2400.33	F	Professor	s^na	-1	0	well it's not it's not seen yeah

Bro003.F.dialogueact903	2406.03	2414.03	F	Professor	s	-1	0	mean it it it does seem to me that a lot of times when you train with something is at least a little bit noisy it can it can help you out in other kinds of times even if it's not matching 
Bro003.F.dialogueact904	2414.03	2415.26	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	even if it's not matching just because 
Bro003.F.dialogueact905	2415.26	2419.31	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	just because there's some more variance built into things but but 
Bro003.F.dialogueact906	2419.31	2420.52	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	but but uh 
Bro003.G.dialogueact907	2419.42	2420.16	G	PhD	b	-1	0	but but uh 
Bro003.F.dialogueact908	2421.31	2426.94	F	Professor	s	-1	0	exactly how well it work well dependent on how near it is too much yeah

Bro003.F.dialogueact1072	2711.18	2712.21	F	Professor	s	-1	0	i think it's more the memory 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1073	2713.14	2718.44	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	uh and expensive cellphones except expensive hand handheld and so forth are going to have lots and 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1074	2719.15	2724.88	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	so it's just that uh people see the the cheap cellphones as being still the biggest market

Bro003.F.dialogueact1083	2742.87	2744.52	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	trainings because these are all trained individual 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1084	2746.3	2746.7	F	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1085	2746.7	2747.41	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	so uh if you 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1086	2747.41	2758.56	F	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	uh if you have all these nets trained someplace then uh you ken their outputs and do the kill transformation and so forth and and

Bro003.F.dialogueact1267	3054.37	3055.43	F	Professor	s	-1	0	it is we we we do a problem that we have 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1268	3055.43	3057.39	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	a problem that we have very limited time 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1269	3058.38	3058.6	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	you know so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1270	3058.6	3065.94	F	Professor	s	+1	1	you know so it's very limited time we actually have really quite a quite a bit of competition will resource available if 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1271	3065.94	3069.54	F	Professor	s^df	+1	1	available if you you know again look across the institute now little things being used 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1272	3070.57	3071.52	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	and uh on the 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1273	3071.81	3086.4	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh on the other hand almost anything that really is you know is is new were saying well let's look at like refine before about uh uh voice and voice silenced detection features unless it's i think it's great 
Bro003.E.dialogueact1274	3077.7	3077.94	E	PhD	b	-1	0	were saying 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1275	3086.45	3087.93	F	Professor	s	-1	0	it's i think it's great thing to go too 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1276	3088.4	3097.99	F	Professor	s	-1	0	if it's new then we have this development and and and learning process to to to go through on top of just the uh all all the work so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1277	3097.99	3099.5	F	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	all all the work so i i don't see how would do it so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1278	3099.96	3103.5	F	Professor	s	-1	0	would do it so i like about this is basically it listed all the things that we already know how to do 
Bro003.E.dialogueact1280	3104.59	3104.79	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and and all 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1279	3104.48	3107.71	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and and all the kinds of data that we at this point already have 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1281	3108.93	3112.89	F	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and uh you just saying let's look at the outer product of all these things 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1282	3113.42	3114.88	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and see if we can calculate 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1283	3115.08	3117.74	F	Professor	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	it in my in my knee interpreting this correctly is sort 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1284	3117.74	3120.51	F	Professor	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	correctly is sort of but what you're thinking of doing the short term

Bro003.F.dialogueact1336	3278.15	3280.45	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	it's it j. ross is more complicated 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1337	3281.07	3290.63	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	it's it's uh instead of doing roster with a log you doing roster with analog like function that varies depending on it j. parameter 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1338	3291.36	3294.5	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	uh which is supposed to be sensitive to the amount of noise there is so sort 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1339	3294.89	3300.67	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	there is so sort of like the right transformation to do the filtering in is dependent on how much nicer is 
Bro003.E.dialogueact1340	3298.3	3298.6	E	PhD	b	-1	0	is dependent 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1341	3301.14	3302.9	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and sunday rossi tend to do that 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1342	3303.39	3304.26	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so complicated because once you do 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1343	3304.26	3307.39	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because once you do that you end up in some funny domain and they end 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1344	3307.39	3310.45	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	and they end up having to do a transformation afterwards which 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1345	3311.0	3312.62	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	requires some tables and 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1346	3312.74	3313.69	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	and uh 
Bro003.E.dialogueact1348	3314.3	3314.92	E	PhD	b	-1	0	so it's 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1347	3314.28	3316.72	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so it's it's it's a little messier 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1349	3317.33	3319.1	F	Professor	s	-1	0	uh there's more ways that can go wrong uh

Bro003.F.dialogueact1419	3493.07	3495.79	F	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	such as usual kind of sometimes say housekeeping right

Bro003.F.dialogueact1423	3499.48	3507.8	F	Professor	s	+1	2	so it seems like there's there's some peculiarities of the uh of each of these dimensions that are getting sorted out

Bro003.F.dialogueact1445	3566.39	3568.17	F	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	no i'm just saying i'm just thinking like loops right and so you 
Bro003.C.dialogueact1448	3568.48	3568.84	C	Grad	b	-1	0	right and so you 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1446	3568.17	3568.47	F	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	right and so you 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1447	3568.47	3573.45	F	Professor	s	-1	0	right and so you know if you had three knesset loops that your choice of this choice for this choice for that right and you're going 
Bro003.C.dialogueact1449	3573.21	3573.46	C	Grad	b	-1	0	for that right and you're going 
Bro003.C.dialogueact1452	3573.93	3574.74	C	Grad	b	-1	0	for that right and you're going through the all that that's 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1450	3573.45	3573.72	F	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	for that right and you're going 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1451	3573.72	3574.69	F	Professor	s	-1	0	for that right and you're going through the all that that's 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1453	3574.69	3575.57	F	Professor	s	-1	0	through the all that that's what i'm 
Bro003.C.dialogueact1454	3575.58	3575.95	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	what i'm 
Bro003.C.dialogueact1455	3576.17	3576.38	C	Grad	s^aa^r	-1	0	and uh 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1456	3576.5	3603.05	F	Professor	fh|s	+1	4	and uh the thing is that once you get a better handle on how much you can realistically too concurrently a different machines difference person so forth uh and you see how long it takes someone machine and so forth you stand back from and say okay if we look at all these combinations were time about combinations combination so forth probably find you can't do it okay 
Bro003.C.dialogueact1457	3599.58	3599.98	C	Grad	b	-1	0	combination 
Bro003.C.dialogueact1458	3603.33	3603.66	C	Grad	b	-1	0	okay 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1459	3603.86	3604.1	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay so then at that point 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1460	3604.1	3608.52	F	Professor	s^co	+1	2	so then at that point uh we should sort out which ones we throw away which are the 
Bro003.C.dialogueact1462	3608.8	3609.18	C	Grad	b	-1	0	away which are the combinations crosses 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1461	3608.63	3611.59	F	Professor	s^e	+1	2	away which are the combinations crosses what are the most likely ones and 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1463	3611.59	3611.77	F	Professor	%--	-1	0	ones and 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1464	3612.36	3613.29	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	and uh i still we 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1465	3613.54	3614.97	F	Professor	s	-1	0	i still we could do a lot of i money 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1466	3614.97	3617.38	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	could do a lot of i money wouldn't surprise me if we could do a hundred of them or something probably probably 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1467	3617.57	3621.33	F	Professor	s	-1	0	probably probably would include all the combinations are actually talking about thousands of them or something and that's 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1468	3621.33	3623.26	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	and that's probably more than we can do uh 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1469	3623.47	3623.92	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1470	3624.3	3625.19	F	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	but hundred is a lot 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1471	3626.16	3627.99	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro003.F.dialogueact1473	3631.8	3632.05	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	and the 
Bro003.C.dialogueact1474	3632.3	3632.51	C	Grad	b	-1	0	and the 
Bro003.C.dialogueact1475	3632.75	3635.38	C	Grad	s^rt^tc	-1	0	and the second thing was about scratch space and keep sending 
Bro003.C.dialogueact1476	3635.51	3641.89	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and keep sending you know about scratch space for for people to work on and 
Bro003.C.dialogueact1477	3641.89	3646.71	C	Grad	s	-1	0	to work on and i know that uh defines working from a and t. machine so 
Bro003.C.dialogueact1478	3646.71	3649.8	C	Grad	s	-1	0	machine so his his home directory exists somewhere else stuff is somewhere else yeah 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1479	3647.98	3649.18	F	Professor	s^2	-1	0	his his home directory exists somewhere else stuff is somewhere else yeah 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1480	3649.18	3649.47	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	somewhere else yeah 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1481	3650.5	3650.67	F	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah i mean my 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1482	3650.67	3651.45	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah i mean my point i i went 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1483	3651.45	3652.74	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	point i i went 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1484	3653.13	3653.35	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah thanks bring it back 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1485	3653.35	3654.38	F	Professor	s^ft	-1	0	yeah thanks bring it back to my that 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1486	3654.38	3658.93	F	Professor	s	-1	0	to my that i want to clarify my point about that that that are repeated has his 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1487	3659.45	3659.88	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1488	3661.12	3664.78	F	Professor	s	+1	1	we're over the next year or two we're going to be upgrading the networks in this place 
Bro003.C.dialogueact1489	3665.02	3665.3	C	Grad	b	-1	0	right now they're still 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1490	3665.12	3668.13	F	Professor	s	+1	1	right now they're still all time pretty much all ten negative line and we have reached 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1491	3668.13	3671.49	F	Professor	s	+1	1	and we have reached that does the machines are getting faster and faster so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1492	3672.08	3678.73	F	Professor	s	+1	1	it actually has reached the point where it's a significant drag on the time for something to move the for one place to another 
Bro003.C.dialogueact1493	3678.94	3679.33	C	Grad	b	-1	0	to another so you 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1494	3679.33	3694.17	F	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so you you don't especially something with repetitive complication you're going over multiple times you do you don't want to the the data that you're working on distant from where it's being where the competitions be done if you can help 
Bro003.C.dialogueact1495	3694.84	3695.3	C	Grad	b	-1	0	uh 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1496	3695.38	3695.95	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1497	3696.67	3701.67	F	Professor	s	-1	0	now we are getting more disk for the the central file server 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1498	3702.57	3707.65	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	since it's not a competition server which seem to be a contradiction to what i just said 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1499	3708.04	3715.83	F	Professor	s	-1	0	but the idea is that uh suppose you're working with this big bunch of different multi multi lingual databases 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1500	3716.69	3717.17	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	you put them 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1501	3717.64	3720.39	F	Professor	s	-1	0	you put them all in the central that's in central files server then 
Bro003.C.dialogueact1502	3720.27	3720.68	C	Grad	b	-1	0	server then 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1503	3720.96	3729.39	F	Professor	s	-1	0	server then when you're working with something and accessing it many times you copied a piece of that you're working with over to some places cause for the competition is and do all the work there 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1504	3729.39	3734.53	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	there and that way you you won't have uh the network you won't be clocking in at work for yourself and others 
Bro003.C.dialogueact1505	3735.24	3735.43	C	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro003.F.dialogueact1506	3735.46	3736.06	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1507	3736.75	3739.3	F	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	so uh it's going to take us 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1508	3740.35	3744.34	F	Professor	s	-1	0	me too late for this precise crunch right now but uh 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1509	3744.34	3744.96	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	now but uh 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1510	3745.53	3746.06	F	Professor	%--	-1	0	we're uh it's going to take 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1511	3746.06	3746.61	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh it's going to take 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1512	3746.61	3753.23	F	Professor	s	+1	1	uh it's going to take a couple weeks at least to get amount of disk be beginning we're actually going to get uh 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1513	3753.38	3759.38	F	Professor	s^e	+1	1	uh for more uh thirty six gigabyte 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1514	3760.08	3762.55	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh put them on another another described rent a space 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1515	3762.55	3764.81	F	Professor	s	-1	0	described rent a space and that this crack that we have for getting 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1516	3764.81	3772.91	F	Professor	s	-1	0	that we have for getting another just cracking for more drives to share between primarily this project in the meetings

Bro003.F.dialogueact1518	3777.09	3778.36	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh we've 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1519	3779.04	3784.76	F	Professor	s	-1	0	put another i guess is another eighteen gigabytes that's that's in there now to help us with the media crunch 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1520	3785.68	3786.83	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	but uh 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1521	3787.16	3788.27	F	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	so i don't

Bro003.F.dialogueact1570	3864.18	3866.62	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and i'll be the one who says okay spending money 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1571	3868.78	3869.69	F	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	which i mean is these 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1572	3869.79	3875.66	F	Professor	s	-1	0	is these days uh if you got much crash space it doesn't increase the need for backup 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1573	3876.15	3879.73	F	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	i think it's not that they could and the 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1574	3879.73	3882.25	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	that they could and the the disks themselves and not that expensive

Bro003.A.dialogueact1576	3884.66	3891.99	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	well you can do when you're on that machine is uh just go to the slash scratch directory and do a d. f. minus k.

Bro003.A.dialogueact1579	3896.08	3897.62	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but wasn't 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1580	3897.87	3898.79	F	Professor	qy^bu.%--	-1	0	but wasn't it uh i think 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1581	3898.79	3904.77	F	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	it uh i think dave was saying that he preferred people didn't put stuff and slash scratches smart 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1582	3904.77	3907.95	F	Professor	s^bu.%--	-1	0	well there's scratches smart putting and x. a. or x. p.

Bro003.A.dialogueact1585	3911.29	3911.58	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right so 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1586	3911.95	3916.82	A	PhD	s	-1	0	right so there's the flashbacks whatever desks and then they're slash scratch 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1587	3917.5	3920.97	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	both of those two kinds are not back that 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1588	3921.45	3925.59	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and if it's called slash scratch it means it's probably an internal but to the machine 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1589	3926.22	3926.61	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro003.A.dialogueact1590	3927.67	3940.91	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and so that's the kind of thing where like if um if you don't have an m. t. v. have a uh uh unix workstation and they attach an external desk it'll be called slash x. something uh if it's not backed up and 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1591	3940.91	3944.17	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	it's not backed up and all these flashes be something if it is backed up if it's 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1592	3944.7	3948.16	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	up if it's inside the machine on the desk it's called i scratch but the problem 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1593	3948.62	3952.23	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but the problem is if you ever get a new machine they take your machine away it's easy to unhook 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1594	3952.23	3954.2	A	PhD	s	-1	0	away it's easy to unhook the external desks put them back 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1595	3954.7	3956.31	A	PhD	s	-1	0	put them back on the new machine but then you're slash 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1596	3956.31	3957.83	A	PhD	s	-1	0	machine but then you're slash scratches gone 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1597	3958.36	3962.87	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so you don't want to put anything in flash scratched you want to keep around for a long period of time 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1598	3963.35	3970.12	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but it's it's a copy of save some is it's on the server you can put it on flash scratch because um 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1599	3970.28	3972.55	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because um personal not backed up and second it 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1600	3972.55	3975.56	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	backed up and second it doesn't matter if that machine disappears and you get a new machine because you just read 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1601	3975.56	3977.05	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	new machine because you just read copy slash so that that's what i was 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1602	3977.05	3988.21	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	so that that's what i was saying you could check slash scratch on those on on um mustard and and that may to see uh if there's space that you could use there you could also use 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1603	3985.66	3986.09	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	to see uh if there's 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1604	3988.42	3993.02	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	you could also use slash x. whatever discs on mustard and that may yeah 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1605	3992.68	3993.25	G	PhD	b	-1	0	mustard and that may yeah 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1606	3994.04	3994.62	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro003.A.dialogueact1607	3996.36	3996.51	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah when we do 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1608	3996.51	3997.41	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah when we do have i mean 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1609	3997.76	3998.12	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	have i mean yeah so seed 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1610	3998.37	3998.58	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah so seed 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1611	3998.58	3999.24	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	yeah so seed it's better 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1612	3999.61	4006.51	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	it's better to have things local if you're going to run over them right so so especially if you're 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1613	4005.58	4005.79	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right so so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1614	4005.79	4020.95	F	Professor	s	-1	0	right so so especially if you're right if you're if you're taking some piece of the training corpus which usually resides and we're trucks putting it on uh um thee uh file server yeah it's fine it's not backed up 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1615	4021.29	4026.05	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because it gets wiped out or something is that company the so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1616	4026.05	4026.2	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro003.A.dialogueact1617	4026.56	4027.02	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro003.A.dialogueact1620	4028.9	4033.07	A	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	yeah so one of the things that i need to i started looking at is just the perfect 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1621	4033.28	4035.4	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	is just the perfect and talk about this 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1622	4035.35	4035.58	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro003.A.dialogueact1623	4036.21	4038.4	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i started looking at um this distaste and david 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1624	4038.43	4044.62	A	PhD	s	+1	2	distaste and david um put uh do um thrive on the habit it's an next desk which means it's 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1625	4044.62	4045.8	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	desk which means it's not backed up so 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1626	4045.8	4046.16	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	not backed up so um 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1627	4046.71	4060.05	A	PhD	fh|s	+1	2	um i've been going through and copying data that is some kind of corpus stuff usually that that was got on a c. d. rom or something on to that need is to free up space on other disks and 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1628	4060.75	4068.07	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and um so far um i've copied a couple of carmen databases over there we haven't to them 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1629	4068.23	4072.45	A	PhD	s	+1	2	we haven't to them off of slash p. c. disk that they're on right now now 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1630	4072.93	4073.34	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	now 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1631	4074.41	4083.89	A	PhD	s^cs	+1	2	uh but we i would like to go through sit down with you about some of these other ones and see if we can move them onto this new disc also 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1633	4084.21	4085.71	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	there's a lot more there it'll yeah like 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1632	4084.11	4084.98	G	PhD	s^aa	+1	2	there's a lot more yeah like 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1634	4085.71	4088.49	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	there it'll free up more space for doing experiments and things 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1635	4089.21	4092.99	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so anything that that you don't need backed up we can put on this new did 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1636	4093.62	4102.83	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	in you're creating files and things that you're going to need you probably want to have those on a disk that's backed up 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1637	4102.83	4103.32	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro003.A.dialogueact1638	4104.08	4104.46	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro003.A.dialogueact1639	4105.11	4106.87	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so far i've copied a couple things but i haven't 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1640	4106.87	4111.89	A	PhD	s	-1	0	a couple things but i haven't deleted anything off of the old this to make 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1641	4112.52	4112.87	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro003.A.dialogueact1642	4113.66	4116.62	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and i haven't looked at the uh the roar stuff 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1643	4117.02	4118.11	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	except for the spanish so 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1644	4118.82	4124.05	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	so i guess i'll need to yeah 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1645	4123.24	4123.8	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1646	4127.3	4127.59	F	Professor	fg	-1	0	um yeah 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1647	4127.86	4128.04	F	Professor	fg	-1	0	um yeah i i just another 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1648	4128.04	4128.56	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i i just another 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1649	4128.56	4133.36	F	Professor	qw	+1	1	i i just another question occurred to me is is what were you folks to do about normalization 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1650	4136.45	4138.01	G	PhD	h	-1	0	uh um we were thinking 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1651	4138.47	4142.17	G	PhD	s	+1	1	we were thinking about using this system i think need for old experiments 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1652	4143.19	4144.01	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	um so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1653	4144.06	4145.13	F	Professor	qw^bu^d	-1	0	so but 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1654	4144.87	4145.43	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	so but 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1655	4145.51	4145.66	G	PhD	%--	-1	0	but 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1656	4147.0	4147.76	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro003.G.dialogueact1657	4148.27	4149.89	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so that could be another that mention but 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1658	4149.89	4159.32	G	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	another that mention but we think press can use uh the best uh um no my to keep a genius using so we 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1659	4159.32	4162.83	G	PhD	s	+1	1	so we army too that they used the animal 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1660	4161.49	4163.66	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	yeah i think it's army too that they used the animal 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1661	4163.54	4163.66	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah i think it's 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1662	4163.66	4164.57	F	Professor	s^ba^na	-1	0	yeah i think it's a good idea i mean it's 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1663	4163.817	4166.223	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	yeah i think it's a good idea i mean it's it we we seem to have enough to as 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1664	4164.57	4167.43	F	Professor	s^df	+1	1	a good idea i mean it's it we we seem to have enough to as it is so probably 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1665	4167.43	4169.77	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it is so probably if we take their probably 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1666	4167.48	4168.64	G	PhD	b	-1	0	it is so probably if we 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1667	4169.84	4171.71	F	Professor	s	-1	0	take their probably down nine line normalization because 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1668	4171.7	4177.09	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because then it it's if we do anything else we're going to end up having to do online normalization too so we may as well just do 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1669	4177.09	4179.22	F	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so we may as well just do online normalization 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1670	4177.34	4178.0	G	PhD	b	-1	0	so we may as well just do online normalization 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1671	4180.19	4180.54	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro003.F.dialogueact1672	4181.44	4183.74	F	Professor	s	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro003.F.dialogueact1675	4187.22	4187.88	F	Professor	%--	-1	0	so i guess yeah 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1676	4187.88	4189.07	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so i guess yeah that's the other topic 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1677	4189.93	4195.98	F	Professor	s	+1	1	like maybe we were re there are almost there uh is uh goals for the for next week's meeting 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1678	4196.75	4203.9	F	Professor	s	+1	1	it seems to me that we want to do is flesh out what you put on the board here 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1679	4204.56	4205.19	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro003.F.dialogueact1680	4206.51	4210.4	F	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	okay to be someone visual oh that 
Bro003.C.dialogueact1681	4210.0	4210.25	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	that 
Bro003.C.dialogueact1682	4211.26	4212.54	C	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	like it's like a like uh so even say what we're doing yeah 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1683	4211.28	4211.52	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	like it's like a uh so even 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1684	4211.52	4212.95	F	Professor	s^df	+1	1	like it's like a like uh so even say what we're doing yeah 
Bro003.C.dialogueact1686	4213.39	4213.62	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	and 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1685	4212.95	4213.23	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	like say what we're doing yeah and 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1687	4213.75	4239.47	F	Professor	s^cs	+1	2	and um also if you have sorted out um this information about how long it roughly how long it takes to do i'm white and you know what we can how many of these trainings uh and testings and so forth we can realistically do big goals of going there next week could be too to actually settle on which is them we're going to do 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1688	4240.83	4244.35	F	Professor	fh|s^co	+1	2	and come back we can charging and do 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1689	4246.3	4246.76	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro003.F.dialogueact1690	4248.33	4249.39	F	Professor	qo.%--	-1	0	anything else that i 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1691	4249.99	4255.48	F	Professor	s	-1	0	that i actually start out this this field trip start off with with uh stuff talking phoenix so you mean you 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1692	4255.48	4257.94	F	Professor	s	-1	0	phoenix so you mean you may have had other girls uh are going up 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1693	4258.09	4262.46	F	Professor	qo^d^rt	-1	0	than anything else you can think of p. should think about accomplishing i'm just 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1694	4262.63	4265.87	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	i'm just saying this because maybe there's things we need to do in preparation 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1695	4269.67	4271.71	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	well i think basically it's just uh 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1696	4271.71	4272.29	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	just uh yeah 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1697	4273.56	4273.82	F	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro003.F.dialogueact1698	4276.62	4276.86	F	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro003.F.dialogueact1701	4281.1	4292.4	F	Professor	s^t^tc	+1	1	and uh and the the other the the last topic i had here was uh they've signed off for two do something and this and he's doing 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1702	4292.4	4294.92	F	Professor	s^df	+1	1	and this and he's doing he's working in other things 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1703	4295.54	4297.34	F	Professor	s^e	+1	1	but to to do something and this project so the question 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1704	4297.34	4302.02	F	Professor	qw	+1	1	so the question is where where could we uh uh most shoes they sell 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1705	4311.31	4311.87	G	PhD	h	-1	0	um yeah 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1706	4311.87	4312.41	G	PhD	h	-1	0	um yeah i was 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1707	4312.81	4320.63	G	PhD	s	-1	0	i was thinking perhaps if um additionally to all these experiments with is that really research 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1708	4321.42	4324.09	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	but i mean it's running programs 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1709	4322.65	4322.87	F	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro003.G.dialogueact1710	4324.09	4340.58	G	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	um trying to um have a closer look at uh perhaps to um speech uh nice depiction all uh it's home and voice on detection 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1711	4341.1	4347.1	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	which could be important and if one nice thing 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1712	4345.4	4348.44	A	PhD	s	-1	0	if one nice thing 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1713	4350.11	4358.78	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because the you know the thing that said no was talking about with the label labeling the database that to the noise and stuff but 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1714	4358.88	4362.16	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	the noise and stuff but that that really throws things off you know 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1715	4362.85	4367.04	A	PhD	s	-1	0	you know having the noise all of a sudden you're speech detector i mean did 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1716	4367.6	4368.9	A	PhD	s^bsc.%--	-1	0	i mean did 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1717	4370.03	4370.43	A	PhD	qw	-1	0	it was it was happening 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1719	4370.43	4371.38	A	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	it was it was happening with the thing was running 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1718	4370.35	4370.67	F	Professor	b	-1	0	it was it was happening 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1720	4371.38	4373.48	A	PhD	s	-1	0	with the thing was running through these models very quickly was getting 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1721	4373.48	4377.22	A	PhD	s	-1	0	quickly was getting lots of uh uh and searching is what it was 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1722	4378.43	4379.54	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and his recognition the only 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1723	4379.77	4380.87	F	Professor	s^nd.%--	-1	0	the only problem i maybe 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1724	4380.87	4381.86	F	Professor	s^am	-1	0	problem i maybe that's right thing the only 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1725	4381.86	4387.74	F	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	that's right thing the only problem i have with it is exactly the same reason why used to be a good thing to do 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1726	4388.2	4389.62	F	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	um i i think that 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1727	4391.26	4392.34	F	Professor	s^co	+1	1	fall back to the but i think 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1728	4392.73	4399.49	F	Professor	s^co.%--	+1	1	but i think the first responsibility sort of to figure out if there's something that uh an additional 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1729	4402.19	4402.73	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh that's 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1730	4402.99	4404.4	F	Professor	s^ba^t3	-1	0	uh that's good thing rooms and like 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1731	4404.53	4404.76	F	Professor	s^co^t3	-1	0	and like 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1732	4404.85	4405.05	F	Professor	s^ba^t3	-1	0	and like 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1733	4405.58	4405.95	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro003.F.dialogueact1734	4407.46	4408.47	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1735	4409.96	4414.71	F	Professor	s	+1	1	what an additional clever person could help with when we really a crutch for time 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1736	4415.94	4416.15	F	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	because stays can be around 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1737	4416.15	4417.87	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because stays can be around for a long time 
Bro003.E.dialogueact1739	4418.7	4419.04	E	PhD	b	-1	0	he used to be here for years 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1738	4418.29	4418.59	F	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	he used 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1740	4418.71	4420.02	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	he used to be here for years and so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1742	4420.6	4421.81	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	and so um 
Bro003.G.dialogueact1741	4420.56	4420.76	G	PhD	b	-1	0	and so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1743	4422.21	4426.44	F	Professor	s	-1	0	over years if he's if he's interested in you know voice voice silence he could do a lot but if they're 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1744	4426.44	4434.39	F	Professor	s	-1	0	do a lot but if they're if in fact there's something else he could be doing but us when we're we're sort of uh strapped for time 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1745	4434.82	4445.41	F	Professor	s	-1	0	to know with the holidays in the middle to to get a lot done if 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1746	4445.91	4448.7	F	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	done if can think of something some piece of this that's going to 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1747	4449.48	4459.49	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	the very fact it is sort of just work and and it's running programs and so forth is exactly why it's possible that it some piece of it could be handed to someone to do because it's 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1748	4459.49	4460.49	F	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	to do because it's not 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1749	4461.19	4461.77	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah so

Bro003.F.dialogueact1751	4463.14	4465.24	F	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean not something right this second but if we can think 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1752	4465.24	4470.23	F	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	but if we can think of some some peace that's that's well to find that she could help with these expressing 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1753	4470.23	4472.56	F	Professor	s^df	+1	1	what with these expressing 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1754	4473.0	4476.64	A	PhD	qo^cs^rt	-1	0	about training if they um a multi lingual matt

Bro003.F.dialogueact1771	4507.62	4516.8	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so were just saying this that that um i was arguing for if possible coming up with something that that really wasn't involvements and one research 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1772	4517.25	4519.69	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because we were we have a time crunch 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1773	4520.2	4527.56	F	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and so uh if there's something that would would save sometimes someone else could do and some other piece and which you think of that first 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1774	4528.07	4534.98	F	Professor	s	-1	0	the with voice voice sounds i really think that that it's to do to do uh uh uh a a poor job is pretty quick 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1775	4535.8	4536.32	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh or you know 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1776	4536.32	4537.77	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	or you know so so job you 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1777	4537.92	4539.9	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so so job you can you can you can throw a couple feet we 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1778	4539.9	4542.35	F	Professor	s	-1	0	can throw a couple feet we know what what kinds of features help with it you 
Bro003.E.dialogueact1779	4542.94	4543.18	E	PhD	b	-1	0	with it you can throw something and 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1780	4542.95	4544.08	F	Professor	s	-1	0	with it you can throw something and you can do pretty 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1781	4544.56	4545.53	F	Professor	s	-1	0	you can do pretty well i remember 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1782	4545.53	4547.9	F	Professor	s	-1	0	well i remember in fact when you were working on that you 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1783	4547.9	4549.9	F	Professor	s	-1	0	you were working on that you work on for a few months is the recall you 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1784	4549.9	4551.51	F	Professor	s	-1	0	is the recall you got to say ninety three percent 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1785	4551.57	4556.13	F	Professor	s	-1	0	percent getting ninety four really really hard yeah 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1786	4552.31	4553.11	A	PhD	b	-1	0	getting ninety four 
Bro003.A.dialogueact1787	4555.87	4556.37	A	PhD	s	-1	0	really really hard yeah 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1788	4556.68	4556.97	F	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1789	4557.15	4557.44	F	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah so 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1790	4557.53	4558.21	F	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah so um 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1791	4558.21	4558.83	F	Professor	fg	-1	0	um 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1792	4559.76	4563.99	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and the the the other tricky thing is since we are 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1793	4564.93	4574.29	F	Professor	s	-1	0	even though we're not we don't have a strict prohibition on memory size and and competition complexity clearly there's some limitation to it so if we have 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1794	4574.29	4586.73	F	Professor	s	-1	0	it so if we have to we say we have to have a attached detectors say we safely for trying to corporate kitchen for may surely some kind of harmonic harm in a city or something this is another whole thing 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1795	4587.53	4588.61	F	Professor	s	-1	0	take a while to develop anyways 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1796	4588.79	4590.54	F	Professor	s	-1	0	to develop anyways very very interesting topic i mean one i 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1797	4590.54	4601.55	F	Professor	s	-1	0	topic i mean one i think one of the a lot of people would say and i think stand would also uh that one of the things wrong with current speech recognition is we you really you throw away uh 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1798	4601.8	4603.43	F	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh we try to get specter on books reason 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1799	4603.78	4609.49	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	reason for doing that is the most of the information about the fanatic identities inspector on books ups not in the harmonic detail but 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1800	4609.96	4612.13	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	detail but the how manic detail does tell you something like the fact that there is 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1801	4612.2	4614.87	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	like the fact that there is harmonic details as well 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1802	4615.81	4616.01	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro003.F.dialogueact1803	4617.13	4617.58	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro003.F.dialogueact1807	4620.69	4634.37	F	Professor	s^bs	+1	2	i think yeah so well that so the yeah they should just it just came up was what about having working on the multi lingual super super say 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1808	4634.66	4641.66	F	Professor	fh|s^bs	+1	2	from two minutes or something 
Bro003.F.dialogueact1809	4642.47	4644.17	F	Professor	s	-1	0	is it are for multiple databases what what would you what
