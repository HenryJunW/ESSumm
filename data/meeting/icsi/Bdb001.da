Bdb001.C.dialogueact0	0.216	5.914	C	Grad	z	-1	0	Yeah , we had a long discussion about how much w how easy we want to make it for people to bleep things out .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1	5.914	6.254	C	Grad	z	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact2	8.339	9.499	C	Grad	z	-1	0	Morgan wants to make it hard .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact3	13.38	14.41	D	PhD	z	-1	0	It {disfmarker} it doesn't {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact4	16.433	17.023	C	Grad	z	-1	0	Did {disfmarker} did {disfmarker} did it {disfmarker} ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact5	17.133	19.073	C	Grad	z	-1	0	I didn't even check yesterday whether it was moving .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact6	18.067	19.977	D	PhD	z	-1	0	It didn't move yesterday either when I started it .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact7	20.3	20.57	C	Grad	z	-1	0	So .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact8	20.56	21.89	D	PhD	z	-1	0	So I don't know if it doesn't like both of us {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact9	21.436	21.946	C	Grad	z	-1	0	Channel three ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact10	22.685	23.215	C	Grad	z	-1	0	Channel three ?
Bdb001.D.dialogueact11	25.97	29.0	D	PhD	z	-1	0	You know , I discovered something yesterday on these , um , wireless ones .
Bdb001.B.dialogueact12	28.413	29.393	B	Grad	z	-1	0	Channel two .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact13	28.939	29.429	C	Grad	z	-1	0	Mm - hmm ?
Bdb001.D.dialogueact14	29.868	32.988	D	PhD	z	-1	0	You can tell if it 's picking up {pause} breath noise and stuff .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact15	32.893	33.013	C	Grad	z	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact16	33.013	35.213	C	Grad	z	-1	0	it has a little indicator on it {disfmarker} on the AF .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact17	33.997	34.437	D	PhD	z	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact18	36.739	37.319	D	PhD	z	-1	0	So if you {disfmarker}
Bdb001.D.dialogueact19	38.329	44.639	D	PhD	z	-1	0	yeah , if you breathe under {disfmarker} breathe and then you see AF go off , then you know {pause} it 's p picking up your mouth noise .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact20	44.814	45.384	F	PhD	z	-1	0	Oh , that 's good .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact21	45.694	47.144	F	PhD	z	-1	0	Cuz we have a lot of breath noises .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact22	46.568	46.818	C	Grad	z	-1	0	Yep .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact23	46.818	47.218	C	Grad	z	-1	0	Test .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact24	48.76	51.89	F	PhD	z	-1	0	In fact , if you listen to just the channels of people not talking , it 's like " @ @ " .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact25	55.774	56.874	F	PhD	z	-1	0	It 's very disgust
Bdb001.C.dialogueact26	56.629	56.869	C	Grad	z	-1	0	What ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact27	56.869	58.889	C	Grad	z	-1	0	Did you see Hannibal recently or something ?
Bdb001.F.dialogueact28	56.874	57.114	F	PhD	z	-1	0	Sorry .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact29	58.318	59.278	F	PhD	z	-1	0	Exactly .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact30	59.338	60.208	F	PhD	z	-1	0	It 's very disconcerting .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact31	60.208	60.668	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact32	61.228	62.188	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So , um ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact33	62.011	62.586	C	Grad	%	-1	0	
Bdb001.F.dialogueact34	62.628	65.918	F	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	I was gonna try to get out of here , like , in half an hour ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact35	65.988	66.428	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact36	66.498	68.88	F	PhD	s	-1	0	cuz I really appreciate people coming ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact37	68.88	89.054	F	PhD	s	+1	1	and {vocalsound} the main thing that I was gonna ask people to help with today is {pause} to give input on what kinds of database format we should {pause} use in starting to link up things like word transcripts and annotations of word transcripts ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact38	89.054	100.288	F	PhD	s^e	+1	0	so anything that transcribers or discourse coders or whatever put in the signal , {vocalsound} with time - marks for , like , words and phone boundaries and all the stuff we get out of the forced alignments and the recognizer .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact39	101.209	103.819	F	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	So , we have this , um {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact40	104.331	110.301	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I think a starting point is clearly the {disfmarker} the channelized {pause} output of Dave Gelbart 's program ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact41	110.301	111.791	F	PhD	s^e^rt	-1	0	which Don brought a copy of ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact42	111.016	111.196	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact43	112.119	113.159	C	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	Yeah , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm familiar with that .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact44	113.159	118.67	C	Grad	s	+1	2	I mean , we {disfmarker} I sort of already have developed an XML format for this sort of stuff .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact45	113.219	113.699	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact46	113.829	114.139	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	which {disfmarker}
Bdb001.D.dialogueact47	114.568	114.928	D	PhD	qy^rt^t3	-1	0	Can I see it ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact48	118.75	123.316	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And so the only question {disfmarker} is it the sort of thing that you want to use or not ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact49	123.677	124.477	C	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Have you looked at that ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact50	124.477	125.657	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	I mean , I had a web page up .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact51	125.724	126.084	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact52	126.084	126.514	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact54	127.894	128.074	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact53	127.512	131.082	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I actually mostly need to be able to link up , or {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact55	131.082	134.512	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I it 's {disfmarker} it 's a question both of what the representation is and {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact56	131.673	132.063	C	Grad	qy^d^rt^t3	-1	0	You mean , this {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact57	133.759	135.789	C	Grad	s	-1	0	I guess I am gonna be standing up and drawing on the board .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact58	135.176	135.436	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact59	135.436	135.716	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact60	135.716	136.846	F	PhD	s^na	-1	0	So you should , definitely .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact61	136.983	139.473	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Um , so {disfmarker} so it definitely had that as a concept .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact62	139.473	141.353	C	Grad	s	+1	2	So tha it has a single time - line ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact63	141.329	141.789	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact64	141.955	144.605	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and then you can have lots of different sections ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact65	144.605	146.195	C	Grad	s	-1	0	each of which have I Ds attached to it ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact66	146.195	148.885	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and then you can refer from other sections to those I Ds ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact67	149.277	149.987	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	if you want to .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact68	150.801	151.341	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So that ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact69	151.341	151.801	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact70	152.9	155.08	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	so that you start with {disfmarker} with a time - line tag .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact71	157.74	158.32	C	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	" Time - line " .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact72	159.518	160.938	C	Grad	s	+1	1	And then you have a bunch of times .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact73	161.658	164.278	C	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I don't e I don't remember exactly what my notation was ,
Bdb001.A.dialogueact74	164.014	165.974	A	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	Oh , I remember seeing an example of this .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact75	164.278	164.578	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	but it {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact76	164.737	165.217	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact77	165.437	165.847	F	PhD	s^bk^r	-1	0	right .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact78	165.974	166.184	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact79	166.357	166.627	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact80	166.627	170.611	C	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	" T equals one point three two " ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact81	170.611	171.121	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact82	171.121	173.991	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And then I {disfmarker} I also had optional things like accuracy ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact83	174.579	179.699	C	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	and then " ID equals T one , uh , one seven " .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact84	179.759	187.122	C	Grad	s	+1	1	And then , {nonvocalsound} I also wanted to {disfmarker} to be i to be able to not specify specifically what the time was and just have a stamp .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact85	186.094	186.454	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact86	189.909	192.219	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , so these are arbitrary , assigned by a program ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact87	192.359	193.299	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	not {disfmarker} not by a user .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact88	193.299	194.499	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So you have a whole bunch of those .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact89	194.923	198.473	C	Grad	s	+1	1	And then somewhere la further down you might have something like an utterance tag
Bdb001.C.dialogueact90	199.481	203.78	C	Grad	s^e	+1	0	which has " start equals T - seventeen ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact91	204.38	206.1	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	end equals T - eighteen " .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact92	206.33	208.98	C	Grad	s:s	+1	0	So what that 's saying is , we know it starts at this particular time .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact93	208.98	210.37	C	Grad	s:s^no	-1	0	We don't know when it ends .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact94	210.93	211.41	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact95	211.498	211.888	C	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact96	212.138	214.098	C	Grad	s	-1	0	But it ends at this T - eighteen ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact97	214.098	215.408	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	which may be somewhere else .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact98	215.408	217.068	C	Grad	s	-1	0	We say there 's another utterance .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact99	218.284	220.134	C	Grad	s	-1	0	We don't know what the t time actually is
Bdb001.C.dialogueact100	220.134	222.714	C	Grad	s	-1	0	but we know that it 's the same time as this end time .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact101	225.315	225.605	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact102	226.157	227.027	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	You know , thirty - eight ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact103	227.027	227.767	C	Grad	s	-1	0	whatever you want .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact104	228.508	230.338	A	PhD	s^bu	+1	0	So you 're essentially defining a lattice .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact105	228.936	229.176	C	Grad	b	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact106	231.21	231.41	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yes ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact107	231.41	231.9	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	exactly .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact108	232.164	232.484	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact109	233.606	236.446	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And then , uh {disfmarker} and then these also have I Ds .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact110	240.331	240.691	C	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact111	240.961	258.509	C	Grad	s^cs	+1	0	So you could {disfmarker} you could have some sort of other {disfmarker} other tag later in the file that would be something like , um , oh , I don't know , {comment} uh , {nonvocalsound} " noise - type equals {nonvocalsound} door - slam " .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact112	258.509	259.229	C	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	You know ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact113	260.887	267.479	C	Grad	s^cs	+1	0	And then , uh , {nonvocalsound} you could either say " time equals a particular time - mark " or you could do other sorts of references .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact114	267.83	269.44	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or you might have a prosody {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact115	270.561	271.481	C	Grad	s	-1	0	" Prosody "
Bdb001.C.dialogueact116	271.641	272.011	C	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right ? D ? T ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact117	272.621	272.881	C	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	D ? T ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact118	272.921	273.211	C	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	T ?
Bdb001.F.dialogueact119	273.48	275.01	F	PhD	s^df^nd	-1	0	It 's an O instead of an I ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact120	275.01	276.04	F	PhD	s^aap	-1	0	but the D is good .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact121	276.594	277.424	C	Grad	qy^d^j^rt	-1	0	You like the D ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact123	277.424	277.954	C	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	That 's a good D .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact122	277.314	277.614	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact124	278.426	278.886	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	Um ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact125	279.345	281.225	C	Grad	s	-1	0	you know , so you could have some sort of type here ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact126	282.223	283.083	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and then you could have ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact127	283.083	283.723	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact128	284.393	288.213	C	Grad	s	-1	0	the utterance that it 's referring to could be U - seventeen or something like that .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact129	289.499	289.989	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact130	289.989	290.489	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact131	290.489	299.33	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	I mean , that seems {disfmarker} that seems g great for all of the encoding of things with time
Bdb001.F.dialogueact132	299.33	299.77	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	and ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact133	300.224	300.494	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , well .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact134	300.75	301.08	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact135	301.997	307.777	F	PhD	qw	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I guess my question is more , uh , what d what do you do with , say , a forced alignment ?
Bdb001.A.dialogueact136	305.329	305.999	A	PhD	%	-1	0	How - how
Bdb001.F.dialogueact137	307.777	309.717	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	I mean you 've got all these phone labels ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact138	309.717	322.056	F	PhD	qw	+1	0	and what do you do if you {disfmarker} just conceptually , if you get , um , transcriptions where the words are staying but the time boundaries are changing , cuz you 've got a new recognition output ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact139	322.056	337.256	F	PhD	qw	+1	0	or s sort of {disfmarker} what 's the , um , sequence of going from the waveforms that stay the same , the transcripts that may or may not change , and then the utterance which {disfmarker} where the time boundaries that may or may not change {disfmarker} ?
Bdb001.A.dialogueact140	334.621	335.011	A	PhD	s^bk.%-	-1	0	Oh , that 's {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact141	337.036	338.646	A	PhD	s	+1	0	That 's actually very nicely handled here
Bdb001.A.dialogueact143	338.646	348.199	A	PhD	s^df	+1	0	because you could {disfmarker} you could {disfmarker} all you 'd have to change is the , {vocalsound} um , time - stamps in the time - line without {disfmarker} without , uh , changing the I Ds .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact142	338.357	338.747	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um .

Bdb001.C.dialogueact193	419.71	423.5	C	Grad	s^no	+1	1	For lower than word - level , you 're talking about so much data that I just {disfmarker} I don't know .

Bdb001.F.dialogueact195	425.09	426.04	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , we actually have {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact196	426.04	431.77	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So , one thing that Don is doing , is we 're {disfmarker} we 're running {disfmarker} For every frame , you get a pitch value ,

Bdb001.F.dialogueact198	431.77	434.39	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and not only one pitch value but different kinds of pitch values
Bdb001.C.dialogueact200	434.554	436.654	C	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , I mean , for something like that I would use P - file

Bdb001.C.dialogueact203	441.168	442.938	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Uh , that 's a {disfmarker} well , or something like it .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact204	442.938	447.028	C	Grad	s	+1	2	It 's ICS uh , ICSI has a format for frame - level representation of features .

Bdb001.F.dialogueact207	448.388	452.688	F	PhD	s^bu	+1	1	That you could call {disfmarker} that you would tie into this representation with like an ID .

Bdb001.C.dialogueact210	453.255	457.595	C	Grad	s	+1	1	Or {disfmarker} or there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a particular way in XML to refer to external resources .

Bdb001.C.dialogueact213	458.453	461.423	C	Grad	s:s^co	-1	0	So you would say " refer to this external file " .

Bdb001.C.dialogueact215	463.024	464.944	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so that external file wouldn't be in {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact216	463.427	464.707	F	PhD	s^na	-1	0	So that might {disfmarker} that might work .

Bdb001.C.dialogueact224	474.29	475.22	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	You don't want to do it with that {disfmarker}

Bdb001.D.dialogueact234	488.547	491.447	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I was thinking the advantage is that we can share this with other people .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact235	489.488	494.798	C	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	Well , but if you 're talking about one per frame , you 're talking about gigabyte - size files .

Bdb001.C.dialogueact241	499.93	502.4	C	Grad	s^df	+1	0	Because you have a two - gigabyte limit on most O Ss .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact242	500.957	501.277	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right ,

Bdb001.A.dialogueact244	502.277	502.797	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I would say {disfmarker}

Bdb001.D.dialogueact288	558.122	558.532	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact289	558.75	561.36	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So that {disfmarker} what 's nice about the P - file {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} i
Bdb001.C.dialogueact290	562.185	567.815	C	Grad	s	+1	0	Built into it is the concept of {pause} frames , utterances , sentences , that sort of thing , that structure .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact291	568.317	572.927	C	Grad	s	+1	0	And then also attached to it is an arbitrary vector of values .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact293	573.611	575.301	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And it can take different types .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact292	573.388	573.748	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact294	575.301	577.241	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So it {disfmarker} th they don't all have to be floats .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact295	577.241	579.861	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	You know , you can have integers and you can have doubles , and all that sort of stuff .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact296	578.604	581.624	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So that {disfmarker} that sounds {disfmarker} that sounds about what I w
Bdb001.C.dialogueact297	580.745	581.095	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact298	581.901	582.081	C	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact299	582.081	587.051	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And it has a header {disfmarker} it has a header format that {pause} describes it {pause} to some extent .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact300	587.051	587.311	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact301	587.991	594.911	C	Grad	s	-1	0	the only problem with it is it 's actually storing the {pause} utterance numbers and the {pause} frame numbers in the file ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact302	595.332	596.802	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	even though they 're always sequential .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact303	597.152	598.892	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And so it does waste a lot of space .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact304	599.781	599.981	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact305	599.787	601.937	C	Grad	s	-1	0	But it 's still a lot tighter than {disfmarker} than ASCII .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact306	601.937	604.067	C	Grad	s	+1	2	And we have a lot of tools already to deal with it .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact307	603.795	604.195	F	PhD	qy^d	-1	0	You do ?
Bdb001.F.dialogueact308	604.195	604.715	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact309	605.005	607.205	F	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Is there some documentation on this somewhere ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact310	606.69	606.87	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact311	606.87	607.55	C	Grad	s^na	-1	0	there 's a ton of it .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact314	607.77	611.658	C	Grad	s^df	+1	1	Man - pages and , uh , source code , and me .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact312	607.455	607.725	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact313	607.725	608.225	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	great .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact315	608.225	608.725	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact316	611.299	612.429	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	I mean , that sounds good .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact317	612.539	613.839	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I was just looking for something {disfmarker}

Bdb001.F.dialogueact319	615.089	620.062	F	PhD	s	+1	0	but something sort of standard enough that , you know , if we start using this we can give it out ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact320	620.062	621.342	F	PhD	s	+1	0	other people can work on it ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact321	620.861	622.011	C	Grad	s^bk|s^nd	-1	0	Yeah , it 's not standard .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact322	621.342	622.152	F	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	or {disfmarker} {comment} Is it {disfmarker} ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact323	622.011	623.661	C	Grad	s^df^nd	+1	2	I mean , it 's something that we developed at ICSI .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact324	624.682	625.292	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	But , uh {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact325	626.009	628.039	F	PhD	s	-1	0	But it 's {pause} been used here
Bdb001.C.dialogueact326	627.839	628.879	C	Grad	s^m^na	-1	0	But it 's been used here
Bdb001.F.dialogueact327	628.039	629.049	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and people 've {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact328	628.879	634.039	C	Grad	s	+1	0	and {disfmarker} and , you know , we have a {pause} well - configured system that you can distribute for free ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact329	634.039	634.369	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bdb001.D.dialogueact330	634.512	640.062	D	PhD	s^bu|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	I mean , it must be the equivalent of whatever you guys used to store feat your computed features in , right ?
Bdb001.F.dialogueact331	635.317	635.987	F	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact332	640.16	640.52	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bdb001.A.dialogueact333	640.52	640.97	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	th we have {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact334	641.719	646.239	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	Actually , we {disfmarker} we use a generalization of the {disfmarker} the Sphere format .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact335	645.514	645.984	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Mmm .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact336	647.337	647.927	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bdb001.A.dialogueact337	648.757	649.077	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact338	650.551	651.951	A	PhD	s^na	-1	0	Yeah , so there is something like that
Bdb001.A.dialogueact339	652.031	654.381	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	but it 's , um , probably not as sophist
Bdb001.C.dialogueact341	653.264	655.304	C	Grad	qw	-1	0	Well , what does H T K do for features ?
Bdb001.D.dialogueact340	652.843	653.663	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	And I think there 's {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact342	655.304	657.214	C	Grad	qy	-1	0	Or does it even have a concept of features ?
Bdb001.A.dialogueact343	655.952	657.062	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	They ha it has its own {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact344	657.922	664.242	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , Entropic has their own feature format that 's called , like , S - SD or some so SF or something like that .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact345	662.116	662.716	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact347	664.41	666.88	C	Grad	qy^cs^df^rt	-1	0	I 'm just wondering , would it be worth while to use that instead ?
Bdb001.D.dialogueact346	664.04	664.52	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact348	665.164	665.514	A	PhD	%	-1	0	Hmm ?
Bdb001.F.dialogueact349	666.922	667.182	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact350	667.182	670.062	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Th - this is exactly the kind of decision {disfmarker} It 's just whatever {disfmarker}
Bdb001.D.dialogueact351	668.338	672.778	D	PhD	s^bu|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	But , I mean , people don't typically share this kind of stuff , right ?
Bdb001.A.dialogueact352	672.675	672.975	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact354	673.214	674.234	C	Grad	s^na	-1	0	They generate their own .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact353	672.778	673.178	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	I mean {disfmarker}
Bdb001.D.dialogueact356	674.275	674.635	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact355	674.143	679.54	F	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Actually , I {disfmarker} I just {disfmarker} you know , we {disfmarker} we 've done this stuff on prosodics
Bdb001.F.dialogueact357	679.54	682.727	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and three or four places have asked for those prosodic files ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact358	682.727	685.977	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and we just have an ASCII , uh , output of frame - by - frame .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact359	684.637	685.117	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Ah , right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact360	686.107	687.007	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Which is fine ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact361	687.585	692.405	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but it gets unwieldy to go in and {disfmarker} and query these files with really huge files .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact362	692.736	693.046	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact363	693.07	693.89	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , we could do it .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact364	693.89	697.29	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I was just thinking if there 's something that {disfmarker} where all the frame values are {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact365	695.261	696.411	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	And a and again , if you have a {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact367	697.72	701.49	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	if you have a two - hour - long meeting , that 's gonna {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact366	697.39	697.6	F	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	Hmm ?
Bdb001.F.dialogueact368	701.169	702.709	F	PhD	s	-1	0	They 're {disfmarker} they 're fair they 're quite large .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact370	702.712	704.182	C	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Yeah , I mean , they 'd be emo enormous .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact369	702.709	706.419	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And these are for ten - minute Switchboard conversations ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact371	705.99	706.26	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact372	706.419	706.649	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact373	707.3	708.04	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So it 's doable ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact374	708.04	711.88	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	it 's just that you can only store a feature vector at frame - by - frame
Bdb001.F.dialogueact375	711.88	713.08	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and it doesn't have any kind of ,
Bdb001.D.dialogueact377	714.869	719.709	D	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Is {disfmarker} is the sharing part of this a pretty important {pause} consideration
Bdb001.F.dialogueact376	714.57	714.91	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bdb001.D.dialogueact378	719.709	722.149	D	PhD	qrr	-1	0	or does that just sort of , uh {disfmarker} a nice thing to have ?
Bdb001.F.dialogueact379	722.987	727.657	F	PhD	s^no^rt	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I don't know enough about what we 're gonna do with the data .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact380	727.717	736.566	F	PhD	s	+1	1	But I thought it would be good to get something that we can {disfmarker} that other people can use or adopt for their own kinds of encoding .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact381	736.566	740.456	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	And just , I mean we have to use some we have to make some decision about what to do .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact382	739.731	739.971	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact383	740.456	745.918	F	PhD	s	+1	0	And especially for the prosody work , what {disfmarker} what it ends up being is you get features from the signal ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact384	745.918	748.168	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and of course those change every time your alignments change .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact385	748.168	749.478	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So you re - run a recognizer ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact386	749.478	754.869	F	PhD	s	+1	0	you want to recompute your features , um , and then keep the database up to date .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact387	754.857	755.057	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact388	754.869	760.04	F	PhD	s	+1	0	Or you change a word , or you change a {vocalsound} utterance boundary segment , which is gonna happen a lot .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact389	760.737	765.097	F	PhD	s	+1	1	And so I wanted something where {pause} all of this can be done in a elegant way
Bdb001.F.dialogueact390	765.097	770.747	F	PhD	s	+1	1	and that if somebody wants to try something or compute something else , that it can be done flexibly .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact391	771.375	771.845	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact392	772.005	773.365	F	PhD	s	-1	0	it doesn't have to be pretty ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact393	773.365	776.693	F	PhD	s.%--	+1	0	it just has to be , you know , easy to use , and {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact394	777.3	778.25	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	Yeah , the other thing {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact395	779.196	780.546	C	Grad	s^cs	+1	1	We should look at ATLAS ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact396	780.876	781.766	C	Grad	s^e	+1	0	the NIST thing ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact397	781.293	781.413	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Oh .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact398	781.979	782.299	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact399	783.008	784.808	C	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	and see if they have anything at that level .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact400	783.026	783.226	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact401	784.808	787.278	C	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I mean , I 'm not sure what to do about this with ATLAS ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact402	787.278	788.678	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because they chose a different route .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact403	789.206	790.306	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	I chose something that {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact404	790.456	791.666	C	Grad	s	+1	1	Th - there are sort of two choices .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact405	791.666	800.135	C	Grad	s^e	+1	0	Your {disfmarker} your file format can know about {disfmarker} know that you 're talking about language {pause} and speech , which is what I chose , and time ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact406	800.501	803.111	C	Grad	s^e	+1	0	or your file format can just be a graph representation .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact407	803.798	806.248	C	Grad	s	+1	0	And then the application has to impose the structure on top .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact408	806.884	809.404	C	Grad	s	+1	0	So what it looked like ATLAS chose is , they chose the other way ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact409	809.504	813.268	C	Grad	s^e	+1	1	which was their file format is just nodes and links ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact410	813.668	815.628	C	Grad	s^e	+1	0	and you have to interpret what they mean yourself .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact411	816.797	819.697	F	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	And why did you not choose that type of approach ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact412	818.751	820.401	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Uh , because I knew that we were doing speech ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact413	820.401	828.131	C	Grad	s	+1	1	and I thought it was better if you 're looking at a raw file to be {disfmarker} t for the tags to say " it 's an utterance " , as opposed to the tag to say " it 's a link " .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact414	820.738	821.168	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact415	828.718	829.148	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact417	829.901	830.201	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	So , but {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact416	829.532	831.102	F	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	But other than that , are they compatible ?
Bdb001.F.dialogueact418	831.102	831.782	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , you could sort of {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact419	832.17	832.37	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact420	832.37	833.52	C	Grad	s^na	-1	0	they 're reasonably compatible .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact421	832.954	834.074	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , you {disfmarker} you could {disfmarker}
Bdb001.D.dialogueact422	833.855	835.255	D	PhD	s	-1	0	You could probably translate between them .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact424	835.779	836.039	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact423	835.57	836.02	F	PhD	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah , that 's w
Bdb001.F.dialogueact425	836.07	836.55	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact426	836.772	837.032	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	So ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact427	837.032	844.882	C	Grad	s	-1	0	well , the other thing is if we choose to use ATLAS , which maybe we should just do , we should just throw this out before we invest a lot of time in it .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact428	837.19	837.42	F	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact429	842.417	842.707	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	I don't {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact430	845.099	846.419	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So this is what the meeting 's about ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact432	846.61	846.84	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact431	846.419	847.309	F	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	just sort of how to {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact433	847.709	851.379	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Um , cuz we need to come up with a database like this just to do our work .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact434	851.379	855.643	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And I actually don't care , as long as it 's something useful to other people , what we choose .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact435	855.078	855.288	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact436	855.643	857.751	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So maybe it 's {disfmarker} maybe oth you know ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact437	857.751	860.441	F	PhD	s^no	-1	0	if {disfmarker} if you have any idea of how to choose , cuz I don't .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact438	858.335	858.895	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	The only thing {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact439	860.908	861.188	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact440	861.452	862.482	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Do they already have tools ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact441	861.929	864.059	C	Grad	s	+1	0	I mean , I {disfmarker} I chose this for a couple reasons .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact442	864.059	865.709	C	Grad	s^df	+1	1	One of them is that it 's easy to parse .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact443	866.518	868.238	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	You don't need a full XML parser .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact444	868.238	871.568	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	It 's very easy to just write a Perl script {pause} to parse it .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact445	871.757	874.277	A	PhD	s	-1	0	As long as uh each tag is on one line .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact446	874.08	874.74	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact447	874.74	875.18	C	Grad	s^aa^r	-1	0	Exactly .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact448	875.18	876.09	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Which I always do .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact449	876.405	879.565	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And you can have as much information in the tag as you want ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact450	879.705	879.915	F	PhD	qy^d^g	-1	0	right ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact451	880.612	881.762	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , I have it structured .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact452	881.762	881.992	C	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact453	881.992	885.992	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So each type tag has only particular items that it can take .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact454	886.53	890.508	F	PhD	s^bu.%--	+1	1	Can you {disfmarker} But you can add to those structures if you {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact455	889.252	889.582	C	Grad	s^aa	+1	0	Sure .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact456	891.02	891.72	C	Grad	s^2	-1	0	If you have more information .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact457	891.84	901.764	C	Grad	s:s	+1	0	So what {disfmarker} What NIST would say is that instead of doing this , you would say something like " link {nonvocalsound} start equals , um , you know , some node ID ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact458	891.912	892.342	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact459	892.342	892.952	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact460	902.654	904.484	C	Grad	s:s	+1	0	end equals some other node ID " ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact461	905.905	908.755	C	Grad	s	+1	1	and then " type " would be " utterance " .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact462	910.531	910.701	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact463	911.141	912.291	C	Grad	s	-1	0	You know , so it 's very similar .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact464	913.429	918.819	F	PhD	qw	-1	0	So why would it be a {disfmarker} a waste to do it this way if it 's similar enough that we can always translate it ?
Bdb001.D.dialogueact465	918.322	919.372	D	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	It probably wouldn't be a waste .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact466	919.372	923.96	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	It would mean that at some point if we wanted to switch , we 'd just have to translate everything .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact467	922.187	922.967	C	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Write a translator .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact468	922.967	923.397	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	But it se
Bdb001.C.dialogueact470	923.95	925.52	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	Since they are developing a big {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact469	923.86	924.98	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	But it {disfmarker} but that sounds {disfmarker}
Bdb001.D.dialogueact471	924.975	925.435	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But that 's {disfmarker}
Bdb001.D.dialogueact472	925.485	926.445	D	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	I don't think that 's a big deal .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact473	925.828	926.668	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	As long as it is {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact474	927.043	928.723	C	Grad	s	+1	1	they 're developing a big infrastructure .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact475	928.723	934.873	C	Grad	s^cs.%-	-1	0	And so it seems to me that if {disfmarker} if we want to use that , we might as well go directly to what they 're doing , rather than {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact476	930.694	931.424	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	If we want to {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact477	933.977	937.757	A	PhD	qy^rt	+1	2	Do they already have something that 's {disfmarker} that would be useful for us in place ?
Bdb001.D.dialogueact478	936.66	936.91	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact479	936.91	937.92	D	PhD	s	-1	0	See , that 's the question .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact480	937.92	939.54	D	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	I mean , how stable is their {disfmarker}
Bdb001.D.dialogueact481	940.251	941.141	D	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Are they ready to go ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact482	940.891	942.081	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	The {disfmarker} I looked at it {disfmarker}
Bdb001.D.dialogueact483	941.141	941.421	D	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact484	942.521	944.191	C	Grad	s^no	+1	0	The last time I looked at it was a while ago ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact485	944.191	945.121	C	Grad	s^e	+1	0	probably a year ago ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact487	945.839	947.709	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	uh , when we first started talking about this .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact486	945.472	945.722	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Hmm .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact488	947.709	951.576	C	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	And at that time at least {vocalsound} it was still not very {pause} complete .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact489	952.036	956.766	C	Grad	s^e^nd	+1	0	And so , specifically they didn't have any external format representation at that time .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact490	957.109	962.339	C	Grad	s^e	+1	0	They just had the sort of conceptual {pause} node {disfmarker} uh , annotated transcription graph ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact491	962.499	963.449	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	which I really liked .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact492	963.449	965.289	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And that 's exactly what this stuff is based on .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact493	965.856	968.556	C	Grad	s	+1	0	Since then , they 've developed their own external file format ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact494	969.139	972.039	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	which is , uh , you know , this sort of s this sort of thing .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact495	972.601	974.741	C	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	Um , and apparently they 've also developed a lot of tools ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact496	974.741	975.691	C	Grad	s	+1	0	but I haven't looked at them .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact497	975.691	976.351	C	Grad	s^cs	+1	1	Maybe I should .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact498	976.505	977.905	A	PhD	s^cs^na	-1	0	We should {disfmarker} we should find out .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact499	976.862	981.362	F	PhD	qy	-1	0	I mean , would the tools {disfmarker} would the tools run on something like this , if you can translate them anyway ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact500	982.166	988.036	C	Grad	h|s	+1	1	Um , th what would {disfmarker} would {disfmarker} would {disfmarker} what would worry me is that maybe we might miss a little detail
Bdb001.A.dialogueact502	982.773	983.663	A	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	It 's a hassle
Bdb001.F.dialogueact501	982.657	984.187	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , that {disfmarker} I guess it 's a question that {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact504	984.73	984.88	A	PhD	%	-1	0	if {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact503	984.287	984.577	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh , yeah .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact505	988.296	990.886	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	that would make it very difficult to translate from one to the other .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact506	988.603	989.083	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact507	990.113	1003.47	A	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	I {disfmarker} I think if it 's conceptually close , and they already have or will have tools that everybody else will be using , I mean , {vocalsound} it would be crazy to do something s you know , separate that {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact508	990.9	991.29	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact509	998.916	999.676	C	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yeah , we might as well .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact510	1003.32	1003.57	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yep .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact511	1004.08	1004.27	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact512	1005.06	1006.6	C	Grad	s^cc	+1	1	So I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll take a closer look at it .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact513	1005.87	1006.3	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	Actually ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact514	1006.3	1006.74	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	so it 's {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact515	1006.74	1011.31	F	PhD	s	-1	0	that {disfmarker} that would really be the question , is just what you would feel is in the long run the best thing .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact516	1008.28	1008.67	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact517	1009.85	1010.11	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact518	1011.31	1019.16	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Cuz {vocalsound} once we start , sort of , doing this I don't {disfmarker} we don't actually have enough time to probably have to rehash it out again
Bdb001.C.dialogueact519	1011.85	1012.1	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	The {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact520	1014.97	1015.19	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact522	1019.57	1026.36	C	Grad	s	+1	1	The other thing {disfmarker} the other way that I sort of established this was as easy translation to and from the Transcriber format .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact521	1019.16	1019.37	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact523	1020.23	1020.29	F	PhD	%	-1	0	s
Bdb001.F.dialogueact524	1026.81	1027.18	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact525	1027.51	1027.98	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact526	1027.69	1028.01	F	PhD	s^bk^r	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact527	1028.66	1028.94	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact528	1029.21	1029.99	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , I like this .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact529	1029.99	1033.03	F	PhD	s	-1	0	This is sort of intuitively easy to actually r read ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact530	1032.07	1032.27	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yep .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact531	1033.03	1034.64	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	as easy it could {disfmarker} as it could be .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact532	1035.03	1035.32	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	But ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact533	1035.97	1040.22	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I suppose that {pause} as long as they have a type here that specifies " utt " ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact534	1040.64	1040.94	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact535	1041.25	1042.23	C	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's almost the same .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact536	1042.12	1043.6	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	it 's {disfmarker} yeah , close enough that {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact537	1042.82	1047.4	C	Grad	s	+1	0	The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the point is {disfmarker} with this , though , is that you can't really add any supplementary information .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact538	1048.56	1048.75	C	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact539	1048.75	1050.49	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	So if you suddenly decide that you want {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact540	1050.42	1051.51	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	You have to make a different type .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact541	1051.75	1051.99	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact542	1052.51	1053.62	C	Grad	s^m^na	-1	0	You 'd have to make a different type .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact543	1053.53	1053.94	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact544	1053.99	1054.97	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Well , if you look at it
Bdb001.F.dialogueact545	1054.97	1056.03	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker} Um ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact546	1056.27	1062.39	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I guess in my mind I don't know enough {disfmarker} Jane would know better , {comment} about the {pause} types of annotations
Bdb001.F.dialogueact547	1062.39	1067.91	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} But I imagine that those are things that would {disfmarker} well , you guys mentioned this , {comment} that could span any {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact548	1068.79	1070.23	F	PhD	s	-1	0	it could be in its own channel ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact549	1070.23	1073.08	F	PhD	s	-1	0	it could span time boundaries of any type ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact550	1072.56	1072.86	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact551	1073.08	1074.44	F	PhD	s	-1	0	it could be instantaneous ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact552	1074.81	1075.57	F	PhD	s	-1	0	things like that .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact553	1075.93	1076.4	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact554	1076.89	1081.58	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and then from the recognition side we have backtraces at the phone - level .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact556	1081.8	1082.14	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact555	1081.58	1084.16	F	PhD	s	-1	0	If {disfmarker} if it can handle that , it could handle states or whatever .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact557	1084.84	1091.09	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And then at the prosody - level we have frame {disfmarker} sort of like cepstral feature files ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact558	1089.19	1089.47	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact559	1091.48	1093.58	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	uh , like these P - files or anything like that .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact560	1093.58	1095.12	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And that 's sort of the world of things that I {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact561	1095.87	1098.3	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And then we have the aligned channels , of course ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact562	1097.59	1097.84	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact564	1098.79	1101.55	A	PhD	s^bs	+1	1	It seems to me you want to keep the frame - level stuff separate .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact563	1098.3	1098.4	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact565	1101.82	1102.04	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .

Bdb001.F.dialogueact566	1102.04	1103.2	F	PhD	s^na	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I definitely agree
Bdb001.F.dialogueact568	1103.2	1108.75	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and I wanted to find actually a f a nicer format or a {disfmarker} maybe a more compact format than what we used before .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact569	1107.69	1107.97	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact570	1108.75	1113.11	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Just cuz you 've got {vocalsound} ten channels or whatever and two hours of a meeting .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact571	1113.11	1114.77	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} it 's a lot of {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact573	1113.98	1114.34	C	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Huge .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact572	1113.98	1121.16	A	PhD	qw	+1	0	Now {disfmarker} now how would you {disfmarker} how would you represent , um , multiple speakers in this framework ?
Bdb001.A.dialogueact574	1121.16	1122.99	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Were {disfmarker} You would just represent them as {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact575	1121.52	1122.22	C	Grad	h	-1	0	Um ,
Bdb001.A.dialogueact576	1123.42	1125.45	A	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	You would have like a speaker tag or something ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact577	1125.26	1127.93	C	Grad	s	+1	1	there 's a spea speaker tag up at the top which identifies them
Bdb001.C.dialogueact578	1127.93	1128.61	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and then each utt
Bdb001.C.dialogueact579	1128.73	1135.54	C	Grad	s	+1	0	the way I had it is each turn or each utterance , {comment} I don't even remember now , had a speaker ID tag attached to it .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact580	1129.72	1130.17	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact581	1136.26	1136.69	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact582	1136.71	1139.12	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And in this format you would have a different tag ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact583	1140.16	1142.87	C	Grad	s	-1	0	which {disfmarker} which would , uh , be linked to the link .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact585	1144.2	1147.45	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so somewhere else you would have another thing {pause} that would be ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact584	1143.86	1144.18	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact586	1147.45	1148.46	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact587	1150.52	1151.95	C	Grad	qr^t1	-1	0	Let 's see , would it be a node or a link ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact588	1151.95	1152.56	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact589	1153.59	1160.9	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And so {disfmarker} so this one would have , um , an ID is link {disfmarker} {comment} link seventy - four or something like that .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact591	1161.01	1161.48	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact590	1160.9	1172.4	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And then somewhere up here you would have a link that {disfmarker} that , uh , you know , was referencing L - seventy - four and had speaker Adam .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact593	1173.58	1174.0	A	PhD	%	-1	0	Is i ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact594	1173.62	1173.81	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	You know ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact595	1173.81	1174.83	C	Grad	s	-1	0	or something like that .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact592	1173.54	1175.48	F	PhD	s^ng.%--	-1	0	Actually , it 's the channel , I think , that {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact597	1176.21	1177.73	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , channel or speaker or whatever .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact596	1176.17	1176.92	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	I mean , w
Bdb001.F.dialogueact598	1176.92	1179.52	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	yeah , channel is what the channelized output out
Bdb001.A.dialogueact599	1177.73	1178.17	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	It doesn't {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact600	1179.15	1180.0	C	Grad	s	-1	0	This isn't quite right .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact602	1180.21	1180.39	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact601	1180.0	1181.01	C	Grad	s	-1	0	I have to look at it again .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact603	1180.25	1181.04	F	PhD	s^bk|%-	-1	0	Yeah , but {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact604	1180.93	1190.47	A	PhD	fg|qw	+1	0	But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} so how in the NIST format do we express {vocalsound} a hierarchical relationship between , um , say , an utterance and the words within it ?
Bdb001.A.dialogueact605	1190.47	1195.86	A	PhD	qw	-1	0	So how do you {pause} tell {pause} that {pause} these are the words that belong to that utterance ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact606	1196.92	1203.66	C	Grad	h|s	+1	0	Um , you would have another structure lower down than this that would be saying they 're all belonging to this ID .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact607	1200.33	1200.74	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact608	1205.5	1209.53	D	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	So each thing refers to the {pause} utterance that it belongs to .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact609	1209.44	1209.76	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact611	1211.02	1213.26	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And then each utterance could refer to a turn ,
Bdb001.D.dialogueact610	1211.01	1213.04	D	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	So it 's {disfmarker} it 's not hi it 's sort of bottom - up .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact612	1213.66	1215.79	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and each turn could refer to something higher up .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact613	1216.2	1217.49	F	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	And what if you actually have {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact614	1218.03	1228.43	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So right now what you have as utterance , um , the closest thing that comes out of the channelized is the stuff between the segment boundaries that the transcribers put in or that Thilo put in ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact615	1229.25	1235.93	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which may or may not actually be , like , a s it 's usually not {disfmarker} um , the beginning and end of a sentence , say .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact616	1235.98	1237.19	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Well , that 's why I didn't call it " sentence " .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact617	1236.66	1236.95	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact618	1236.95	1237.27	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact619	1237.85	1239.45	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Um , so it 's like a segment or something .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact620	1239.4	1239.65	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact621	1239.75	1240.32	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact622	1241.3	1254.59	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , I assume this is possible , that if you have {disfmarker} someone annotates the punctuation or whatever when they transcribe , you can say , you know , from {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} from the c beginning of the sentence to the end of the sentence , from the annotations , this is a unit ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact623	1254.89	1256.07	F	PhD	s^e.%--	-1	0	even though it never actually {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact624	1256.87	1260.82	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	i It 's only a unit by virtue of the annotations {pause} at the word - level .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact625	1260.94	1261.28	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Sure .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact626	1261.28	1263.25	C	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , so you would {disfmarker} you would have yet another tag .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact627	1261.5	1264.22	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And then that would get a tag somehow .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact628	1264.2	1266.66	C	Grad	s	-1	0	You 'd have another tag which says this is of type " sentence " .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact629	1264.22	1264.62	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact630	1266.62	1267.1	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact631	1267.34	1267.74	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	And ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact633	1268.1	1268.43	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	what {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact632	1268.02	1270.27	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But it 's just not overtly in the {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact634	1269.91	1270.14	A	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact635	1271.98	1273.52	F	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Um , cuz this is exactly the kind of {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact636	1273.38	1273.71	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact637	1275.04	1277.55	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I think that should be {pause} possible as long as the {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact638	1278.1	1283.13	F	PhD	s^no	-1	0	But , uh , what I don't understand is where the {disfmarker} where in this type of file {pause} that would be expressed .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact639	1284.91	1285.09	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact640	1285.09	1286.59	C	Grad	s	-1	0	You would have another tag somewhere .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact641	1287.26	1288.92	C	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} well , there 're two ways of doing it .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact642	1287.37	1291.94	F	PhD	s	-1	0	S so it would just be floating before the sentence or floating after the sentence without a time - mark .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact643	1290.69	1292.66	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	You could have some sort of link type {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact644	1294.02	1295.16	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	type equals " sentence " ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact645	1297.17	1299.42	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	and ID is " S - whatever " .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact646	1300.2	1303.38	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	And then lower down you could have an utterance .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact647	1303.74	1307.1	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	So the type is " utterance " {disfmarker} equals " utt " .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact648	1307.17	1308.72	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	And you could either say that {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact649	1309.57	1309.88	C	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact650	1309.88	1310.29	C	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I don't know {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact652	1310.7	1311.6	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So here 's the thing .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact651	1310.67	1311.31	C	Grad	s	-1	0	I take that back .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact653	1312.01	1312.5	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact655	1313.24	1318.0	C	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Can you {disfmarker} can you say that this is part of this ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact654	1312.94	1313.5	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	See , cuz it 's {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact656	1315.17	1316.09	A	PhD	%	-1	0	Hhh .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact657	1315.72	1315.84	F	PhD	%	-1	0	it 's {disfmarker}
Bdb001.D.dialogueact658	1316.77	1317.62	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	You would just have a r
Bdb001.F.dialogueact659	1317.41	1318.0	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	S
Bdb001.C.dialogueact660	1318.0	1319.32	C	Grad	qrr	-1	0	or do you say this is part of this ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact661	1319.32	1319.64	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	I think {disfmarker}
Bdb001.D.dialogueact663	1319.92	1321.28	D	PhD	s	-1	0	You would refer up to the sentence .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact662	1319.84	1320.24	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	But they 're {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact664	1320.76	1321.33	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Well , the thing {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact665	1321.14	1323.08	F	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	they 're actually overlapping each other , sort of .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact666	1321.77	1321.99	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact667	1323.14	1329.28	A	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	the thing is that some something may be a part of one thing for one purpose and another thing of another purpose .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact668	1323.42	1323.71	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact670	1330.31	1330.66	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	So f
Bdb001.F.dialogueact669	1330.06	1332.0	F	PhD	s	-1	0	You have to have another type then , I guess .

Bdb001.A.dialogueact672	1332.46	1333.02	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Um ,

Bdb001.A.dialogueact675	1333.75	1335.31	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	s let 's {disfmarker} let 's ta so let 's {disfmarker}

Bdb001.F.dialogueact676	1333.92	1334.11	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact678	1336.49	1336.9	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact679	1336.65	1337.4	C	Grad	s^df.%--	-1	0	because I {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker}

Bdb001.F.dialogueact680	1336.89	1337.27	F	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact681	1337.82	1340.1	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	y So for instance @ @ {comment} sup
Bdb001.C.dialogueact682	1338.65	1341.6	C	Grad	s	-1	0	There 's one level {disfmarker} there 's one more level of indirection that I 'm forgetting .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact683	1341.12	1343.22	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Suppose you have a word sequence
Bdb001.A.dialogueact684	1343.22	1346.71	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and you have two different segmentations of that same word sequence .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact685	1346.94	1353.92	A	PhD	s	+1	0	f Say , one segmentation is in terms of , um , you know , uh , sentences .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact686	1354.61	1359.28	A	PhD	s	+1	0	And another segmentation is in terms of , um , {vocalsound} I don't know , {comment} prosodic phrases .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact687	1360.15	1362.67	A	PhD	s	+1	0	And let 's say that they don't {pause} nest .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact688	1362.8	1367.62	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	So , you know , a prosodic phrase may cross two sentences or something .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact689	1365.27	1365.48	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact690	1367.62	1368.71	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I don't know if that 's true or not

Bdb001.F.dialogueact692	1368.91	1370.65	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , it 's definitely true with the segment .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact693	1370.62	1370.82	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact694	1370.65	1374.39	F	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	That 's what I {disfmarker} exactly what I meant by the utterances versus the sentence could be sort of {disfmarker}

Bdb001.A.dialogueact696	1373.32	1379.71	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So , you want to be s you want to say this {disfmarker} this word is part of that sentence and this prosodic phrase .

Bdb001.A.dialogueact699	1381.07	1382.81	A	PhD	s	-1	0	But the phrase is not part of the sentence
Bdb001.F.dialogueact698	1381.0	1381.16	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact700	1382.81	1384.4	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and neither is the sentence part of the phrase .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact701	1383.62	1384.02	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact702	1384.17	1385.71	C	Grad	s^na	+1	0	I I 'm pretty sure that you can do that ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact703	1385.71	1388.09	C	Grad	s^no	+1	1	but I 'm forgetting the exact level of nesting .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact704	1386.42	1391.25	A	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	So , you would have to have {vocalsound} two different pointers from the word up {disfmarker} one level up ,

Bdb001.C.dialogueact706	1391.57	1394.67	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so what you would end up having is a tag saying " here 's a word ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact707	1394.67	1396.14	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	and it starts here and it ends here " .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact708	1395.67	1396.07	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact709	1396.45	1399.1	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	And then lower down you would say " here 's a prosodic boundary
Bdb001.C.dialogueact710	1399.27	1400.3	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	and it has these words in it " .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact711	1401.05	1402.6	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	And lower down you 'd have " here 's a sentence ,

Bdb001.F.dialogueact712	1401.44	1402.32	F	PhD	b	-1	0	An - Right .

Bdb001.F.dialogueact715	1403.12	1407.52	F	PhD	s:s^co	-1	0	So you would be able to go in and say , you know , " give me all the words in the bound in the prosodic phrase

Bdb001.C.dialogueact719	1409.38	1410.44	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So I think that 's {disfmarker} that would wor
Bdb001.F.dialogueact720	1409.5	1410.46	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Um , OK .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact721	1410.44	1411.41	C	Grad	s^co	-1	0	Let me look at it again .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact722	1411.28	1411.58	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact724	1412.06	1423.88	A	PhD	s^tc	-1	0	The {disfmarker} the o the other issue that you had was , how do you actually efficiently extract , um {disfmarker} find and extract information in a structure of this type ?
Bdb001.F.dialogueact723	1411.66	1412.09	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact725	1412.2	1412.41	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact726	1413.34	1413.61	F	PhD	s^ba^t3	-1	0	That 's good .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact727	1424.73	1426.77	A	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	So you gave some examples like {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact728	1427.38	1427.83	F	PhD	h	-1	0	Well ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact729	1428.24	1429.86	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	uh , and , I mean , you guys might {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact730	1430.94	1432.32	F	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I don't know if this is premature
Bdb001.F.dialogueact731	1432.32	1436.04	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because I suppose once you get the representation you can do this ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact732	1436.04	1438.17	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but the kinds of things I was worried about is ,
Bdb001.A.dialogueact733	1439.21	1440.06	A	PhD	s^ar|s^nd	-1	0	No , that 's not clear .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact734	1439.21	1439.64	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact735	1440.06	1441.92	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	I mean , yeah , you c sure you can do it ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact736	1440.28	1440.91	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Well , OK .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact737	1440.91	1441.84	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So i if it {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact738	1441.92	1446.23	A	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	but can you do it sort of l l you know , it {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact739	1443.44	1444.59	F	PhD	s^j^nd	-1	0	I I mean , I can't do it ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact740	1444.59	1445.41	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but I can {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact741	1446.2	1446.64	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bdb001.A.dialogueact742	1446.77	1450.82	A	PhD	s	-1	0	y y you gotta {disfmarker} you gotta do this {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you 're gonna want to do this very quickly
Bdb001.C.dialogueact743	1447.15	1447.39	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact744	1450.97	1455.92	A	PhD	s	-1	0	or else you 'll spend all your time sort of searching through very {vocalsound} complex data structures {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact745	1454.0	1454.32	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact746	1454.32	1456.97	F	PhD	s	-1	0	You 'd need a p sort of a paradigm for how to do it .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact747	1456.97	1470.04	F	PhD	s	-1	0	But an example would be " find all the cases in which Adam started to talk while Andreas was talking and his pitch was rising ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact748	1470.27	1471.07	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	Andreas 's pitch " .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact749	1471.33	1471.88	F	PhD	s	-1	0	That kind of thing .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact750	1472.67	1472.85	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact751	1472.85	1473.62	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , that 's gonna be {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact752	1474.35	1476.82	C	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Is the rising pitch a {pause} feature ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact753	1476.82	1478.66	C	Grad	qrr	-1	0	or is it gonna be in the same file ?
Bdb001.F.dialogueact754	1478.67	1482.14	F	PhD	h|s	-1	0	Well , the rising pitch will never be {pause} hand - annotated .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact755	1482.14	1485.34	F	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	So the {disfmarker} all the prosodic features are going to be automatically {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact756	1484.48	1484.93	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	But the {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact757	1485.47	1487.21	C	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , that 's gonna be hard regardless ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact758	1485.5	1486.5	F	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	So they 're gonna be in those {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact759	1487.21	1487.43	C	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact760	1487.43	1492.06	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Because you 're gonna have to write a program that goes through your feature file and looks for rising pitches .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact761	1489.68	1489.95	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact762	1491.41	1491.72	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact763	1491.78	1492.05	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact764	1492.05	1496.28	F	PhD	s:qw^rt	-1	0	So normally what we would do is we would say " what do we wanna assign rising pitch to ? "
Bdb001.F.dialogueact765	1496.28	1497.52	F	PhD	s:qy^rt	-1	0	Are we gonna assign it to words ?
Bdb001.F.dialogueact766	1497.52	1498.94	F	PhD	s.%--:qy.%--	-1	0	Are we gonna just assign it to sort of {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact767	1499.51	1502.42	F	PhD	s	-1	0	when it 's rising we have a begin - end rise representation ?
Bdb001.F.dialogueact768	1502.42	1503.99	F	PhD	s	-1	0	But suppose we dump out this file
Bdb001.F.dialogueact769	1503.99	1509.36	F	PhD	s:s	-1	0	and we say , uh , for every word we just classify it as , w you know , rise or fall or neither ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact770	1509.65	1509.83	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact771	1509.83	1512.99	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , in that case you would add that to this {pause} format
Bdb001.F.dialogueact772	1510.08	1510.46	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact774	1512.99	1513.23	C	Grad	%--	-1	0	r
Bdb001.F.dialogueact773	1512.78	1522.51	F	PhD	s	+1	0	So we would basically be sort of , um , taking the format and enriching it with things that we wanna query in relation to the words that are already in the file ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact775	1522.07	1522.3	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact776	1522.84	1523.69	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and then querying it .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact778	1524.3	1529.26	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	You want sort of a grep that 's {disfmarker} that works at the structural {disfmarker} on the structural representation .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact777	1523.95	1524.29	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact779	1527.6	1528.2	C	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	You have that .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact780	1528.82	1538.46	C	Grad	s	+1	1	There 's a {pause} standard again in XML , specifically for searching XML documents {disfmarker} structured X - XML documents , where you can specify both the content and the structural position .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact781	1539.94	1541.83	A	PhD	s^bk|s^ng.%--	-1	0	Yeah , but it 's {disfmarker} it 's not clear that that 's {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact783	1542.93	1545.33	A	PhD	s^df^nd	-1	0	That 's relative to the structure of the XML document ,

Bdb001.C.dialogueact785	1545.36	1546.53	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	You use it as a tool .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact786	1546.99	1547.98	C	Grad	s^df^r	-1	0	You use it as a tool ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact787	1547.98	1548.83	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	not an end - user .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact788	1548.83	1549.9	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	It 's not an end - user thing .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact789	1549.8	1550.31	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact790	1549.9	1553.85	C	Grad	s^df	+1	1	It 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} you would use that to build your tool to do that sort of search .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact791	1552.48	1552.73	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact792	1553.45	1553.8	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	Be
Bdb001.A.dialogueact793	1554.22	1556.15	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Because here you 're specifying a lattice .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact794	1554.88	1554.91	F	PhD	%	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact795	1556.45	1559.66	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So the underlying {disfmarker} that 's the underlying data structure .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact797	1559.66	1562.32	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And you want to be able to search in that lattice .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact796	1559.62	1560.86	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	But as long as the {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact798	1561.68	1562.44	C	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	It 's a graph ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact799	1562.44	1562.67	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact800	1563.24	1565.44	A	PhD	s	-1	0	That 's different from searching through the text .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact801	1564.54	1566.75	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	But it seems like as long as the features that {disfmarker}

Bdb001.C.dialogueact803	1566.62	1566.98	C	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	no , no , no .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact804	1566.98	1570.32	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	The whole point is that the text and the lattice are isomorphic .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact805	1571.01	1573.49	C	Grad	s	-1	0	They {pause} represent each other {pause} completely .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact806	1573.93	1574.59	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact807	1575.13	1575.59	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So that {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact808	1577.58	1577.87	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	I mean th
Bdb001.F.dialogueact809	1577.58	1585.77	F	PhD	s^aap	-1	0	That 's true if the features from your acoustics or whatever that are not explicitly in this are at the level of these types .

Bdb001.F.dialogueact811	1586.29	1588.86	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	That {disfmarker} that if you can do that {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact812	1587.47	1589.36	C	Grad	s^bk|s^df^ng	-1	0	Yeah , but that 's gonna be the trouble no matter what .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact813	1589.78	1589.97	C	Grad	qy^d^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact814	1589.97	1596.88	C	Grad	s^df	+1	1	No matter what format you choose , you 're gonna have the trou you 're gonna have the difficulty of relating the {disfmarker} the frame - level features {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact815	1594.1	1594.74	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	That 's right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact816	1594.9	1595.34	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	That 's true .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact817	1595.34	1599.52	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	That 's why I was trying to figure out what 's the best format for this representation .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact818	1599.21	1599.43	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact819	1599.52	1600.48	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And it 's still gonna be {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact821	1602.4	1602.86	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact820	1602.05	1604.05	F	PhD	s	-1	0	it 's still gonna be , uh , not direct .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact823	1604.23	1604.46	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact822	1604.13	1604.57	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	You know , it {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact824	1605.66	1614.09	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Or another example was , you know , uh , where in the language {disfmarker} where in the word sequence are people interrupting ?
Bdb001.F.dialogueact825	1614.28	1614.74	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact826	1615.92	1617.24	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	I guess that one 's actually easier .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact827	1618.88	1619.27	D	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	What about {disfmarker}
Bdb001.D.dialogueact828	1619.69	1628.92	D	PhD	qo^r	+1	0	what about , um , the idea of using a relational database to , uh , store the information from the XML ?
Bdb001.D.dialogueact829	1628.92	1629.62	D	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	So you would have {disfmarker}
Bdb001.D.dialogueact830	1630.22	1632.22	D	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	XML basically would {disfmarker}
Bdb001.D.dialogueact831	1633.67	1634.33	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh ,
Bdb001.D.dialogueact832	1634.33	1637.14	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	you {disfmarker} you could use the XML to put the data in ,
Bdb001.D.dialogueact833	1637.25	1639.37	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	and then when you get data out , you put it back in XML .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact834	1639.37	1642.08	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	So use XML as sort of the {disfmarker} the transfer format ,

Bdb001.D.dialogueact836	1642.08	1644.4	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	uh , but then you store the data in the database ,
Bdb001.D.dialogueact837	1644.4	1648.63	D	PhD	s^e	+1	0	which allows you to do all kinds of {pause} good search things in there .

Bdb001.C.dialogueact841	1654.99	1661.14	C	Grad	s^df	+1	1	so that , uh , you could define a single API and the {disfmarker} the storage could be flat XML files or a database .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact842	1659.01	1659.4	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact843	1661.51	1674.88	C	Grad	s^ba	+1	0	My opinion on that is for the s sort of stuff that we 're doing , {comment} I suspect it 's overkill to do a full relational database , that , um , just a flat file and , uh , search tools I bet will be enough .

Bdb001.C.dialogueact845	1675.82	1685.48	C	Grad	s	-1	0	But that 's the advantage of ATLAS , is that if we actually take {disfmarker} decide to go that route completely and we program to their API , then if we wanted to add a database later it would be pretty easy .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact846	1680.53	1680.98	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact847	1682.84	1683.13	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact848	1688.09	1695.01	F	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	It seems like the kind of thing you 'd do if {disfmarker} I don't know , if people start adding all kinds of s bells and whistles to the data .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact849	1695.23	1696.09	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And so that might be {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact850	1696.09	1705.18	F	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	I mean , it 'd be good for us to know {disfmarker} to use a format where we know we can easily , um , input that to some database if other people are using it .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact851	1703.99	1704.25	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact852	1705.62	1706.21	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Something like that .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact853	1706.55	1716.99	C	Grad	s^bd^na	+1	0	I guess I 'm just a little hesitant to try to go whole hog on sort of the {disfmarker} the whole framework that {disfmarker} that NIST is talking about , with ATLAS and a database and all that sort of stuff ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact854	1707.47	1707.74	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact855	1716.99	1719.97	C	Grad	s^df	+1	0	cuz it 's a big learning curve , just to get going .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact856	1718.66	1719.02	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact857	1719.33	1719.69	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact858	1719.97	1724.3	C	Grad	s^cs^df	-1	0	Whereas if we just do a flat file format , sure , it may not be as efficient
Bdb001.C.dialogueact859	1724.3	1727.23	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	but everyone can program in Perl and {disfmarker} and use it .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact860	1727.25	1727.75	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact861	1729.16	1729.41	C	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bdb001.A.dialogueact863	1729.77	1730.33	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But this is {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact862	1729.41	1730.51	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	So , as opposed to {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact864	1730.49	1740.8	A	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I 'm still , um , {vocalsound} not convinced that you can do much at all on the text {disfmarker} on the flat file that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} you know , the text representation .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact865	1741.77	1742.05	A	PhD	%	-1	0	e
Bdb001.A.dialogueact866	1742.05	1750.66	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Because the text representation is gonna be , uh , not reflecting the structure of {disfmarker} of your words and annotations .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact867	1751.59	1752.39	A	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	It 's just {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact868	1751.81	1754.41	C	Grad	qw^df^nd^rt	-1	0	Well , if it 's not representing it , then how do you recover it ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact869	1754.41	1755.58	C	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	Of course it 's representing it .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact870	1754.91	1755.17	A	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact871	1755.17	1756.02	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	You {disfmarker} you have to {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact873	1756.02	1758.09	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	what you have to do is you have to basically {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact872	1755.58	1756.62	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	That 's the whole point .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact874	1758.77	1765.0	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Y yeah . You can use Perl to read it in and construct a internal representation that is essentially a lattice .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact875	1766.57	1768.0	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But , the {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact878	1768.42	1768.83	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and then {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact877	1768.41	1768.58	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact876	1768.07	1768.46	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact879	1768.58	1769.73	C	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	Well , that was a different point .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact882	1770.12	1770.56	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact880	1769.82	1770.08	C	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact881	1770.08	1772.39	C	Grad	s^df.%-	-1	0	So what I was saying is that {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact883	1772.4	1773.56	A	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	But that 's what you 'll have to do .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact885	1774.31	1774.72	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	Bec - be
Bdb001.C.dialogueact884	1774.04	1775.76	C	Grad	s^df^ng	-1	0	For Perl {disfmarker} if you want to just do Perl .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact886	1775.76	1779.28	C	Grad	s^nd	+1	0	If you wanted to use the structured XML query language , that 's a different thing .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact887	1779.28	1789.34	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	And it 's a set of tools {vocalsound} that let you specify given the D - DDT {disfmarker} DTD of the document , um , what sorts of structural searches you want to do .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact888	1790.38	1801.69	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	So you want to say that , you know , you 're looking for , um , a tag within a tag within a particular tag that has this particular text in it , um , and , uh , refers to a particular value .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact889	1803.03	1810.24	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	And so the point isn't that an end - user , who is looking for a query like you specified , wouldn't program it in this language .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact890	1810.24	1814.48	C	Grad	s^e	+1	1	What you would do is , someone would build a tool that used that as a library .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact891	1816.36	1820.4	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	So that they {disfmarker} so that you wouldn't have to construct the internal representations yourself .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact892	1819.11	1819.33	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	Is a {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact893	1822.37	1829.54	F	PhD	s	-1	0	See , I think the kinds of questions , at least in the next {disfmarker} to the end of this year , are {disfmarker} there may be a lot of different ones ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact894	1829.54	1830.92	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but they 'll all have a similar nature .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact895	1830.92	1838.67	F	PhD	s	-1	0	They 'll be looking at either a word - level prosodic , uh , an {disfmarker} a value ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact897	1839.06	1839.45	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact896	1838.67	1839.69	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	like a continuous value ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact898	1839.69	1841.11	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	like the slope of something .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact899	1841.46	1841.7	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	But
Bdb001.F.dialogueact900	1842.4	1851.48	F	PhD	s	-1	0	you know , we 'll do something where we {disfmarker} some kind of data reduction where the prosodic features are sort o uh , either at the word - level or at the segment - level ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact901	1851.48	1851.77	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact902	1851.48	1852.5	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	or {disfmarker} or something like that .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact903	1852.5	1859.43	F	PhD	s	-1	0	They 're not gonna be at the phone - level and they 're no not gonna be at the frame - level when we get done with sort of giving them simpler shapes and things .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact904	1860.3	1862.81	F	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	And so the main thing is just being able {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact905	1864.97	1866.25	F	PhD	s	+1	0	Well , I guess , the two goals .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact906	1866.25	1874.02	F	PhD	s^df	+1	0	Um , one that Chuck mentioned is starting out with something that we don't have to start over , that we don't have to throw away if other people want to extend it for other kinds of questions ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact907	1872.57	1872.84	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact908	1874.34	1886.68	F	PhD	s^df	+1	0	and being able to at least get enough , uh , information out on {disfmarker} where we condition the location of features on information that 's in the kind of file that you {pause} put up there .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact909	1887.24	1888.4	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And that would {disfmarker} that would do it ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact911	1888.83	1888.93	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact912	1888.93	1891.49	C	Grad	s	-1	0	I think that there are quick and dirty solutions ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact910	1888.62	1889.45	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	I mean , for me .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact913	1891.49	1894.78	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and then there are long - term , big - infrastructure solutions .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact914	1894.78	1898.17	C	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	And so {vocalsound} we want to try to pick something that lets us do a little bit of both .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact915	1897.47	1898.18	F	PhD	s^2	-1	0	In the between ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact916	1898.18	1898.54	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact917	1898.54	1901.2	F	PhD	s^df^na	-1	0	And especially that the representation doesn't have to be thrown away ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact918	1899.1	1899.53	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact919	1901.3	1901.61	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact920	1901.36	1903.33	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	even if your tools change .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact921	1903.82	1904.73	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	And so it seems to me that {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact922	1904.73	1907.55	C	Grad	s	+1	2	I mean , I have to look at it again to see whether it can really do what we want ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact923	1908.01	1918.43	C	Grad	s	+1	0	but if we use the ATLAS external file representation , um , it seems like it 's rich enough that you could do quick tools just as I said in Perl ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact925	1919.08	1925.1	C	Grad	s	+1	0	and then later on if we choose to go up the learning curve , we can use the whole ATLAS inter infrastructure ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact924	1919.01	1919.4	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact926	1925.41	1926.6	F	PhD	s^na	-1	0	I mean , that sounds good to me .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact927	1926.21	1927.45	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	which has all that built in .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact928	1926.73	1927.35	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact929	1928.07	1928.16	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	So
Bdb001.F.dialogueact930	1928.16	1931.03	F	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	if {disfmarker} if you would l look at that and let us know what you think .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact931	1930.5	1930.69	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Sure .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact932	1931.09	1932.87	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	I mean , I think we 're sort of guinea pigs ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact933	1932.87	1934.91	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	cuz I {disfmarker} I want to get the prosody work done
Bdb001.F.dialogueact934	1934.91	1938.44	F	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	but I don't want to waste time , you know , getting the {disfmarker}

Bdb001.A.dialogueact942	1946.39	1952.84	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	well , maybe you should actually look at it yourself too to get a sense of what it is you 'll {disfmarker} you 'll be dealing with ,

Bdb001.A.dialogueact943	1952.84	1958.48	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because , um , you know , Adam might have one opinion but you might have another ,

Bdb001.C.dialogueact980	2008.62	2009.84	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	we have expertise here ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact981	2010.41	2013.04	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and so if we pick something else , there 's the learning - curve problem .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact982	2013.37	2015.66	C	Grad	s^df	+1	2	But , I mean , it is just something we developed at ICSI .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact984	2016.31	2018.11	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Is there an {disfmarker} is there an IP - API ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact983	2016.26	2016.73	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	And so {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact985	2019.13	2019.33	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact986	2019.7	2020.1	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact987	2019.86	2020.79	C	Grad	s^na	+1	1	There 's an API for it .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact988	2020.79	2021.45	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	And , uh ,
Bdb001.A.dialogueact989	2022.0	2024.51	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	There used to be a problem that they get too large ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact990	2022.13	2024.0	C	Grad	s^na	+1	1	a bunch of libraries , P - file utilities .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact991	2024.97	2029.71	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and so {pause} basically the {disfmarker} uh the filesystem wouldn't {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact992	2029.07	2030.43	C	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	Well , that 's gonna be a problem no matter what .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact993	2030.43	2032.87	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	You have the two - gigabyte limit on the filesystem size .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact994	2033.14	2035.15	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	And we definitely hit that with Broadcast News .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact995	2036.72	2045.35	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Maybe you could extend the API to , uh , support , uh , like splitting up , you know , conceptually one file into smaller files on disk
Bdb001.A.dialogueact996	2045.47	2049.85	A	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	so that you can essentially , you know , have arbitrarily long f
Bdb001.C.dialogueact997	2047.5	2047.78	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yep .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact998	2048.51	2050.16	C	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	Most of the tools can handle that .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1000	2050.28	2050.48	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact999	2050.27	2050.69	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So that
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1001	2051.2	2052.45	C	Grad	s	-1	0	we didn't do it at the API - level .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1002	2052.45	2053.68	C	Grad	s	-1	0	We did it at the t tool - level .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1003	2053.68	2057.39	C	Grad	s	-1	0	That {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} most {disfmarker} many of them can s you can specify several P - files
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1004	2057.68	2059.01	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and they 'll just be done sequentially .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1005	2059.68	2060.04	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1006	2060.25	2060.45	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1007	2062.08	2062.52	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So , I guess ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1008	2062.52	2062.76	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1009	2062.76	2066.54	F	PhD	s^co	-1	0	if {disfmarker} if you and Don can {disfmarker} if you can show him the P - file stuff and see .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1010	2065.99	2066.25	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Sure .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1011	2066.54	2068.2	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	So this would be like for the F - zero {disfmarker}
Bdb001.B.dialogueact1013	2067.05	2067.47	B	Grad	b	-1	0	True .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1012	2066.81	2070.2	C	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , if you do " man P - file " or " apropos P - file " , you 'll see a lot .
Bdb001.B.dialogueact1014	2069.19	2070.87	B	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	I 've used the P - file , I think .
Bdb001.B.dialogueact1015	2070.87	2076.03	B	Grad	s^bd	-1	0	I 've looked at it at least , briefly , I think when we were doing s something .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1016	2074.17	2075.67	A	PhD	qw	-1	0	What does the P stand for anyway ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1017	2075.65	2076.45	C	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I have no idea .
Bdb001.B.dialogueact1018	2078.26	2078.54	B	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	Oh , in there .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1019	2080.04	2081.43	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	I didn't de I didn't develop it .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1020	2081.43	2083.12	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	You know , it was {disfmarker} I think it was Dave Johnson .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1021	2084.02	2086.0	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	So it 's all part of the Quicknet library .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1022	2086.0	2087.28	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	It has all the utilities for it .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1023	2088.36	2090.4	A	PhD	s^ar|s^nd	-1	0	No , P - files were around way before Quicknet .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1025	2090.95	2094.67	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	P - files were {disfmarker} were around when {disfmarker} w with , um , {vocalsound} RAP .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1024	2090.87	2091.24	C	Grad	qy^bh^rt	-1	0	Oh , were they ?
Bdb001.D.dialogueact1026	2094.85	2095.37	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1027	2095.41	2095.81	A	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1028	2095.54	2096.99	F	PhD	s^j	-1	0	It 's like the history of ICSI .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1029	2096.56	2097.64	A	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	You worked with P - files .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1031	2097.58	2097.98	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1030	2097.15	2097.24	F	PhD	%	-1	0	Like {disfmarker}
Bdb001.D.dialogueact1032	2097.67	2098.12	D	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1033	2098.17	2099.05	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I worked with P - files .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1034	2098.55	2098.79	F	PhD	qy^bh^rt	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bdb001.D.dialogueact1035	2101.06	2102.32	D	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I don't remember what the " P " is , though .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1036	2103.66	2104.05	A	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1037	2105.12	2106.19	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	But there are ni they 're {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1038	2107.0	2110.2	C	Grad	s	-1	0	The {pause} Quicknet library has a bunch of things in it to handle P - files ,
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1039	2109.57	2109.87	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1040	2110.2	2111.07	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so it works pretty well .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1041	2112.208	2112.736	A	PhD	%	-1	0	
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1042	2112.25	2118.64	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And that isn't really , I guess , as important as the {disfmarker} the main {disfmarker} I don't know what you call it , the {disfmarker} the main sort of word - level {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1043	2117.74	2118.21	C	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	Neither do I .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact1044	2118.31	2119.56	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Probably stands for " Phil " .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact1045	2120.96	2121.51	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	Phil Kohn .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1046	2123.01	2123.56	C	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	It 's a Phil file ?
Bdb001.D.dialogueact1047	2124.05	2124.34	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact1048	2125.9	2126.56	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	That 's my guess .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1049	2126.96	2127.15	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Huh .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1050	2128.65	2128.97	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	OK .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1051	2128.97	2130.21	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Well , that 's really useful .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1052	2130.21	2133.47	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , this is exactly the kind of thing that I wanted to settle .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1053	2133.54	2133.93	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1054	2134.36	2134.79	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1055	2136.19	2138.87	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , I 've been meaning to look at the ATLAS stuff again anyway .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1056	2136.62	2137.08	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Great .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1057	2139.06	2140.11	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So , just keep {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1058	2139.16	2139.48	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1059	2140.25	2142.45	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I guess it 's also sort of a political deci
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1060	2142.45	2150.86	F	PhD	s^na	-1	0	I mean , if {disfmarker} if you feel like that 's a community that would be good to tie into anyway , then it 's {disfmarker} sounds like it 's worth doing .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1061	2149.92	2150.68	C	Grad	s^bk|s.%-	-1	0	Yeah , I think it {disfmarker} it w
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1062	2150.61	2151.4	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	j I think there 's {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1063	2151.03	2154.79	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And , w uh , as I said , I {disfmarker} what I did with this stuff {disfmarker} I based it on theirs .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1064	2154.79	2157.5	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	It 's just they hadn't actually come up with an external format yet .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1065	2158.13	2162.99	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	So now that they have come up with a format , it doesn't {disfmarker} it seems pretty reasonable to use it .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1066	2161.12	2161.79	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1067	2163.96	2165.05	C	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	But let me look at it again .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1068	2164.91	2165.21	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1069	2165.2	2165.72	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	great .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1070	2165.74	2166.69	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	As I said , that {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1071	2166.27	2167.54	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Cuz we actually can start {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1072	2167.09	2169.13	C	Grad	s	-1	0	There 's one level {disfmarker} there 's one more level of indirection
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1073	2169.13	2171.63	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and I 'm just blanking on exactly how it works .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1074	2172.11	2173.24	C	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	I gotta look at it again .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1075	2174.88	2178.59	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	I mean , we can start with , um , I guess , this input from Dave 's ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1076	2178.93	2181.87	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which you had printed out , the channelized input .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1077	2181.87	2184.27	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Cuz he has all of the channels ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1078	2184.46	2186.66	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	you know , with the channels in the tag and stuff like that .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1079	2185.28	2185.91	C	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	Yeah , I 've seen it .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1080	2186.66	2188.55	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So that would be i directly ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1081	2189.03	2189.21	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yep .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1083	2189.71	2190.66	C	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Easy {disfmarker} easy to map .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1082	2189.33	2189.68	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1084	2190.34	2190.79	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1085	2190.79	2199.9	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	And so then it would just be a matter of getting {disfmarker} making sure to handle the annotations that are , you know , not at the word - level and , um , t to import the
Bdb001.B.dialogueact1086	2198.84	2200.44	B	Grad	qw^rt	-1	0	Where are those annotations coming from ?
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1087	2200.78	2203.21	F	PhD	s^no.%--	-1	0	Well , right now , I g Jane would {disfmarker} {vocalsound} would {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1088	2202.49	2202.79	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1089	2204.62	2204.82	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1090	2207.66	2209.32	E	Postdoc	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	Are you talking about the overlap a annotations ?
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1091	2209.29	2209.6	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1092	2209.6	2213.13	F	PhD	s^df^na	-1	0	any kind of annotation {pause} that , like , isn't already there .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1093	2213.13	2214.77	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Uh , you know , anything you can envision .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1094	2214.05	2214.31	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1095	2215.07	2219.91	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So what I was imagining was {disfmarker} um , so Dave says we can have unlimited numbers of green ribbons .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1096	2220.42	2223.9	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And so put , uh , a {disfmarker} a green ribbon on for an overlap code .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1097	2224.29	2226.05	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And since we w we {disfmarker}
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1098	2226.76	2230.72	E	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I think it 's important to remain flexible regarding the time bins for now .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1099	2231.3	2233.17	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And so it 's nice to have {disfmarker}
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1100	2233.64	2239.49	E	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	However , you know , you want to have it , uh , time time uh , located in the discourse .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1101	2240.01	2240.36	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1102	2240.77	2241.16	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1103	2241.66	2248.48	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	if we {disfmarker} if we tie the overlap code to the first word in the overlap , then you 'll have a time - marking .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1104	2248.66	2250.74	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	It won't {disfmarker} it 'll be independent of the time bins ,
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1105	2250.87	2253.62	E	Postdoc	s^e	+1	0	however these e evolve , shrink , or whatever ,
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1106	2253.72	2254.16	E	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	increase ,
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1107	2254.16	2254.32	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	or {disfmarker}
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1108	2254.73	2257.09	E	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	Also , you could have different time bins for different purposes .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1109	2257.49	2264.09	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And having it tied to the first word in an overlap segment is unique , uh , you know , anchored , clear .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1110	2265.08	2266.83	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And it would just end up on a separate ribbon .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1112	2267.59	2267.86	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1111	2267.41	2269.56	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So the overlap coding is gonna be easy with respect to that .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1113	2272.06	2272.69	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	You look puzzled .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact1114	2273.34	2276.4	D	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I just {disfmarker} I don't quite understand what these things are .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1115	2275.57	2275.98	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .

Bdb001.E.dialogueact1130	2286.45	2288.34	E	Postdoc	s^bs	-1	0	W the idea is just to have a separate green ribbon ,

Bdb001.E.dialogueact1133	2291.25	2292.04	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	There 's a word here .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1134	2292.31	2294.74	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	This is the first word of an overlapping segment of any length ,

Bdb001.E.dialogueact1136	2299.94	2300.57	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	And , um ,
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1137	2301.53	2304.36	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	then you can indicate that this here was perhaps a ch a backchannel ,
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1138	2304.36	2307.31	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	or you can say that it was , um , a usurping of the turn ,
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1139	2307.31	2309.27	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	or you can {disfmarker} you know , any {disfmarker} any number of categories .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1140	2309.27	2315.76	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But the fact is , you have it time - tagged in a way that 's independent of the , uh , sp particular time bin that the word ends up in .

Bdb001.E.dialogueact1145	2320.53	2323.51	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it 's still unique and {disfmarker} and , uh , fits with the format ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1144	2320.09	2320.38	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1146	2324.32	2325.33	E	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	flexible , all that .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1147	2325.72	2326.14	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Um ,
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1148	2328.32	2329.23	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	it would be nice {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1149	2329.23	2329.54	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1150	2329.79	2335.91	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	eh , gr this is sort of r regarding {disfmarker} uh , uh it 's related but not directly germane to the topic of discussion ,
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1151	2335.91	2349.22	A	PhD	s	+1	0	but , when it comes to annotations , um , you often find yourself in the situation where you have {pause} different annotations {pause} of the same , say , word sequence .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1153	2350.32	2350.72	A	PhD	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	OK ?
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1152	2349.99	2350.19	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1155	2351.09	2356.69	A	PhD	s	+1	1	And sometimes the word sequences even differ slightly because they were edited s at one place but not the other .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1154	2351.03	2351.21	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1156	2357.21	2371.29	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So , once this data gets out there , some people might start annotating this for , I don't know , dialogue acts or , um , you know , topics or what the heck .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1157	2371.29	2371.65	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	You know ,
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1158	2371.76	2374.18	A	PhD	s	-1	0	there 's a zillion things that people might annotate this for .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1159	2374.92	2383.42	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And the only thing that is really sort of common among all the versi the various versions of this data is the word sequence ,
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1161	2383.84	2385.2	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	or approximately .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1160	2383.47	2383.62	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1162	2384.74	2385.42	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Or the time .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1163	2386.35	2387.01	A	PhD	s^m^na	-1	0	Or the times .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1164	2387.01	2392.64	A	PhD	s^ng	+1	1	But , see , if you 'd annotate dialogue acts , you don't necessarily want to {disfmarker} or topics {disfmarker} you don't really want to be dealing with time - marks .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1165	2387.27	2387.48	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	I guess .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1166	2392.74	2396.03	A	PhD	s^df|qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	You 'd {disfmarker} it 's much more efficient for them to just see the word sequence , right ?
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1167	2394.7	2395.06	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1168	2397.4	2403.78	A	PhD	s^bd^df	-1	0	I mean , most people aren't as sophisticated as {disfmarker} as we are here with , you know , uh , time alignments and stuff .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1169	2403.78	2404.11	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1170	2405.89	2408.04	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the point is {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1171	2407.74	2409.81	C	Grad	qy^cs^j.%--	-1	0	Should {disfmarker} should we mention some names on the people who are n ?
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1172	2409.82	2410.16	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1173	2410.97	2411.28	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1174	2411.75	2412.18	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1175	2412.54	2419.58	A	PhD	s	-1	0	the p my point is that {pause} you 're gonna end up with , uh , word sequences that are differently annotated .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1176	2419.58	2430.04	A	PhD	s	+1	0	And {pause} you want some tool , uh , that is able to sort of merge these different annotations back into a single , uh , version .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1177	2431.05	2431.46	A	PhD	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	OK ?
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1178	2432.15	2442.92	A	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Um , and we had this problem very massively , uh , at SRI when we worked , uh , a while back on , {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} well , on dialogue acts as well as , uh , you know ,
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1179	2443.23	2444.45	A	PhD	fh|qw	-1	0	um , what was it ?
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1180	2444.76	2445.09	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1181	2445.38	2446.64	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , all the Switchboard in it .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1182	2445.9	2446.64	A	PhD	s	-1	0	utterance types .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1184	2446.82	2450.42	A	PhD	s	-1	0	There 's , uh , automatic , uh , punctuation and stuff like that .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1183	2446.64	2446.98	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1185	2451.07	2460.01	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Because we had one set of {pause} annotations that were based on , uh , one version of the transcripts with a particular segmentation ,
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1186	2460.38	2468.21	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	and then we had another version that was based on , uh , a different s slightly edited version of the transcripts with a different segmentation .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1187	2468.21	2476.2	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So , {vocalsound} we had these two different versions which were {disfmarker} you know , you could tell they were from the same source but they weren't identical .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1188	2476.2	2483.27	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So it was extremely hard {vocalsound} to reliably merge these two back together to correlate the information from the different annotations .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1189	2483.09	2483.33	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yep .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1190	2483.57	2486.46	C	Grad	s	+1	0	I {disfmarker} I don't see any way that file formats are gonna help us with that .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1191	2486.09	2486.5	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	No .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1192	2486.46	2488.03	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} it 's all a question of semantic .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1193	2487.67	2487.99	A	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	No .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1194	2488.31	2500.71	A	PhD	s	+1	0	But once you have a file format , I can imagine writing {disfmarker} not personally , but someone writing a tool that is essentially an alignment tool , um , that mediates between various versions ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1195	2488.66	2489.0	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1196	2496.91	2497.16	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1197	2500.83	2506.18	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and {disfmarker} uh , sort of like th uh , you know , you have this thing in UNIX where you have , uh , diff .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1198	2505.45	2505.65	C	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Diff .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1199	2505.94	2507.04	F	PhD	s^2	-1	0	W - diff or diff .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1200	2506.73	2514.6	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	There 's the , uh , diff that actually tries to reconcile different {disfmarker} two diffs f {comment} based on the same original .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1201	2507.04	2507.31	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1202	2511.83	2512.58	E	Postdoc	qy	-1	0	Is it S - diff ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1203	2514.15	2514.38	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1204	2514.74	2515.07	E	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	Mmm .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1205	2515.51	2516.36	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Something like that ,
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1206	2516.93	2523.03	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um , but operating on these lattices that are really what 's behind this {disfmarker} uh , this annotation format .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1207	2522.36	2522.63	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yep .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1208	2523.68	2524.08	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1210	2523.87	2530.22	C	Grad	s	-1	0	There 's actually a diff library you can use {pause} to do things like that that {disfmarker} so you have different formats .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1209	2523.79	2525.23	F	PhD	s^cs.%-	-1	0	You could definitely do that with the {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1211	2528.89	2536.26	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So somewhere in the API you would like to have like a merge or some {disfmarker} some function that merges two {disfmarker} two versions .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1212	2535.6	2536.83	C	Grad	s^bk|s^ng	-1	0	Yeah , I think it 's gonna be very hard .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1213	2536.83	2541.91	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Any sort of structured anything when you try to merge is really , really hard
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1214	2538.84	2539.06	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1215	2541.91	2542.43	C	Grad	s^df.%--	-1	0	because you ha i
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1216	2542.71	2544.26	C	Grad	s^df	+1	0	The hard part isn't the file format .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1217	2544.26	2547.02	C	Grad	s^df	+1	1	The hard part is specifying what you mean by " merge " .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1218	2545.07	2545.26	A	PhD	s^2.%-	-1	0	Is {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1219	2546.73	2547.33	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1221	2547.79	2548.82	C	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	And that 's very difficult .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1220	2547.39	2556.38	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	But the one thing that would work here actually for i that is more reliable than the utterances is the {disfmarker} the speaker ons and offs .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1222	2556.38	2557.28	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So if you have a good ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1224	2558.41	2561.67	C	Grad	s^na.%-	-1	0	But this is exactly what I mean , is that {disfmarker} that the problem i
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1223	2557.93	2558.28	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1225	2559.16	2559.57	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1226	2560.71	2562.65	F	PhD	s	-1	0	You just have to know wha what to tie it to .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1227	2562.56	2562.8	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1228	2562.8	2563.29	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	exactly .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1229	2563.29	2565.74	C	Grad	s:qw	-1	0	The problem is saying " what are the semantics ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1230	2563.48	2563.97	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1231	2565.74	2567.13	C	Grad	s:qw	-1	0	what do you mean by " merge " ? "
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1232	2566.23	2567.09	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right , right .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1233	2566.74	2567.05	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1235	2567.88	2574.74	A	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so just to let you know what we {disfmarker} where we kluged it by , uh , doing {disfmarker} uh , by doing {disfmarker} Hhh .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1234	2567.74	2568.04	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1236	2575.3	2576.49	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Both were based on words ,
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1237	2576.49	2582.68	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so , bo we have two versions of the same words intersp you know , sprinkled with {disfmarker} with different tags for annotations .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1238	2582.02	2582.82	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And then you did diff .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1239	2583.13	2583.98	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And we did diff .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1241	2583.98	2584.58	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly !
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1240	2583.89	2584.11	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1242	2584.11	2585.1	C	Grad	s	-1	0	that 's just what I thought .

Bdb001.A.dialogueact1245	2586.67	2587.06	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1246	2587.56	2589.19	A	PhD	s	-1	0	But , you know , it had lots of errors
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1247	2589.24	2591.72	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and things would end up in the wrong order , and so forth .

Bdb001.A.dialogueact1249	2592.32	2592.7	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so ,

Bdb001.A.dialogueact1254	2597.51	2602.26	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because it was basically reducing everything to {disfmarker} uh , to {disfmarker} uh , uh , to textual alignment .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1255	2600.48	2601.05	C	Grad	s^2	-1	0	A textual {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1256	2602.97	2603.49	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1257	2603.49	2604.07	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1258	2603.88	2604.06	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	But ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1259	2604.06	2619.45	F	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	d isn't that something where whoever {disfmarker} if {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if the people who are making changes , say in the transcripts , cuz this all happened when the transcripts were different {disfmarker} ye um , if they tie it to something , like if they tied it to the acoustic segment {disfmarker} if they {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1260	2619.97	2620.66	F	PhD	qy^d^f^rt	-1	0	You know what I mean ?
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1261	2620.73	2624.89	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Then {disfmarker} Or if they tied it to an acoustic segment and we had the time - marks , that would help .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1263	2625.15	2625.39	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1262	2624.89	2632.12	F	PhD	s	-1	0	But the problem is exactly as Adam said , that you get , you know , y you don't have that information or it 's lost in the merge somehow ,
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1265	2632.7	2633.54	E	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	Well , can I ask one question ?
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1264	2632.24	2632.38	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1266	2633.54	2641.25	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It {disfmarker} it seems to me that , um , we will have o an official version of the corpus , which will be only one {disfmarker} one version in terms of the words {disfmarker} where the words are concerned .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1267	2641.3	2645.0	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	We 'd still have the {disfmarker} the merging issue maybe if coding were done independently of the {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1268	2645.44	2646.35	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And you 're gonna get that
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1269	2645.62	2646.49	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1270	2646.35	2650.53	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because if the data gets out , people will do all kinds of things to it .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1271	2651.31	2662.24	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	And , uh , s you know , several years from now you might want to look into , um , the prosody of referring expressions .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1272	2662.44	2668.2	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	And someone at the university of who knows where has annotated the referring expressions .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1274	2668.42	2672.5	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So you want to get that annotation and bring it back in line with your data .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1273	2668.39	2668.67	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1276	2673.04	2673.76	A	PhD	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	OK ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1275	2672.72	2675.4	C	Grad	s	-1	0	But unfortunately they 've also hand - edited it .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1277	2673.08	2673.62	E	Postdoc	%	-1	0	OK , then {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1278	2674.27	2674.88	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But they 've also {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1279	2674.88	2675.41	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1280	2675.41	2686.05	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And so that 's exactly what we should {disfmarker} somehow when you distribute the data , say that {disfmarker} you know , that {disfmarker} have some way of knowing how to merge it back in and asking people to try to do that .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1281	2675.96	2676.23	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1282	2676.73	2676.97	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1283	2677.44	2677.69	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1284	2678.28	2678.8	E	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	Well , then the {disfmarker}
Bdb001.D.dialogueact1285	2685.16	2687.45	D	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	What 's {disfmarker} what 's wrong with {pause} doing times ?
Bdb001.D.dialogueact1287	2687.45	2687.66	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	I {disfmarker}
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1286	2687.26	2687.73	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	I agree .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1288	2687.73	2688.66	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	That was what I was wondering .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1289	2687.96	2689.27	F	PhD	h|s.%--	-1	0	Uh , yeah , time is the {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1291	2690.07	2690.35	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	Well ,
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1290	2689.75	2690.46	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Time is unique .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1292	2690.62	2692.02	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	You were saying that you didn't think we should {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1293	2690.79	2691.83	F	PhD	s^fe^j	-1	0	Time is passing !
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1294	2692.06	2696.09	A	PhD	s^j	-1	0	Time {disfmarker} time {disfmarker} times are ephemeral .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1295	2692.59	2693.24	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	Andreas was saying {disfmarker}
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1296	2693.45	2693.59	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1297	2694.93	2697.05	C	Grad	qw	-1	0	what if they haven't notated with them , times ?
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1298	2695.49	2695.59	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1299	2696.22	2698.35	F	PhD	s	-1	0	He {disfmarker} he 's a language modeling person , though .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1300	2697.85	2698.15	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1301	2698.05	2698.91	C	Grad	fg|s.%--	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so imagine {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1302	2698.91	2700.53	C	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	I think his {disfmarker} his example is a good one .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1303	2700.53	2705.96	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Imagine that this person who developed the corpus of the referring expressions didn't include time .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1304	2704.64	2705.09	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1305	2706.21	2706.48	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1306	2706.72	2708.37	C	Grad	s	-1	0	He included references to words .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1307	2706.79	2706.93	E	Postdoc	%	-1	0	Ach !
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1310	2708.66	2709.04	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1309	2708.62	2711.64	C	Grad	s	-1	0	He said that at this word is when {disfmarker} when it happened .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1308	2708.51	2708.79	E	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	Well , then {disfmarker}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1311	2710.99	2711.51	A	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	Or she .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1313	2711.93	2712.29	C	Grad	s^m^na	-1	0	Or she .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1312	2711.57	2715.22	E	Postdoc	qy	-1	0	But then couldn't you just indirectly figure out the time {pause} tied to the word ?
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1314	2712.2	2713.01	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	But still they {disfmarker}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1315	2713.76	2714.42	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1316	2714.42	2714.79	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Sure .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1318	2714.85	2716.58	C	Grad	qw^ng^rt	-1	0	But what if {disfmarker} what if they change the words ?
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1317	2714.42	2714.77	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1319	2716.76	2716.96	E	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	Not {disfmarker}
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1320	2717.05	2717.29	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	Well ,
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1321	2717.52	2719.58	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but you 'd have some anchoring point .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1322	2719.58	2720.68	E	Postdoc	s^ng	-1	0	He couldn't have changed all the words .
Bdb001.D.dialogueact1323	2720.47	2722.98	D	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	But can they change the words without changing the time of the word ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1324	2721.22	2721.56	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Sure .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1325	2721.56	2722.48	C	Grad	s^arp	-1	0	But they could have changed it a little .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1326	2723.96	2730.07	C	Grad	s	-1	0	The {disfmarker} the point is , that {disfmarker} that they may have annotated it off a word transcript that isn't the same as our word transcript ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1327	2730.07	2731.24	C	Grad	qw	-1	0	so how do you merge it back in ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1328	2731.24	2732.25	C	Grad	s	-1	0	I understand what you 're saying .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1329	2731.84	2731.95	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1330	2731.95	2732.7	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1331	2732.78	2737.77	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And I {disfmarker} I guess the answer is , um , it 's gonna be different every time .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1332	2738.27	2739.46	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	It 's j it 's just gonna be {disfmarker}
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1334	2738.68	2738.74	E	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1333	2738.33	2738.74	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1336	2740.29	2742.06	C	Grad	s	-1	0	I it 's exactly what I said before ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1335	2739.8	2741.4	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	You only know the boundaries of the {disfmarker}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1337	2742.06	2744.26	C	Grad	s	-1	0	which is that " what do you mean by " merge " ? "
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1338	2744.48	2748.95	C	Grad	qw	-1	0	So in this case where you have the words and you don't have the times , well , what do you mean by " merge " ?
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1340	2749.18	2751.64	C	Grad	s	-1	0	If you tell me what you mean , I can write a program to do it .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1339	2749.14	2749.35	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1341	2751.5	2751.73	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1342	2751.73	2755.76	F	PhD	s	-1	0	You can merge at the level of the representation that the other person preserved and that 's it .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1343	2755.5	2755.78	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1344	2755.78	2757.32	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And that 's about all you can do .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1345	2756.11	2758.79	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And beyond that , all you know is {disfmarker} is relative ordering
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1346	2758.79	2760.12	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and sometimes even that is wrong .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1347	2760.35	2765.19	C	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so in {disfmarker} so in this one you would have to do a best match between the word sequences ,
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1348	2761.08	2761.37	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1349	2765.41	2765.7	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1350	2765.64	2769.32	C	Grad	s	-1	0	extract the times f from the best match of theirs to yours ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1351	2769.32	2770.06	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and use that .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1352	2769.33	2771.93	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And then infer that their time - marks are somewhere in between .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1353	2771.2	2771.44	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1354	2771.93	2772.69	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , exactly .
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1355	2772.77	2778.48	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But it could be that they just {disfmarker} uh , I mean , it could be that they chunked {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they lost certain utterances and all that stuff ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1356	2777.64	2777.88	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right ,
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1357	2777.88	2778.38	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	exactly .
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1358	2778.38	2779.87	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So it could get very , very ugly .
