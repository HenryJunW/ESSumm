Topics discussed by the Berkeley Meeting Recorder group included a potential collaboration with another ICSI member regarding the analysis of inference structures , efforts by speaker mn005 to detect speaker overlap , the current status on recordings and transcriptions , and future efforts to collect meeting data.
In addition to weekly meetings by the BMR group , efforts are in progress to record meetings by other ICSI research groups , as well as routine discussions by non-ICSI members.
