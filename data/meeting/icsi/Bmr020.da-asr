Bmr020.F.dialogueact48	41.54	42.5	F	Professor	z	-1	0	on yeah i did have to 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact49	42.73	42.98	F	Professor	z	-1	0	to 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact50	44.39	46.02	E	Grad	z	-1	0	change what in the summer anyway change that in the software where 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact51	46.47	47.41	A	Grad	z	-1	0	change what in the summer where like you just don't 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact52	47.1	51.61	E	Grad	z	-1	0	like you just don't like if you if it starts catching heroes like in the driver or something 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact53	52.4	54.58	E	Grad	z	-1	0	in the car or somewhere in the hardware where if you're 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact54	54.58	59.98	E	Grad	z	-1	0	hardware where if you're seeing zero come across one channel you should add some least for like 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact55	59.98	60.8	E	Grad	z	-1	0	and least for like small nice phone 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact56	60.925	61.945	A	Grad	z	-1	0	and certainly we could do that but small nice phone 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact57	61.945	63.125	A	Grad	z	-1	0	certainly we could do that but i don't think it's a good idea we can do that post 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact58	63.125	66.195	A	Grad	z	-1	0	we can do that post processing if if the a petition needs it postal well i i 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact59	64.729	65.009	E	Grad	z	-1	0	processing if if the a petition needs 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact61	66.396	67.636	B	PhD	z	-1	0	it postal system well i i actually don't 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact60	66.278	74.438	F	Professor	z	-1	0	it postal system well i i actually don't know what the default is anymore how we're using the the friend and stuff but for for when we used to actually friend and but um 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact63	75.068	75.738	A	Grad	z	-1	0	an argument there isn't 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact62	74.591	75.151	F	Professor	z	-1	0	an argument friend and but um there isn't 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact64	75.608	78.328	F	Professor	z	-1	0	an argument there isn't there is an option in austin which 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact65	78.498	78.888	F	Professor	z	-1	0	which 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact66	80.737	88.94	F	Professor	z	-1	0	then when i first put it in uh like amazing actually wrote things uh i did actually put in a random dancer so there was and but 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact67	88.421	88.681	E	Grad	z	-1	0	so there was and but 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact68	88.94	94.36	F	Professor	z	-1	0	so there was and but then i realized that putting in random bit was equivalent to adding uh adding flat spectrum and 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact69	94.46	94.68	E	Grad	z	-1	0	and 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact70	94.935	100.415	F	Professor	z	-1	0	and it was a lot faster just at a constant to the into the spectrum so i just started doing that instead of calling 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact71	98.111	98.431	E	Grad	z	-1	0	into the spectrum 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact73	100.522	100.812	E	Grad	z	-1	0	doing that instead of calling 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact72	100.415	102.205	F	Professor	z	-1	0	doing that instead of calling rand or something 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact74	102.27	102.44	E	Grad	z	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr020.F.dialogueact75	102.315	102.475	F	Professor	z	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr020.F.dialogueact76	105.043	105.943	F	Professor	z	-1	0	it it does 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact77	109.61	110.96	F	Professor	s^fe^tc	-1	0	see here we all are 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact78	111.991	112.351	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	uh so the only agenda 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact79	112.351	118.466	A	Grad	s^t	+1	2	so the only agenda items were jane was chain learn to talk about some of the i b. m. transcription process i sort of 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact80	113.058	113.598	F	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt^t3	-1	0	items were jane 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact81	118.466	121.307	A	Grad	s	-1	0	i sort of condensed the three things you said into that and then 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact82	121.787	127.827	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and then just i only have like this afternoon and maybe tomorrow morning to get anything done before i go to japan for ten days 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact83	128.236	132.006	A	Grad	s^co	-1	0	so if there's anything that absolutely desperately needs to be done should let me know now

Bmr020.G.dialogueact326	476.92	480.3	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so you treat back channels last month speeches pauses you

Bmr020.G.dialogueact329	480.87	482.67	G	PhD	s	+1	1	you still have significant overlap you know 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact330	482.82	498.28	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	overlap you know it goes down from maybe for switchboard's goes down from fourteen percent of the too maybe uh i don't know eleven percent or something it's it's not a dramatic 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact331	498.28	500.01	G	PhD	s	-1	0	it's it's not a dramatic change so 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact333	500.323	500.533	A	Grad	b	-1	0	so

Bmr020.G.dialogueact334	501.891	502.221	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	anyway so it's uh 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact335	502.221	502.951	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so it's uh 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact336	504.29	506.61	G	PhD	s	-1	0	that was that was one set of the house and then the second 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact337	506.61	515.385	G	PhD	s	+1	2	the house and then the second one was just basically the stuff we had uh and the sheltie paper and how overlaps affect the recognition performance 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact338	507.629	507.709	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	one was just basically 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact339	511.213	511.363	A	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	sheltie paper and

Bmr020.G.dialogueact342	516.223	519.593	G	PhD	s	+1	1	and we read scored things um a little bit more carefully real some 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact343	519.593	522.873	G	PhD	s	-1	0	real some fixed the transcripts and numerous ways 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact344	523.583	527.253	G	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	uh but mostly we added one one number which was 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact345	528.157	532.047	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	what if you uh basically school or ignoring all so 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact346	532.89	542.536	G	PhD	s	+1	0	so so that the conjecture from the and so t. results was that most of the at it recognition areas from infections due to background speech 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact347	544.04	550.7	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	we scored all their uh recognition results uh in such a way that the um 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact348	550.81	551.32	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	the um 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact349	552.34	553.86	A	Grad	qw^rt	-1	0	oh by the way who's on channel four you're yeah 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact351	553.99	554.97	A	Grad	s	-1	0	on channel four you're getting a lot of breath yeah i was just 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact350	553.8	554.0	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	on channel four you're getting a lot of breath yeah i was just 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact353	554.313	555.593	B	PhD	s	-1	0	getting a lot of breath i was just wondering huh 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact352	554.053	554.433	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	getting a lot of breath i was just 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact354	555.683	555.823	B	PhD	b	-1	0	wondering huh 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact355	556.078	556.618	E	Grad	s	-1	0	that's me 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact356	559.71	561.13	G	PhD	s	-1	0	that's right um well bouncing working hard 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact357	561.317	561.847	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	that's right 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact358	562.392	562.652	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	okay so 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact359	562.652	570.527	G	PhD	s	-1	0	okay so so if you have the foreground speaker speaking here and then there's some background speech maybe overlapping it somehow 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact360	571.25	573.98	G	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um and this is the time then that we used 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact361	574.57	576.89	G	PhD	s	-1	0	right then of course you're going to get a certain hours here and here 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact362	577.068	577.288	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right so 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact363	577.29	577.56	G	PhD	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right so 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact364	577.92	579.42	G	PhD	s	+1	0	right so we scored everything and i 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact365	579.42	582.56	G	PhD	s	+1	0	and i must say that miss scoring tools are pretty nice for this away 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact366	583.055	589.227	G	PhD	s	+1	0	you just basically ignore everything outside of the uh reaching that was deemed to be foreground speech and where 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact367	589.86	594.33	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and where that laws we have to use that to forced alignment uh results from four so 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact368	594.33	594.65	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	four so 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact369	595.227	597.217	G	PhD	s	-1	0	that's somewhat that's how much subject hour but still we 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact370	597.217	600.693	G	PhD	s	-1	0	but still we we uh don did some have hand checking 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact371	601.35	606.05	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and and we think that based and that we think that the results are you know ballot although of course some 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact372	606.05	608.31	G	PhD	s	-1	0	although of course some air it's going to be in there but 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact373	608.931	622.77	G	PhD	s	+1	2	there but basically what we found us after we take out these regions so we only score the reasons that were certified as foreground speech recognition i went down to almost uh the level austin on overlapped speech 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact374	623.65	631.818	G	PhD	s	-1	0	that's great so that means that even if you do have background speech if you can somehow separate outdoor find where it is uh the recognize it does a good job 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact375	624.706	625.196	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	that's great that even if you do have background 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact376	630.064	630.184	B	PhD	b	-1	0	uh the recognize 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact377	632.409	633.739	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	yeah i guess that doesn't even though there's this back 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact378	633.273	634.643	A	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah i guess that doesn't surprise me because there's this back 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact379	634.643	639.006	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	surprise me because with a close talking mikes the the signal will be so much stronger right

Bmr020.G.dialogueact438	721.0	724.79	G	PhD	s	-1	0	that was number that was the second set of uh the second section and then 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact439	724.79	731.23	G	PhD	s	+1	0	section and then the other thing was we looked at uh what we call interrupts although that's that 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact440	731.23	733.65	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	although that's that maybe a misnomer but basically 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact441	733.65	735.87	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	misnomer but basically we look at cases where 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact442	736.632	740.072	G	PhD	s	+1	0	uh so we we used to punctuation from the original transcripts and 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact443	740.76	744.1	G	PhD	s	+1	0	and we inferred the beginnings and and the sentence

Bmr020.G.dialogueact453	757.904	759.914	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and we know that there's that's not a very 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact454	760.56	761.8	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	okay i mean we miss a lot of them but 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact455	761.742	761.812	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	okay a lot of them but 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact457	761.812	762.182	C	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	okay call a lot of them but but it's

Bmr020.G.dialogueact462	766.296	770.25	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and then we looked at locations where 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact463	771.13	771.74	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact464	773.18	785.37	G	PhD	qw	+1	0	if you have overlapping speech and someone else starts sentence you know where do these where do other people start their turns not turns really but you know sentences um 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact465	782.69	782.74	B	PhD	b	-1	0	turns 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact466	785.91	786.52	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact467	787.62	790.71	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so we only look at cases where there was a foreground speaker 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact468	791.15	797.35	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and then at the top of the so the different speakers started into their sentence and then someone else started later 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact470	798.65	800.23	B	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	somewhere in between the startling in okay and so what sorry 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact469	798.63	799.03	G	PhD	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	somewhere in between the startling okay and so 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact471	799.604	800.534	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	the startling in and so what sorry 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact472	800.33	800.56	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	in what sorry 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact473	800.844	801.094	G	PhD	qw^br^d^rt	-1	0	in somewhere in between what sorry 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact474	801.41	803.66	B	PhD	s^bu^r	-1	0	somewhere in between these comedy for yes uh so 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact475	802.52	802.84	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	these comedy yes 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact476	803.4	806.31	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	for uh so the such that there was overlap between the two sons so 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact477	805.499	805.669	B	PhD	b	-1	0	between the two sons 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact478	806.764	818.32	G	PhD	s	+1	0	three words from the and so the the question was how can we what can we say about the places where the second store or actually several second speakers um start there interrupted to call them 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact479	818.27	819.22	D	PhD	s^cs^j	-1	0	three words from the and them 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact480	820.256	821.276	A	Grad	s	-1	0	that cause boundaries and 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact481	821.05	821.17	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	and 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact482	821.6	823.61	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and we looked at this in terms of um 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact483	823.61	824.3	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	on t. of um 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact484	824.718	826.228	A	Grad	s^cs^j	-1	0	on t. closures homely so so 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact485	826.3	828.71	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so so we had we had um 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact486	828.71	829.33	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	we had um too 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact487	829.99	835.67	G	PhD	s	+1	0	too for the for the purpose of this analysis we attacked the word sequences and and we time alliance and 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact488	836.36	836.68	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	um and 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact489	836.97	840.23	G	PhD	s	-1	0	um and we considered interrupt interrupted occurred in the middle of a word we basically 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact490	840.23	846.42	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	we basically you know consider that to be interrupt as i said where at at the beginning of the war it so that 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact491	846.42	851.32	G	PhD	s^e	+1	0	war it so that if any part of the word was overlapped that was considered to interrupted word 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact492	851.13	851.43	F	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact493	852.123	858.72	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and then we looked at the the location of the um you know the features that the tags because we 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact494	858.72	865.48	G	PhD	s^df	+1	0	tech but the tags because we have tag these strings um that that occurred right before these these uh interrupt locations and the 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact495	860.5	861.2	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	tech but um that that occurred 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact496	865.868	869.927	G	PhD	s^e	+1	0	and the tag and we looked at our this perch tag which 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact497	869.927	871.017	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	tag which basically says actually 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact498	871.66	872.07	G	PhD	s.%--	+1	0	actually sorry 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact499	872.19	872.36	G	PhD	s^fa	-1	0	sorry 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact500	873.32	873.91	G	PhD	s^bsc	+1	1	and it's part so 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact501	873.91	877.12	G	PhD	s	+1	0	and it's part so whether there was a pause essentially here because births are 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact502	877.12	881.75	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because births are defined as being you know siphon millisecond so longer pauses 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact503	882.54	884.72	G	PhD	s	+1	1	and then we had things like this course markers 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact504	885.71	886.97	G	PhD	s	+1	1	uh back channels 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact505	888.08	889.2	G	PhD	s	+1	1	disowned seas 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact506	890.04	890.81	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact507	891.59	892.8	G	PhD	s	+1	0	uh phil pause 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact508	893.41	898.74	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	so disowned the d.'s are for um the interruption part of it on and cease away 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact509	898.74	901.66	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	it on and cease away you hesitate or where you start to repair or 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact510	902.57	903.99	G	PhD	fh|qw^t1	-1	0	uh what else do we had uh 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact511	903.99	907.65	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	what else do we had uh repeated you know repeated words is another kind of associate and so forth so 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact512	908.01	909.84	G	PhD	s	-1	0	we had both the beginnings and of disease 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact513	911.96	914.02	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	uh so the end of the film pause 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact514	915.326	917.006	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and the end of the discourse marker 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact515	918.95	919.7	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	we just eyeballs i mean 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact516	919.7	922.69	G	PhD	s	+1	0	just eyeballs i mean we didn't really hand tag all of these things we just 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact517	922.69	925.22	G	PhD	s	-1	0	of these things we just look at the distribution of words and so every 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact518	925.22	932.19	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and so every so yeah and okay uh and uh we're we're the we're deemed to be back jones and well 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact519	932.19	938.93	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and well and so and uh rights uh word that's right right in the back childhood 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact520	938.93	946.38	G	PhD	s	+1	0	right in the back childhood so easily just based on the mexico uh identity of the words we we attack them it's one of these things 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact521	947.743	951.173	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and of course the dictator option ponds we got from the original transcript 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact522	952.12	952.42	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	so and then we 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact523	952.8	954.0	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so and then we look at the distance so we looked at the 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact524	954.0	958.54	G	PhD	s	-1	0	we looked at the these distribution have of these or different kinds of of tag @reject@ overall uh 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact525	958.75	961.53	G	PhD	s	-1	0	uh and or and and with the because they have to use her an option of points and 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact526	962.06	964.97	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so on uh we we found it so 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact527	964.97	965.32	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	so there is 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact528	965.84	967.15	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	there is

Bmr020.G.dialogueact580	1033.78	1034.04	G	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	hours wonder yeah that i would well do you can 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact581	1034.04	1036.24	G	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	the well do you can really make everything smaller but at least we 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact583	1036.67	1037.92	B	PhD	s	-1	0	the abstract then but at least we put oh i 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact582	1036.24	1037.36	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	the abstract then but at least we put oh i 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact584	1037.78	1038.42	G	PhD	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	pick abstract then put oh i i you 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact586	1038.95	1039.9	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	pick out white space i you know that the gap between 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact585	1038.94	1042.24	G	PhD	s	-1	0	pick out white space i you know that the gap between the two columns like ten millimeters so i 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact587	1042.13	1042.31	B	PhD	b	-1	0	so i 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact588	1042.38	1044.61	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so i strike it's eight millimeters and that helped 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact589	1044.61	1046.41	G	PhD	s	-1	0	there wasn't and that helped them and stuff like that 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact590	1046.06	1048.24	D	PhD	qy	-1	0	there wasn't there some result under s. i i thought like that 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact591	1046.21	1046.52	F	Professor	b	-1	0	there wasn't like that 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact592	1048.24	1053.29	D	PhD	s	+1	0	s. i i thought maybe liz presented this at some conference awhile ago about uh back channels uh 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact593	1049.88	1050.25	G	PhD	b	-1	0	maybe liz presented this at some conference awhile 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact594	1051.27	1051.61	G	PhD	b	-1	0	ago about 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact595	1053.29	1053.82	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact596	1054.37	1058.09	D	PhD	s	+1	0	and that they tend to happen when uh the pitch drops you know you know falling 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact597	1058.4	1059.83	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	you know you know falling pitch 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact599	1060.93	1062.79	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and so that's when people tend to back channel that yeah well 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact598	1060.48	1060.84	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and yeah 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact600	1061.19	1061.57	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	so that's when people tend well 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact601	1062.79	1063.57	D	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	to back channel that you yeah we didn't talk about 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact602	1063.12	1066.77	G	PhD	s^nd	+1	0	you right right yeah we didn't talk about uh because i like uh properties at all though 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact603	1065.45	1066.13	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	right right like uh properties at all though

Bmr020.G.dialogueact604	1066.77	1070.66	G	PhD	s	+1	1	yeah at all though that's i i take it that's something that the dog will look at now that 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact607	1070.94	1072.24	E	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah we're going to be looking at that look at now that we have the data and we have the alignment so

Bmr020.G.dialogueact725	1245.3	1245.76	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	no well um 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact727	1246.34	1246.54	F	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah and then it under 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact726	1246.11	1247.79	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah and then it under their 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact728	1248.08	1251.63	G	PhD	s	+1	0	um actually on this directory is not to read a bowl it's 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact729	1251.85	1253.57	G	PhD	s^e	+1	0	a bowl it's only uh accessible so 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact730	1253.67	1258.57	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	so in other words to access anything under there you have to be told what the name is 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact732	1259.21	1259.45	A	Grad	b	-1	0	right so that's so this uh 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact731	1259.11	1263.15	G	PhD	s	-1	0	right so that's so this uh quick and dirty way of doing access control so 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact733	1263.28	1263.69	F	Professor	b	-1	0	so 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact734	1263.56	1264.0	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	so uh 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact735	1264.84	1268.26	G	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	uh and the directory for this i call that i i. s. r. zero point one because it's sort 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact736	1268.26	1270.51	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	i don't know here's this meeting because it's sort this meant for recognition 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact737	1269.98	1271.75	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i don't know here's this meeting i know uh this meant for recognition and then 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact738	1271.02	1271.31	A	Grad	s	-1	0	i know uh and then 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact739	1271.69	1275.73	G	PhD	s	-1	0	i know uh and then then in there i have a file that lists all the other files so that 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact740	1275.78	1279.68	G	PhD	s^df	+1	0	files so that someone can get that's fine and then though the finance and therefore download them if you don't 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact741	1279.68	1281.09	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and a dash download them if you don't know the finance you can't i mean you can't 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact742	1281.39	1283.0	F	Professor	qrr^bu	-1	0	don't don't don't say and a dash or adopting i mean you can't that 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact743	1281.48	1282.0	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	don't and a dash or adopting i mean you can't 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact744	1282.97	1283.9	A	Grad	s	-1	0	don't don't don't say or adopting that

Bmr020.G.dialogueact747	1288.34	1294.83	G	PhD	s	+1	1	so i was going to do that was sixty the transcripts after we the way that we munch them for scoring because 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact748	1294.89	1296.75	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	scoring because that's what he cares about and 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact749	1296.76	1297.0	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	cares about and 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact750	1297.88	1298.33	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact751	1299.31	1303.47	G	PhD	s	+1	0	and also and then the the way farms that don segment that i mean 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact752	1303.77	1310.51	G	PhD	s	-1	0	i that i mean just basically taught them all up i mean for each meeting i taught them all into one tar file and she's just them and stick in there 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact753	1310.86	1314.93	A	Grad	s	-1	0	i uh the digits in my own home directory home and keep p. record all in there

Bmr020.D.dialogueact769	1332.58	1334.5	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	set so that when they did experiments they could compare right but they don't 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact770	1334.49	1334.7	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	right but they don't 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact771	1334.7	1335.99	G	PhD	s	-1	0	right but they don't have a recognize recognizing

Bmr020.D.dialogueact780	1343.27	1345.16	D	PhD	s	+1	1	we we need to give brian the beep file so i was going to probably 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact781	1343.4	1343.68	G	PhD	b	-1	0	we need to give 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact782	1345.32	1346.26	D	PhD	s.%-	+1	0	we can put in the same place so i was going to probably put it 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact783	1345.99	1347.18	A	Grad	s	-1	0	we can put in the same place just put another directory so i was going to probably put it yeah it well 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact785	1347.3	1348.41	A	Grad	s	-1	0	just put another directory yeah it i make another directory well make it that make 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact784	1347.23	1347.74	D	PhD	s^bk|s.%-	-1	0	just put another directory yeah it well 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact787	1348.3	1349.44	D	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	i make another directory yeah make it that make another directory done 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact786	1347.96	1349.78	G	PhD	fg|s^co	-1	0	just put another directory yeah it i make another directory yeah well make it that make another directory done

Bmr020.G.dialogueact789	1349.78	1350.49	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah exactly yeah another directory done yeah 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact792	1350.91	1351.07	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	exactly yeah and this yeah 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact791	1350.49	1350.74	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	exactly yeah yeah 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact794	1351.48	1355.1	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and this um i think the styles that i gave you are downtown bolted they are 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact793	1351.36	1351.57	G	PhD	b	-1	0	and this 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact795	1355.46	1355.8	G	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	they are 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact796	1356.11	1356.64	E	Grad	s^na	-1	0	i think so yeah 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact797	1356.82	1357.13	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	i think so yeah um so okay 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact799	1357.73	1364.16	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	um so either we should regenerate the original versions where um we should make a note of that okay oh like well 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact798	1357.25	1357.56	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	um so okay 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact800	1361.91	1362.24	G	PhD	b	-1	0	where um oh 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact801	1363.02	1363.84	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	we should make a note of that like well 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact802	1365.12	1367.52	G	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	yeah that's the first okay because in one directory does two versions 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact803	1367.6	1369.49	E	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	yeah that's the first meeting a couple of versions just to versions okay 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact805	1369.7	1372.08	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	just to check you if there's significant difference okay and so i but okay so but for the other meetings 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact804	1369.53	1370.03	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	just to check you if okay and so i 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact806	1370.47	1370.96	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	check you if and so i 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact807	1370.96	1371.52	G	PhD	%--	-1	0	check you if there's significant difference and so i but okay so 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact808	1371.62	1371.92	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	there's significant difference but okay so 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact809	1371.92	1374.73	G	PhD	s^bu	+1	0	there's significant difference that's that's all yeah but okay so but for the other meetings it's the down type person that you have 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact810	1374.03	1374.86	E	Grad	s^na	-1	0	that's that's all yeah that you have 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact811	1374.86	1375.19	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	that's that's all yeah that you have oh okay 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact812	1375.45	1376.49	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay oh 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact813	1376.96	1378.05	G	PhD	s	-1	0	oh that's so important to know okay so 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact814	1378.05	1378.42	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay so 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact815	1378.42	1378.98	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	okay so 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact816	1379.92	1383.38	G	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	yeah we should probably uh you know xenon down several versions 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact817	1382.55	1382.91	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah down several versions 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact818	1384.14	1385.4	E	Grad	fg	-1	0	uh okay 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact819	1385.34	1385.85	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	okay

Bmr020.E.dialogueact831	1399.18	1399.29	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah because i mean i okay 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact832	1399.29	1405.29	E	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah because i mean i think just decided to go ahead with that don't sample versions because we can because it's like a significant difference okay but it takes it takes a less 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact830	1399.15	1399.42	G	PhD	fh.%	-1	0	yeah because i mean i okay 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact833	1404.33	1407.04	G	PhD	fg|s^df	-1	0	like a significant difference it does think about if they if but it takes it takes a less decipher likely 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact834	1406.61	1407.82	E	Grad	s^m^na	-1	0	it does think about if they if decipher likely 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact835	1407.82	1410.98	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	about if they if they make it even better than the original than the original versions which yeah yeah right 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact836	1409.24	1409.48	G	PhD	b	-1	0	than the original than yeah yeah 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact837	1409.9	1410.2	G	PhD	b	-1	0	than the original than the original versions which yeah yeah right 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact839	1410.98	1413.14	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	the original versions which you know it's just the random right yeah it was a small difference but 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact838	1410.49	1410.76	G	PhD	b	-1	0	the original versions which right 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact840	1412.6	1413.81	G	PhD	s	-1	0	just the random yeah it was a small difference but 
Bmr020.E.dialogueact842	1414.15	1416.63	E	Grad	s	+1	1	but um they probably won't want the originals okay 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact841	1413.81	1414.35	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	but um a small difference but 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact843	1415.93	1416.25	G	PhD	b	-1	0	they probably won't want the originals okay

Bmr020.C.dialogueact864	1446.2	1449.14	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	that but but you were going to use the usually transcribe file because i tighten of time 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact865	1449.14	1450.49	C	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	because i tighten of time benson that's also 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact866	1450.49	1454.12	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	benson that's also the one that they had already and trying to do by the first changes this 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact867	1454.78	1455.54	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact868	1456.19	1457.29	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	my understanding was that um 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact869	1457.29	1457.64	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	that um 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact870	1458.33	1460.33	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i haven't i haven't listened to it yet but it sounded very 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact872	1460.41	1460.81	A	Grad	b	-1	0	it yet but it sounded very 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact871	1460.33	1461.21	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	it yet but it sounded very good and and i understand that you 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact873	1461.21	1464.75	C	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	it was good and and i understand that you guys were going to have a meeting today before this meeting 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact874	1464.87	1466.81	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	it was just to talk about how to generate it this meeting 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact875	1467.16	1471.21	A	Grad	fh|s^e	-1	0	um just so that while i'm gone you can regenerate generated if you decide to do it a different way 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact877	1472.14	1476.2	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so uh chalk auntie low should now more or less know how to generate the filing yeah i think 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact876	1471.99	1472.36	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	so uh chalk auntie 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact878	1472.64	1472.92	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	so uh chalk auntie 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact879	1476.2	1483.35	A	Grad	s	+1	0	yeah i think chuck pointed out is that um since this one is hand marked there are discourse boundaries right so 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact880	1483.73	1483.94	A	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right so 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact882	1483.94	1486.8	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	right so so when one person is speaking there's breaks 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact881	1483.74	1483.86	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	right so 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact883	1487.15	1488.53	A	Grad	s	-1	0	worries kilos won't have that oh 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact886	1489.23	1497.26	A	Grad	s	+1	1	so what what we're probably going to do is just write a script that if too chung this are very close to each other on the same channel will just merge them okay interesting oh sure 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact884	1488.75	1488.93	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	have that oh 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact885	1489.15	1489.49	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	so what what we're probably okay interesting 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact887	1489.78	1490.28	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	so what what we're probably going to do is just write a script okay interesting 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact888	1490.4	1490.53	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	going to do is just write a script 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact889	1491.02	1491.1	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	that 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact890	1497.45	1497.74	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	them oh sure 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact891	1498.0	1498.38	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	sure make sense 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact892	1498.47	1498.93	C	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	sure make sense 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact893	1499.08	1505.74	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	so uh and i will get around the problem of the you know one word deep one word deep one word deep one word beat oh wow clever 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact894	1502.57	1502.95	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	you know one word 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact895	1504.85	1505.85	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	one word deep one word beat oh wow clever 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact896	1505.91	1506.27	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	one word beat wow clever yes 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact897	1506.27	1506.85	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yes 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact898	1507.07	1507.47	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	clever

Bmr020.C.dialogueact900	1511.03	1511.53	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	excellent yeah in fact 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact901	1511.61	1525.89	D	PhD	s	+1	2	excellent yeah in fact after our meeting uh this morning people came in and said that um there could be other differences between the uh already transcribed meeting with the beach and it and one that has just been run through his process so 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact902	1512.31	1513.02	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	after our meeting uh this morning people 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact903	1525.6	1525.86	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	through his process so 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact904	1525.89	1533.2	D	PhD	s	+1	1	through his process so tomorrow when we go to make the um uh jumped file for i b. m. we're going to actually compare the two so he's going to run his 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact905	1533.2	1535.66	D	PhD	s	-1	0	two so he's going to run his process on that same meeting 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact906	1536.13	1536.79	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	great idea and then we're going to do 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact907	1536.41	1541.75	D	PhD	s	+1	1	great idea okay and then we're going to do the beep defy on both and listen to them and see if we notice any real differences 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact908	1538.94	1539.16	G	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	on both and listen to them and see 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact909	1541.89	1542.08	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	okay know one thing that prevented real differences 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact910	1542.08	1545.77	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	know one thing that prevented us from apply you you from applying exactly 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact911	1545.91	1546.25	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	from applying exactly trying so that is 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact912	1546.25	1546.63	C	Postdoc	s^m^na	-1	0	trying so that is 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact913	1546.63	1547.72	C	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	trying so that is a training meeting yeah 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact916	1548.33	1548.56	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	okay well and we know that 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact914	1548.04	1548.2	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay well and we know that 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact915	1548.2	1549.07	D	PhD	s	-1	0	okay well and we know that what i would just want to see if 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact917	1549.07	1554.36	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	what i would just want to see if if there are any major differences between doing it on the hand 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact918	1550.19	1550.47	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	if there 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact919	1555.9	1556.87	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	oh interesting 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact920	1557.29	1557.36	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact922	1557.82	1558.1	A	Grad	b	-1	0	oh okay interesting 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact921	1557.36	1558.19	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay interesting 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact923	1558.63	1559.37	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	interesting idea 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact925	1562.16	1562.41	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	this training meeting 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact924	1561.97	1570.89	G	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	i went so this training meeting uh i is that uh some data where we have uh very um you know accurate time marks for 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact926	1570.8	1573.02	C	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	i went back and had more t. but depends on which i mentioned that marks for okay 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact927	1573.02	1574.93	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	on which i mentioned that last week but okay yeah 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact928	1574.04	1574.41	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	last week but yeah 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact929	1574.41	1574.72	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	last week but yeah 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact930	1575.01	1582.63	D	PhD	s	-1	0	the but there's yeah but there's this one issue with them and that there there are time boundaries in there that occur in the middle of speech because 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact931	1575.24	1575.63	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	the but there's because 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact932	1583.37	1583.89	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact933	1585.06	1586.44	D	PhD	s^e.%--	-1	0	when we went to um 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact934	1586.44	1587.0	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	um my i was listening to 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact935	1587.27	1593.87	D	PhD	s^e	+1	0	that's on the other channel my i was listening to the original file that habits like you you hear word in your beep and then you hear the continuation of what is the same sentence 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact936	1593.12	1594.23	A	Grad	s	-1	0	that's on the other channel that's the same sentence 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact937	1595.05	1596.26	A	Grad	s	+1	1	because the channel overlapped well 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact938	1597.01	1597.24	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	and and so the 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact939	1597.31	1598.98	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and and so the 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact940	1598.27	1598.46	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact942	1599.26	1599.63	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	it's it so there these chunks 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact941	1599.11	1603.54	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	it's it so there these chunks that look like uh that have uh 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact943	1604.09	1606.01	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and that's not going to be true the foreground speaker that'll only be if it's the background 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact944	1606.01	1607.79	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	that'll only be if it's the background speaker 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact945	1609.1	1609.2	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so you'll you'll have a chunk 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact946	1609.2	1614.41	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so you'll you'll have a chunk of you know channel hey which starts at zero and and ten and 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact947	1615.05	1616.99	D	PhD	s	-1	0	then the same channel starting at eleven ending 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact948	1616.99	1618.12	D	PhD	s	-1	0	at eleven ending of fifteen and 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact949	1618.93	1620.58	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and then again starting in sixteen ending it 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact950	1620.58	1621.73	D	PhD	s	-1	0	sixteen ending it twenty right 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact951	1621.95	1622.15	D	PhD	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	twenty right size three chong 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact952	1622.15	1626.36	D	PhD	s	-1	0	size three chong swear actually we can just make one jumped out of that which 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact954	1626.87	1628.87	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	that which is a zero twenty 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact953	1626.62	1626.94	G	PhD	b	-1	0	that which 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact955	1627.82	1628.18	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	is a zero twenty 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact957	1629.42	1630.2	A	Grad	s^na	-1	0	that's what i just said yeah yeah 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact956	1628.95	1629.13	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	that's what i just said twenty 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact958	1629.68	1629.94	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	that's what i just said 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact959	1630.25	1630.48	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	yeah yeah

Bmr020.D.dialogueact961	1630.77	1632.44	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	yeah that yeah so i so i make sure that was so 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact962	1632.67	1632.8	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	that was so 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact963	1632.8	1633.3	C	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	that was was so if you were to 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact964	1632.82	1638.08	D	PhD	fg|s.%-	-1	0	that was was so if you were to use these you have to be careful not to part of these individuals oh okay i mean it right i mean 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact965	1633.69	1633.78	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	was if you were to 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact966	1636.14	1636.37	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	not to part oh okay i mean it 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact967	1636.63	1637.0	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	not to part of these individuals oh okay i mean it 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact968	1638.26	1638.64	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	right i mean 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact969	1638.64	1647.33	G	PhD	s	+1	1	right i mean so i mean what i would i was interested in this having a uh having time marks so the beginnings and ends uh speech 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact970	1648.25	1649.46	G	PhD	s^e	+1	0	well that's definitely by each speaker 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact971	1649.44	1650.56	A	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	well that's definitely a problem uh because we 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact972	1650.3	1654.6	G	PhD	s^df	+1	1	a problem uh because we could use that to find tune our alignment process to make 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact975	1655.11	1655.43	A	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	saturday battery it more accurate

Bmr020.G.dialogueact1008	1693.61	1698.41	G	PhD	s^df^na	+1	0	it's good you always want to have a little bit of positive on speech around the speech safer recognition purposes 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1009	1699.24	1699.58	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh but just 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1010	1699.58	1707.01	G	PhD	s	-1	0	uh but just just you know again i i just want to have an idea of uh of how much extra you're allowed 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1011	1707.63	1708.31	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1012	1708.93	1713.61	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	so that i can interpret the numbers if i compare that with the forced alignment sanitation 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1014	1714.66	1715.48	C	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	cancer that but but 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1013	1714.5	1714.92	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	cancer 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1015	1715.48	1727.55	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that but but my main goal is um in these areas where you have a three way overlap and one of the overlaps involved yeah and it's swimming in this huge been i wanted to get it so that it was quote more closely localized right 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1016	1719.41	1719.73	G	PhD	b	-1	0	and one 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1017	1721.81	1722.15	G	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1018	1724.68	1724.94	G	PhD	b	-1	0	been i right 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1019	1728.34	1732.6	G	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	but i we talking about i don't know uh tenth of a second uh 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1020	1732.71	1733.21	G	PhD	%--	-1	0	uh 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1021	1734.09	1734.47	G	PhD	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	how how 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1022	1734.69	1737.39	G	PhD	qw^bu	-1	0	i i wanted to i wanted how how much how much extra would you allow allowing most 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1023	1736.31	1737.63	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	i i wanted to i wanted would you allow allowing most 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1024	1737.86	1741.88	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	to i wanted it to be able to he be heard normally most 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1025	1741.99	1742.37	G	PhD	b	-1	0	normally so that if 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1026	1742.56	1750.15	C	Postdoc	s^e	+1	1	so that if you if you play back that and have it in the mode where it stops at the boundary it sounds like a normal word it doesn't sound like the person okay 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1027	1747.88	1748.18	G	PhD	b	-1	0	at the boundary it sounds okay 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1028	1750.15	1751.45	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	it doesn't sound like the person 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1029	1752.48	1753.66	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	it you sounds normal it's as if 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1030	1753.66	1755.55	C	Postdoc	s^e	+1	0	normal it's as if a person could have stopped there okay 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1031	1753.75	1754.14	G	PhD	b	-1	0	normal it's as if a person could have stopped 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1033	1756.23	1758.06	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	it wouldn't have been an awkward place to off now sometimes 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1032	1755.89	1756.23	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	there it wouldn't have been an awkward okay 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1034	1758.51	1762.39	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	now sometimes you know i see these are involved in places where there was not time and 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1035	1762.71	1765.83	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and so there wouldn't be a gap afterwards because okay 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1036	1765.59	1765.86	G	PhD	b	-1	0	because okay 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1037	1766.13	1775.23	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	in some cases there are some people um who who have very long segments of discourse where you know they'll they'll breed and then i put a break 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1038	1775.41	1775.72	G	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1039	1776.42	1778.02	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but other than that it's really pretty continuous and this includes things like 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1040	1778.02	1782.68	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	and this includes things like going from one sense into the when i turns into the next one sense of the next 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1041	1783.21	1783.57	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1042	1784.69	1786.26	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	without really stopping mean 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1043	1786.26	1787.64	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	mean they it you know and writing 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1044	1787.64	1790.36	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	they it you know and writing you have this two spaces and a big gap you know 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1045	1787.78	1787.87	G	PhD	b	-1	0	they it you know and writing 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1046	1790.36	1790.63	C	Postdoc	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	gap you know 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1047	1790.53	1790.76	G	PhD	b	-1	0	gap you know 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1048	1791.07	1793.74	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	but but uh some people are planning and you 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1049	1793.74	1796.93	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	are planning and you know we we always are planning we're going to say next 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1050	1796.64	1797.0	G	PhD	b	-1	0	going to say next but 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1051	1797.75	1808.48	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but uh in which case the gap between these two complete some tactic it's which course spoken things are not always complacent actively but 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1052	1808.48	1813.72	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	actively but but it would be a shorter shorter break then maybe you might like but 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1053	1812.07	1812.39	G	PhD	b	-1	0	then maybe 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1054	1813.95	1820.71	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you might like but their goal there was to not have thee text be so so crudely parsons time than me because 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1055	1820.82	1827.76	C	Postdoc	s^df.%--	-1	0	time than me because from a discourse purpose it's it's more it's more useful to be able to see and also 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1056	1827.85	1835.22	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	to see and also you know from a speech recognition purpose my impression is that if you have too long a unit it's it's doesn't help you very much either because of the memory 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1057	1835.22	1836.05	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	because of the memory 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1058	1835.31	1835.81	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	because of the memory 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1059	1836.02	1836.46	G	PhD	s^na	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1060	1837.25	1845.02	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	so that means that d. uh amount of time after something is variable depending partly in context but my general goal 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1061	1845.02	1854.31	C	Postdoc	s	+1	1	but my general goal when there was sufficient space room pause after it to have it be kind of a natural feeling 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1062	1853.83	1854.12	G	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1063	1855.43	1857.24	C	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	which i i don't know it would be quantify that you know it well 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1064	1857.44	1867.65	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	that you know it well she says that um introducing narratives of spurts of people use tend to be uh that that that what would be a pause might be something like two two seconds 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1065	1867.77	1868.09	G	PhD	b	-1	0	seconds and 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1066	1868.78	1871.25	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	and um that would be the one speaker 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1067	1872.23	1875.16	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	the discourse the people who look at turn taking off and use i was interested that you chose 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1068	1874.5	1874.76	G	PhD	b	-1	0	taking off and use 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1069	1875.27	1880.02	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i was interested that you chose uh the you know the use because i think that's a unit that 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1070	1880.02	1883.46	C	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	i think that's a unit that would be more consistent with sociolinguistics 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1072	1884.35	1884.61	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	well we chose um 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1071	1884.26	1887.5	G	PhD	s	+1	0	well we chose um you know half a second because 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1073	1887.5	1898.45	G	PhD	s^df	+1	0	because if if you go much larger you have uh you know your your statement about how much overlap there is becomes less precise because you 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1075	1898.71	1899.39	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	because you include more 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1074	1898.51	1903.52	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because you include more actual pause time into what you consider overlapped speech 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1076	1904.5	1904.84	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	um so 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1077	1905.0	1905.51	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	it's 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1078	1906.01	1907.19	G	PhD	s	-1	0	sort of a compromise and 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1080	1907.66	1927.54	B	PhD	s^bk|s	+1	0	yeah also use i think something around syrup on five seconds for this becomes that should occur so the minimum and it's also base i mean it is just that value based on the distribution of pause times that you see in switchboard and another corpora 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1079	1907.19	1908.89	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and it's also base i mean 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1081	1908.89	1918.22	G	PhD	s^e	+1	0	it's also base i mean it is just that value based on the distribution of pause times that you see in switchboard and another corpora 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1082	1917.39	1917.66	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	another corpora

Bmr020.G.dialogueact1084	1920.78	1921.19	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1085	1927.54	1929.38	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	occur so the minimum silence line i see 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1086	1927.73	1928.04	G	PhD	b	-1	0	occur so the minimum silence 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1087	1929.63	1929.97	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	line i see

Bmr020.C.dialogueact1093	1937.95	1939.56	C	Postdoc	s	+1	1	that i hand i'm i have just the two of them i mentioned 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1094	1939.68	1940.52	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	of them i mentioned before and i said okay

Bmr020.C.dialogueact1099	1941.88	1941.99	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	i send email sorry so so 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1098	1941.68	1945.92	G	PhD	s	+1	1	i send email sorry something so so at some point we will try to find humor in our first alignments maybe 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1100	1942.84	1944.67	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	something at some point we will try to find humor in our first 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1101	1945.92	1948.07	G	PhD	s^am^e	+1	0	alignments maybe using those as preferences because 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1102	1949.0	1952.83	G	PhD	s	-1	0	you know what you would do is he would play with different parameters and 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1103	1952.83	1960.61	G	PhD	s	-1	0	parameters and to get an object you need an objective measure of how closely you can align the models to the actual speech 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1104	1961.23	1965.66	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and that's where your your data would be 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1105	1965.99	1966.57	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1106	1967.81	1968.11	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1107	1968.98	1976.48	B	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah and hopefully the new meetings which was stuff from the travelling through from we'll better time boundaries elements 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1108	1975.4	1975.84	G	PhD	b	-1	0	boundaries elements 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1109	1977.79	1978.09	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	i like right 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1110	1978.81	1985.85	C	Postdoc	s	+1	1	i like this idea of uh for our purposes for the idea in preparation uh having these join together 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1111	1982.62	1982.77	B	PhD	b	-1	0	preparation 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1113	1986.14	1986.25	B	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1112	1985.85	1986.48	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	together 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1114	1987.25	1988.12	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it makes a lot of sense in terms of transcription 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1115	1988.33	1990.68	C	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	in terms of transcription it would be easy to do it that way the way 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1116	1988.4	1988.6	G	PhD	b	-1	0	in terms of transcription 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1117	1990.9	1993.13	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	do it that way the way that they have with the longer not having to fuss with 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1118	1990.96	1991.02	G	PhD	b	-1	0	do it that way the way that they have 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1119	1993.13	1995.36	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	that would you could have one having to fuss with adding these units 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1120	1994.23	1994.4	B	PhD	b	-1	0	that would adding these units 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1122	1995.08	2001.03	B	PhD	s^rt	+1	0	you could have one like if there is uh bechtel in between those the things the than 
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1121	1994.87	1995.07	G	PhD	b	-1	0	that would you could have one adding these units 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1123	1999.85	2000.24	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	those the things 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1124	2001.64	2005.45	B	PhD	s^e	+1	0	the than the actual look for at the end off off those three and yes 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1125	2004.92	2005.37	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	off off those three and yes 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1126	2005.45	2013.24	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	three and and and and uh and the previous version and that which is use now that the bechtel of would be in between there's more so that i see yeah 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1128	2013.46	2013.72	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	so that i see yeah 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1127	2013.42	2013.68	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	so that i see yeah 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1130	2014.05	2014.89	B	PhD	s	-1	0	would be more intro about well that's 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1129	2013.89	2014.04	C	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	so that would be more intro about i see yeah well that's 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1131	2014.24	2014.52	C	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	would be more intro about well that's 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1132	2014.89	2015.05	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	would be more intro about well that's that's right but you know 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1133	2014.94	2015.67	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	would be more intro about well that's that's right but you know 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1134	2015.67	2019.33	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	that's right but you know this this brings me to the other stages that you discuss so he earlier today which is 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1135	2019.02	2019.13	B	PhD	b	-1	0	today which is 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1136	2019.54	2025.82	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	today which is the second stage is um what to do in terms of the transcribers adjustment of the state i discuss 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1137	2025.82	2026.77	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	of the state i discuss this with you 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1138	2027.18	2028.65	C	Postdoc	fh|s.%--	-1	0	um the q. so the 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1139	2028.65	2032.08	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	q. so the idea initially was we we get uh for the new meetings so the e. d. 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1140	2032.08	2038.44	C	Postdoc	s^e	+1	1	so the e. d. u. meetings that tivo had it has no pre segmented all of them force on channel by child basis and 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1141	2039.0	2039.71	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1142	2040.04	2044.53	C	Postdoc	s	+1	1	so i've assigned i've i've assigned them to our transcribers and 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1143	2044.86	2045.91	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1144	2046.4	2047.64	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so far discussed it with one with 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1145	2047.74	2048.29	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	it with one with uh and i had uh 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1146	2048.37	2051.06	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	uh and i had uh about an hour discussion with her about this yesterday we went to uh 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1147	2051.06	2053.89	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	we went to uh e. d. you wanted some extent 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1148	2054.58	2063.19	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and it occurred to me is that um that's basically what we have in this kind of a format is you could consider as a staggers mixed file we had some discussion or 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1149	2063.19	2067.17	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	we had some discussion or the weekend of about at this other meeting that we are oh i that um 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1150	2067.66	2073.33	C	Postdoc	fh|s^e	-1	0	that um about whether the trent the idea transcriber should hear single channel audio or mixed chow audio and 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1151	2073.95	2081.63	C	Postdoc	fh|s	+1	0	and um in a in a way by by having this this junk and then the back channel after it it's like a faculty stagger makes channel 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1152	2082.18	2086.93	C	Postdoc	fh|s.%--	-1	0	and um it occurred to me and my discussion with her yesterday that um 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1153	2087.41	2087.82	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1154	2088.78	2096.02	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	the the maximum gain it's from the i b. m. people maybe in long stretches of connected speech says basically 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1155	2096.39	2102.64	C	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	says basically a whole bunch of words which they can't really do because of the continuity within that person's turned 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1156	2103.18	2113.84	C	Postdoc	fh|s^cs	+1	0	so what i'm thinking and it maybe that not all meetings will be good for this but but what i'm thinking is that indie do you meetings they tend to be driven by a couple of dominant speakers 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1157	2114.27	2124.76	C	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	1	and if beach on files focused on the dominant speakers then when when it got patched together when it comes back from i. b. m. we can add the back channels 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1158	2125.36	2129.88	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	it seems to me that um you know back channels per se wouldn't be so hard but then 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1159	2129.88	2135.05	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	wouldn't be so hard but then there's this question of the time uh marking and whether the beeps would be a yeah and i'm not exactly 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1160	2135.14	2138.71	C	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	yeah and i'm not exactly sure how that how that would work with it with the back channels 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1161	2139.61	2139.98	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1162	2140.31	2141.1	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	so um and certainly 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1163	2141.51	2149.23	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	and certainly things that are intrusions of multiple words taken out of context and just placed in time from where they occurred that would be hard so 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1164	2149.66	2161.05	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so my my thought is i'm having this transcriber go through the e. d. one meeting and indicated start time for each thomas speaker and put in time for each on the speaker and the idea that these 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1165	2161.05	2166.62	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and the idea that these units would be generated for the donna speakers and maybe not for the other channels 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1166	2167.69	2172.88	A	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	yeah the only um disadvantage disadvantages that is then it's hard to use an automatic method to do that 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1167	2173.75	2178.95	A	Grad	s^na	-1	0	these vantages that it's probably faster to do that than it is to use the dionna made method and correct it 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1168	2179.14	2179.44	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	so well 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1169	2179.85	2180.28	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	so will just have to see well i i can't i think 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1171	2180.58	2181.26	A	Grad	s	-1	0	will just have to see i i can't i think i i 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1170	2180.28	2180.65	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	will just have to see i i can't i think 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1172	2180.65	2188.46	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	will just have to see i i can't i think i i think um you know the original plan was that the transcriber would adjust to set boundaries and all that for all the channels but 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1173	2188.46	2190.67	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	channels but you know that is so time consuming and since 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1174	2190.67	2195.4	C	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	consuming and since we have a bottle like here we want to get i. b. m. things are usable is as soon as possible then the 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1175	2195.4	2198.64	C	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	then the me it be a way of getting to get them a flood of data which 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1176	2198.96	2200.76	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	of data which would be useful when it comes back to us 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1177	2201.72	2202.44	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1179	2203.34	2203.59	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	yep i also at the same 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1178	2203.22	2214.68	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yep i also at the same time she when she goes through this she'll be uh if there's anything that was in coated as a pas but really has something transcribe oval and it then she's going to um make a mark 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1180	2215.28	2218.99	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	uh you know so that that been would be marked as it as double dots 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1181	2219.38	2220.51	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	and she'll just add a mess 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1182	2221.24	2229.29	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	and in the other any other case if it's marked a speech and really there's nothing transcribe one and then she's going to put his dashing i'll go through and 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1183	2229.29	2238.06	C	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	i'll go through and and um the substitute and come and get it so that it's clear that those are the other kind of gory just you know recoding 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1184	2238.06	2239.38	C	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	just you know recoding but 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1185	2239.88	2250.36	C	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	but um um the transcriber events that um i'm considering and that's that continue to be laugh as well speech and cough and things like that so i'm not stripping 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1186	2250.36	2251.67	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that so i'm not stripping out of anything just just 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1187	2251.67	2254.56	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	out of anything just just you know being very lenient what's considered speech 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1189	2256.19	2256.43	C	Postdoc	qw^d	-1	0	in terms of 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1188	2255.83	2256.05	D	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	james in terms of 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1190	2256.45	2262.49	D	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	it's not that different in terms of the this new procedures suggesting um what is e. 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1191	2260.65	2261.6	A	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	it's not that different what is 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1192	2263.65	2264.59	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so i'm a little confused because how 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1193	2264.59	2266.17	D	PhD	qw^bu^rt	-1	0	oh confused because how do we know where to put beeps is it is 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1194	2266.41	2267.34	D	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	transcriber oh okay so what is it is it 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1195	2266.99	2267.42	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	transcriber oh okay so what is it is it 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1197	2267.72	2268.67	A	Grad	s	-1	0	transcriber will do it okay so what what what involved is it 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1196	2267.7	2272.18	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	transcriber will do it okay so what what what involved is is really is uh the original per procedure but it 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1198	2272.46	2279.4	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	we take but only applied to uh uh certain strategically chosen this aspect of the data so 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1199	2279.83	2281.81	A	Grad	s	-1	0	we take the easy part to the data basically and the data so you got 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1200	2279.87	2280.2	C	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	we take the easy part to the data data so 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1201	2281.81	2283.66	A	Grad	s	-1	0	basically and the transcriber marks it by hand you got it 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1202	2281.82	2282.17	C	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	basically and the transcriber marks it you got it 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1203	2284.39	2285.13	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	and because no but after we've done to those

Bmr020.C.dialogueact1229	2307.56	2316.76	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and then um the transcriber instead of going painstakingly through all the channels moving the boundaries around and deciding that speech or not but not transcribing anything 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1230	2317.69	2317.99	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	okay instead 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1231	2317.99	2324.6	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	okay instead of doing that which was our original plan the truth they focus on the dominant speaker they just do that on the main channel

Bmr020.D.dialogueact1233	2322.25	2325.17	D	PhD	s	-1	0	the truth they focus on the dominant speaker yeah so what they do they just do that on the main channel okay 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1234	2325.08	2325.29	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yeah so what they do okay 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1235	2325.52	2329.91	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yeah so what they do is they down to five who was on a speaker and when the speaker starts okay 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1236	2325.56	2325.77	D	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah so what they do okay

Bmr020.B.dialogueact1238	2330.93	2331.24	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay so 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1239	2331.83	2332.83	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and so i mean you're still going to so we're

Bmr020.C.dialogueact1243	2334.82	2335.88	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and precipitation that's the basic thing 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1244	2335.93	2341.78	B	PhD	qy^d^rt	+1	1	and it just it's just segments of the dominant speak to them for phone sending to i b. m. or basic thing 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1245	2341.78	2342.07	B	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	to i b. m. or exactly so now

Bmr020.C.dialogueact1256	2357.88	2364.78	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	so i you know so and you do you one as far as i listened to it you start off with that this section by jerry so jerry 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1257	2364.78	2366.97	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	by jerry so jerry starts at minute so and so 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1258	2367.16	2368.63	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	and goes until minutes on so and then mark 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1259	2368.63	2369.97	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	on so and then mark pass can comes in 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1260	2370.32	2372.34	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	and he starts it minute such and such an goes on

Bmr020.C.dialogueact1262	2374.55	2374.9	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1263	2375.1	2379.18	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and then meanwhile she's listening to both of these guys channels determining 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1264	2379.48	2384.03	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	determining if there are any cases of this class of speech as nothing and nothing is speech and 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1265	2383.23	2383.58	D	PhD	b	-1	0	nothing is speech 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1266	2384.02	2384.27	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1267	2384.88	2387.46	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and uh and adding a tag if that happens so she does just judgment on those guys 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1268	2385.9	2387.64	D	PhD	qy^bu^d	-1	0	uh and adding a tag if that happens so she does just judgment on those guys 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1269	2388.22	2396.92	C	Postdoc	s	+1	1	that meeting but you know i want to say his segment is so good that um the part that i listen to with her yesterday didn't need any adjustments the bins huh 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1270	2393.08	2393.6	B	PhD	s^2	-1	0	that meeting i listen to with her 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1271	2394.86	2395.12	D	PhD	b	-1	0	yesterday didn't need any adjustments huh 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1272	2397.07	2397.94	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so far we haven't 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1273	2398.21	2400.17	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	this is not going to be a major part of the process at least he's so if you 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1274	2400.33	2402.55	C	Postdoc	s^e.%-	-1	0	at least he's not i'm not and ones that that really mm so if you don't have to adjust the bins why 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1275	2400.49	2404.58	D	PhD	qh^cs	-1	0	at least he's not i'm not and ones that that really mm so if you don't have to adjust the bins why not just do it for all the channels i just 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1276	2402.76	2403.0	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	that really mm why not just do it for all 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1277	2404.83	2406.76	D	PhD	qh^cs	-1	0	well the channels i just throw all the channels i b. m. 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1278	2406.99	2409.34	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	well there's the question of uh weather i b. m. 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1279	2410.97	2411.51	C	Postdoc	h	-1	0	well okay she 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1280	2411.79	2421.15	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	okay she they it's a question of how much time we want our transcriber to invest here when she's going to have to invest that when it comes back for my b. m. anyway so it's uhhuh 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1281	2421.01	2421.39	D	PhD	b	-1	0	so it's 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1282	2421.68	2433.16	C	Postdoc	qy	-1	0	but then we could so it's only in certain uhhuh here and there then would that be something that would be just as efficient to do at this end instead of having to go through i b. m. than be patched together then be double checked here right 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1283	2421.74	2421.89	D	PhD	b	-1	0	so it's 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1284	2424.22	2424.5	D	PhD	b	-1	0	then right 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1285	2427.06	2427.12	B	PhD	b	-1	0	as efficient to do 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1286	2428.73	2428.82	B	PhD	%	-1	0	at this 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1287	2433.62	2439.81	B	PhD	s^cs^ng	+1	2	but then we could trust use the the up to this detector and do the keeping on it depends on the time in 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1288	2440.8	2441.96	D	PhD	s^2	+1	1	without having to check anything

Bmr020.A.dialogueact1293	2444.38	2446.85	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	i think we just we just have to listen to it and see how good they are meetings i'm i'm sure it i'm 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1292	2444.33	2446.08	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	i think we just we just have to listen to it and see how good they are meetings i'm i'm sure it i'm 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1294	2446.64	2446.75	B	PhD	%	-1	0	see how good they are i'm 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1295	2446.97	2447.73	C	Postdoc	s^na	+1	0	see how good they are i'm open to that yes it's

Bmr020.F.dialogueact1297	2447.75	2448.82	F	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	open to that yes it's working well 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1299	2449.12	2451.14	B	PhD	s	-1	0	that's how some on some meanings it's good that sounds like a good idea such as you say if to do stuff together and then 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1298	2449.0	2450.19	F	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	that's how some on some meanings it's good that sounds like a good idea such as you say if to 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1300	2450.19	2452.27	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	on some meanings it's good well yeah okay could such as you say if to do stuff together and then 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1301	2452.32	2452.52	B	PhD	b	-1	0	well yeah okay could 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1302	2452.46	2452.71	C	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	well yeah okay could 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1303	2452.71	2453.15	C	Postdoc	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	well yeah okay could mean the detectors yeah i mean we have to fix 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1305	2453.27	2454.48	C	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	mean the detectors this that you yeah i mean we have to fix it when it comes back anyhow 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1304	2453.18	2455.22	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	mean the detectors this that you were saying that they they yeah i mean we have to fix it when it comes back anyhow 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1306	2454.66	2454.84	B	PhD	b	-1	0	this that you it when it comes back anyhow 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1307	2454.87	2460.18	C	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	yeah so we should perhaps trust this that you were saying that they they differ and how well they work depending on channel subsist systems and stuff it when it comes back anyhow 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1308	2458.24	2458.38	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah on channel subsist 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1309	2459.26	2465.38	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	so we should perhaps trust select meetings on which the speech on speech addiction works well and just systems and stuff but he he was great 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1310	2461.34	2462.4	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	select meetings on which the but he he was great 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1311	2465.43	2470.14	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	least to begin with and just use those meetings to just to send to i b. m. and that he owns interesting you know but the problem though i forget his 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1312	2467.32	2468.21	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	least to begin with those meetings to just to send to i b. m. interesting

Bmr020.B.dialogueact1318	2473.38	2474.89	B	PhD	h|s^aap	-1	0	uh it really depends 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1319	2475.59	2482.03	B	PhD	s^aap^rt	-1	0	i'm my my name my impression is that it's better for meetings with fewer speakers and it's better 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1320	2482.27	2485.98	B	PhD	s^aap^j	-1	0	and it's better for the meetings then nobody's breeding 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1321	2487.44	2487.51	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	the 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1323	2488.38	2488.69	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah get dead meeting 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1322	2488.03	2488.8	F	Professor	s^j	-1	0	yeah get dead meeting 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1324	2488.97	2489.22	B	PhD	%	-1	0	yeah get that's it dead meeting 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1325	2489.34	2489.75	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	that's it 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1326	2490.21	2494.88	D	PhD	s	-1	0	now the i'm knitting so in fact this might suggest an alternative sort of a a hybrid between these two things so 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1327	2491.12	2492.07	A	Grad	s^j^nd^t3	-1	0	now the i'm knitting suggest an alternative sort of a a 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1328	2492.07	2492.2	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	sort of a a 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1329	2492.66	2492.75	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	sort of a a 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1330	2494.72	2494.99	C	Postdoc	qy^bh	-1	0	these two things so 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1331	2494.88	2498.09	D	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	these two things so the the one suggestion is you know we we run kilos thing and then we have somebody's going to 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1332	2498.09	2500.07	D	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	and then we have somebody's going to just all the time boundaries and we send a bag and the other 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1335	2500.19	2500.34	B	PhD	b	-1	0	and we send a bag and the other 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1333	2499.95	2500.25	C	Postdoc	qy^bh	-1	0	just all the time boundaries and we send a bag and the other 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1334	2500.07	2500.84	D	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	and we send a bag and the other 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1336	2500.84	2503.32	D	PhD	s^cs	+1	2	and we send a bag and the other one is we just run his thing and intended i. b. m. there's a 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1338	2503.83	2503.96	B	PhD	b	-1	0	m. there's a 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1337	2503.71	2507.9	D	PhD	s	+1	0	yeah m. there's a uh another possibility if we find that there are some problems in 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1339	2507.58	2507.71	B	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah are some problems in 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1341	2508.3	2508.49	B	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah that is the go ahead 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1340	2507.9	2514.36	D	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	yeah yeah yeah and are some problems in that is the go ahead and we just run his to me generate to be filed and we have somebody listen to the beeps file and 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1342	2514.41	2514.6	B	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah and and 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1344	2514.96	2515.64	B	PhD	s^2	-1	0	yeah and it really is and they listen to each section 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1343	2514.84	2518.15	D	PhD	s^cs.%--	+1	0	yeah and it really is yeah is intelligent and they listen to each section and say yes no whether that section is is 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1345	2516.1	2516.27	B	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah and say yes no whether 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1346	2518.63	2519.57	C	Postdoc	s^2	-1	0	is intelligent will is intel's able 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1347	2519.03	2520.41	D	PhD	s^m^na	-1	0	will intel's able or not and it 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1348	2520.63	2527.44	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	that's interesting that's that's directly related or not and it it just is a little interface which will probably yes is it then that will be the final be fine 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1349	2523.13	2523.28	B	PhD	b	-1	0	will probably yes 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1350	2524.47	2524.59	A	Grad	s	-1	0	is it then that will be 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1351	2525.87	2526.53	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	that's interesting that's that's the final be 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1352	2526.53	2529.64	C	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	stress test interesting that's that's directly related to be viet and task be fine 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1353	2529.66	2530.41	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	stress test task how yeah 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1354	2529.86	2530.12	D	PhD	b	-1	0	stress test task how yeah 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1355	2530.97	2531.79	C	Postdoc	s^ba^fe	-1	0	how interesting yeah i mean i wouldn't be that 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1356	2531.06	2531.24	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	interesting i mean i wouldn't be that 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1357	2531.46	2535.26	D	PhD	s	-1	0	no interesting i mean i wouldn't be that much fun for transcribers that they're here it be yes or no but i i i don't 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1358	2533.17	2533.35	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	no that they're here it 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1359	2534.91	2536.35	F	Professor	s^no	-1	0	be yes or no but it would be quick i i i don't know it 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1360	2535.85	2536.71	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	but it would be quick i i don't know it 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1361	2536.97	2538.26	F	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	it would be quick know it would be kind of quick but the still listening 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1362	2538.26	2539.78	F	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	but quick but the still listening to everything 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1363	2539.94	2540.96	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	but there's no adjusting to everything 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1364	2541.06	2541.9	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	and that's what's slow there's 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1365	2541.9	2543.49	D	PhD	s^df^r	-1	0	well and that's what's slow there's no adjusting of time boundaries 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1366	2542.64	2544.71	C	Postdoc	s^nd	-1	0	well no adjusting of time boundaries

Bmr020.A.dialogueact1467	2657.88	2662.93	A	Grad	s^cs	+1	0	i was just double check with brian on a few simple conventions on how they should mark things yeah sure than others

Bmr020.D.dialogueact1470	2663.12	2665.23	D	PhD	s^cs^na	-1	0	yeah yeah when they when there's either no speech in there or

Bmr020.A.dialogueact1478	2668.09	2674.65	A	Grad	s^bk|s^na	-1	0	yeah because uh what i had originally said to brian was well they'll have to mark when they can't distinguish between the foreground and background because i thought 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1477	2668.03	2668.32	F	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah because uh what i 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1479	2674.65	2676.82	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	and background because i thought that was going to be the most prevalent 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1481	2677.39	2682.54	A	Grad	s	-1	0	but if we send them without editing that we're also going to have to have a notations for words that are cut off 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1480	2677.04	2677.35	D	PhD	b	-1	0	but if we send them 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1482	2679.13	2679.26	B	PhD	b	-1	0	also going to have to have 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1483	2682.65	2683.13	D	PhD	b	-1	0	off and other sorts of 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1485	2683.21	2685.73	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and other sorts of uh acoustic problems they and they may

Bmr020.D.dialogueact1486	2685.68	2687.92	D	PhD	s	-1	0	problems they do already and they may just guess at what those cutoff words are but 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1488	2687.29	2687.37	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	cutoff words are but 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1489	2687.92	2690.63	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but what what we would like cutoff words are but let me we're going to adjust everything 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1490	2689.59	2692.24	A	Grad	s	-1	0	but what what we would like them to do is be conservative so that they should only everything 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1491	2692.41	2695.0	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	so that they should only write down the transcript if they're shore and otherwise they should market market

Bmr020.B.dialogueact1552	2798.95	2800.15	B	PhD	s	-1	0	that's just my amount of speech i'm not 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1553	2800.53	2801.6	B	PhD	s^e.%--	-1	0	i'm not 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1554	2802.24	2804.24	B	PhD	s	-1	0	you know to take this test is speech but it's not 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1555	2804.24	2804.84	B	PhD	s	-1	0	but it's not 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1556	2805.76	2809.9	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so that that can be oh when when it's really impressive channel 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1557	2810.24	2811.49	F	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	yeah but i think it's less of a problem most listeners 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1559	2811.73	2811.83	B	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah a problem most listeners 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1558	2811.49	2812.03	F	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah a problem most listeners just wasted time 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1560	2812.03	2812.9	F	Professor	s	-1	0	just wasted time 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1561	2813.04	2813.22	B	PhD	b	-1	0	and and 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1562	2813.64	2815.01	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and and that's for a good me now what about in

Bmr020.B.dialogueact1564	2819.85	2826.11	B	PhD	s^no	+1	1	i counts really side don't have freely or numbers i think that's really 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1565	2826.62	2827.36	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	that's really i i did 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1566	2827.36	2832.43	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	i i did this on on four meetings and only five minutes a full fire him you know if if these meetings so 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1567	2832.43	2835.17	B	PhD	s	-1	0	meetings so it's not not that her son that just but 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1568	2835.17	2835.38	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	but 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1569	2836.19	2837.54	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	it's perhaps 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1570	2838.24	2838.27	B	PhD	x	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1571	2840.06	2840.47	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1572	2841.04	2844.02	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	it's perhaps time and steps five percent of something which uh some 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1573	2844.02	2848.3	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which uh some of the frames speech france which i which i miss but i'm 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1574	2848.3	2850.56	B	PhD	s	-1	0	but i'm become kind really tell 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1575	2850.87	2851.1	F	Professor	b	-1	0	really tell 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1576	2851.24	2860.66	F	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so it sometimes you might want to go back and look at it more in terms of how many times is there's bert that's that's uh interrupted 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1577	2855.72	2855.89	B	PhD	b	-1	0	at it more in terms 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1578	2859.87	2860.04	B	PhD	b	-1	0	that's uh interrupted 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1579	2861.45	2861.53	B	PhD	b	-1	0	something like 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1580	2861.5	2862.3	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and something like that 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1581	2862.97	2870.35	C	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and the promise when it when it uh on the breath he wants where you get reading back into indicated speech that 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1582	2863.06	2863.46	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	the promise when 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1583	2863.6	2863.73	B	PhD	fg	-1	0	the promise when 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1584	2871.07	2875.59	C	Postdoc	s^cs.%--	-1	0	and i guess we could just indicate to the transcribers not too and coat that if they could yeah 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1585	2875.89	2877.06	C	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	that if they could still do the p. file yeah again i i think that that is probably less 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1586	2875.95	2878.93	F	Professor	s^bk|s^ng	-1	0	that if they could still do the p. file yeah again i i think that that is probably less of a problem because 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1587	2878.93	2887.5	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	of a problem because if you're if there's if if if a word is is split that they might have to listen to a few times really understand that they can't quite get it whereas 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1588	2879.89	2880.09	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	if you're if there's 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1589	2886.28	2886.47	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	that they can't quite 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1592	2888.23	2888.32	B	PhD	fg	-1	0	if they listen 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1590	2887.76	2887.98	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	get it whereas 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1591	2888.1	2892.34	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	if they listen to it and there's don't hear any speech i think they probably just listen to it once so that you'd think 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1593	2890.72	2890.87	B	PhD	b	-1	0	hear any speech i think 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1594	2892.34	2896.94	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	so that you'd think there would be a factor three or four in in uh cost function 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1595	2894.72	2894.89	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	a factor three or 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1596	2897.11	2898.44	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	yeah so but i you know between them or something 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1597	2898.27	2898.35	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah so but i 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1598	2898.42	2904.04	B	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	yeah so but i think that's that but it doesn't happen very often but that have run just caught in the middle of something that's that's really 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1599	2904.1	2906.72	B	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	that's that's really not not normal 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1600	2907.06	2917.41	F	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	there's not a speech yeah yeah so so what you're saying is that nearly always what happens when there's a problem is that is that uh there's some uh uh non speech that uh they just interpreters seats 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1601	2916.15	2917.06	B	PhD	s^2	-1	0	there's not a speech yeah yeah they just interpreters seats 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1602	2917.06	2917.21	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah yeah 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1603	2917.62	2917.78	B	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah yeah 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1604	2918.16	2920.04	F	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	well then we really should just send this stuff right

Bmr020.C.dialogueact1735	3081.17	3081.41	C	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	i mean so my standard 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1736	3081.41	3088.29	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i mean so my standard approaches been if it's not someone close miked then they don't end up on one of the quotes like channels they end up on a different 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1737	3088.34	3089.41	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	they end up on a different channel and we have 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1738	3089.58	3091.56	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	channel and we have any number of channels available i mean it's an infinite 
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1739	3091.19	3091.63	F	Professor	b	-1	0	available i mean it's an infinite 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1741	3091.95	3092.04	B	PhD	b	-1	0	but available i mean it's an infinite number of so 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1740	3091.56	3092.84	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	but available i mean it's an infinite number of so 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1743	3093.03	3093.14	B	PhD	fg	-1	0	when just put them on some 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1742	3092.9	3094.45	C	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	but when the when this is sensitive number of so just put them on some other time 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1744	3094.11	3099.61	B	PhD	s^no.%--	-1	0	yeah the when this is sensitive to the i mean i've been friends gross i i don't know if if they can tell that's really other time yeah 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1745	3096.62	3096.76	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	been friends gross i yeah 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1746	3096.76	3097.27	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	been friends gross i i don't know if if yeah 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1747	3100.03	3102.73	A	Grad	s^aa|s^df	-1	0	because there will be no channel on which it is foreground yeah yeah 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1748	3101.53	3101.69	B	PhD	b	-1	0	on which it is yeah 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1749	3102.85	3103.04	B	PhD	b	-1	0	foreground yeah well they convention 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1751	3103.58	3103.93	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	well they convention 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1750	3103.29	3109.17	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	right but well they convention in their own procedures which is four background sound 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1752	3109.63	3112.99	A	Grad	s^bk|s^nd	-1	0	right but uh in general i don't think we want them transcribing the background 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1753	3112.99	3114.22	A	Grad	s^df^nd	-1	0	the background because i would be too much work right 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1754	3113.19	3114.46	A	Grad	b.%	-1	0	because i would be too much work right 
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1755	3114.46	3114.66	B	PhD	b	-1	0	right 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1756	3114.96	3115.1	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right for it because in the overlap 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1757	3115.1	3115.36	A	Grad	%--	-1	0	for it because in the overlap 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1758	3115.36	3117.48	A	Grad	s^df.%-	-1	0	for it because in the overlap sections then they'll well i don't think jane saying they're going to 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1759	3116.68	3118.53	D	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	sections then they'll well i don't think jane saying they're going to transcribe it they'll just market 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1760	3118.53	3121.02	D	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	but that's going to be all over the place transcribe it they'll just market is being there some background stuff that right 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1761	3120.52	3122.13	A	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	but that's going to be all over the place how how they tell the background stuff that right 
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1763	3121.48	3121.68	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	be all over the place right

Bmr020.C.dialogueact1766	3128.02	3131.1	C	Postdoc	s^cs^nd	-1	0	how i think i think it'd be easy to say background laptop but wait 
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1768	3132.04	3132.87	A	Grad	qw^nd	-1	0	would they know that a minute why would they treat them 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1767	3131.68	3132.24	D	PhD	s^co	-1	0	how would they know that but wait a minute why would they treat them 
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1769	3132.24	3133.48	D	PhD	qw^bu	-1	0	would they know that well a minute why would they treat them differently
