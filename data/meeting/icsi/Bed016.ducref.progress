The thesis proposal focuses on how construal works in the tourist domain.
One can build a probabilistic relational model with domain general rules that define how ontology , situation , user and discourse models combine to infer intentions.
The talk for EML includes a presentation of the motivation behind the project , as well as the work already done on SmartKom ( parser , generator , synthesis ).
Furthermore , the data collection currently taking place and some preliminary observations are going to be outlined.
All this is going to be given from the perspective of the general theoretical framework , NTL , with further explanations on X-schemas and also the embodied simulation approach.
