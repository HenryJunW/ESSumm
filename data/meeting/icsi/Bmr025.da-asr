Bmr025.D.dialogueact45	95.02	99.02	D	PhD	s	+1	1	i you uh just process the first five you meetings and they are trumped 
Bmr025.D.dialogueact46	99.02	100.49	D	PhD	s	+1	1	they are trumped up so do 
Bmr025.D.dialogueact47	100.49	103.43	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	up so do it they probably can be sent to i b. m.

Bmr025.F.dialogueact54	109.044	111.074	F	PhD	s	+1	1	okay other ones that's the one that we're waiting to hear from them on 
Bmr025.D.dialogueact55	109.62	109.78	D	PhD	b	-1	0	other ones that's the one that we're waiting 
Bmr025.D.dialogueact56	111.027	111.147	D	PhD	b	-1	0	okay 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact58	111.85	112.19	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	okay these it's separate

Bmr025.A.dialogueact59	112.535	114.225	A	Postdoc	s^bu.%-	-1	0	these it's separate from the ones that i mean do you there's i b. 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact60	112.57	112.92	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	these it's separate 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact61	114.435	114.905	A	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	that i mean do you there's i b. 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact62	114.63	115.44	F	PhD	s	-1	0	that i mean do you there's i b. m. set

Bmr025.A.dialogueact67	117.11	117.3	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	and so 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact66	116.987	117.167	F	PhD	b	-1	0	and so 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact69	117.78	121.7	F	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	and so as soon as we hear from bryan that this one is okay came we get 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact68	117.59	118.16	H	Grad	qy^rt^t1	-1	0	and so as soon as we hear 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact70	118.16	118.38	H	Grad	b	-1	0	as soon as we hear 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact71	121.7	122.92	F	PhD	s	+1	1	this one is okay came we get the transcript back and 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact72	122.92	129.389	F	PhD	s	+1	1	the transcript back and we find out that hopefully there are no problems matching up the transcript with what we gave them 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact73	130.45	133.98	F	PhD	s^cc	+1	1	and uh we'll be ready to go would descend in the next four as a big patch 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact74	134.318	134.678	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	and let 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact75	134.81	135.77	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and let them work on that 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact76	136.12	139.26	H	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	yes and so we're doing those as destroying from the ones are transcribing here 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact77	139.58	139.72	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yes here 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact79	140.13	140.58	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	exactly so doing think it 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact78	139.91	140.3	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yes exactly so doing here think it 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact80	140.58	141.72	F	PhD	s	+1	2	exactly so doing things unparalleled away we think it 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact81	141.72	143.33	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	things unparalleled away we can get as much done at once yeah i think that's the right way to do it 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact82	142.91	144.02	H	Grad	s^na	-1	0	can get as much done at once yeah i think that's the right way to do it especially for the information 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact83	143.91	144.09	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	once i think that's the right way to do it especially for the information 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact84	144.17	146.06	H	Grad	s^e	+1	3	especially for the information retrieval so 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact85	148.891	150.401	H	Grad	qy^d^rt^t	-1	0	anything else on transcription service 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact86	150.217	150.437	A	Postdoc	s^ar	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr025.H.dialogueact87	151.62	151.8	H	Grad	s^bk^rt	-1	0	okay 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact88	152.36	152.93	B	Professor	s^rt^t	+1	2	pepperdine where we 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact89	152.93	154.67	B	Professor	s^e^rt	-1	0	pepperdine where we had this sub meeting the other day right which 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact90	154.56	155.7	H	Grad	fg|%--	-1	0	the other day right which uh 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact91	156.82	161.38	H	Grad	s	+1	1	so i've been working on using this this'll tools to do information retrieval and meeting data and 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact92	161.908	165.822	H	Grad	s	+1	1	data and the tools are there two sets as a back in the front and so 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact93	165.942	167.312	H	Grad	s	+1	2	the front and so the funding disease or these face in the back and 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact94	167.312	170.532	H	Grad	s	+1	2	face in the back and is the indexing tool and the korean tool 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact95	171.4	176.37	H	Grad	s	+1	2	and so i've written some tools to convert everything into the right for file formats and 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact96	176.774	181.7	H	Grad	s	+1	2	and uh command line version of the neck thing creating is now working 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact97	182.369	188.493	H	Grad	s	+1	1	so at least on the one meeting that i had the transcript for uh conveniently you can now do information retrieval on it do type 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact98	188.593	193.003	H	Grad	s^e	+1	1	what what kind on it do type in a a string and get back a list of start in times for the meeting uh it hits 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact100	193.57	196.28	F	PhD	qw	-1	0	what what kind of what is that look like a stringy type and what are you are you uh it hits 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact99	193.479	194.389	H	Grad	s^e	-1	0	what what kind of what is uh it hits 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact101	196.28	198.23	F	PhD	qr.%--	-1	0	and what are you are you the the key words are they okay works 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact102	197.91	198.34	H	Grad	s^aa^m	-1	0	the the key words are they okay works 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact103	198.46	198.77	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	they okay works 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact104	199.431	199.691	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	right and 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact105	199.82	206.376	H	Grad	s	-1	0	right and so and then it munchers that uh pass it to this is y. r. which uses nasty m. l. like format for everything 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact106	206.73	207.22	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr025.B.dialogueact107	207.427	209.21	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	there's a place in america that sometimes and um right 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact108	209.21	210.54	B	Professor	qr	-1	0	that sometimes and now i um right now i 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact109	209.533	215.043	H	Grad	s^na	-1	0	that sometimes and now i um right now i have a tool that will do that on a command line using arts standard tools but my intention 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact110	215.199	215.639	B	Professor	b	-1	0	but my intention 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact111	215.475	218.935	H	Grad	s.%--	+1	2	but my intention is to do a pretty or user interface based either 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact112	219.44	222.99	H	Grad	s^cs^t:qw	-1	0	so so that's the other thing i want to discuss is well what should we do for these the user face we 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact113	222.99	225.706	H	Grad	s	-1	0	we do for these the user face we have two tools that have already been written um 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact114	225.796	228.266	H	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	been written um this all sound guys did a web based on um 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact115	228.689	229.069	B	Professor	b	-1	0	on um which i haven't 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact116	229.001	231.331	H	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	which i haven't used haven't looked at dances it's pretty 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact117	231.331	232.681	H	Grad	s	-1	0	at dances it's pretty good 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact118	232.962	233.272	B	Professor	b	-1	0	good but it does mean 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact119	233.196	235.906	H	Grad	s	+1	3	but it does mean you need to be running a web server 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact120	236.418	236.768	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and so it 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact121	236.76	238.69	H	Grad	s	+1	3	and so it it's pretty big and complex 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact122	239.424	241.674	H	Grad	fh|s	+1	3	uh and it would be difficult support windows because i mean 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact123	241.674	243.894	H	Grad	s^df	-1	0	windows because i mean supporting the web server to windows 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact124	244.49	244.93	B	Professor	b	-1	0	uhhuh uh 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact125	244.967	250.614	H	Grad	s	+1	3	uhhuh uh the other option is dan did uh tickle t. k. a. this'll gooey front and for broadcast news which i think 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact126	249.616	249.906	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and for broadcast 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact127	250.614	251.584	H	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	news which i think looks great i think that's a nice 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact128	251.584	252.654	H	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	looks great i think that's a nice demo 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact129	253.177	255.757	H	Grad	s	-1	0	um and that would be much easier to port to windows 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact130	256.07	257.49	H	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	and so i think that's the way we should go 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact131	258.666	259.796	A	Postdoc	qy	-1	0	i can ask a question so 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact133	260.006	265.59	A	Postdoc	fh|s:s	-1	0	um as it stands with them that the channel trans interface it's possible to do a find and play 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact132	259.612	259.982	H	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	ask a question so 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact134	266.3	267.75	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you can find a search string in place so what 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact135	267.75	274.352	A	Postdoc	qo^bu.%-	-1	0	string in place so what are you so you're adding like um i don't know uh or the fuzzy matches or are they uh it's a sort of standard 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact136	273.632	276.301	H	Grad	s	-1	0	they uh it's a sort of standard text retrieval based 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact137	277.32	280.62	H	Grad	s	-1	0	so it's uh term frequency inverse document frequency scoring 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact138	281.036	281.466	A	Postdoc	s^bk^rt	-1	0	um 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact139	281.395	284.589	H	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um and then there are all sorts of metrics for spacing how far apart 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact140	284.589	286.679	H	Grad	s^e	-1	0	spacing how far apart they have to be and things like that 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact141	287.343	288.233	H	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	lot more sophisticated so it's it's 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact142	288.337	291.77	A	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	lot more sophisticated than they um basically windows space it's like doing a google corey

Bmr025.A.dialogueact178	364.0	366.29	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	some point we're going to have to say with their private joke is that keeps coming yeah 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact179	366.29	367.16	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	is that keeps coming up yeah and 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact180	366.37	366.61	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	is that keeps coming yeah 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact181	367.974	369.054	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	up and then again maybe not so 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact182	369.054	370.914	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so uh 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact183	371.59	372.64	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah that sounds it sounds as if it right 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact184	372.64	377.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it sounds as if it my my recollection is it's it's a pretty reasonable uh demo sort of format yeah that sounds good that sounds really neat right and so i think they'd 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact185	372.893	373.153	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	it sounds as if it my my recollection right 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact186	376.35	376.95	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	uh demo sort yeah that sounds good and so i think 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact187	376.74	380.161	H	Grad	s	-1	0	uh demo sort of format yeah that sounds good that sounds really neat and so i think they'd be minimal effort to get it to work minimally and then would want to add 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact188	377.24	378.01	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	of format that sounds really neat they'd be minimal effort to get 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact189	380.161	384.511	H	Grad	s^cs:s	-1	0	and then would want to add things like creed by speaker night meeting and all that sort of stuff um 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact190	384.971	387.651	H	Grad	s	-1	0	of stuff um dave gilbert express some interest in working on that's all work 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact191	387.651	388.691	H	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	on that's all work with him on it 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact192	389.078	390.248	H	Grad	s	-1	0	and it's looking pretty good you know the fact 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact193	390.408	392.638	H	Grad	s^e	-1	0	you know the fact that like off the court system working 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact194	393.193	396.333	H	Grad	s^ba^cs	-1	0	so if we want to just do a video based when i think that'll be easy everyone 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact195	396.693	397.063	B	Professor	b	-1	0	huh everyone to get windows it's 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact196	396.811	399.051	H	Grad	s	-1	0	huh everyone to get windows it's going to be a little more work because uh 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact197	399.051	404.63	H	Grad	s^df.%--	-1	0	because uh this'll i already information retrieval pools um i difficulty

Bmr025.B.dialogueact199	407.303	407.673	B	Professor	b	-1	0	getting him to 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact200	407.46	410.797	H	Grad	s	-1	0	getting him to compile on windows might be challenging 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact201	411.231	411.581	B	Professor	b	-1	0	but you were saying so 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact202	411.61	416.805	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	but you were saying that that thee uh that there's a set of tools uh sickness tools that so it certainly 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact203	411.812	412.082	H	Grad	fh	-1	0	but you were saying that that thee so 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact204	416.732	417.732	H	Grad	s^na	-1	0	tools that it certainly helps 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact205	418.11	418.43	F	PhD	b	-1	0	um me without 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact206	418.202	420.502	H	Grad	s	-1	0	um me without those i wouldn't even attempt it 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact208	420.88	421.34	B	Professor	b	-1	0	it but what does they 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact207	420.67	420.98	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	it 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact209	421.222	425.472	H	Grad	s	-1	0	but what does they what those do is provide sort of a b. s. t. compatibility layer so 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact211	426.153	426.663	B	Professor	b	-1	0	that the normal unix

Bmr025.B.dialogueact212	427.58	428.09	B	Professor	b	-1	0	function calls all work um 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact214	429.341	430.241	F	PhD	s^bu.%-	-1	0	you have to have all the but the problem is that 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact213	428.998	429.358	H	Grad	fh	-1	0	you have to have all um but the 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact215	429.89	433.48	H	Grad	s	-1	0	you have to have all the but the problem is that that the special tools didn't use anything like auto cough 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact216	434.423	440.499	H	Grad	s	-1	0	and so you have the normal porting problems of different header files and some things are defined in some things aren't and 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact217	441.092	444.6	H	Grad	s	-1	0	uh different compile or work around and so on so the fact 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact218	444.6	453.701	H	Grad	s	-1	0	how about well and so on so the fact that um it took me a data get it compile just solaris means it's probably going to take me significantly more than that to get it to compile under windows 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact219	453.8	456.01	B	Professor	qo^cs	-1	0	how about having a run under freebie estee well you need windows freebies beastie would probably

Bmr025.E.dialogueact222	457.98	463.02	E	PhD	s:s	-1	0	all you need to do is say and she it'd be nice if this work under under constant it'll be done in a day right be easier

Bmr025.H.dialogueact283	543.445	545.665	H	Grad	s^df	-1	0	right because he worked on the transcriber stuff 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact284	545.83	546.03	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right and stuff and he's more familiar with tickled 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact285	546.072	547.862	H	Grad	s^df	-1	0	and then you get it then you get the and he's more familiar with tickled to k. than i am 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact286	546.94	549.87	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and then you get it then you get the windows media playing for free and he's more familiar with tickled to k. than i am 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact287	550.23	552.73	H	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	well that's snack not not transcriber 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact288	553.6	558.94	E	PhD	s^aa|s^df	-1	0	right but the point is that the tries to resist snack and then you can but you can use a lot of the same function now any yeah 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact290	558.94	559.22	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	same function now any yeah i mean i i think 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact289	558.879	563.239	H	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	same function now any yeah i mean i i think some folks crystal gooey probably use a snack 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact291	564.4	567.02	H	Grad	s	-1	0	and so my intention was just to base it on that 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact292	569.33	569.51	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah well 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact293	569.901	576.1	E	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	yeah well my thought laces i mean i it would be nice to have the running transcripts um it you know for speakers speaker right and if it doesn't 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact294	570.48	571.13	H	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	my thought laces i mean i it would be nice to and if it doesn't 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact295	576.75	576.98	E	PhD	qy^d^g	-1	0	right 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact296	577.11	580.56	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	do you have you have you know let's become here and it's become more clear right we'll have 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact297	580.183	583.233	H	Grad	s^bk|s^cc	-1	0	more clear right well that was my thought right we'll have to figure out the user interface for that so 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact298	582.42	586.255	E	PhD	fg|s^cs	-1	0	right well that was my thought was if you had like multi trans or whatever to it interface for that so yeah 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact299	586.83	587.18	E	PhD	s^e	-1	0	it yeah 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact300	587.052	587.582	H	Grad	s^am	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr025.H.dialogueact301	588.748	594.6	H	Grad	s	-1	0	it might be really difficult to get that to work in the little short segments would be talking about and having 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact302	594.6	596.866	H	Grad	s^e	-1	0	about and having the search tools and so on week 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact303	596.866	597.826	H	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	tools and so on week we look into it but 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact305	597.971	598.171	E	PhD	b	-1	0	we look into it but 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact304	597.866	598.076	H	Grad	fh	-1	0	we look into it but 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact306	599.237	603.507	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	the thing i was asking about with um previous day is that it might be easier to get 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact307	603.949	609.178	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	to get powerpoint shows running in previous days and to get this other package running and yeah 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact308	609.891	613.631	H	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	and yeah i mean we have to i have to sit down and try it before i make any judgments so 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact309	613.809	614.099	B	Professor	b	-1	0	judgments so uh 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact310	613.811	614.401	H	Grad	fh	-1	0	judgments so uh 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact311	615.83	616.27	H	Grad	fh	-1	0	um my experience 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact312	616.53	623.32	H	Grad	s	-1	0	my experience with the canoe compatibility library is really it's justice hard and just as easy to port to any system 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact313	624.18	624.32	H	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right the windows system isn't 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact314	624.32	625.81	H	Grad	s	-1	0	right the windows system isn't any harder because 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact315	625.81	627.69	H	Grad	s^df	-1	0	uhhuh any harder because it it looks like a b. s. d. system 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact316	627.905	628.285	B	Professor	b	-1	0	uhhuh d. system it's just you 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact317	628.47	632.71	H	Grad	s	-1	0	it's just you know just like all of them being clued files are a little different function calls are a little different 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact318	632.86	633.17	B	Professor	b	-1	0	are a little different so i it 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact319	633.261	635.221	H	Grad	s	-1	0	so i it might be a little easier but it's not going to be a lot 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact320	635.221	636.511	H	Grad	s^e	-1	0	but it's not going to be a lot easier 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact321	637.18	637.48	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr025.B.dialogueact322	638.959	640.939	B	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	so there was that demo which was one of the main ones and 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact323	640.939	643.57	B	Professor	s	-1	0	was one of the main ones and we talked about um some other stuff which is basically 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact324	643.57	648.47	B	Professor	s	-1	0	other stuff which is basically be um showing off uh the transcriber inefficient self and as 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact325	648.47	651.62	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	self and as you said maybe you could even merge those in some sense but but 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact326	651.62	652.98	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	some sense but but um 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact327	653.96	661.18	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	about uh and part of that was showing off with the speech now um um on speech stuff to them so 
Bmr025.D.dialogueact328	659.89	660.07	D	PhD	b	-1	0	so 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact329	661.462	662.512	A	Postdoc	qy	-1	0	about but so so what 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact331	662.844	666.524	A	Postdoc	qy^bu^d^rt.%-	-1	0	but so so what the are stuff then you end up with uh somewhat prioritized um excellent uhhuh right 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact330	662.456	662.746	H	Grad	s^aa^rt	-1	0	but so so what 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact332	666.467	666.727	H	Grad	s^aa^rt	-1	0	um excellent uhhuh right 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact334	667.08	667.42	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	excellent 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact333	666.987	667.297	H	Grad	s^2	-1	0	um excellent excellent uhhuh right 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact335	667.54	667.92	A	Postdoc	s^bk^r	-1	0	excellent 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact336	668.863	669.013	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	to another idea 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact337	669.18	679.334	G	PhD	s^cs	+1	2	to another idea i had just now actually for the demo was whether it might get interested to show some of the probably the uh work that don's been doing 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact338	679.736	680.136	B	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	um 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact339	680.56	683.0	G	PhD	fh|s^cs^e	-1	0	um actually show some of the features and then show 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact340	683.0	688.36	G	PhD	s^cs^e	+1	1	and then show friends since the test like finding sentence boundaries are finding turned boundaries 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact341	689.33	689.67	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr025.G.dialogueact342	690.36	693.15	G	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	you can show that graphically sort of what the teachers are doing it you know it doesn't work 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact343	693.22	696.18	G	PhD	s	+1	1	well i think it you know it doesn't work great but it's definitely giving us something i don't know 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact344	696.7	697.07	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	well i think it i don't know if that would be of interest 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact346	697.07	700.87	B	Professor	s^na	+1	1	it at the very least we're going to want something for to that because if that would be of interest uh 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact345	696.729	698.599	G	PhD	s^no	+1	1	well i think it at the very least i don't know if that would be of interest uh 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact347	700.87	702.36	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	for to that because i'm going to want to talk about it and so 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact348	702.47	708.57	B	Professor	s	+1	1	it and so if there's something that shows it graphically it's much better than me just having a bullet point 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact349	702.87	703.21	G	PhD	b	-1	0	it and so if there's something 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact350	709.16	710.74	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	putting something i don't know much about so i mean you're looking at this 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact351	709.69	711.44	G	PhD	s	-1	0	putting something i don't know much about so i mean you're looking at this now are you looking at ways 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact352	710.74	711.0	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	know much about so looking at this now are you looking at ways 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact353	711.44	713.12	G	PhD	qr^rt	-1	0	um yeah i'm starting to now are you looking at ways not love 
Bmr025.C.dialogueact354	712.52	713.87	C	Grad	h|s	-1	0	um yeah i'm starting to not love 
Bmr025.C.dialogueact355	714.18	714.61	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	and 
Bmr025.C.dialogueact356	715.741	716.771	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr025.C.dialogueact357	717.736	723.05	C	Grad	s^cc	+1	1	so when we are having yeah we could probably find some examples of different type of person i think events going on 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact358	720.03	720.34	G	PhD	s^aa.%-	-1	0	different type of person 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact359	722.869	729.419	B	Professor	s	+1	2	so when we are having this to meeting we were sort of coming up with this that we want to have all these pieces together to first order by the end of the month events going on 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact360	723.126	723.376	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	when we are having 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact361	730.168	731.688	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then that would give this a week or so we end of uh the end of this month or 
Bmr025.C.dialogueact363	731.16	731.64	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	a week or so we end of the end of this month or 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact362	730.863	732.363	G	PhD	qr^bu	-1	0	and then that would give this a week or so we end of uh the end of this month or next oh this month 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact365	732.768	733.878	G	PhD	s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	june next oh you mean like today this month 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact364	732.466	732.976	H	Grad	s	-1	0	next oh this month 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact366	733.42	733.69	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	june you mean like today 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact367	734.341	734.591	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact369	735.33	736.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	june june june yeah oh sorry next month is this 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact370	735.43	735.79	G	PhD	s^bk^m	+1	2	june june yeah oh sorry next

Bmr025.C.dialogueact371	735.95	736.36	C	Grad	b	-1	0	june june june yeah oh sorry next month is this 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact372	736.12	736.35	G	PhD	s^fa	-1	0	june month is this 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact373	736.5	737.58	H	Grad	s	-1	0	june month is this your first visit 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact374	737.541	738.221	F	PhD	s	-1	0	uh your first visit 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact375	737.58	737.79	H	Grad	qy^d^g	-1	0	your first visit 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact377	738.703	745.834	B	Professor	fg|s	+1	2	uh that would that would give us they'll give us a week or so to uh to port things over to my laptop to make sure that works i think 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact376	738.68	739.1	E	PhD	b	-1	0	uh that would that 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact378	740.245	740.475	G	PhD	s^fa^r	-1	0	would give us 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact380	745.834	745.894	B	Professor	b	-1	0	sure that works i think 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact379	745.8	747.11	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	sure that works yeah i mean i'd be here i think i mean where yeah 
Bmr025.C.dialogueact381	746.4	747.63	C	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	yeah i mean i'd be here i mean where yeah 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact382	747.75	750.71	G	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	i'd be here yeah if the if done some sort of talk to whoever's because we're 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact384	751.069	751.279	B	Professor	b	-1	0	doing this anyway as part 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact383	750.71	753.89	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	to whoever's because we're doing this anyway as part of our you know the research visualizing 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact385	753.89	755.62	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	you know the research visualizing what these teachers are doing and so either 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact386	755.14	755.32	B	Professor	b	-1	0	are doing and so either 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact387	755.62	756.38	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	are doing and so either might not 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact388	756.697	757.797	G	PhD	s	-1	0	might not be integrated but 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact389	757.797	760.047	G	PhD	s	-1	0	be integrated but it could potentially be in it 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact391	761.47	763.13	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah this is to an audience of researchers so i mean you know to 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact390	761.327	761.887	G	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah this is to 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact392	763.13	763.9	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	so i mean you know to 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact393	763.96	766.47	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so i mean you know to that's supposed to let them know what is we're doing so i mean it's different i don't think anyone 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact394	764.558	765.408	G	PhD	s	-1	0	that's supposed to let them know what is i mean it's different 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact395	766.47	766.87	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	we're doing so i don't think anyone 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact396	766.5	768.39	G	PhD	s	-1	0	we're doing so i don't think anyone has done this on meeting is it might be neat 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact397	768.39	769.93	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	is it might be neat 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact398	769.43	769.67	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr025.B.dialogueact399	771.654	771.804	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr025.B.dialogueact400	773.88	774.23	B	Professor	s^rt^t^tc	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr025.B.dialogueact401	775.47	776.18	B	Professor	qy^d^rt^t^tc	-1	0	smell too um 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact402	776.53	777.03	H	Grad	fh	-1	0	um so i've 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact403	777.83	779.93	H	Grad	s	+1	2	so i've been doing a bunch of x. m. l. tools we 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact404	779.93	783.735	H	Grad	s	-1	0	of x. m. l. tools we are we're sort of moving to x. m. l. is the general format for everything and i think that's 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact405	783.735	785.145	H	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	for everything and i think that's definitely the right way to go because there are a lot 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact406	785.145	790.265	H	Grad	s^df	+1	1	because there are a lot of tools they'll let you do extraction and reformat reformatted of x. m. l. tools um 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact407	790.803	791.203	H	Grad	fh	-1	0	um so 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact408	792.002	796.512	H	Grad	s^cs	+1	1	yet again we should probably need to talk about transcription formats in x. m. l. because i'm not 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact409	796.512	799.042	H	Grad	s^df	-1	0	x. m. l. because i'm not particularly happy with what we have now i mean worked 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact410	799.525	800.805	H	Grad	s	-1	0	i mean worked with transcriber but it 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact411	800.805	803.135	H	Grad	s	-1	0	with transcriber but it it's a pain to use and other tools uh because it 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact412	803.515	805.285	H	Grad	s^df	-1	0	starting uh because it doesn't mark start and and 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact413	806.0	807.75	F	PhD	qy^d.%--	-1	0	and of each parents 
Bmr025.D.dialogueact415	806.556	806.686	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact414	806.169	806.409	H	Grad	h	-1	0	and 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact416	807.7	808.23	H	Grad	s^2	-1	0	of each other and just parents 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact417	808.322	808.822	F	PhD	s^2^bk	-1	0	other and just 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact418	808.822	809.392	F	PhD	qy^bu^d	-1	0	other and just marks so it's implicit in 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact419	809.11	810.54	H	Grad	s	-1	0	marks yeah so it's implicit in in there but you have to do

Bmr025.H.dialogueact560	984.91	988.406	H	Grad	s	-1	0	ready to go yet because um it's hard to tell whether the mics connected or not because 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact561	988.496	993.72	H	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	or not because the best quality once the crown ones are about the same level if they're off and 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact562	994.012	996.362	H	Grad	s^e	-1	0	no one's or if they're on and no one's talking 
Bmr025.C.dialogueact563	996.45	996.7	C	Grad	b	-1	0	talking 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact564	997.51	1000.47	H	Grad	s	-1	0	um these these ones that are much easier there's a bigger 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact565	1000.61	1001.58	H	Grad	s^df	-1	0	easier there's a bigger difference 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact566	1002.25	1003.25	H	Grad	s	-1	0	so i'm working on that and it it sort of works 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact567	1003.25	1004.35	H	Grad	s	-1	0	and it it sort of works and so eventually 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact568	1004.35	1005.91	H	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	and so eventually will change to that and then 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact569	1005.91	1008.55	H	Grad	s^df	-1	0	will change to that and then you'll be able to see graphically if you're my kids dropping in or out 
Bmr025.C.dialogueact570	1009.63	1011.79	C	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	but also include like battery's dying just yep 
Bmr025.C.dialogueact572	1012.04	1014.44	C	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	anytime the of bring out there is basically yep yep

Bmr025.H.dialogueact573	1013.1	1013.28	H	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	bring out there is basically yep

Bmr025.H.dialogueact576	1015.35	1015.65	H	Grad	%-	-1	0	but what the screensaver now 
Bmr025.D.dialogueact578	1015.98	1016.48	D	PhD	b	-1	0	but yeah what the screensaver kicking in it now 
Bmr025.C.dialogueact580	1017.09	1017.4	C	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah that screensaver 
Bmr025.D.dialogueact581	1017.39	1017.55	D	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah that screensaver 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact579	1016.98	1018.43	H	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	yeah yeah that kicking in it screensaver too 
Bmr025.C.dialogueact582	1018.74	1019.0	C	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	speaking of too um 
Bmr025.C.dialogueact584	1019.6	1020.34	C	Grad	s	-1	0	speaking of which um thing is as i said 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact583	1019.33	1022.6	H	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	speaking of which um thing is as i said before it is actually on the 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact585	1023.03	1023.47	H	Grad	s^e	-1	0	thing there's a little level 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact586	1023.47	1024.57	H	Grad	s	-1	0	thing there's a little level meter but of 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact587	1024.86	1026.57	H	Grad	s	-1	0	meter but of course no one ever pays attention to it so i think 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact588	1026.57	1030.48	H	Grad	s	-1	0	it would to it so i think having it on the screen it's more easy to notice 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact589	1030.86	1033.6	A	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	it would be nice if if these had little light indicators really lead

Bmr025.B.dialogueact600	1042.67	1042.93	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	okay just 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact599	1042.64	1043.91	H	Grad	qy^d^rt^t^tc	-1	0	okay just back 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact601	1044.93	1051.23	H	Grad	s	+1	2	i'm i spoke with dave johnson about putting all the meeting recorder stuff on on back to this to save the overhead it back up and he 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact602	1051.67	1054.04	H	Grad	s:s	-1	0	up and he pretty much said yeah you could do that if you want it was a bad 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact603	1054.33	1055.56	H	Grad	s^ba	+1	1	it was a bad idea 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact604	1056.2	1063.23	H	Grad	s^ba^rt	+1	2	in fact he said is doing the manual one doing uh and if you archive to copy it is a good idea that we should do 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact605	1063.52	1065.68	H	Grad	s	+1	2	that we should do that and have it backed up 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact606	1066.65	1069.96	H	Grad	s	+1	2	he he's a firm believer in in lots of different modalities of backup 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact607	1070.35	1071.7	H	Grad	s	-1	0	mean his point was well taken the state 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact608	1071.85	1073.44	H	Grad	s^df	+1	2	well taken the state it cannot be recovered 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact609	1073.78	1074.06	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and so if 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact610	1074.4	1079.52	H	Grad	s	-1	0	and so if a mistake is made and we lose the backup we should have the arc eyes and if the mistake 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact611	1079.52	1082.48	H	Grad	s	+1	2	well i guess eyes and if the mistake is made we lose the archive we should have the backup 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact612	1082.73	1087.99	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	well i guess it is true that even with something that's backed up it's not going to backup 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact613	1088.51	1093.55	B	Professor	s	+1	2	if it's stationary it's not going to go through the government is not going to burden things and incremental backgrounds just just the month playful 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact614	1092.87	1094.51	H	Grad	s^2	+1	2	and incremental backgrounds yeah just just the month playful 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact615	1093.38	1093.55	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	just the month playful 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact616	1094.85	1096.44	B	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah so the mostly phobia beer but yeah but he 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact617	1096.44	1096.54	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	beer but yeah but he 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact618	1096.6	1102.28	H	Grad	s	-1	0	beer but yeah but he said that that we shouldn't worry too much about that that we're getting 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact619	1102.42	1104.1	H	Grad	s^df	-1	0	that that we're getting a new backup system and we're far enough away 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact620	1104.1	1108.56	H	Grad	s	+1	2	really and we're far enough away from saturation on full back that it's probably okay and 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact621	1106.48	1106.68	B	Professor	qy^bh	-1	0	really full back that it's 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact622	1108.96	1119.43	H	Grad	fh|s	+1	4	okay and uh so the only issue here is the timing between getting more desks and uh recording meetings 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact623	1120.09	1129.31	B	Professor	s^bu	+1	4	so i guess the idea is that we would be reserve ing the non backed up space for things that took less than twenty four hours to re create or something like that i'm very creative 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact625	1129.31	1129.54	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	i'm very creative 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact624	1129.13	1133.34	H	Grad	s^na	+1	4	yeah i'm very creative believes leanne also yeah basically things that are incredible be 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact626	1130.87	1131.26	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah believes leanne also yeah basically 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact627	1132.67	1133.04	B	Professor	b	-1	0	things that are incredible be 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact628	1134.06	1135.75	H	Grad	s	-1	0	expanded files and things like that 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact629	1137.06	1137.53	B	Professor	b	-1	0	they take up a lot more room 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact630	1137.18	1138.4	H	Grad	s	-1	0	they take up a lot more room anyway 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact631	1139.19	1139.51	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr025.H.dialogueact632	1140.47	1141.55	H	Grad	s	-1	0	i i'm twenty need more desk 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact633	1142.23	1143.8	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	so we can get more into yeah 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact635	1143.8	1144.48	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	get more into yeah 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact634	1143.67	1143.88	H	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	get more into yeah 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact636	1145.21	1146.23	H	Grad	s	-1	0	i i think i agree with him his point was well 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact637	1146.23	1150.18	H	Grad	s	-1	0	him his point was well taken that if we lose one of these we cannot get it back 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact638	1150.6	1150.93	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr025.H.dialogueact639	1154.37	1156.11	H	Grad	s^t	-1	0	i don't think there's any other et cetera there 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact640	1157.67	1161.0	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	oh that was long someone else to come up with something related to thing and uh 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact641	1163.11	1164.9	E	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	i think that we're going to burn c. d.'s 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact642	1165.07	1168.39	H	Grad	h|s^ng	-1	0	um unfortunately we could burn c. d.'s but all it's a pain because 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact643	1168.81	1169.0	E	PhD	b	-1	0	because you have to copy it down to 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact644	1168.87	1171.82	H	Grad	s^df^rt	-1	0	because you have to copy it down to the p. c. and then burn it and that's 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact645	1171.82	1173.38	H	Grad	s^e^rt	-1	0	burn it and that's a multi step procedure and second 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact646	1173.76	1178.55	H	Grad	s	-1	0	and second of all the the right once burners as opposed to a professional press don't last 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact647	1179.08	1179.28	E	PhD	b	-1	0	so i think burning 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact648	1179.35	1181.86	H	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	so i think burning them for distribution is fine 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact649	1182.19	1184.3	H	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	but burning in for backup is not a good idea 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact650	1184.44	1184.79	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr025.E.dialogueact652	1185.79	1186.03	E	PhD	b	-1	0	because they they 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact651	1185.63	1188.56	H	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because they they well after a couple of years 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact653	1188.92	1189.12	E	PhD	b	-1	0	of years 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact654	1191.16	1194.0	A	Postdoc	s^t^tc	-1	0	to help uh it it's a different topic and they had one took typing time much 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact655	1194.0	1194.39	A	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	time much

Bmr025.H.dialogueact679	1234.82	1238.13	H	Grad	s	-1	0	paths uh got an email from uh james land day who basically said if 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact680	1238.13	1242.1	H	Grad	s^e:qy	+1	1	who basically said if you're not using them did you return them so he had he 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact681	1242.44	1248.73	H	Grad	s	-1	0	so he had he doesn't need them he just periodically you at the end of each terms and daddy email to everyone who was recorded is having them 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact682	1249.17	1251.1	H	Grad	s	-1	0	so we've never use and asks them if they're still using them 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact683	1251.09	1252.5	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	least once so we've never use them 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact684	1252.58	1253.29	A	Postdoc	s^nd	-1	0	least once them once we we use them a 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact686	1253.46	1253.8	B	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	once we we use them a 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact685	1253.42	1254.72	H	Grad	s^nd	+1	2	sometimes once then there's we we use them a couple times but 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact687	1254.0	1254.29	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	sometimes then there's couple times but 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact690	1254.78	1255.26	A	Postdoc	s^aa^m	-1	0	sometimes then there's more than one couple times but yeah

Bmr025.F.dialogueact691	1254.82	1255.48	F	PhD	qy^bu^d^e^rt	-1	0	sometimes then there's more than one couple times but yeah 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact689	1254.72	1254.99	H	Grad	fh	-1	0	sometimes then there's couple times but 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact693	1256.04	1256.2	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	we have to 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact694	1256.09	1256.45	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	we have to 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact692	1255.88	1256.53	H	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	more than one yeah we have to 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact695	1257.42	1257.84	H	Grad	fg	-1	0	um 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact696	1258.6	1258.86	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	but 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact697	1259.12	1260.77	H	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	my opinion on it is first 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact698	1260.77	1262.23	H	Grad	s	-1	0	it is first i never take notes anyway so i'm 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact699	1262.54	1263.81	H	Grad	s	-1	0	so i'm not going to use it 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact700	1264.76	1268.29	H	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um and second it's enough and infrastructure that we have to deal with 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact701	1269.23	1274.61	A	Postdoc	s^ba	+1	1	and i have uh so my my feeling on it is that i think in principle are really nice idea and you have 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact702	1274.61	1279.17	A	Postdoc	s^ba	+1	1	idea and you have the time tags which makes it better than than just taking ra ra now it's on the other hand 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact703	1279.25	1284.2	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	on the other hand i the downside for me was that i think the penn is really noisy so you could plunk 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact704	1284.2	1285.96	A	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	so you could plunk poke poke 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact705	1286.1	1287.94	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and i and i don't know if it's audible on the 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact706	1288.26	1290.19	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but i i sort of thought that was a disadvantaged i do take notes 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact707	1290.33	1291.12	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i do take notes i mean i could be taking 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact708	1291.12	1292.99	A	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	i mean i could be taking notes on these things and 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact709	1292.99	1296.57	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	notes on these things and i guess the plus with the cross pads would be the time markings but 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact710	1296.57	1296.72	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	markings but 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact711	1297.27	1297.64	A	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr025.D.dialogueact712	1298.18	1299.35	D	PhD	fg|qw^rt	-1	0	uh what is the crust 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact713	1300.27	1308.06	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so it's it's and it's a regular had just a regular pad of paper but there's a span which indicates position and so 
Bmr025.C.dialogueact714	1302.6	1302.94	C	Grad	s^ft^t3	-1	0	had 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact715	1308.75	1312.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so you have time and position stuff stored so that you can 
Bmr025.D.dialogueact716	1308.83	1309.18	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and so you have time and 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact717	1312.1	1315.12	B	Professor	s	+1	1	so that you can you have a record of whatever it is you've written 
Bmr025.D.dialogueact718	1315.41	1315.66	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr025.H.dialogueact719	1316.24	1317.26	H	Grad	s	-1	0	and then you can download it and they have 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact720	1317.26	1320.55	H	Grad	s	-1	0	okay it and they have o. c. r. and searching and all sorts of things 
Bmr025.D.dialogueact721	1319.24	1319.52	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay and searching and all sorts 
Bmr025.D.dialogueact722	1320.14	1320.32	D	PhD	b	-1	0	of things 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact723	1321.43	1323.94	H	Grad	s	+1	1	um if you take notes it's a great little device 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact724	1321.93	1322.54	A	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	um if you take notes it's 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact725	1324.91	1326.18	H	Grad	s	-1	0	and one of the reasons but i don't take notes so 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact726	1326.25	1332.41	B	Professor	s	+1	1	and one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because uh we were interested in in higher level things not just uh you so 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact727	1326.5	1326.78	H	Grad	fh	-1	0	and one of the reasons so 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact728	1332.41	1336.75	B	Professor	s	+1	1	things not just uh you know microphone stuff and also summer as a nation and so forth and the question 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact729	1336.75	1343.93	B	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	so forth and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what what what was it that happened to me you know where where they come from 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact730	1344.11	1347.83	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and um i think that was one of the things right 
Bmr025.D.dialogueact731	1344.36	1344.55	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and um 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact733	1347.04	1347.41	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	things right 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact732	1346.7	1346.91	H	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	of the 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact734	1347.83	1348.16	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	things right and so that it 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact735	1348.16	1350.01	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	and so that it seemed like any idea well have a you know have described 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact736	1350.01	1351.44	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	well have a you know have described how 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact737	1351.94	1355.69	B	Professor	s	-1	0	how somebody uh take good notes and then that's part of the record the meeting 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact738	1356.15	1358.32	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and then we did it once or twice a young sort of probably yep and just sort of died out 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact739	1357.4	1359.11	H	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	or twice a young sort of probably chose drugs crime yep and just sort of died out 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact740	1358.84	1360.03	B	Professor	s^j	-1	0	of probably chose drugs crime but is just sort of died out yeah that's right 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact741	1360.03	1361.63	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	well i did one but is it's uh yeah that's right 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact743	1360.48	1360.84	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	but is yeah that's right 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact742	1360.4	1361.17	H	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	well i did one but is it's uh yeah that's right 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact744	1361.47	1362.31	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	well i did one time but um it's uh 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact746	1362.31	1362.57	H	Grad	b	-1	0	time but um 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact745	1362.31	1363.16	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	time but um but 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact747	1362.64	1362.9	B	Professor	b	-1	0	time but um 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact748	1363.6	1371.25	A	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	but i guess maybe other thing i'm thinking is if we wanted that kind of thing that i wonder if we'd lose that much by having someone be ascribe by listening to the tape 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact749	1371.25	1373.72	A	Postdoc	s^cs^e	-1	0	by listening to the tape to the recording afterwards 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact750	1374.0	1376.73	A	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	taking notes and some other interface i mean we're transcribing 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact751	1376.7	1378.19	F	PhD	s	-1	0	other interface i mean we're transcribing anyways but when you know 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact752	1378.19	1378.98	F	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	but when you know 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact753	1379.32	1380.39	A	Postdoc	s^nd	-1	0	it's like it's useful have a summary summer i think because that summary 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact754	1379.48	1380.28	H	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	it's like it's useful have a summary summer i think because that summary 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact755	1380.39	1382.18	A	Postdoc	s^ng	-1	0	have a summary and high points summer i think there's also there's this use 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact757	1380.73	1381.33	B	Professor	s^m	-1	0	have a summary and high points summer i think there's also 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact756	1380.42	1380.87	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	have a summary summer i think 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact758	1381.3	1381.87	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	and high points there's also 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact759	1382.5	1383.37	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	summarize there's this use that 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact760	1383.99	1385.2	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	summarize it from the transcript and that well what if you're sitting 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact761	1384.14	1384.28	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	it from the transcript 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact762	1385.31	1387.6	G	PhD	qo	+1	2	and well what if you're sitting there you just want to make an axe and you don't want 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact763	1387.6	1388.69	G	PhD	s	+1	2	an axe and you don't want to take notes and 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact764	1388.69	1389.72	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	doodle to take notes and you just want to 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact765	1389.96	1390.18	F	PhD	s^2^rt	-1	0	doodle you just want to get the summary 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact766	1390.11	1393.1	G	PhD	s	-1	0	get the summary of the transcript from this time location like you 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact767	1393.1	1396.04	G	PhD	s	-1	0	like you know and and then while you're bored you don't do anything in once in a while maybe there's 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact768	1396.04	1398.24	G	PhD	s	-1	0	in once in a while maybe there's a joking but but 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact769	1398.94	1399.19	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	but in other words you 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact770	1399.35	1404.1	G	PhD	s^bs^cs	-1	0	in other words you can use that just to highlight times in a very simple way also with i was 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact771	1404.1	1407.68	G	PhD	s	-1	0	also with i was thinking in i know morgan disagrees with me on this but 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact772	1407.68	1415.9	G	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	with me on this but suppose you have a grouping here and you want to let them note whenever they think there might be something later that they might not want to distribute in terms of content 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact773	1416.65	1419.51	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	they could just sort of making x. near that point iraq question 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact774	1419.51	1426.49	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	point iraq question mark that sort of alerts them that when they get the transcript back big gets red flags in that transcript region and they can then 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact775	1426.49	1427.69	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	region and they can then look at it so 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact776	1427.69	1427.99	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	look at it so 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact777	1428.35	1429.59	G	PhD	s	-1	0	i know we haven't been using it but 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact778	1429.62	1435.29	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	using it but i i can imagine it being useful just for certain marking time periods would you then right 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact779	1434.4	1434.59	H	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	time periods right 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact780	1435.29	1437.44	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	i guess so would you then get back in the transcript so 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact781	1436.88	1437.03	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	i guess so get back in the transcript so 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact782	1437.12	1444.95	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	i guess so oh you know what what makes something because it is maybe we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later and so 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact783	1437.44	1437.74	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	i guess so so 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact784	1444.95	1448.61	B	Professor	s	-1	0	something later and and and put some kind of summary or something uh 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact785	1448.83	1454.74	B	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	something uh you know some to be some scribes who would actually listened degree they actually listen to the whole thing not 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact786	1455.06	1458.63	B	Professor	s	-1	0	transcribe it it just sort of write down things struck him as important 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact787	1459.11	1465.75	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but then you don't you don't have the time reference uh that you have if you have that lives and you 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact788	1462.77	1463.15	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	reference uh 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact789	1465.9	1469.52	G	PhD	s	-1	0	that lives how do you synchronized to time and and you don't have a lot of other cues that might these 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact790	1467.84	1468.2	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	how do you synchronized other cues that might these 
Bmr025.F.dialogueact791	1468.59	1471.54	F	PhD	qw	-1	0	how do you synchronized to time and across town and the time of their that might these and that was one of the issues we talked 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact792	1469.88	1470.06	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	to time and across town and the time and that 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact793	1470.88	1473.17	H	Grad	s	-1	0	across town and the time of their and that was one of the issues we talked about originally and that that's part 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact794	1473.17	1477.85	H	Grad	s	-1	0	and that that's part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time the cross patents that 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact795	1477.85	1479.61	H	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	the cross patents that mean synchronized and the time 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact796	1478.99	1479.46	G	PhD	b	-1	0	mean synchronized and the time 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact798	1480.95	1481.21	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	you know you want to pretty close 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact797	1480.92	1482.4	H	Grad	s	-1	0	you know you want to pretty close and there's 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact799	1482.66	1485.87	H	Grad	s	-1	0	and there's a of skewed because it's a handheld unit with the battery 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact800	1486.17	1486.98	A	Postdoc	fg|s.%-	-1	0	well when when i i see

Bmr025.A.dialogueact802	1487.48	1487.71	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	so 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact803	1487.89	1492.28	H	Grad	s^co	-1	0	so you have to synchronized at the beginning of each meeting all the pads that are being used 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact804	1493.08	1494.89	H	Grad	s^df	+1	2	so that it's synchronized with the time on that and they 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact805	1494.89	1497.99	H	Grad	s^e	+1	2	with the time on that and they have to download to an application 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact806	1497.99	1503.82	H	Grad	s^e	+1	2	an application and they have to that's are converted over if you want to do anything with this information

Bmr025.A.dialogueact813	1509.18	1513.25	A	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	i mean they still there's you know your point stands about their big needing to be an infrastructure but it doesn't have to 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact814	1513.25	1516.65	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but it doesn't have to be synchronized with the little clock's timer on it you 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact815	1516.65	1520.1	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	timer on it you mean i when i when i did it i think are nice it by voice by whispering one two three 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact816	1520.1	1522.41	A	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	by whispering one two three four months of my phone and

Bmr025.H.dialogueact819	1524.64	1526.5	H	Grad	s	-1	0	well but then there's the infrastructure at the other end which someone has 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact820	1525.22	1525.38	E	PhD	b	-1	0	there's the infrastructure at the

Bmr025.A.dialogueact822	1528.94	1529.62	A	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	yeah it's transcribed it's in the transcript that point and then market 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact824	1529.62	1530.4	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it's transcribed it's in the transcript and then market so

Bmr025.A.dialogueact827	1532.04	1532.83	A	Postdoc	s^r	-1	0	it's in the transcript well could we keep 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact828	1532.23	1535.25	G	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	it's in the transcript well could we keep one of these things for another year which i mean is

Bmr025.G.dialogueact835	1546.78	1551.68	G	PhD	s	-1	0	neat to do but i it might not be the case that we can actually synchronized and they do all the infrastructure but we can 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact836	1551.68	1553.35	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	well infrastructure but we can at least try it out 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact837	1553.58	1564.83	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	well one thing that we might try um is on some set of meeting some collection meetings maybe you you is the right one or maybe something else 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact838	1565.58	1570.41	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	2	we we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this is part of the task i mean 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact839	1570.41	1570.86	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	i mean 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact840	1570.71	1570.93	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	i mean 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact841	1571.38	1579.31	B	Professor	s	+1	2	uh part of the reason i think part of the reason that adam was so interested in the speech quarter sort of idea for the beginnings he sits in beginning aged taking notes and 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact843	1579.31	1579.45	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact842	1579.06	1579.3	H	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	and 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact844	1580.03	1580.63	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and so forth so 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact845	1580.63	1582.99	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and so forth so and and jane is more into it but 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact846	1582.99	1584.35	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	is more into it but uh you know i don't 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact847	1584.63	1586.66	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	you know i don't know if you want to really do do this all the time so i think 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact848	1586.66	1589.68	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	this all the time so i think the thing is that to get someone to actually buy into it have at 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact849	1589.68	1592.25	B	Professor	s^cs^e	-1	0	buy into it have at least some series of meetings where we do it 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact850	1593.23	1593.81	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr025.B.dialogueact851	1594.48	1596.4	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and uh so it's probably worth having one to put the 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact852	1596.71	1599.36	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	one to put the the problem with those the more extended you all these other 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact853	1599.36	1603.47	B	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	you all these other you know but what equivalent about particular applications of it is that it looks 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact854	1603.47	1608.73	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	of it is that it looks like it's hard to get people too um uh routinely use it i mean 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact855	1608.73	1610.55	B	Professor	s	-1	0	use it i mean it just hasn't happened anyway but 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact856	1611.03	1613.23	B	Professor	s^cs.%-	-1	0	maybe if we get a person too yeah i don't think it has to be part 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact857	1612.46	1616.21	G	PhD	s	-1	0	person too yeah i don't think it has to be part of that what everybody does in a meeting but it might be 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact858	1616.21	1620.38	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	but it might be i use those neat part of the project that we can you 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact859	1620.38	1625.38	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	that we can you know showoff has a mechanism for synchronized ing events in time that 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact860	1625.93	1627.82	G	PhD	s^df^e	-1	0	that happen that you just want to make a note of like 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact861	1627.82	1629.4	G	PhD	s	-1	0	a note of like what jane was talking about with some 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact862	1629.77	1632.39	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	about with some later browsing just just as the convenience even 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact863	1632.8	1636.3	G	PhD	s	-1	0	well she wanted to do that even if it's not a full blown note-taking substitute 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact864	1636.25	1640.92	E	PhD	s^cs	+1	2	well she wanted to do that maybe the right architecture ford is to get a p. d. a. with a wireless card 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact865	1641.32	1645.99	E	PhD	s	+1	2	and and that way you can synchronized very easily with uh the the meeting because 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact866	1645.99	1649.28	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	the the meeting because you'll be thinking of you can synchronized with the the linux server 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact867	1650.77	1651.99	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	and uh so what kind of 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact868	1651.55	1653.03	G	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	uh so so i so what kind of input would you be 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact869	1653.26	1655.01	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	so so i mean if you're not worried about you just be pressing like 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact870	1653.93	1654.38	H	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	so so i mean if you're not worried about you just 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact871	1654.8	1656.54	G	PhD	qy^d.%-	-1	0	mean if you're not worried about well yeah the p. you just be pressing like uh 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact872	1656.2	1657.28	E	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	well yeah the p. d. a. and making you could uh 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact873	1657.28	1660.4	E	PhD	s^cs^e	-1	0	d. a. and making you could have the same sort of x. interface or whatever i mean you have to do 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact874	1660.4	1663.13	E	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean you have to do a little a little bit of coding to do it but 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact875	1660.84	1661.07	G	PhD	b	-1	0	i mean you have to do a little a little 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact876	1663.97	1665.35	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but you could imagine i mean if 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact877	1664.4	1664.68	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	you could imagine 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact878	1665.01	1665.42	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	i mean if 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact879	1665.64	1670.23	E	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean if if all you really wanted was she didn't want this secondary note-taking channel but just sort of 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact880	1670.23	1673.68	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but just sort of being able to use markers of some sort 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact881	1674.17	1676.85	E	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	the p. d. a. with all wireless card to be the probably everybody go 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact882	1677.87	1679.1	E	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	i mean even buttons you could do sort of 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact883	1679.68	1680.04	E	PhD	s^e	-1	0	sort of i mean as you said for what what you've been 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact884	1680.04	1680.73	E	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean as you said for what what you've been 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact885	1680.19	1684.09	H	Grad	s^cs	+1	2	i mean as you said right that would be fine for what what you've been describing buttons would be more convenient than anything else right you have the 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact886	1682.32	1682.59	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	right be more convenient than 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact887	1682.83	1683.21	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right be more convenient than anything else 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact891	1684.49	1684.69	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	that would be fine right you have the 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact889	1684.16	1685.45	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	that would be fine too i i don't right you have the 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact888	1684.09	1684.25	H	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	that would be fine right you have the 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact890	1684.25	1684.71	H	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	that would be fine right you have the 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact892	1685.45	1688.05	G	PhD	s	-1	0	too i i don't have you know grandiose ideas in mind there's sort of thinking 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact893	1688.05	1691.88	G	PhD	s:s	-1	0	there's sort of thinking well we've we're getting into the next year now we 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact894	1691.88	1694.45	G	PhD	s	-1	0	next year now we have a lot of these things worked out it the terms of the speech maybe somebody 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact895	1694.45	1696.53	G	PhD	s	-1	0	speech maybe somebody will be interested in this and 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact896	1696.53	1696.71	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	in this and 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact897	1697.15	1698.35	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	i like the speedy idea yeah 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact898	1698.69	1698.95	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact899	1698.96	1700.68	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	yeah like idea of having a couple buttons are like one yeah i'm sure they would 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact901	1699.2	1699.62	G	PhD	b	-1	0	like idea of having a couple yeah i'm sure they would 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact900	1699.02	1699.63	H	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	like idea of having a couple yeah i'm sure they would 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact903	1700.96	1701.29	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	buttons are like one one button was oh 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact902	1700.68	1702.36	B	Professor	s^e:s^fe	-1	0	buttons are like one one button was oh another 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact904	1702.74	1704.34	B	Professor	s^e:s^ba	-1	0	another button was that's great and live on that's like this is 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact905	1704.34	1705.91	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	and live on that's like this is my i'm supposed to do this 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact906	1704.34	1707.4	G	PhD	s^2:s	-1	0	and live on that's like this is my i'm supposed to do this kind of buttons like a better 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact907	1705.13	1705.43	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	my i'm supposed to do this 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact908	1707.4	1708.7	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	like a better remembered to action item 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact909	1708.42	1709.05	H	Grad	s^2	-1	0	remembered to yeah something action item 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact910	1709.18	1709.62	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah something 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact911	1709.72	1710.51	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	yeah something like that or 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact912	1710.51	1710.72	G	PhD	%--	-1	0	like that or 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact914	1711.77	1712.04	A	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	and then uh yeah i think the it is 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact913	1711.52	1713.67	H	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	and then uh yeah i think the it is a good one 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact915	1712.19	1712.44	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	uh the it is 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact916	1714.44	1716.55	H	Grad	s^df	-1	0	it's just a question of getting people to use it and getting 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact917	1716.55	1720.17	H	Grad	s^df	-1	0	to use it and getting the infrastructure set up in such a way that it's not a lot of extra work 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact918	1720.69	1722.67	H	Grad	s^df	-1	0	why it hasn't happened is that 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact919	1722.67	1726.19	H	Grad	s^e	-1	0	uh happened is that it's been all the extra work for me 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact920	1723.56	1723.92	G	PhD	b	-1	0	it's 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact921	1725.74	1725.95	B	Professor	b	-1	0	work for me 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact923	1726.86	1727.83	A	Postdoc	s^nd	-1	0	uh and not just you but 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact922	1726.68	1726.86	H	Grad	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact925	1728.0	1733.11	A	Postdoc	s^ng	-1	0	it's also it has this problem of having do go from analog to a digital record tutors and 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact924	1727.85	1728.1	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	and not just you but it's also it has 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact926	1733.11	1733.79	A	Postdoc	qy^g^rt	-1	0	and 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact928	1733.79	1734.02	A	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	and but it's in a format 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact927	1733.75	1738.01	H	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	and but i say if if if you're writing if but it's in a format that is not particularly standard 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact929	1736.81	1742.74	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but i say if if if you're writing if you're writing notes and it does it can't do handwriting recognition right no is not particularly standard 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact930	1742.74	1743.03	A	Postdoc	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	recognition right no no but it's just it's just 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact931	1742.99	1747.53	B	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	recognition right okay no no but it's just it's just storing uh so and from a position information so there's show 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact932	1745.93	1746.27	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	okay and from a position information 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact933	1747.53	1748.08	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so there's show 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact934	1749.34	1756.82	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	i guess i'm thinking is that the p. d. a. solution you you haven't already without needing to go from pickles nation to uh 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact935	1757.73	1757.89	A	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr025.B.dialogueact936	1757.73	1757.98	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr025.B.dialogueact937	1758.65	1759.06	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	the transfer functions lost their whole 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact938	1758.67	1760.28	E	PhD	s^na	-1	0	oh yeah the transfer functions lost their whole yeah yeah 
Bmr025.A.dialogueact942	1761.0	1761.69	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	nice we put yeah yeah 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact941	1760.86	1761.01	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	oh nice we put yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Bmr025.E.dialogueact939	1760.56	1760.78	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	oh yeah yeah yeah 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact940	1760.68	1761.64	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	oh nice we put yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact943	1761.88	1762.63	B	Professor	b	-1	0	nice we put yeah yeah well and also it's 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact944	1762.49	1767.82	G	PhD	s	-1	0	well and also it's maybe really is because people aren't supposed to be bringing their p. d. a.'s to the meeting eventually right 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact945	1767.82	1768.1	G	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	eventually right that's why we have this 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact946	1768.21	1769.33	G	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	that's why we have this little i don't 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact947	1769.83	1772.21	G	PhD	s	-1	0	little i don't know what i don't want to cause more work for anyone but i can imagine 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact948	1772.21	1775.96	G	PhD	s	-1	0	but i can imagine some interesting things that you could do with it and 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact949	1775.96	1777.57	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	you could do with it and so if we don't have to return it and we can 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact950	1777.78	1779.51	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	return it and we can keep it for your i don't know 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact951	1779.66	1779.97	G	PhD	s^no	-1	0	your i don't know 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact952	1780.27	1782.69	H	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	well we we we certainly don't have to return of the all 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact953	1782.69	1787.1	H	Grad	s^df	-1	0	to return of the all all he said is that if you're not using extra return if you are using it feel free to keep that 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact954	1788.05	1789.84	H	Grad	s	-1	0	the point is that we haven't used as at all 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact955	1790.1	1791.27	H	Grad	s:qy	-1	0	so we have no and are we going to 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact956	1791.46	1792.13	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so we have no but but by to 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact957	1792.13	1794.66	B	Professor	s^co	+1	1	but but by i i would suggest you return one 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact960	1795.62	1797.9	B	Professor	s^df	+1	1	because we we you know we we haven't used it at all we 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact959	1795.18	1795.48	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	because we 
Bmr025.H.dialogueact958	1795.02	1795.28	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	because we 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact961	1796.61	1797.0	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	we you know we we haven't used it at all we 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact962	1798.01	1800.53	B	Professor	s	-1	0	have some aspirations of using them and one would probably be fine maybe could do like a 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact963	1798.12	1799.3	G	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	have some aspirations of using one would probably be fine 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact965	1800.53	1800.77	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	them and maybe could do like a 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact964	1800.31	1802.0	G	PhD	s^cs	+1	3	them and maybe could do like a student project you know maybe someone wants 
Bmr025.G.dialogueact966	1802.0	1807.05	G	PhD	s^ba	+1	3	know maybe someone wants to just as their main like project for something would be cool 
Bmr025.B.dialogueact967	1804.88	1805.12	B	Professor	b	-1	0	like project
