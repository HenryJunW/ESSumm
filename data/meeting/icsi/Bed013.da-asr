Bed013.D.dialogueact62	199.78	211.44	D	Grad	s	+1	0	imagine if you will that we have a system that does all that understanding that we wanted to do based on occurrences

Bed013.B.dialogueact74	273.53	280.66	B	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah you're in uh the hands thing and twenty two like now i was able to write messages also to generate based upon situations i 
Bed013.B.dialogueact75	280.66	281.85	B	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	situations i mean that sort of thing

Bed013.D.dialogueact78	284.81	291.99	D	Grad	s	-1	0	once you've done that what we can do is have the system ask

Bed013.D.dialogueact80	296.0	296.82	D	Grad	s	-1	0	the answer 
Bed013.D.dialogueact81	298.06	299.03	D	Grad	s	-1	0	something else and enter

Bed013.D.dialogueact85	310.52	316.56	D	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah you if you want you can have two pro asking each other 
Bed013.D.dialogueact86	317.51	318.67	D	Grad	qh	-1	0	what would that give us 
Bed013.D.dialogueact87	319.08	321.42	D	Grad	s	-1	0	would maybe some thinking to do weird and strange 
Bed013.D.dialogueact88	322.16	333.75	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and be if you look at all the factors we would never observe people that say in wheelchairs under you know under all conditions you know 
Bed013.E.dialogueact89	322.437	322.797	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	and be 
Bed013.D.dialogueact90	333.75	340.97	D	Grad	s	-1	0	conditions you know when they say it x. and there is a riot at the gold and the parking is good we can never contacted 
Bed013.D.dialogueact92	341.56	342.92	D	Grad	s^e	-1	0	it's it's not possible 
Bed013.E.dialogueact91	341.503	341.723	E	Grad	b	-1	0	it's it's 
Bed013.E.dialogueact93	342.69	343.31	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	not possible 
Bed013.D.dialogueact94	344.12	345.74	D	Grad	s	+1	2	but maybe one could do some learning 
Bed013.D.dialogueact95	347.8	358.95	D	Grad	s	+1	0	if you get the system to speak to itself you may find breakdowns in ours and you may be able to 
Bed013.D.dialogueact96	360.93	362.7	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and make it whereabouts maybe 
Bed013.D.dialogueact97	362.77	364.21	D	Grad	s	-1	0	whereabouts maybe learn new things

Bed013.D.dialogueact99	367.388	373.92	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so there's no no and of potential things one could get out of it if that works 
Bed013.D.dialogueact100	375.93	379.331	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and he would like to actually work on that 
Bed013.B.dialogueact102	382.67	385.2	B	Grad	s	-1	0	well they probably should be coming back a year from now 
Bed013.D.dialogueact101	382.536	382.736	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	well they probably

Bed013.D.dialogueact104	388.88	395.007	D	Grad	s^ba^df	-1	0	see that that generation but making the system generate generate something this shouldn't be too hard 
Bed013.B.dialogueact105	396.87	398.46	B	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	well what's the system understand things yeah 
Bed013.E.dialogueact106	398.69	399.72	E	Grad	s^aa|s^ba^j	-1	0	things yeah no problem 
Bed013.B.dialogueact107	400.88	404.69	B	Grad	s	-1	0	i just don't think i think there are probably a year away from getting this and understand things yeah 
Bed013.D.dialogueact108	404.8	420.71	D	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	things yeah well if we can get it to understand one thing like our where is run through we can also maybe make it say or ask or not 
Bed013.E.dialogueact109	421.4	422.51	E	Grad	s^nd^no	-1	0	mm i don't know i i'm 
Bed013.E.dialogueact110	422.51	432.2	E	Grad	s^nd	+1	1	don't know i i'm sort of have the impression that getting it to say the right thing in the right circumstances is much more difficult than getting it to understand something given the circumstances and so you know i mean just this it's 
Bed013.E.dialogueact111	432.2	440.96	E	Grad	s^df^e|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	you know i mean just this it's sort of harder to learn to speak correctly in a foreign language learning to understand

Bed013.D.dialogueact115	449.93	451.11	D	Grad	%--	-1	0	it's it's well

Bed013.D.dialogueact118	459.86	461.79	D	Grad	s^e	+1	1	you're right it's not the same as the understanding 
Bed013.D.dialogueact119	462.28	465.19	D	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	it's in some ways easier in some ways harder

Bed013.D.dialogueact121	465.32	466.09	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	i think it

Bed013.E.dialogueact365	994.143	995.853	E	Grad	s:s	-1	0	here's a here's one possible thing you could do 
Bed013.D.dialogueact366	996.08	996.52	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	short it 
Bed013.E.dialogueact367	996.203	996.593	E	Grad	s	-1	0	short it

Bed013.E.dialogueact369	997.423	1000.81	E	Grad	s^no	-1	0	pages and i just don't know what you have in mind for expanding like 
Bed013.E.dialogueact370	1000.97	1003.84	E	Grad	s	-1	0	expanding like i i what i didn't do is go to the website of the conference in like

Bed013.D.dialogueact373	1006.45	1009.08	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	basis well it seems to me that 
Bed013.B.dialogueact374	1009.97	1011.34	B	Grad	fg|qy^rt	+1	0	basis committee science conference is uh 
Bed013.B.dialogueact375	1011.34	1011.84	B	Grad	qrr.%-	-1	0	is uh 
Bed013.D.dialogueact376	1012.45	1014.81	D	Grad	h|s^aap	-1	0	um well that's more 
Bed013.D.dialogueact377	1015.38	1016.2	D	Grad	s^e|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	it's both ride it's it's sort of 
Bed013.D.dialogueact378	1016.2	1021.7	D	Grad	s	+1	0	it's it's sort of cockatoo snore oh side cold english linguistic 
Bed013.D.dialogueact379	1022.43	1025.42	D	Grad	s	+1	0	but all it for the sake of doing computer science 
Bed013.D.dialogueact380	1027.77	1036.87	D	Grad	s	+1	0	so it's sort of scorpio too if cycles cycle neural plausible thee much of a toots architecture so that's remember first thing 
Bed013.D.dialogueact381	1038.05	1040.2	D	Grad	s	-1	0	it seems pretty interdisciplinary and i mean read 
Bed013.D.dialogueact382	1040.2	1042.83	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and i mean read the keynote speakers come i said oh right

Bed013.D.dialogueact385	1044.51	1044.94	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	so 
Bed013.D.dialogueact386	1047.03	1052.64	D	Grad	s	-1	0	the question is what quickly actually do and and and keep a straight face was doing it

Bed013.E.dialogueact1019	2314.63	2319.58	E	Grad	s	-1	0	you know that becomes part of like there's sort of current ongoing active conceptual structure and then 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1020	2317.69	2318.48	D	Grad	b	-1	0	active conceptual 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1021	2319.8	2334.26	E	Grad	s	-1	0	structure and then um over in your base that or whatever when when a person says where is it you've already got you know since they were talking about admission in that you folks the idea of entering um then when they go and ask where is it then you are enter notice already active because that's what 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1023	2334.71	2334.95	D	Grad	b	-1	0	because that's what 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1022	2334.34	2336.15	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because that's what the person is thinking about i mean that's the sort of 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1024	2335.92	2336.16	D	Grad	b	-1	0	the person is thinking about i mean that's the sort of 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1025	2336.28	2338.3	E	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah i i mean that's the sort of cognitive linguistic anyway and probably not

Bed013.D.dialogueact1028	2341.18	2343.39	D	Grad	s	-1	0	i think that's that's the correct way so of course 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1029	2343.39	2347.99	D	Grad	s	-1	0	way so of course we have to keep memory of what what's the last intention and

Bed013.D.dialogueact1036	2360.53	2368.21	D	Grad	s	+1	0	they do but even before that uh there's a student of arses doing a dialup crack um recognition more trouble 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1037	2360.81	2361.04	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	they do but even before that

Bed013.A.dialogueact1155	2779.25	2786.01	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and another one is um pap from current user for location too that locations so 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1156	2785.0	2785.29	D	Grad	b	-1	0	that locations 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1157	2786.01	2786.42	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	so 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1158	2787.08	2787.84	A	Grad	qy.%--	-1	0	so is the question i just 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1159	2787.84	2789.11	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so is the question i just i'm not sure what the is the 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1160	2789.89	2794.83	A	Grad	qy	-1	0	is the question for this particular construction how we specify that that's the information it provides 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1161	2795.97	2798.32	A	Grad	qrr	-1	0	or or ask for both 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1162	2798.51	2799.64	A	Grad	s^e|qy^d^g	-1	0	both sides right yeah you don't need 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1163	2799.61	2801.95	D	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	sides right yeah you don't need to even do that it's 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1164	2801.95	2809.12	D	Grad	s	-1	0	observed even do that it's just sort of what what would be observed in in that case 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1165	2809.83	2814.21	A	Grad	qr^bu	-1	0	observed when you heard the speaker say where's x. or when when that first

Bed013.A.dialogueact1167	2816.33	2818.6	A	Grad	s^bu^rt	-1	0	so the little circle you have by the d. is it 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1168	2818.6	2818.97	A	Grad	qy.%-	-1	0	the d. is it 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1170	2819.28	2820.52	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay okay that's exactly what they're looking for 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1169	2819.17	2820.58	D	Grad	s^na	-1	0	okay okay that's exactly what they're looking for 
Bed013.B.dialogueact1171	2821.31	2825.59	B	Grad	s	-1	0	i i just i don't like having characterizing the concessions location and pass 
Bed013.B.dialogueact1172	2826.02	2827.56	B	Grad	s	-1	0	or the characters and like they could get on 
Bed013.B.dialogueact1173	2827.56	2833.7	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	and like they could get on it seems like an agenda because you would know how how to characterize them i mean you wouldn't 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1174	2832.18	2832.64	D	Grad	s^na	-1	0	how how to characterize you wouldn't 
Bed013.B.dialogueact1175	2833.7	2834.73	B	Grad	s:qw	-1	0	them i mean area for when that could be 
Bed013.B.dialogueact1176	2834.73	2836.71	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	area for when that could be entertained we don't have a note before and uh 
Bed013.B.dialogueact1177	2837.44	2842.85	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	i mean it seems like make or to have i i know the construction and then let the chips fall they may 
Bed013.B.dialogueact1178	2844.22	2851.1	B	Grad	s	-1	0	versus saying this construction other can mean location our path 
Bed013.B.dialogueact1179	2852.66	2856.1	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and in this case since since it can mean i those things are like those those uh 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1180	2858.06	2858.46	D	Grad	s	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed013.B.dialogueact1181	2863.37	2863.73	B	Grad	qo	-1	0	thoughts 
Bed013.B.dialogueact1182	2864.52	2865.26	B	Grad	qo	-1	0	questions i'm thinking about it um 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1183	2864.91	2865.77	E	Grad	s	-1	0	questions i'm thinking about it um 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1185	2866.2	2866.88	D	Grad	s^r	-1	0	it would be the same so 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1184	2865.77	2866.44	E	Grad	h	-1	0	it would be the same so thinking about it um 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1186	2866.88	2869.8	D	Grad	s:s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	answers it would be the same so i take it you we have all go their rights 
Bed013.B.dialogueact1187	2868.19	2868.59	B	Grad	qo	-1	0	answers you we have all go 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1188	2870.57	2872.31	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and we have all the info on 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1189	2873.24	2879.12	D	Grad	s:s	-1	0	so it might my case this would sort of make this happy and this would make the go they're happy what you're saying 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1190	2879.31	2884.99	D	Grad	s:qw	-1	0	what you're saying is we have a wary question wakes no it's that makes both happy 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1191	2886.0	2886.19	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	that's what you're proposing 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1192	2886.58	2888.83	D	Grad	s	-1	0	that's what you're proposing but just my might 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1193	2889.15	2889.74	D	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	just decide 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1194	2890.68	2902.34	D	Grad	s	+1	0	so what if we have a construction no it's wary sex got the but but you're probably the tea that it's it's on top 
Bed013.B.dialogueact1195	2900.96	2901.59	B	Grad	b	-1	0	probably the tea that it's it's on 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1196	2903.06	2906.26	D	Grad	s^e	+1	0	in farthest too often and that go there is too hot as well 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1197	2907.73	2914.59	D	Grad	s	+1	0	which would be sexy analogous to what i'm proposing is this makes make something here too and it's like something 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1198	2914.59	2916.43	D	Grad	s	-1	0	here too and it's like something office in you two and this makes 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1199	2916.43	2919.77	D	Grad	s	+1	0	two and this makes this too up in this makes this drop as well 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1200	2920.08	2922.7	E	Grad	s^cs	+1	0	i kind of like it better without extra level of in direction too you know 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1201	2922.7	2925.39	E	Grad	s	-1	0	too you know this point to this point of that 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1202	2925.39	2928.02	E	Grad	s^df.%-	-1	0	yeah because we got we got tons of 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1204	2927.72	2929.58	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	yeah because we got we got tons of so i think 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1203	2927.32	2930.05	D	Grad	s^aa|s^df	-1	0	yeah because we got we got tons of so i think because 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1206	2930.18	2933.98	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	yeah sure because you know give have many ways of for the same thing and 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1205	2929.82	2930.14	E	Grad	b	-1	0	so i think because 
Bed013.B.dialogueact1207	2933.17	2933.65	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah sure for the same thing and 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1208	2933.68	2933.99	A	Grad	b.%	-1	0	yeah sure for the same thing and 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1209	2933.98	2934.12	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	so yeah sure i just for the same thing and 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1210	2934.96	2935.58	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	so and i just i just my next 
Bed013.B.dialogueact1211	2934.98	2936.2	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so and so i i just i just my next 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1213	2936.72	2937.56	A	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	so i agree with that i have a different 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1212	2936.57	2936.77	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	so i 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1214	2937.57	2939.36	A	Grad	s	-1	0	agree with that i have a different kind of question might be related 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1215	2939.49	2940.19	A	Grad	s	-1	0	might be related which is 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1216	2940.43	2946.25	A	Grad	s^bu|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	which is okay so implicitly everything any do you where always entering the speaker intense right like what 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1217	2946.8	2947.87	A	Grad	s	-1	0	like what they want 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1218	2948.72	2950.72	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	you the information that they want or 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1219	2951.29	2953.61	A	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	is always information they want probably of some kind 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1220	2955.59	2955.75	A	Grad	qy^d^g	-1	0	right i 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1221	2955.75	2956.64	A	Grad	s^no	-1	0	right i i don't know where what something the system 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1223	2956.64	2957.42	A	Grad	s^e.%-	-1	0	i don't know where what something is the system does this massage she would know 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1222	2956.63	2958.48	D	Grad	s^nd|s^ar	-1	0	i don't know where what something is i i the system does this massage she would know 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1224	2958.75	2959.22	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i i don't 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1225	2960.18	2960.57	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay so 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1226	2960.83	2962.5	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	okay so um 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1227	2964.71	2964.97	A	Grad	s	-1	0	but see i 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1228	2964.97	2971.03	A	Grad	s^no	-1	0	but see i don't know if it i mean it it just as moore's here that's not shown that you already like parts or whatever but where 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1229	2971.35	2976.31	A	Grad	s.%--:qw.%--	-1	0	but where is x. like the fact that is is you know speech act whatever it is a question 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1230	2976.34	2977.15	A	Grad	s	-1	0	it is a question it's a question that 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1231	2977.15	2980.65	A	Grad	s	-1	0	it's a question that um is on some particular thing tex mex 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1232	2980.65	2981.98	A	Grad	s	-1	0	thing tex mex is that locations there's 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1233	2981.98	2984.0	A	Grad	s	-1	0	is that locations there's like a lot of structure in representing that so that seems 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1234	2983.25	2984.19	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	in representing that so that seems 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1235	2984.5	2987.06	A	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	so that seems different is having the notebook next and that goes into it right yeah he 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1236	2987.06	2988.14	A	Grad	s|qy^d^g	-1	0	and that goes into it right he protested that's 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1237	2987.11	2988.79	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	and that goes into it right he protested that's 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1238	2988.79	2989.55	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	protested that's that's 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1240	2990.34	2992.08	A	Grad	qy	-1	0	so that is that what you're talking about what what kind of structure so a we have some we have specified tool 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1239	2990.14	2991.19	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	so that is that what you're talking about so a we have some we 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1241	2991.19	2993.1	D	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	talking about what what kind of structure we want a we have some we have specified tool okay the next

Bed013.D.dialogueact1243	2993.51	2995.96	D	Grad	s	-1	0	we want okay the next one would be here just for mood

Bed013.A.dialogueact1245	2996.81	2997.59	A	Grad	b	-1	0	the next one would

Bed013.D.dialogueact1249	3012.38	3015.81	D	Grad	s	-1	0	okay so in some ways and give your and to make intrusions about the users intelligence i don't 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1250	3013.38	3015.25	A	Grad	s^bk|s.%-	-1	0	okay so in some ways and to make intrusions about the users intelligence i don't 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1251	3015.81	3016.16	D	Grad	s^no	-1	0	um intelligence i don't know 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1253	3016.9	3024.33	A	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	um so some ways in the other sort of parallels that or more linguistic means we've been talking about possible semantics of some construction right where know 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1252	3016.53	3016.59	D	Grad	b	-1	0	um know 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1254	3024.11	3024.82	E	Grad	b	-1	0	right where

Bed013.A.dialogueact1257	3026.37	3031.19	A	Grad	s	-1	0	the simulation that's according to you know that that correspond to it and as well the this discourse whatever

Bed013.A.dialogueact1262	3036.23	3041.54	A	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	so are we looking for a sort of abbreviation of that that's tailored to this problem 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1263	3042.17	3046.25	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because that that has you know basically you know it's in progress doesn't evolve instill 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1264	3046.25	3046.98	A	Grad	s^df^e	-1	0	doesn't evolve instill

Bed013.D.dialogueact1291	3103.36	3107.29	D	Grad	s	+1	0	if if if it's not at all triggered power things that it's irrelevant and it doesn't 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1292	3106.85	3107.14	A	Grad	b	-1	0	that it's irrelevant and it doesn't 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1293	3107.29	3110.0	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and it doesn't hurt to leave it out for the moment um 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1294	3110.87	3111.67	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	um but 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1295	3114.49	3114.83	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1296	3117.25	3124.11	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	um it seems like for instance where is x. the fact that it might mean tell me how to get to axe like 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1297	3124.78	3125.2	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	like 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1298	3126.19	3128.44	A	Grad	qy.%--	-1	0	who would you want to say that those two are both like 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1299	3129.06	3130.44	A	Grad	s|s^f	-1	0	those are the two interpretations right the the ones that 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1300	3130.44	3132.29	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	right the the ones that are location or path so you 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1301	3132.71	3136.8	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so you could say that this construction is a question asking about this location 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1302	3137.28	3141.39	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and then you can additionally it for if they're ass out of patience because they want to go to that place in which case 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1304	3141.63	3145.51	A	Grad	s:s	-1	0	place in which case the you're jumping it's got to stop and think oh i know where it is but i also know how 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1303	3141.31	3141.61	D	Grad	b	-1	0	place in which case 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1305	3141.66	3141.96	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	place in which case 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1306	3145.51	3148.66	A	Grad	s:s	-1	0	know where it is but i also know how to get they want it seems they seem to want to get there so i'm going to tell them so 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1307	3149.03	3150.34	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	there's like structure 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1308	3151.18	3155.77	E	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	it it sort of it but right the this it's not it's not that this is sort of like semantics ambiguous between these two it's really 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1309	3151.83	3152.97	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	it it sort of it but right the this it's not it's not that 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1310	3152.37	3152.73	D	Grad	b.%	-1	0	it sort of it but it's not it's not that 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1311	3155.77	3156.87	E	Grad	s	-1	0	between these two it's really about this but 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1312	3156.87	3158.92	E	Grad	qh	-1	0	about this but why would you care about this well 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1313	3158.92	3162.25	E	Grad	s|s^f	-1	0	so it's like you for the speaker about this well it's because you also want to know that or something 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1315	3162.01	3163.72	A	Grad	s	+1	0	it's like you for the speaker intense 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1314	3161.89	3162.41	D	Grad	b	-1	0	so it's like you for the speaker that or something 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1316	3164.19	3168.82	A	Grad	s	+1	0	and then in for a plan a larger plan from that for would you have the additional information interesting 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1317	3167.0	3167.18	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	for would you have the 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1318	3167.64	3167.95	D	Grad	b	-1	0	for would you have the 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1319	3168.82	3169.89	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	additional information interesting extra helpful 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1320	3169.33	3169.52	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	extra helpful

Bed013.D.dialogueact1322	3173.78	3176.17	D	Grad	s^bd	+1	0	yeah think it would this this it's just a mental exercise if you think about 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1323	3176.1	3176.29	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah if you think about 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1324	3176.17	3177.02	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	yeah if you think about focus on this question 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1325	3177.37	3180.6	D	Grad	s^cs:qw	+1	0	focus on this question how would you do sian that is 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1326	3179.75	3180.3	E	Grad	b	-1	0	sian that is 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1327	3180.74	3188.34	D	Grad	qy	-1	0	that is it do you feel confident about saying this is part of the language already too to detect those fads and why would anyone 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1328	3188.34	3190.31	D	Grad	qh	-1	0	and why would anyone care about location it's not you know 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1329	3190.31	3191.11	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	it's not you know and so forth 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1331	3191.67	3192.35	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and so forth or

Bed013.D.dialogueact1332	3192.69	3193.82	D	Grad	qrr.%--	-1	0	or do you actually this 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1333	3193.82	3195.38	D	Grad	s	-1	0	do you actually this is legitimate and i i would not 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1334	3195.38	3197.99	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and i i would not have any problems so they racing this and 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1335	3197.99	3202.36	D	Grad	s:s	-1	0	and just by an additional link so they racing this and said that's all we can activates based on the after it's all out of context 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1336	3200.5	3201.08	A	Grad	b	-1	0	and just by an additional based on the after it's all out of context

Bed013.A.dialogueact1338	3203.57	3203.68	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	up right

Bed013.A.dialogueact1341	3204.09	3204.42	A	Grad	b	-1	0	and like and then 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1340	3203.7	3204.18	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	up right and like and then 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1343	3204.42	3204.71	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	and like and then 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1342	3204.28	3215.72	D	Grad	s:s	-1	0	and like with context and enough user permission yet and then did that america so that we get out the attention go there happens based on what we know about that and to do you about the was or what is food these as i was probably about 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1344	3205.15	3207.39	A	Grad	s	-1	0	with context and enough user permission yet did that america so that we get out the attention

Bed013.E.dialogueact1346	3208.18	3208.63	E	Grad	b	-1	0	go there 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1347	3216.34	3217.13	D	Grad	s	-1	0	absentee fine but this is the sort 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1348	3217.37	3221.04	D	Grad	s	-1	0	but this is the sort of thing i i propose that we think about so that 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1349	3218.92	3219.11	A	Grad	b	-1	0	of thing i i propose 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1350	3221.67	3229.37	D	Grad	s^df	+1	2	so that we actually end up with um no it's for the discourse and on prodigy so 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1351	3229.93	3231.88	D	Grad	s	+1	1	so that we can put them into our base that 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1352	3232.64	3233.54	D	Grad	s	-1	0	never change him so we 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1353	3233.62	3235.63	D	Grad	s:qw	-1	0	him so we all there is is where sex 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1354	3236.2	3239.94	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and you if i around pay the d. or if things and 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1355	3239.94	3243.04	D	Grad	s	+1	1	d. or if things and we can run our bad a java based on how to produce more put in for the first time in 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1356	3243.04	3247.12	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	in for the first time in and the well we look at our outputs and um 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1357	3247.45	3251.1	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and um and see whether it it's any good 
Bed013.A.dialogueact1358	3252.09	3252.35	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	you know i mean 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1359	3252.46	3252.76	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	you know i mean

Bed013.D.dialogueact1365	3258.31	3261.52	D	Grad	s^bk|s^df	-1	0	yeah i mean for me this is just about better queer us it's yeah i want to 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1366	3261.52	3269.63	D	Grad	s	-1	0	us it's yeah i want to would like to look at uh what this that talk process of designing davidian that actually produce 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1367	3261.89	3263.22	E	Grad	b	-1	0	us it's yeah i want to would like to look at uh

Bed013.D.dialogueact1369	3272.0	3273.97	D	Grad	s^e:qw	-1	0	if we ask where is something

Bed013.D.dialogueact1371	3283.29	3289.17	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	um come up but interesting question strewn which you can find interesting answers and 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1372	3289.99	3293.03	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and additionally it might fit in really nasty with the paper 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1374	3294.1	3298.91	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because if if if we run and except for the paper i suggest that are this

Bed013.D.dialogueact1376	3306.62	3312.91	D	Grad	s	+1	0	so the this i've been eyes opening paragraph of the papers saying the people look at kinds of any ambiguity sand 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1377	3312.91	3314.92	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	sand 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1378	3315.53	3317.31	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and and it's true burst bank and 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1379	3318.04	3321.9	D	Grad	s	-1	0	whatever kinds of garden path phenomenon

Bed013.D.dialogueact1381	3322.53	3326.01	D	Grad	s:s	-1	0	and we can say well that's all nonsense hey 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1382	3326.69	3330.04	D	Grad	s	+1	0	hey uh these things are never really ambiguous and discourse 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1383	3331.39	3333.55	D	Grad	s	-1	0	p don't ever occur really and discourse 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1384	3334.23	3344.53	D	Grad	s:qw	+1	1	but normal statements that seem completely i'd be curious such as where is there blah blah actually i terror become and completely ambiguous 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1385	3340.46	3340.71	E	Grad	b	-1	0	actually 
Bed013.E.dialogueact1386	3344.66	3345.0	E	Grad	b	-1	0	and so 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1387	3345.52	3354.31	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and so whatever everybody has has been doing so far and and you know has become p. g.'s nonsensical and can all grow into the rest of but and 
Bed013.D.dialogueact1388	3355.06	3355.98	D	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	you know do that's always a good
