Bro016.E.dialogueact15	25.167	26.157	E	Professor	s^df	+1	1	i seen a here and 
Bro016.E.dialogueact16	26.157	26.387	E	Professor	%--	-1	0	and 
Bro016.E.dialogueact17	27.217	29.587	E	Professor	s^df^j	-1	0	you know they don't have any check accent not time 
Bro016.E.dialogueact18	29.587	31.547	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	not time as far as i know so 
Bro016.E.dialogueact19	31.547	31.917	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	as i know so

Bro016.E.dialogueact23	37.567	39.247	E	Professor	qw^rt^t^tc	-1	0	so other than reading that it's it's hard there 
Bro016.F.dialogueact24	48.916	51.246	F	PhD	s	+1	1	i don't really have uh 
Bro016.F.dialogueact25	52.084	54.364	F	PhD	s	+1	1	been working on getting recorders

Bro016.E.dialogueact28	57.58	58.52	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	um do you think 
Bro016.E.dialogueact29	58.903	62.163	E	Professor	qy^rt	+1	1	do you think that would be the case for next week also or is is 
Bro016.E.dialogueact30	62.163	63.413	E	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	or is is uh what's 
Bro016.E.dialogueact31	63.933	66.835	E	Professor	qw.%--	+1	2	uh what's your projection 
Bro016.F.dialogueact32	68.449	70.009	F	PhD	h	-1	0	because the one um 
Bro016.E.dialogueact33	70.543	76.394	E	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	because the one thing that the one thing it seems to me we really should try if you hadn't tried before worries had occurred it was sort of obvious 
Bro016.E.dialogueact34	76.394	77.794	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	it was sort of obvious thing 
Bro016.E.dialogueact35	78.727	85.967	E	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	is um adjusting the uh of the scaling and uh assertion healthy sort of stuff 
Bro016.F.dialogueact36	86.41	88.38	F	PhD	s	+1	1	i did play with that actually a little bit um 
Bro016.F.dialogueact37	88.94	94.88	F	PhD	s	+1	2	bit um what happens is uh uh when you get to the noisy stuff you start getting lots of infections 
Bro016.E.dialogueact38	94.935	95.285	E	Professor	s^bk^rt	-1	0	of infections and 
Bro016.F.dialogueact39	95.515	96.595	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bro016.F.dialogueact40	97.159	102.389	F	PhD	s	+1	2	so i've tried playing around a little bit with in searching penalties and things like that 
Bro016.E.dialogueact41	102.54	102.86	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	that 
Bro016.F.dialogueact42	102.819	103.189	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	that i mean 
Bro016.F.dialogueact43	103.844	106.114	F	PhD	s	+1	2	i mean it it didn't make a whole lot of difference like for the well matched case 
Bro016.F.dialogueact44	106.114	109.074	F	PhD	s^e	+1	2	like for the well matched case it seemed like it was pretty good 
Bro016.F.dialogueact45	109.745	112.305	F	PhD	fh|s^cc	+1	2	i could do more playing with that though 
Bro016.F.dialogueact46	112.815	113.305	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	though 
Bro016.E.dialogueact48	114.116	116.096	E	Professor	s^bu	+1	1	but you were looking at no cancer 
Bro016.F.dialogueact47	114.085	114.565	F	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	but you were looking at 
Bro016.F.dialogueact49	117.073	117.513	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro016.E.dialogueact50	118.337	118.737	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	oh 
Bro016.F.dialogueact51	119.06	121.88	F	PhD	s^bu	+1	1	you're talking about for uh for our future 
Bro016.E.dialogueact52	122.083	122.403	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right so i mean 
Bro016.E.dialogueact53	122.403	130.003	E	Professor	s	+1	1	right so i mean it it's not the direction that you are working with they we were saying what's uh what's the best you can do with with no catch them but 
Bro016.E.dialogueact55	130.577	132.777	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but they raised a very valid point 
Bro016.F.dialogueact54	130.192	131.302	F	PhD	b	-1	0	but they raised a very 
Bro016.E.dialogueact56	133.097	134.147	E	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	which i guess so the first 
Bro016.E.dialogueact57	134.317	136.707	E	Professor	s	-1	0	so the first order i mean you have other things you're going to do 
Bro016.E.dialogueact58	137.107	156.891	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but the first order i would say that the conclusion is that if you um do some munching around with uh the exact h. t. k. train and was uh you know how many states and so forth it doesn't particularly improve the performance another 
Bro016.E.dialogueact59	156.891	165.441	E	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	the performance another it's that even though it sounds pretty dumb just applying the same number of states to everything or alas no matter what language isn't so bad 
Bro016.E.dialogueact60	166.628	166.878	E	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro016.E.dialogueact61	167.543	171.263	E	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	and i guess she hadn't gotten to experience you want to do it never doubt seems but 
Bro016.F.dialogueact62	170.992	171.282	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	it never doubt seems but 
Bro016.E.dialogueact63	171.873	172.923	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	but um 
Bro016.E.dialogueact64	173.303	173.713	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	let's just if we had 
Bro016.E.dialogueact65	173.713	178.693	E	Professor	s	-1	0	let's just if we had to if we had to draw a conclusion on information have far we'd say something like that right 
Bro016.E.dialogueact66	178.783	179.073	E	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	like that right 
Bro016.F.dialogueact67	179.11	180.49	F	PhD	b	-1	0	uh so the next 
Bro016.E.dialogueact68	180.33	191.416	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	uh so the next question to ask which is i think the one that that that and dresses to addressing himself too and a lunch meeting is um we're not supposed to adjust the back and but 
Bro016.E.dialogueact69	191.836	194.046	E	Professor	s	+1	1	and but anybody using the system what 
Bro016.F.dialogueact70	194.414	194.644	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro016.E.dialogueact71	195.511	195.941	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro016.E.dialogueact72	196.541	202.427	E	Professor	qw	+1	1	if you were just adjusting the back and how much better would you do uh in no ice 
Bro016.E.dialogueact73	203.209	210.149	E	Professor	s^df	+1	1	uh because the language scaling in searching thomas over there probably set to be about right for mel capture 
Bro016.F.dialogueact74	210.585	211.145	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro016.E.dialogueact75	211.303	217.026	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	they're probably not at all set right for these things particularly these things that 
Bro016.E.dialogueact76	217.026	226.104	E	Professor	s^e	-1	0	particularly these things that look over uh larger time windows in one way or another with with al t. a. k. o. t. and their own that's all these things and the fat 
Bro016.E.dialogueact77	226.584	232.164	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and the fat pass we always found we had to increasing talon assertion penalty to correspond such things 
Bro016.E.dialogueact78	233.117	233.767	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro016.E.dialogueact79	234.147	238.157	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	i think that's uh that's kind of a first order thing that that we should try so 
Bro016.F.dialogueact80	238.828	239.778	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so four 
Bro016.F.dialogueact81	240.23	248.52	F	PhD	s^bu	+1	2	so the experiment is to um run our friend and like normal with the default uh and certain penalties and so forth and 
Bro016.F.dialogueact82	248.87	251.37	F	PhD	s^bu	+1	2	so forth and then tweaked out a little bit and see how 
Bro016.F.dialogueact83	251.37	253.53	F	PhD	s^bu	+1	2	so by bit and see how much of a difference it makes 
Bro016.E.dialogueact84	253.64	261.93	E	Professor	s^na	+1	1	so by our friend and i mean take you know the virtues to take some version that stuff and has that is you know our current best version of something 
Bro016.F.dialogueact85	253.99	254.47	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	so by our friend and i mean 
Bro016.F.dialogueact86	258.344	259.094	F	PhD	b	-1	0	that is you know our current 
Bro016.E.dialogueact87	262.973	263.623	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro016.E.dialogueact88	264.992	268.082	E	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean don't want to do this over a hundred different things that they've tried but you know 
Bro016.E.dialogueact89	268.082	271.212	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but you know four summers and he's he's a good one you know 
Bro016.E.dialogueact90	271.382	271.742	E	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	you know 
Bro016.E.dialogueact91	272.552	273.102	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	um how 
Bro016.E.dialogueact92	273.659	279.389	E	Professor	qw	+1	1	how how much uh this is improved if you actually just that 
Bro016.F.dialogueact93	284.257	284.517	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro016.E.dialogueact94	285.091	285.841	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but it is interesting say 
Bro016.E.dialogueact95	285.841	287.961	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but it is interesting say you you have four the noisy 
Bro016.E.dialogueact96	288.171	293.971	E	Professor	qw	-1	0	how about for the for the mismatched or or or the or the medium mismatch conditions have 
Bro016.E.dialogueact97	293.971	294.401	E	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	conditions have you when 
Bro016.E.dialogueact98	294.952	298.212	E	Professor	qy.%--	+1	1	you when you just that those numbers from l. caps from did it 
Bro016.F.dialogueact99	299.165	301.645	F	PhD	s^no	+1	1	i i don't remember off the top of my head 
Bro016.F.dialogueact100	302.287	303.197	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro016.F.dialogueact101	305.338	306.548	F	PhD	s^df	+1	1	yeah i didn't even write them down 
Bro016.F.dialogueact102	307.776	308.766	F	PhD	s^no	-1	0	i i don't remember i would need 
Bro016.F.dialogueact103	308.766	309.486	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i don't remember i would need to well i did

Bro016.F.dialogueact106	314.575	318.515	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so when i was doing i just wrote down some numbers for the well matched case 
Bro016.E.dialogueact107	318.783	319.123	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	case 
Bro016.F.dialogueact108	319.3	320.06	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	looking

Bro016.F.dialogueact111	325.897	328.517	F	PhD	s^e	+1	1	four different numbers of states per phone 
Bro016.E.dialogueact112	328.79	329.15	E	Professor	b	-1	0	phone um but 
Bro016.F.dialogueact113	329.275	332.065	F	PhD	s	+1	1	um but uh that's that's all i wrote down

Bro016.F.dialogueact137	372.217	378.315	F	PhD	s	-1	0	probably will have time to do that and time to play a little bit with the silence so maybe 
Bro016.E.dialogueact138	377.066	377.776	E	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro016.F.dialogueact139	378.815	381.045	F	PhD	s	+1	2	so maybe i can have that for next week in phoenix

Bro016.E.dialogueact144	389.898	396.056	E	Professor	s	-1	0	that in fact it might have been part of what uh the difference was you he's 
Bro016.E.dialogueact145	396.808	398.808	E	Professor	s^e	-1	0	you he's part of that that that we were seeing 
Bro016.E.dialogueact146	398.908	402.418	E	Professor	s^e	-1	0	were seeing you never seen yes our system is so much better than the tandem system 
Bro016.F.dialogueact147	402.913	403.943	F	PhD	b	-1	0	part of 
Bro016.E.dialogueact148	403.64	409.975	E	Professor	s^e	-1	0	part of be that sri system they they they always adjust these things about of optimize is there 
Bro016.F.dialogueact149	408.88	409.41	F	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	these things about of optimize is there

Bro016.F.dialogueact151	410.076	416.596	F	PhD	s	+1	1	yes i wonder if there's anything that we could do to the front and that would affect insurrection 
Bro016.E.dialogueact152	416.712	417.092	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yes i think you can't 
Bro016.E.dialogueact153	417.092	417.952	E	Professor	s^na	-1	0	i think you can't

Bro016.E.dialogueact157	424.216	431.665	E	Professor	s	+1	1	part of what's going on um is the uh the rain 
Bro016.E.dialogueact158	433.088	440.978	E	Professor	s	+1	1	so if you have something that has a much smaller range are much larger range and taking the appropriate grouped

Bro016.F.dialogueact160	441.42	442.69	F	PhD	b	-1	0	you know if something 
Bro016.E.dialogueact161	442.174	442.654	E	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	you know if something 
Bro016.E.dialogueact162	442.804	450.163	E	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	you know if something is kind of like the equivalent of a bunch of probabilities multiplied together you can take a route of some sort of like some probabilities 
Bro016.E.dialogueact163	450.163	454.093	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	of like some probabilities together you can take seventh retarded or something or smog i mean 
Bro016.E.dialogueact164	454.093	455.843	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	or smog i mean throughout the seven but 
Bro016.F.dialogueact165	454.423	455.093	F	PhD	b	-1	0	or smog i mean throughout the seven but

Bro016.E.dialogueact168	457.489	458.029	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	that 
Bro016.E.dialogueact169	458.624	460.614	E	Professor	s	-1	0	that has a similar effect 
Bro016.E.dialogueact170	461.333	467.503	E	Professor	s^df	+1	1	because it changes the scale of the numbers of the differences between different candidate's from the acoustic model as oh right 
Bro016.F.dialogueact171	466.512	467.282	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	from the acoustic model as oh right

Bro016.E.dialogueact173	468.043	470.183	E	Professor	s^e	+1	1	opposed to what's coming from the language model so that right so in effect that's 
Bro016.F.dialogueact174	468.132	468.862	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	opposed to what's coming so that right 
Bro016.F.dialogueact175	468.862	469.242	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	opposed to what's coming from the language model so that right so in effect 
Bro016.F.dialogueact176	469.242	474.331	F	PhD	s	+1	1	from the language model yeah i mean it's so in effect that's changing the value of your assertion penalty 
Bro016.E.dialogueact177	474.191	474.471	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah i mean it's 
Bro016.E.dialogueact178	474.471	480.801	E	Professor	s^df	+1	1	yeah i mean it's more directly like the that the language scaling or the uh the miles going acoustic scaling but you that's interesting 
Bro016.F.dialogueact179	476.391	477.111	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	the that the language scaling that's interesting 
Bro016.E.dialogueact180	480.801	484.201	E	Professor	s	-1	0	scaling but you know that those things have kind of a somewhere effectiveness or should penalty anyway it's slightly 
Bro016.F.dialogueact181	483.376	484.186	F	PhD	b	-1	0	or should penalty anyway it's slightly 
Bro016.E.dialogueact182	484.201	487.555	E	Professor	s	-1	0	anyway it's slightly different way of of handling it so 
Bro016.F.dialogueact183	486.54	486.97	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	of handling 
Bro016.E.dialogueact184	487.555	488.625	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	it so so if 
Bro016.F.dialogueact185	488.85	495.487	F	PhD	s^bu	+1	1	i think so if we know what the searching penalty is weak about what range are number should be and so that they 
Bro016.E.dialogueact187	495.828	496.398	E	Professor	s^na	-1	0	i think so yeah be and so that they match with 
Bro016.F.dialogueact186	495.487	497.117	F	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	i think so yeah yeah so that's be and so that they match with 
Bro016.E.dialogueact188	496.398	496.818	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	so yeah match with 
Bro016.E.dialogueact189	497.505	497.705	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah so that's 
Bro016.E.dialogueact190	497.705	498.485	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah so that's why i think that's 
Bro016.E.dialogueact191	498.825	505.72	E	Professor	s	-1	0	why i think that's another reason other in curiosity as to why we would in fact be kind of neat to find out if we're way off 
Bro016.E.dialogueact193	506.097	508.107	E	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	any other things are are we seeing you i'm sure you've already looked at

Bro016.E.dialogueact195	509.227	512.577	E	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	this in these noisy cases are we are seeing lots of insurgence right in searching

Bro016.E.dialogueact221	538.028	553.809	E	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean it in the the dual systems we used to do i i uh i remember numbers kind of like assertions being half the number of relations is being and both numbers being tend to be on the small side comparing to to uh substation well 
Bro016.B.dialogueact223	552.295	553.165	B	PhD	b	-1	0	to uh substation well

Bro016.F.dialogueact225	554.404	563.247	F	PhD	s	-1	0	this the whole problem with insurgents was what i think um we talked about when the guy from o. j. i came down at one time and and that

Bro016.F.dialogueact227	563.757	569.758	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and and that was when people were saying that we should have a um uh bush activity detector 
Bro016.E.dialogueact228	569.894	570.164	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	detector that because all 
Bro016.F.dialogueact229	570.208	575.268	F	PhD	s	-1	0	that because all that stuff that we're getting through the silence it's getting through is causing search and so

Bro016.F.dialogueact233	577.471	580.221	F	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah and it may be i betcha there's still a lot 
Bro016.B.dialogueact234	579.809	580.259	B	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah and it may be 
Bro016.E.dialogueact235	580.227	580.427	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah and it may be 
Bro016.E.dialogueact236	580.427	582.527	E	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah and it may be less of a critical thing i mean the 
Bro016.E.dialogueact237	582.727	589.027	E	Professor	s^e^r	-1	0	thing i mean the fact that some get by maybe less of a critical thing if you uh get things in the right range so i mean the searching 
Bro016.F.dialogueact238	588.547	589.247	F	PhD	b	-1	0	in the right range so i mean the searching 
Bro016.E.dialogueact239	589.347	591.677	E	Professor	s	-1	0	so i mean the searching is is is a symptom 
Bro016.E.dialogueact240	592.39	595.21	E	Professor	s^e	-1	0	it's a symptom that there's something uh wrong with a range but there's

Bro016.E.dialogueact242	595.65	598.91	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but there's uh your your your substation tend to go up as well so 
Bro016.E.dialogueact243	598.91	600.52	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	to go up as well so uh i i i think that 
Bro016.F.dialogueact244	599.356	599.866	F	PhD	b	-1	0	uh i i i think 
Bro016.E.dialogueact245	601.12	603.16	E	Professor	s	-1	0	uh the most obvious thing is just the assertions but

Bro016.E.dialogueact250	617.783	618.183	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	that's the minimum so

Bro016.E.dialogueact269	683.313	687.133	E	Professor	s	-1	0	once we knew what russ roughly red operating range was was pretty stable and uh

Bro016.F.dialogueact272	693.17	697.09	F	PhD	qy^cs^rt	-1	0	uh what a good idea be to try to map it into the same range you get in a well matched case sophie computer with

Bro016.E.dialogueact281	720.314	720.644	E	Professor	b	-1	0	should probably take it

Bro016.E.dialogueact287	743.958	756.844	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	of can be kind of tricky so i mean what you would do is set the set the scaling factor is uh so that you got the best number for this point four or five times the downside

Bro016.E.dialogueact302	771.68	772.06	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	you know it's of these other things 
Bro016.E.dialogueact303	772.06	776.036	E	Professor	s^df	+1	2	it's of these other things and they turn out that uh it's kind of reasonable but then 
Bro016.E.dialogueact304	776.036	776.406	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but then 
Bro016.E.dialogueact305	777.169	780.479	E	Professor	s	+1	2	i mean and grass gave very reasonable response and he's 
Bro016.E.dialogueact306	780.479	783.579	E	Professor	s	+1	2	and he's probably not going to be anyone who's going to say this the future of you know 
Bro016.E.dialogueact307	783.579	784.149	E	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	future of you know people people 
Bro016.E.dialogueact308	784.189	791.795	E	Professor	s	+1	2	people people within this tight knit community who are doing this evaluation are accepting um more or less that these are the rules 
Bro016.E.dialogueact310	792.429	800.039	E	Professor	s	+1	2	but people outside of it is looking at the broader picture certainly going to say well wait a minute you doing all this standing on your head uh in the friend went all you could do is 
Bro016.F.dialogueact309	791.939	792.279	F	PhD	b	-1	0	are the rules but people 
Bro016.E.dialogueact311	800.039	804.119	E	Professor	s	+1	2	went all you could do is just a justice of the back and was once one knob and 
Bro016.F.dialogueact312	803.024	803.574	F	PhD	b	-1	0	once one knob 
Bro016.E.dialogueact313	804.219	804.589	E	Professor	%--	-1	0	and 
Bro016.E.dialogueact314	805.311	809.797	E	Professor	s^co	+1	2	so we have to at least i think determine that that's not true 
Bro016.E.dialogueact315	810.333	811.133	E	Professor	s^e	-1	0	which would be okay or 
Bro016.E.dialogueact316	811.787	813.047	E	Professor	s^co	-1	0	or determine that it is true much case we want to 
Bro016.E.dialogueact317	813.047	814.727	E	Professor	s^co	-1	0	much case we want to adjust that and 
Bro016.E.dialogueact318	814.867	817.577	E	Professor	s^co	-1	0	adjust that and then continuous this what we're doing and 
Bro016.E.dialogueact320	817.767	827.464	E	Professor	s	+1	2	we're doing and as you say as you point out finding ways to then compensate for that and friend and also then becomes priority for this particular test

Bro016.E.dialogueact386	975.6	981.582	E	Professor	s^bs	+1	1	but yeah basically we experiments and trying to pull it together in some coherent for them to be able to see what see what happens i 
Bro016.C.dialogueact387	977.938	978.368	C	PhD	b	-1	0	coherent for them to

Bro016.E.dialogueact407	1002.79	1003.09	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	okay so my 
Bro016.E.dialogueact408	1003.36	1008.65	E	Professor	s^cs	+1	2	so my suggestion though is that you you know necessarily finished that 
Bro016.E.dialogueact409	1010.01	1015.57	E	Professor	s^cs	+1	2	that you put it all together so that it's you've got you've got a clear structure to it you know what 
Bro016.E.dialogueact410	1015.57	1016.8	E	Professor	s^e	+1	1	to it you know what things are you have 
Bro016.E.dialogueact411	1016.8	1017.99	E	Professor	s^e	+1	1	things are you have things documented you've 
Bro016.E.dialogueact412	1017.99	1020.63	E	Professor	s^e	+1	1	things documented you've look things up that you needed to look up so 
Bro016.B.dialogueact414	1020.94	1021.34	B	PhD	b	-1	0	to look up so that you know so there's 
Bro016.E.dialogueact413	1020.85	1023.13	E	Professor	s^df	+1	2	to look up so that you know so there's such a thing could be written and 
Bro016.E.dialogueact415	1023.98	1025.22	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	and um when 
Bro016.E.dialogueact416	1025.93	1027.71	E	Professor	qw^rt	+1	1	when when when do you these again 
Bro016.C.dialogueact417	1028.59	1029.83	C	PhD	h|s	-1	0	uh and to my 
Bro016.C.dialogueact418	1030.12	1031.09	C	PhD	s^e	+1	1	sister and i first of july okay 
Bro016.E.dialogueact419	1031.0	1031.77	E	Professor	s^bk^m	-1	0	of july okay 
Bro016.E.dialogueact420	1031.77	1032.12	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	of july okay and 
Bro016.E.dialogueact421	1032.55	1038.4	E	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	and that you think you're on actually finishing it in in june 
Bro016.E.dialogueact422	1039.52	1043.25	E	Professor	s^df	+1	1	because you know you're going to have another bunch of results sit in there anyway and 
Bro016.B.dialogueact423	1041.13	1041.68	B	PhD	b	-1	0	bunch of results 
Bro016.C.dialogueact424	1043.35	1043.82	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bro016.E.dialogueact425	1043.97	1049.42	E	Professor	s^df	+1	2	and right now it's kind of important that we actually go forward with experiment so so 
Bro016.C.dialogueact426	1045.81	1046.3	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	it's kind of important that 
Bro016.E.dialogueact427	1049.42	1055.24	E	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	so so i i think it's good to pause and together everything together and make sure it's in good shape so that other 
Bro016.E.dialogueact428	1055.38	1057.34	E	Professor	s^df	+1	1	so that other people can get access to it and so that can 
Bro016.E.dialogueact429	1057.34	1059.24	E	Professor	s^df	+1	1	to it and so that can go into a report in june but i think 
Bro016.E.dialogueact430	1059.24	1067.75	E	Professor	s	+1	1	but i think to to really work on on fine tuning the report at this point is is probably bad timing 
Bro016.B.dialogueact431	1065.84	1066.3	B	PhD	b	-1	0	probably bad timing 
Bro016.B.dialogueact432	1068.01	1068.21	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	but we 
Bro016.B.dialogueact433	1068.72	1069.49	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but we didn't we 
Bro016.B.dialogueact434	1069.96	1072.3	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	didn't we just got to work on one week just people no no more 
Bro016.B.dialogueact435	1072.29	1073.78	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	no no more anyway 
Bro016.B.dialogueact436	1074.61	1075.52	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	you may you 
Bro016.E.dialogueact437	1075.65	1078.19	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	you may you may really want to add other things later anyway because you

Bro016.E.dialogueact489	1207.79	1209.32	E	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	yeah i guess the thing is yeah i guess 
Bro016.E.dialogueact490	1209.47	1209.74	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah i guess 
Bro016.E.dialogueact491	1209.74	1211.5	E	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah i guess it's a matter of interpretation the rules 
Bro016.E.dialogueact492	1211.5	1219.05	E	Professor	s.%--	+1	2	the rules as i understand it is that in principle the italian and uh spanish and english italian

Bro016.E.dialogueact494	1219.87	1224.85	E	Professor	s^bsc^rt	+1	2	italian in the finish we're development uh 
Bro016.B.dialogueact495	1225.05	1225.26	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah in spanish how much you could 
Bro016.B.dialogueact496	1225.4	1226.29	B	PhD	s	+1	2	yeah in spanish how much you could adjust things 
Bro016.E.dialogueact497	1225.53	1226.99	E	Professor	s^e	+1	2	yeah in spanish how much you could adjust things 
Bro016.E.dialogueact498	1227.9	1231.75	E	Professor	s	+1	2	and they and they german and danish worthy valuation day uh 
Bro016.B.dialogueact499	1230.46	1231.07	B	PhD	b	-1	0	worthy valuation day uh 
Bro016.E.dialogueact500	1232.61	1236.4	E	Professor	s	+1	2	yeah and then when they finally actually evaluated things they used everything 
Bro016.B.dialogueact501	1236.76	1236.92	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah 
Bro016.B.dialogueact502	1237.21	1237.71	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	that's right um so 
Bro016.B.dialogueact504	1237.86	1238.33	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	that's right um so 
Bro016.E.dialogueact503	1237.76	1238.34	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	that's right um so 
Bro016.E.dialogueact505	1239.38	1239.89	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh and 
Bro016.E.dialogueact506	1239.89	1246.83	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh and it is true that the performance uh on the german was i mean 
Bro016.E.dialogueact507	1246.83	1250.92	E	Professor	s	-1	0	was i mean it improvement wasn't so good to perdue bra performance was really pretty good 
Bro016.B.dialogueact508	1250.94	1251.3	B	PhD	b	-1	0	pretty good so 
Bro016.E.dialogueact509	1251.64	1252.4	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	so and 
Bro016.E.dialogueact510	1252.4	1253.74	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	and uh 
Bro016.E.dialogueact511	1254.07	1264.97	E	Professor	s	+1	2	it it doesn't appear that there's strong evidence is even though things were somewhat too and on those three or four languages that's going to a different language really her you and 
Bro016.E.dialogueact512	1264.97	1266.93	E	Professor	s	+1	2	her you and the noises were not exactly the same right 
Bro016.E.dialogueact513	1266.93	1267.19	E	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	the same right because it was taken 
Bro016.E.dialogueact514	1267.19	1269.02	E	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	because it was taken from a different

Bro016.E.dialogueact516	1271.44	1273.62	E	Professor	s	+1	2	i mean were different drives me was 
Bro016.B.dialogueact517	1272.75	1273.64	B	PhD	s^2	+1	2	drives me was 
Bro016.B.dialogueact519	1273.78	1274.01	B	PhD	b	-1	0	drives me was it was actually different cars 
Bro016.E.dialogueact518	1273.62	1275.71	E	Professor	s	-1	0	drives me was it was actually different cars and so on so 
Bro016.B.dialogueact520	1274.94	1275.25	B	PhD	b	-1	0	it was actually different cars and so on so 
Bro016.E.dialogueact521	1275.71	1276.06	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	and so on so um 
Bro016.E.dialogueact522	1276.9	1278.62	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um it's somewhat too and it's and 
Bro016.E.dialogueact523	1278.62	1281.45	E	Professor	s^e.%--	+1	2	too and it's and more than you know uh uh uh you 
Bro016.B.dialogueact524	1280.43	1280.94	B	PhD	b	-1	0	uh uh uh 
Bro016.E.dialogueact525	1282.03	1286.31	E	Professor	s	+1	2	really like to have something that needed no particular noise at all maybe just some 
Bro016.E.dialogueact526	1286.31	1289.48	E	Professor	s^e	-1	0	all maybe just some white noise or something like that at most 
Bro016.B.dialogueact527	1288.45	1288.94	B	PhD	b	-1	0	like that at 
Bro016.E.dialogueact528	1290.27	1292.6	E	Professor	s	+1	2	but that's not really what this contest is so 
Bro016.E.dialogueact529	1292.79	1293.21	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	is so 
Bro016.E.dialogueact530	1294.18	1295.74	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	i guess it's okay

Bro016.E.dialogueact533	1297.03	1300.95	E	Professor	s	+1	3	that's something i'd like to understand before we actually use something from it because he gets 
Bro016.F.dialogueact532	1296.93	1297.56	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	that's something i'd like to understand he gets 
Bro016.E.dialogueact534	1300.95	1301.49	E	Professor	s^df.%-	-1	0	something from it because of it it's probably 
Bro016.F.dialogueact535	1301.59	1308.95	F	PhD	s	+1	2	of it it's probably something that experiment designers didn't really think about because 
Bro016.F.dialogueact536	1308.95	1319.73	F	PhD	s^df	+1	2	really think about because i think most people aren't doing train systems or you know systems that are like cars where you actually use the data to build models 
Bro016.F.dialogueact537	1319.73	1322.04	F	PhD	s^df	+1	2	well it's true except models doing signal processing so 
Bro016.B.dialogueact538	1322.03	1322.18	B	PhD	b	-1	0	well it's true except so 
Bro016.E.dialogueact540	1322.47	1322.97	E	Professor	s^na	-1	0	well it's true except so 
Bro016.F.dialogueact539	1322.04	1322.39	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	well it's true except so 
Bro016.E.dialogueact541	1322.97	1325.58	E	Professor	s^arp	+1	2	well it's true except that uh that's what we used to never or one so 
Bro016.E.dialogueact542	1326.16	1329.14	E	Professor	s	+1	2	and then they design the things for our two knowing that we were doing that that's true 
Bro016.F.dialogueact543	1326.44	1326.72	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and then they design the 
Bro016.F.dialogueact544	1329.12	1329.87	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	that's true 
Bro016.E.dialogueact545	1330.02	1330.98	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro016.F.dialogueact546	1331.46	1332.8	F	PhD	s^bu	+1	2	and they didn't forbid us right 
Bro016.F.dialogueact547	1332.8	1333.05	F	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	forbid us right to build 
Bro016.F.dialogueact548	1333.13	1335.38	F	PhD	qy^bu^d^e^rt	+1	2	no to build models on day 
Bro016.E.dialogueact549	1335.47	1335.81	E	Professor	s^aa	+1	2	no 
Bro016.E.dialogueact550	1336.23	1337.64	E	Professor	s.%--	+1	2	but i think i think that it it 
Bro016.E.dialogueact551	1338.23	1349.73	E	Professor	s	+1	2	it probably would be the case that if say we trained on italian uh data and then uh we tested on danish dead and it did terribly uh that's that you would look bad in i 
Bro016.E.dialogueact552	1349.73	1351.25	E	Professor	s	+1	2	would look bad in i think someone would notice and say well look 
Bro016.E.dialogueact553	1351.25	1353.71	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and say well look this is not generalizing i 
Bro016.E.dialogueact555	1353.94	1355.18	E	Professor	s	-1	0	i hope i would hope they would

Bro016.F.dialogueact612	1505.9	1512.74	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	i mean you could maybe use the idea is a similar idea to what they do in boca like normalization you know you 
Bro016.F.dialogueact613	1512.74	1517.01	F	PhD	s	-1	0	normalization you know you have some sort of a general speech model and maybe just 
Bro016.F.dialogueact614	1517.01	1523.26	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and maybe just a mixture of calcium that you evaluate every other ends against and then you see 
Bro016.F.dialogueact615	1523.44	1533.37	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and then you see where each you know other ends like the likelihood of each other and she divide the the range of the likelihood up into discrete bins and then each pins 
Bro016.F.dialogueact616	1533.37	1538.06	F	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah but just listen to yourself i mean that's really doesn't sound and then each pins got some knob setting 
Bro016.E.dialogueact617	1536.56	1537.83	E	Professor	fg|s^nd	-1	0	yeah but just listen to yourself i mean setting

Bro016.E.dialogueact639	1559.77	1560.48	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	and so right so whatever it was

Bro016.F.dialogueact640	1560.17	1563.28	F	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah so whatever it was it would have to be sort of preferring basis 
Bro016.E.dialogueact641	1561.76	1562.09	E	Professor	b	-1	0	it would have to be sort of preferring basis 
Bro016.B.dialogueact642	1563.39	1563.76	B	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bro016.E.dialogueact643	1563.67	1564.09	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah i mean you 
Bro016.E.dialogueact644	1564.35	1565.64	E	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	i mean you can do um 
Bro016.E.dialogueact645	1565.84	1566.54	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	can do um 
Bro016.E.dialogueact647	1567.36	1571.41	E	Professor	s	-1	0	fairly quickly can do male female or male female stuff but 
Bro016.F.dialogueact646	1567.22	1567.54	F	PhD	b	-1	0	fairly quickly 
Bro016.F.dialogueact648	1571.01	1571.46	F	PhD	b	-1	0	stuff but 
Bro016.E.dialogueact649	1571.99	1572.78	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	stuff but as far as i mean 
Bro016.E.dialogueact650	1572.78	1577.94	E	Professor	s	-1	0	as far as i mean like i thought b. b. n. did this thing with uh uh vocal truck normalization ways back maybe 
Bro016.E.dialogueact651	1577.94	1578.99	E	Professor	s	-1	0	ways back maybe other people do too with 
Bro016.E.dialogueact652	1578.99	1584.97	E	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	other people do too with with uh the trying to a third format average informant using that as an indicator of 
Bro016.F.dialogueact653	1584.21	1584.67	F	PhD	s^no	-1	0	as an indicator of 
Bro016.E.dialogueact654	1585.66	1585.96	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	so 
Bro016.E.dialogueact655	1586.13	1587.14	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	you know third foreman if you imagine 
Bro016.E.dialogueact656	1587.14	1595.33	E	Professor	s	-1	0	if you imagine that the first order what happens with uh changing focal track is that uh the foreman skit moved out by some proportion 
Bro016.F.dialogueact657	1595.6	1596.25	F	PhD	b	-1	0	so if you had 
Bro016.E.dialogueact658	1596.2	1604.95	E	Professor	s^e	-1	0	so if you had a first format that was one hundred hertz before is this fifty if they vocal track this fifty percent shorter then it would be out at seven fifty years 
Bro016.E.dialogueact659	1605.12	1605.72	E	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and so on 
Bro016.E.dialogueact660	1606.34	1608.27	E	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	so that's a move tutors fifty hertz whereas the third 
Bro016.E.dialogueact661	1608.27	1614.15	E	Professor	s^e	-1	0	whereas the third format which might start off at twenty five hundred hurts you know might be up to thirty seven fifty s. is that 
Bro016.E.dialogueact662	1614.15	1614.75	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	s. is that 
Bro016.E.dialogueact663	1615.35	1615.81	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro016.E.dialogueact664	1616.91	1623.1	E	Professor	s	-1	0	although you are going to get less distinct higher is still third form it's kind of a reasonable compromising

Bro016.F.dialogueact666	1623.79	1624.46	F	PhD	b	-1	0	so i think 
Bro016.E.dialogueact667	1624.51	1627.62	E	Professor	s	-1	0	so i think if i recall correctly they did something like that and 
Bro016.E.dialogueact669	1627.85	1628.88	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	like that and and but 
Bro016.F.dialogueact668	1627.38	1628.02	F	PhD	b	-1	0	like that and and but 
Bro016.E.dialogueact670	1629.0	1633.74	E	Professor	s	-1	0	um it doesn't work for just having one frame or something you 
Bro016.F.dialogueact671	1633.35	1633.84	F	PhD	b	-1	0	or something you 
Bro016.B.dialogueact673	1634.05	1634.71	B	PhD	b	-1	0	know it's more like looking at 
Bro016.E.dialogueact672	1633.96	1637.78	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	or something you know it's more like looking at third form and over overturned or something like that 
Bro016.B.dialogueact674	1637.29	1637.63	B	PhD	b	-1	0	like that 
Bro016.E.dialogueact675	1637.78	1638.0	E	Professor	%--	-1	0	like that

Bro016.E.dialogueact679	1640.91	1650.4	E	Professor	s	-1	0	so but on the other hand male female is uh is uh is a much simpler categories patient and figuring out a factor too uh squish or expanding the spectrum so

Bro016.E.dialogueact681	1650.4	1651.51	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bro016.E.dialogueact682	1652.53	1653.68	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	you could imagine that they're just 
Bro016.E.dialogueact683	1653.8	1656.21	E	Professor	s	-1	0	imagine that they're just like we're saying voice on voiced is good to know uh

Bro016.B.dialogueact751	1783.26	1783.77	B	PhD	b	-1	0	so if it's very 
Bro016.E.dialogueact752	1783.51	1786.18	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so if it's very different then this is the sort of thing i really got address 
Bro016.E.dialogueact753	1786.27	1787.99	E	Professor	s	-1	0	i really got address brought this point uh 
Bro016.E.dialogueact754	1788.1	1790.5	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	i sort of forgotten to discuss it 
Bro016.E.dialogueact755	1791.41	1792.15	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	you always 
Bro016.E.dialogueact756	1792.69	1798.52	E	Professor	s^co	-1	0	you always have to look at how this uh these justice uh affect things

Bro016.B.dialogueact759	1805.67	1806.16	B	PhD	b	-1	0	so if it if in fact 
Bro016.E.dialogueact758	1805.39	1807.55	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so if it if in fact uh the problem 
Bro016.E.dialogueact760	1807.73	1813.85	E	Professor	s	-1	0	uh the problem might be that the range of industry features it's quite different than the range guilty or not catch

Bro016.E.dialogueact832	1942.87	1943.16	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	right so the question 
Bro016.E.dialogueact833	1943.16	1957.8	E	Professor	s	-1	0	so the question is you know whatever they are at that point um i they something for which taking square ruder keepers or four three or something like that is is going to be a good or a bad thing

Bro016.E.dialogueact837	1963.52	1965.6	E	Professor	s^bsc.%--	-1	0	that nothing nothing else after that just going to it things are going 
Bro016.E.dialogueact838	1965.61	1966.81	E	Professor	s	-1	0	just going to it things are going to scale it you 
Bro016.E.dialogueact839	1966.81	1968.13	E	Professor	s	-1	0	to scale it you know subtracting from summit scale it from it but 
Bro016.E.dialogueact840	1968.13	1968.92	E	Professor	s	-1	0	scale it from it but 
Bro016.E.dialogueact841	1968.92	1970.53	E	Professor	s	-1	0	scale it from it but nothing will have that same fact

Bro016.E.dialogueact845	1977.3	1978.0	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	anyway yeah because if if the law problems that 
Bro016.F.dialogueact846	1977.32	1977.45	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	anyway yeah because if if 
Bro016.F.dialogueact847	1977.45	1986.98	F	PhD	s	-1	0	anyway yeah because if if the law problems that are coming out of the atmosphere really big the standard assertion penalty's going to have very little effect 
Bro016.E.dialogueact848	1980.53	1981.03	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	of the atmosphere really big 
Bro016.E.dialogueact849	1987.12	1987.4	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	compared to 
Bro016.F.dialogueact850	1987.43	1991.76	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	again you don't compared to smaller setup lung problems

Bro016.E.dialogueact852	1991.58	1993.2	E	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	again you don't really look at that it's something that's lung problems 
Bro016.E.dialogueact853	1993.2	1994.31	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it's something that's and then it's gone 
Bro016.E.dialogueact854	1994.31	1998.11	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and then it's gone through this transformation that's probably pretty close to it whatever the kill tease 
Bro016.E.dialogueact855	1998.11	1999.41	E	Professor	s	-1	0	it whatever the kill tease doing that it's probably 
Bro016.E.dialogueact856	1999.41	2003.21	E	Professor	s^e	-1	0	doing that it's probably pretty close to a uh uh to be causing transformation sorry but still it's 
Bro016.F.dialogueact857	1999.58	1999.9	F	PhD	b	-1	0	doing that it's probably 
Bro016.E.dialogueact858	2003.52	2007.39	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but still it's it's not going to probably radically changed the scale of things

Bro016.F.dialogueact1066	2448.42	2453.05	F	PhD	s^e	+1	1	and i think of acoustic features as being um things a linguist about like

Bro016.F.dialogueact1077	2460.73	2462.98	F	PhD	s^e	+1	1	because dictated so they talk about features for phones like 
Bro016.F.dialogueact1078	2462.98	2464.59	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	for phones like uh it's height it's

Bro016.F.dialogueact1087	2486.05	2487.3	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	i mean and at least in my mind 
Bro016.E.dialogueact1088	2487.81	2494.12	E	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean we did the spam work i mean there we had we had this notion of and uh auditory auditory event mind

Bro016.E.dialogueact1096	2504.38	2510.42	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and they the the idea was something that occurred that is important to a bunch of new around somewhere 
Bro016.E.dialogueact1097	2511.98	2512.35	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bro016.A.dialogueact1098	2512.7	2512.99	A	Grad	b	-1	0	um 
Bro016.E.dialogueact1099	2512.76	2519.38	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um a sudden change or relatively rapid change in some spectra characteristic we'll we'll do sort of this and is certainly a 
Bro016.E.dialogueact1100	2519.38	2525.09	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	of this and is certainly a bunch of a bunch of places were you know that around are going to fire because something novels happened that 
Bro016.E.dialogueact1101	2525.95	2528.03	E	Professor	s	-1	0	that was that was a main thing that we're focusing on they're but they're certainly other things 
Bro016.E.dialogueact1102	2528.03	2533.7	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but they're certainly other things beyond what we talked about their that aren't just sort of rapid changes but 
Bro016.E.dialogueact1103	2533.7	2533.9	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	changes but 
Bro016.F.dialogueact1104	2534.87	2537.3	F	PhD	s	+1	1	it's kind of like the difference between top down and bottom up 
Bro016.E.dialogueact1105	2535.78	2536.5	E	Professor	b	-1	0	kind of like the difference between top down and bottom 
Bro016.F.dialogueact1106	2538.07	2541.92	F	PhD	s^e	+1	1	i think of the acoustic you know phonetic features is being top down 
Bro016.F.dialogueact1107	2542.1	2543.09	F	PhD	s^df	+1	1	you know you look at the phone and you say this phone 
Bro016.F.dialogueact1108	2543.09	2547.94	F	PhD	s^df	+1	1	and you say this phone is supposed to be you know have this teacher this teacher in this feature 
Bro016.F.dialogueact1109	2548.37	2551.9	F	PhD	s	+1	1	whether that those features show up and acoustic signal is sort of a relative whereas 
Bro016.F.dialogueact1110	2551.9	2554.47	F	PhD	s	+1	1	sort of a relative whereas an acoustic event goes the other way here's the signal 
Bro016.F.dialogueact1111	2554.47	2555.33	F	PhD	s^df	+1	1	other way here's the signal here some events 
Bro016.F.dialogueact1112	2555.61	2556.36	F	PhD	s^df	+1	1	here some events what 
Bro016.A.dialogueact1113	2556.58	2556.87	A	Grad	b	-1	0	what 
Bro016.F.dialogueact1114	2556.78	2557.07	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	what and then that 
Bro016.F.dialogueact1115	2557.37	2560.89	F	PhD	s	+1	1	and then that you know that may map to this phone sometimes and sometimes 
Bro016.F.dialogueact1116	2560.89	2561.79	F	PhD	s	-1	0	sometimes and sometimes it may not it just 
Bro016.F.dialogueact1117	2561.79	2563.51	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	it may not it just depend maybe depend on the context things like that 
Bro016.F.dialogueact1118	2563.51	2563.99	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	things like that 
Bro016.E.dialogueact1120	2564.64	2565.5	E	Professor	b	-1	0	so it's sort of a different way of looking 
Bro016.F.dialogueact1119	2564.23	2566.19	F	PhD	s	+1	1	so it's sort of a different way of looking

Bro016.A.dialogueact1128	2573.77	2579.3	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	using these these events um and we can we can perform these these uh cheating experiments see how how 
Bro016.A.dialogueact1129	2579.3	2586.45	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	see how how how good they are um and um terms of phony recognition or word recognition

Bro016.A.dialogueact1132	2589.49	2606.69	A	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	and then from that point on i would uh design robust eventing textures um in a similar um @reject@ spirit that saul has done um with his graphical models and this is probably stick and or model that he uses 
Bro016.A.dialogueact1133	2607.09	2607.62	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro016.A.dialogueact1134	2608.25	2616.67	A	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	tried to extended to um to account for other other phenomenon like um c. m. are so much relation released

Bro016.A.dialogueact1137	2619.62	2627.55	A	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	and maybe also investigate ways to to modify the structure of these models um in a data driven way uh 
Bro016.A.dialogueact1138	2627.76	2632.84	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	way uh similar to the way that uh jeff jeff uh buildings to his work 
Bro016.A.dialogueact1139	2633.52	2634.18	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	um and well 
Bro016.A.dialogueact1140	2634.58	2647.48	A	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	and well i'm i'm doing these um event detectors like in my my measure my progress by comparing um the air raids and cleaning noisy conditions to something like uh no that's

Bro016.A.dialogueact1144	2651.23	2665.06	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	so once we have these these uh you vent detectors um put them together and c. d. outputs of the event detectors into into the sri um each of them h. m. m. system and
