The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group discussed recognition results generated for 20 minutes of close-talking microphone data.
Recognition performance was very good , indicating promising results for forced alignment procedures and the ability to analyze other important signal information , e.g . prosody and overlapping speech.
It was decided that close-talking data should be downsampled and fed to the SRI recognizer to compare recognition performance , and that data from the far-field microphones should be tested on the recognizer as soon as possible.
The group also discussed recording setup and equipment issues.
A decision was made to purchase an additional head-mounted crown microphone.
A tentative decision was also made to integrate the use of a hand-held wireless microphone to help compensate for the lack of available close-talking microphones.
The collection of Meeting Recorder data is ongoing , and will include meetings by the Berkeley Even Deeper Understanding research group and , possibly , an organized discussion by members of the transcriber pool.
