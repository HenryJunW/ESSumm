Bmr011.B.dialogueact62	93.1	98.51	B	Professor	qo^t	-1	0	An - anything else , uh , strike anybody ?
Bmr011.A.dialogueact63	99.068	103.278	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Uh , we started {pause} running recognition on {pause} one conversation

Bmr011.A.dialogueact69	109.72	117.86	A	PhD	s	-1	0	uh , the main thing would be if anyone has , um , knowledge about ways to , uh , post - process the wave forms that would give us better recognition ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact70	118.0	119.22	A	PhD	s	-1	0	that would be helpful to know about .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact71	120.68	121.58	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Um ,
Bmr011.H.dialogueact72	121.481	121.581	H	Grad	s	-1	0	Dome

Bmr011.C.dialogueact77	129.417	131.277	C	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	Yeah , we 're working more on it
Bmr011.C.dialogueact78	131.277	133.147	C	PhD	s	-1	0	but , {vocalsound} it 's not finished .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact79	133.773	134.073	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact80	135.2	137.09	B	Professor	s^t	-1	0	Alright , that seems like a {disfmarker} a good collection of things .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact81	137.09	139.66	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And we 'll undoubtedly think of {pause} other things .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact82	139.99	141.94	G	Postdoc	s^t	-1	0	I had thought under my topic that I would mention
Bmr011.G.dialogueact83	142.03	147.95	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	the , uh , four items that I {disfmarker} I , uh , put out for being on the agenda f on that meeting ,
Bmr011.G.dialogueact84	147.95	151.97	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	which includes like the pre - segmentation and the {disfmarker} and the developments in multitrans .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact85	153.717	155.367	B	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	Oh , under the NIST meeting .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact86	154.63	155.42	G	Postdoc	s^m^na	-1	0	Yeah , under the NIST thing .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact88	155.859	156.139	B	Professor	s^bk^rt	-1	0	OK .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact87	155.51	155.69	G	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact89	156.951	158.061	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Alright , why don't we start off with this ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact90	158.061	159.571	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	u u
Bmr011.B.dialogueact91	160.253	162.123	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I guess the order we brought them up seems fine .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact92	161.504	161.754	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact93	162.553	163.173	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact94	164.14	166.18	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	so , better quality close talking mikes .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact95	166.18	172.24	B	Professor	s	+1	0	So the one issue was that the {disfmarker} the , uh , lapel mike , uh , isn't as good as you would like .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact96	172.24	176.83	B	Professor	s^bu	+1	0	And so , uh , it {disfmarker} it 'd be better if we had close talking mikes for everybody .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact97	176.83	177.1	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr011.A.dialogueact99	178.491	179.031	A	PhD	h	-1	0	Ri - um ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact98	178.09	179.78	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Is that {disfmarker} is that basically the point ?
Bmr011.A.dialogueact100	180.556	180.976	A	PhD	s^aa|%--	-1	0	yeah , the {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact101	182.269	190.066	A	PhD	s	+1	1	And actually in addition to that , that the {disfmarker} the close talking mikes are worn in such a way as to best capture the signal .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact102	190.941	194.451	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And the reason here is just that for the people doing work
Bmr011.A.dialogueact103	194.451	197.701	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	not on microphones but on sort of like dialogue and so forth ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact104	198.345	199.735	A	PhD	h|s.%--	-1	0	uh {disfmarker} or and even on prosody ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact105	199.735	201.665	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	which Don is gonna be working on soon ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact106	202.015	208.435	A	PhD	s	+1	1	it adds this extra , you know , vari variable for each speaker to {disfmarker} to deal with when the microphones aren't similar .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact108	208.768	209.208	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact107	208.63	208.86	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact109	209.577	211.337	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	So {disfmarker} And I also talked to Mari this morning
Bmr011.A.dialogueact110	211.337	213.767	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and she also had a strong preference for doing that .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact111	213.767	218.505	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And in fact she said that that 's useful for them to know in starting to collect their data too .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact112	217.259	217.629	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact113	219.72	220.4	B	Professor	fg|s.%-	-1	0	Right , so one th
Bmr011.H.dialogueact114	219.8	220.27	H	Grad	fg|%-	-1	0	Well , so {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact115	221.89	229.633	B	Professor	s	+1	1	uh , well one thing I was gonna say was that , um , i we could get more , uh , of the head mounted microphones
Bmr011.B.dialogueact116	229.983	232.563	B	Professor	s	-1	0	even beyond the number of radio channels we have
Bmr011.B.dialogueact117	232.563	237.506	B	Professor	s	-1	0	because I think whether it 's radio or wire is probably second - order .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact118	237.506	240.006	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And the main thing is having the microphone close to you ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact120	240.217	240.607	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact119	240.006	241.536	B	Professor	s^bd^df	-1	0	u although , not too close .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact121	242.456	242.626	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Right ,
Bmr011.H.dialogueact122	242.626	247.556	H	Grad	s	-1	0	so , uh , actually the way Jose is wearing his is {disfmarker} is c {pause} correct .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact123	245.41	245.65	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr011.B.dialogueact127	249.827	250.097	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact128	249.944	251.284	D	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	I it 's not cor it 's correct ?

Bmr011.D.dialogueact131	251.985	252.195	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact132	252.35	255.83	H	Grad	s	+1	1	So it 's towards the corner of your mouth so that breath sounds don't get on it .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact134	252.975	253.105	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact135	254.968	255.438	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact136	255.83	261.74	H	Grad	s^co	+1	0	And then just sort of about , uh , a thumb or {disfmarker} a thumb and a half away from your {disfmarker} from your mouth .

Bmr011.A.dialogueact142	263.757	265.587	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But we have more than one type of {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact141	263.712	264.152	B	Professor	qw.%-	-1	0	How am I d
Bmr011.A.dialogueact143	265.587	266.567	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , for instance , you 're {disfmarker}
Bmr011.C.dialogueact144	266.247	266.377	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact145	266.61	267.86	H	Grad	s	-1	0	And this one isn't very adjustable ,
Bmr011.D.dialogueact147	268.31	268.59	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact146	267.86	269.18	H	Grad	s	-1	0	so this about as good as I can get
Bmr011.A.dialogueact149	269.288	269.738	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact150	269.342	269.622	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact148	269.18	270.38	H	Grad	s	-1	0	cuz it 's a fixed boom .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact151	270.12	270.68	D	PhD	s^2	-1	0	Is fixed . Yeah .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact153	271.231	277.821	A	PhD	s^cs	+1	2	But if we could actually standardize , you know , the {disfmarker} the microphones , uh , as much as possible that would be really helpful .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact152	271.228	271.518	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact154	271.93	272.4	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact155	276.364	276.714	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact156	277.81	278.14	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact157	278.419	281.759	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Well , I mean it doesn't hurt to have a few extra microphones around ,
Bmr011.D.dialogueact158	278.716	278.906	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact159	281.759	284.439	B	Professor	s^cs.%--	+1	1	so why don't we just go out and {disfmarker} and get an order of {disfmarker} of
Bmr011.B.dialogueact160	284.729	286.569	B	Professor	s	-1	0	if this microphone seems OK to people ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact161	287.159	288.939	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	uh , I 'd just get a half dozen of these things .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact162	288.287	293.157	H	Grad	s	-1	0	Well the onl the only problem with that is right now , um , some of the Jimlets aren't working .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact163	294.382	296.202	H	Grad	s^e	-1	0	The little {disfmarker} the boxes under the table .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact164	296.7	297.15	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact165	297.11	300.42	H	Grad	s	-1	0	And so , w Uh , I 've only been able to find three jacks that are working .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact166	301.047	301.467	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact167	302.24	303.35	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Can we get these , wireless ?
Bmr011.H.dialogueact168	302.66	303.05	H	Grad	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact169	303.808	305.068	B	Professor	s^ar|s.%-	-1	0	No , but my point is {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact170	304.635	308.765	A	PhD	s	-1	0	But y we could just record these signals separately and time align them with the start of the meeting .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact171	309.08	310.42	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	R r right {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact172	310.01	311.03	H	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure I 'm follow .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact173	311.09	311.6	H	Grad	s^co^rt	-1	0	Say that again ?
Bmr011.B.dialogueact174	311.955	318.072	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Right now , we 've got , uh , two microphones in the room , that are not quote - unquote standard .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact175	318.672	320.332	B	Professor	s^cs.%-	-1	0	So why don't we replace those {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact176	320.291	320.971	H	Grad	s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	OK , just two .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact177	322.79	324.4	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , however many we can plug in .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact179	324.4	326.21	B	Professor	s	-1	0	You know , if we can plug in three , let 's plug in three .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact178	324.341	324.621	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact180	325.357	325.717	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact181	326.54	329.55	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Also what we 've talked before about getting another , uh , radio ,
Bmr011.H.dialogueact182	329.52	329.74	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact183	330.48	333.75	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so then that would be , you know , three {pause} more .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact184	333.17	333.75	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right . OK .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact185	333.88	334.11	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact186	334.466	338.096	B	Professor	s^co	+1	0	So , uh {disfmarker} so we should go out to our full complement of whatever we can do ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact187	338.402	339.882	B	Professor	s	+1	2	but have them all be the same mike .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact188	339.962	345.498	B	Professor	s	+1	0	I think the original reason that it was done the other way was because , it w it was sort of an experimental thing
Bmr011.B.dialogueact189	345.498	351.11	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and I don't think anybody knew whether people would rather have more variety or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} or , uh , more uniformity ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact190	346.923	347.093	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact191	351.11	352.382	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} but uh ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact192	354.721	356.271	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	sounds {disfmarker} sounds fine .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact193	355.52	356.83	H	Grad	s	-1	0	Sounds like uniformity wins .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact194	356.379	356.539	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact196	357.656	363.09	A	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	Well , for short term research it 's just {disfmarker} there 's just so much effort that would have to be done up front n uh ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact195	357.307	357.637	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact197	362.03	362.23	H	Grad	fg	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact198	363.2	365.03	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so {disfmarker} yeah , uniformity would be great .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact199	363.297	363.467	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact200	363.83	364.49	E	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	Is it because {disfmarker}
Bmr011.E.dialogueact201	365.45	367.72	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	You {disfmarker} you 're saying the {disfmarker} for dialogue purposes ,
Bmr011.E.dialogueact202	367.72	371.504	E	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	so that means that the transcribers are having trouble with those mikes ?
Bmr011.E.dialogueact203	371.504	372.104	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Is that what you mean ?
Bmr011.A.dialogueact205	372.138	374.558	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Well Jane would know more about the transcribers .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact204	372.104	372.164	E	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	Or {disfmarker} ?
Bmr011.G.dialogueact206	374.27	374.97	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And that 's true .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact207	375.02	376.4	G	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	I mean , I {disfmarker} we did discuss this .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact208	376.53	377.72	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	Uh , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact209	376.65	376.77	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yep .

Bmr011.G.dialogueact212	378.75	380.8	G	Postdoc	fh|s.%--	-1	0	so , um , yeah , the transcribers notice {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact213	380.8	382.46	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And in fact there 're some where , um {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact214	383.04	383.1	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	ugh
Bmr011.G.dialogueact215	383.87	385.61	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	well , I mean there 's {disfmarker} it 's the double thing .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact216	385.61	387.37	G	Postdoc	s	+1	2	It 's the equipment and also how it 's worn .

Bmr011.C.dialogueact231	401.376	401.646	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact230	400.97	402.4	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It 's also like n no breathing ,
Bmr011.G.dialogueact232	402.4	402.51	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	no {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact233	402.58	404.11	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	You know , it 's like it 's {disfmarker} it 's um ,

Bmr011.G.dialogueact235	404.41	407.23	G	Postdoc	s	+1	2	it 's really {disfmarker} {nonvocalsound} it makes a big difference from the transcribers ' point of view
Bmr011.H.dialogueact236	404.54	406.34	H	Grad	s^j	-1	0	Yeah , it 's an advantage when you don't breath .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact237	407.23	408.7	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and also from the research s point of view .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact240	409.172	409.612	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact238	409.12	409.66	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	When we 're doing {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact239	409.12	414.74	H	Grad	s^df	+1	0	Yeah , I think that the point of doing the close talking mike is to get a good quality signal . We 're not doing research on close talking mikes .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact241	413.175	413.425	G	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact243	415.02	415.5	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact242	415.01	416.78	H	Grad	s	+1	2	So we might as well get it as uniform as we can .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact244	416.337	416.517	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact245	417.2	420.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Now , this is locking the barn door after the horse was stolen .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact246	420.88	424.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	We do have thirty hours , of {disfmarker} of speech , which is done this way .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact247	422.12	422.36	H	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact248	423.568	424.148	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That 's OK .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact249	424.29	424.57	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact250	425.03	428.48	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	but , uh , yeah , for future ones we can get it a bit more uniform .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact251	429.045	430.395	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Great , great .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact252	429.35	431.55	H	Grad	s	-1	0	So I think just do a field trip at some point .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact253	432.087	433.987	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah , probably {disfmarker} yeah , to the store we talked about
Bmr011.B.dialogueact255	433.987	434.407	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	and that {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact254	433.84	434.0	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact256	435.07	439.45	G	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	And there was some talk about , uh , maybe the h headphones that are uncomfortable for people , to {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact257	438.71	438.85	H	Grad	fg	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact258	439.35	446.71	H	Grad	s	+1	0	So , as {disfmarker} as I said , we 'll do a field trip and see if we can get all of the same mike that 's more comfortable than {disfmarker} than these things , which I think are horrible .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact259	444.797	445.127	G	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .

Bmr011.G.dialogueact301	520.552	521.372	G	Postdoc	s^bd|s.%--	-1	0	Well that 's OK , I mean we 'll {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact299	520.1	520.38	H	Grad	s^fa	-1	0	Sorry .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact302	522.596	523.876	G	Postdoc	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , and it 's t and it looks really great .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact303	523.876	525.106	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	He {disfmarker} he has a prototype .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact304	525.106	528.88	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I , uh , @ @ {comment} didn't {disfmarker} didn't see it , uh , yesterday
Bmr011.G.dialogueact305	528.88	529.63	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but I 'm going to see it today .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact306	530.37	538.15	G	Postdoc	s	+1	1	And , uh , that 's {disfmarker} that will enable us to do {pause} nice um , tight time marking of the beginning and ending of overlapping segments .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact307	538.15	543.651	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	At present it 's not possible with limitations of {disfmarker} of the , uh , original {pause} design of the software .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact308	544.768	545.438	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	And um .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact309	545.728	546.058	G	Postdoc	s^bd^no	-1	0	So , I don't know .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact310	546.247	551.477	G	Postdoc	s	+1	1	In terms of , like , pre - segmentation , that {disfmarker} that continues to be , um , a terrific asset to the {disfmarker} to the transcribers .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact311	551.557	554.217	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Do you {disfmarker} I know that you 're al also supplementing it further .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact312	554.217	556.187	G	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	Do you want to mention something about that c Thilo ,
Bmr011.G.dialogueact313	556.187	556.217	G	Postdoc	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bmr011.C.dialogueact314	556.85	557.62	C	PhD	h|s^aa	-1	0	Um , yeah .
Bmr011.C.dialogueact315	557.62	568.574	C	PhD	s	+1	1	What {disfmarker} what I 'm doing right now is I 'm trying to include some information about which channel , uh , there 's some speech in .
Bmr011.C.dialogueact316	568.574	571.414	C	PhD	s	-1	0	But that 's not working at the moment .
Bmr011.C.dialogueact318	572.104	578.83	C	PhD	s	+1	1	I 'm just trying to do this by comparing energies , uh {disfmarker} normalizing energies and comparing energies of the different channels .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact317	571.852	572.002	G	Postdoc	s^bk.%	-1	0	OK .
Bmr011.C.dialogueact319	578.83	579.04	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	And
Bmr011.C.dialogueact320	579.539	586.199	C	PhD	s	+1	0	so to {disfmarker} to give the transcribers some information in which channel there 's {disfmarker} there 's speech in addition to {disfmarker} to the thing we {disfmarker} we did
Bmr011.C.dialogueact321	587.067	590.717	C	PhD	s	+1	0	now which is just , uh , speech - nonspeech detection on the mixed file .
Bmr011.C.dialogueact323	591.67	595.29	C	PhD	s	+1	0	So I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm relying on {disfmarker} on the segmentation of the mixed file
Bmr011.G.dialogueact322	591.562	592.272	G	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	This is good . Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.C.dialogueact324	595.29	603.955	C	PhD	s	+1	0	but I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm trying to subdivide the speech portions into different portions if there is some activity in {disfmarker} in different channels .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact325	604.32	607.25	G	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	Excellent , so this 'd be like w e providing also speaker ID {pause} potentially .
Bmr011.C.dialogueact326	605.483	605.683	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr011.C.dialogueact327	606.89	607.0	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.C.dialogueact328	607.32	607.48	C	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr011.B.dialogueact331	611.47	618.76	B	Professor	fg|s^t.%--	-1	0	Um , something I guess I didn't put in the list but , uh , on that , uh , same day later on in {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact332	618.87	621.01	B	Professor	s^bsc	-1	0	or maybe it 's {disfmarker} No , actually {pause} it 's this week ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact333	621.676	626.386	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	uh , Dave Gelbart and I will be , uh , visiting with John Canny
Bmr011.B.dialogueact334	627.076	629.606	B	Professor	s^e	+1	0	who i you know , is a CS professor ,
Bmr011.G.dialogueact335	627.386	627.696	G	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact337	630.079	632.219	B	Professor	s^e	+1	0	who 's interested in ar in array microphones .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact336	629.894	630.654	H	Grad	s^2	-1	0	HCC .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact338	632.58	633.76	H	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	Oh , he 's doing array mikes .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact339	633.84	634.08	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact340	635.004	638.424	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And so we wanna see what commonality there is here .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact341	638.824	642.94	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	You know , maybe they 'd wanna stick an array mike here when we 're doing things
Bmr011.E.dialogueact342	641.4	642.15	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That would be cool .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact343	642.3	643.06	H	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Yeah , that would be neat .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact344	643.0	647.937	B	Professor	s	-1	0	or {disfmarker} or maybe it 's {disfmarker} it 's not a specific array microphone they want
Bmr011.D.dialogueact345	643.037	643.377	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact346	643.204	644.034	E	PhD	s^ba^m	-1	0	That would be really neat .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact347	647.937	654.007	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	but they might wanna just , {disfmarker} uh , you know , you could imagine them taking the four signals from these {disfmarker} these table mikes and trying to do something with them {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact348	654.775	657.825	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Um , I also had a discussion {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact349	657.825	664.895	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So , w uh , we 'll be over {disfmarker} over there talking with him , um , after class on Friday .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact350	665.155	667.741	B	Professor	fh|s^cc	-1	0	Um , we 'll let you know what {disfmarker} what goes with that .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact351	668.081	676.832	B	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	Also had a completely unrelated thing . I had a , uh , discussion today with , uh , Birger Kollmeier who 's a , uh , a German , uh , scientist
Bmr011.B.dialogueact352	677.452	680.732	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	who 's got a fair sized group {vocalsound} doing a range of things .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact353	680.732	683.602	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	It 's sort of auditory related , largely for hearing aids and so on .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact354	683.602	683.742	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact355	684.458	693.535	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but , uh , he does stuff with auditory models and he 's very interested in directionality , and location , and {disfmarker} and , uh , head models and {pause} microphone things .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact356	693.535	697.295	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	And so , uh , he 's {disfmarker} he and possibly a student , there w
Bmr011.B.dialogueact357	697.415	701.015	B	Professor	s	-1	0	there 's , uh , a student of his who gave a talk here last year ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact358	701.205	706.835	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh , may come here , uh , in the fall for , uh , sort of a five month , uh , sabbatical .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact359	706.965	708.115	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So he might be around .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact360	709.346	710.716	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Get him to give some talks and so on .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact361	710.716	712.986	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But anyway , he might be interested in {pause} this stuff .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact362	711.024	711.524	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact363	712.09	718.108	E	PhD	s^cs^tc	+1	0	That {disfmarker} that reminds me , I had a {disfmarker} a thought of an interesting project that somebody could try to do with {pause} the data from here ,
Bmr011.E.dialogueact364	718.108	724.006	E	PhD	s^cs^e	-1	0	either using , you know , the {disfmarker} the mikes on the table or using signal energies from the head worn mikes ,
Bmr011.D.dialogueact365	721.387	721.667	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact366	724.006	726.436	E	PhD	s^cs^e	+1	1	and that is to try to construct a map of where people were sitting ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact367	726.84	727.05	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact368	726.86	727.36	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact370	727.3	728.1	E	PhD	fh|s.%-	-1	0	uh , based on {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact369	727.16	729.06	H	Grad	s^ng	+1	1	Well Dan {disfmarker} Dan had worked on that . Dan Ellis ,
Bmr011.D.dialogueact371	728.038	728.348	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact372	728.58	728.94	E	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	Oh , did he ?
Bmr011.E.dialogueact374	729.55	730.39	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Oh , that 's interesting .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact373	729.06	729.26	H	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact375	730.37	734.64	H	Grad	s	+1	1	So that {disfmarker} that 's the cross - correlation stuff , was {disfmarker} was doing b beam - forming .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact376	733.111	733.331	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact377	733.57	735.7	E	PhD	s^bu	+1	1	And so you could plot out who was sitting next to who
Bmr011.B.dialogueact379	735.91	736.23	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	A little bit ,
Bmr011.E.dialogueact378	735.7	735.87	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact380	736.23	739.04	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , he didn't do a very extreme thing but just {disfmarker} it was just sort of
Bmr011.D.dialogueact381	736.42	736.71	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr011.D.dialogueact382	736.71	736.77	D	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact383	738.23	738.38	H	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	No ,
Bmr011.H.dialogueact384	738.51	739.45	H	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	he did start on it .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact385	739.868	744.698	B	Professor	s	-1	0	e e given that , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the block of wood with the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the two mikes {comment} on either side ,
Bmr011.H.dialogueact386	742.701	742.971	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact387	745.181	750.801	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	if I 'm speaking , or if you 're speaking , or someone over there is speaking , it {disfmarker} if you look at cross - correlation functions , you end up with a {disfmarker}
Bmr011.D.dialogueact388	747.69	747.93	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact389	751.39	755.74	B	Professor	s	+1	0	if {disfmarker} if someone who was on the axis between the two is talking , then you {disfmarker} you get a big peak there .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact390	755.74	760.67	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And if {disfmarker} if someone 's talking on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on , uh , one side or the other , it goes the other way .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact391	755.743	756.253	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact392	760.67	767.467	B	Professor	s	+1	0	And then , uh , it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it even looks different if th t if the two {disfmarker} two people on either side are talking than if one in the middle .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact393	767.467	768.937	B	Professor	s^r	+1	0	It {disfmarker} it actually looks somewhat different ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact395	768.937	769.227	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact394	768.49	768.78	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact396	769.7	777.47	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Well I was just thinking , you know , as I was sitting here next to Thilo that um , when he 's talking , my mike probably picks it up better than {pause} your guys 's mikes .
Bmr011.C.dialogueact397	771.55	771.64	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact399	777.904	778.264	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact398	777.71	778.7	E	PhD	s^cs.%-	-1	0	So if you just looked at {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact400	778.11	779.26	H	Grad	s^2^bk	-1	0	Oh , that 's another cl cue ,
Bmr011.D.dialogueact403	779.528	779.798	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact402	779.513	784.843	E	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	yeah , {comment} looked at {comment} the energy on my mike and you could get an idea about who 's closest to who .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact401	779.26	779.81	H	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	that 's true .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact404	780.184	780.424	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact405	781.95	782.18	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .

Bmr011.E.dialogueact409	785.516	785.716	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact410	785.98	787.23	H	Grad	s^2^j	-1	0	Or who talks the loudest .
Bmr011.C.dialogueact411	787.354	787.574	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact412	788.18	788.24	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact413	789.61	794.2	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , well you have to {disfmarker} the appropriate normalizations are tricky , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and are probably the key .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact414	792.35	792.53	H	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.C.dialogueact415	792.96	793.09	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact416	795.177	800.177	A	PhD	s^j	-1	0	You just search for Adam 's voice on each individual microphone , you pretty much know where everybody 's sitting .
Bmr011.C.dialogueact417	798.478	798.808	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact418	801.812	804.352	B	Professor	fg|s^ng	-1	0	Yeah . We 've switched positions recently so you can't {disfmarker}

Bmr011.B.dialogueact420	805.626	805.966	B	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	OK .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact421	807.322	808.792	B	Professor	s^t	-1	0	So those are just a little couple of news items .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact422	809.08	809.73	G	Postdoc	qy^rt^t	-1	0	Can I ask one thing ?
Bmr011.G.dialogueact423	809.73	810.62	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	Uh , so , um ,
Bmr011.G.dialogueact424	810.8	814.08	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Jonathan Fiscus expressed an interest in , uh , microphone arrays .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact425	814.34	814.57	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact426	814.78	816.28	G	Postdoc	fh|qy.%--	-1	0	Um , is there {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact427	816.48	819.38	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean {disfmarker} b And I also want to say , his {disfmarker} he can't stay all day .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact428	819.38	824.73	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	He needs to uh , leave for {disfmarker} uh , from here to make a two forty - five flight
Bmr011.H.dialogueact429	824.91	825.73	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , so just morning .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact430	825.82	826.9	G	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	from {disfmarker} from Oakland .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact431	827.3	827.63	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact432	827.54	828.83	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So it makes the scheduling a little bit tight

Bmr011.B.dialogueact440	841.304	847.094	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh , he might be excited to and it might be very appropriate for him to , uh , or he might have no interest whatsoever .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact441	847.094	848.354	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I just really don't know .

Bmr011.H.dialogueact443	848.75	849.84	H	Grad	qy.%--	-1	0	Is he involved in {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact444	849.84	851.91	H	Grad	s	-1	0	Ach ! {comment} I 'm blanking on the name of the project .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact445	852.379	859.472	H	Grad	s	+1	0	NIST has {disfmarker} has done a big meeting room {disfmarker} instrumented meeting room with video and microphone arrays , and very elaborate software .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact446	859.472	860.942	H	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Is {disfmarker} is he the one working on that ?
Bmr011.B.dialogueact447	860.115	861.125	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	Well that 's what they 're starting up .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact448	861.74	861.93	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact449	862.58	866.14	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah . No , I mean , that 's what all this is about . They {disfmarker} they haven't done it yet .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact451	867.4	868.41	B	Professor	s^e	+1	0	They wanted to do it {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact450	867.03	867.28	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact452	867.46	870.41	H	Grad	s	-1	0	I had read some papers that looked like they had already done some work .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact453	870.75	873.18	B	Professor	s	+1	0	Uh , well I think they 've instrumented a room
Bmr011.B.dialogueact454	873.63	876.72	B	Professor	s	+1	0	but I don't {pause} think they {disfmarker} they haven't started recordings yet .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact455	876.72	879.09	B	Professor	s	-1	0	They don't have the t the transcription standards .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact457	879.09	879.72	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	They don't have the {disfmarker}
Bmr011.E.dialogueact456	879.03	880.08	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Are they going to do video as well ?
Bmr011.H.dialogueact458	879.477	879.767	H	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact459	880.446	880.746	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact461	881.47	881.8	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	I think .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact460	881.041	881.571	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact462	882.51	883.14	B	Professor	s^am^r	-1	0	I think they are .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact463	882.655	889.04	H	Grad	s	-1	0	Oh , cuz what {disfmarker} what I had read was , uh , they had a uh very large amount of software infrastructure for coordinating all this ,
Bmr011.H.dialogueact464	889.12	897.095	H	Grad	s^e	-1	0	both in terms of recording and also live room where you 're interacting {disfmarker} the participants are interacting with the computer , and with the video , and lots of other stuff .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact465	897.351	898.661	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	Well , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm not sure .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact466	898.067	898.317	H	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact467	898.661	904.881	B	Professor	s	+1	0	All {disfmarker} all I know is that they 've been talking to me about a project that they 're going to start up recording people meet in meetings .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact468	902.412	903.332	H	Grad	fg	-1	0	OK . Well {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact469	905.351	907.411	B	Professor	s	+1	1	And , uh , it is related to ours .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact470	907.411	908.401	B	Professor	s	+1	1	They were interested in ours .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact471	908.401	912.571	B	Professor	s	+1	0	They wanted to get some uniformity with us , uh , about the transcriptions and so on .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact472	910.49	910.72	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Alright .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact473	913.272	915.542	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And one {disfmarker} one notable difference {disfmarker} u u
Bmr011.B.dialogueact474	915.542	919.202	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	actually I can't remember whether they were going to routinely collect video or not ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact475	919.262	925.744	B	Professor	s	+1	0	but one {disfmarker} one , uh , difference from the audio side was that they are interested in using array mikes .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact476	926.24	928.94	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	So , um , I mean , I 'll just tell you the party line on that .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact477	928.94	938.775	B	Professor	s^df	+1	0	The reason I didn't go for that here was because , uh , the focus , uh , both of my interest and of Adam 's interest was uh , in impromptu situations .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact478	938.895	939.265	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	And
Bmr011.B.dialogueact479	940.25	942.29	B	Professor	s	+1	0	we 're not recording a bunch of impromptu situations
Bmr011.B.dialogueact480	942.29	946.437	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but that 's because it 's different to get data for research than to actually apply it .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact481	945.633	945.843	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact482	946.437	950.317	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	And so , uh , for scientific reasons we thought it was good to instrument this room as we wanted it .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact483	950.967	963.534	B	Professor	s	+1	0	But the thing we ultimately wanted to aim at was a situation where you were talking with , uh , one or more other people i uh , in {disfmarker} in an p impromptu way , where you didn't {disfmarker} didn't actually know what the situation was going to be .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact484	963.804	970.044	B	Professor	s	+1	0	And therefore it would not {disfmarker} it 'd be highly unlikely that room would be outfitted with {disfmarker} with some very carefully designed array of microphones .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact485	970.695	974.515	B	Professor	fh|s^df	-1	0	Um , so it was only for that reason . It was just , you know , yet another piece of research
Bmr011.B.dialogueact486	974.515	976.685	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	and it seemed like we had enough troubles just {disfmarker}
Bmr011.E.dialogueact487	976.0	979.09	E	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	So there 's no like portable array of mikes ?
Bmr011.B.dialogueact488	979.2	985.81	B	Professor	s^ar|s^ng	-1	0	No . So there 's {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} uh , there 's a whole range of things {disfmarker} there 's a whole array of things , {vocalsound} that people do on this .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact489	979.508	979.878	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact490	985.81	986.72	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So , um ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact491	987.39	990.19	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	the , uh {disfmarker} the big arrays ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact492	990.29	995.73	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	uh , places , uh , like uh , Rutgers , and Brown , and other {disfmarker} other places ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact493	996.309	1000.259	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh , they have , uh , big arrays with , I don't know , a hundred {disfmarker} hundred mikes or something .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact494	997.722	998.282	H	Grad	s.%	-1	0	Xerox .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact495	1000.74	1002.65	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And so there 's a wall of mikes .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact496	1002.81	1006.41	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And you get really , really good beam - forming {comment} with that sort of thing .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact497	1002.9	1003.17	E	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	Wow .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact498	1007.0	1008.82	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And it 's {disfmarker} and , um ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact499	1009.27	1016.85	B	Professor	s	-1	0	in fact at one point we had a {disfmarker} a proposal in with Rutgers where we were gonna do some of the sort of per channel signal - processing
Bmr011.B.dialogueact500	1016.85	1018.64	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and they were gonna do the multi - channel stuff ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact501	1018.71	1020.66	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but {pause} it d it d we ended up not doing it .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact502	1020.66	1020.82	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr011.E.dialogueact503	1020.95	1025.37	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I 've seen demonstrations of the microphone arrays . It 's amazing how {disfmarker} how they can cut out noise .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact504	1023.72	1026.3	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Yeah , it 's r It 's really neat stuff .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact505	1025.38	1026.78	H	Grad	s	-1	0	And then they have little ones too
Bmr011.B.dialogueact506	1026.59	1027.78	B	Professor	s^aa^m	-1	0	And then they had the little ones , yeah .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact507	1026.78	1029.79	H	Grad	s	-1	0	but I mean {disfmarker} but they don't have our block of wood ,
Bmr011.H.dialogueact508	1029.79	1030.16	H	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr011.B.dialogueact509	1030.34	1031.55	B	Professor	s^aa|s^j	-1	0	Yeah , our block of wood is unique .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact510	1030.81	1031.05	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact511	1031.55	1033.58	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	But the {vocalsound} But the
Bmr011.B.dialogueact512	1034.02	1037.26	B	Professor	s	-1	0	No , there are these commercial things now you can buy that have four mikes or something
Bmr011.A.dialogueact513	1036.96	1037.41	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact514	1037.26	1038.73	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and , uh ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact515	1039.97	1040.55	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact516	1042.74	1045.31	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So , yeah , there 's {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's a range of things that people do .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact517	1045.28	1045.68	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Huh .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact518	1045.82	1050.86	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um , so if we connected up with somebody who was interested in doing that sort of thing that 's {disfmarker} that 's a good thing to do .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact519	1050.86	1057.47	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , whenever I 've described this to other people who are interested on the {disfmarker} with the acoustic side that 's invariably the question they ask .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact520	1057.47	1062.58	B	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	Just like someone who is interested in the general dialogue thing will always ask {vocalsound} " um , are you recording video ? "
Bmr011.A.dialogueact522	1063.62	1063.96	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact521	1063.29	1063.89	B	Professor	fh|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Um , right ?
Bmr011.A.dialogueact524	1064.25	1064.5	A	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	right .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact523	1064.07	1068.49	B	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and the acoustic people will always say , " well are you doing , uh , uh , array microphones ? "
Bmr011.B.dialogueact525	1068.49	1078.42	B	Professor	s	+1	0	So it 's {disfmarker} it 's a good thing to do , but it doesn't solve the problem of how do you solve things when there 's one mike or at best two mikes in {disfmarker} in this imagined PDA that we have .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact526	1079.15	1080.76	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	So maybe {disfmarker} maybe we 'll do some more of it .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact527	1080.74	1082.45	G	Postdoc	s^cs.%--	-1	0	Well one thing I {disfmarker} I mean , I don't know .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact528	1082.65	1087.79	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean , I know that having an array of {disfmarker} I mean , I would imagine it would be more expensive to have a {disfmarker} an array of microphones .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact529	1087.79	1095.23	G	Postdoc	qy^cs^rt	-1	0	But couldn't you kind of approximate the natural sis situation by just shutting off uh , channels when you 're {disfmarker} later on ?
Bmr011.G.dialogueact530	1095.23	1103.72	G	Postdoc	qy^cs^rt	-1	0	I mean , it seems like if the microphones don't effect each other then couldn't you just , you know , record them with an array and then just not use all the data ?
Bmr011.H.dialogueact531	1103.33	1108.39	H	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} it 's just a lot of infrastructure that for our particular purpose we felt we didn't need to set up .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact532	1105.64	1105.97	G	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact534	1106.64	1107.03	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact533	1106.15	1106.29	G	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Fine .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact536	1108.57	1112.52	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Yeah , if ninety - nine percent of what you 're doing is c is shutting off most of the mikes , then going through the {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact535	1108.08	1108.36	G	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact537	1113.48	1117.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But if you get somebody who 's {disfmarker} who {disfmarker} who has that as a primary interest then that put {disfmarker} then that drives it in that direction .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact538	1116.73	1119.56	H	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's right , I mean if someone {disfmarker} if someone came in and said we really want to do it ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact539	1117.52	1117.9	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact540	1120.15	1120.92	H	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , we don't care .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact541	1120.92	1121.39	H	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	That would be fine ,
Bmr011.E.dialogueact542	1121.68	1126.3	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	So to save that data you {disfmarker} You have to have one channel recording per mike in the array ?
Bmr011.H.dialogueact543	1122.3	1123.16	H	Grad	s	-1	0	Buy more disk space .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact545	1127.21	1129.77	B	Professor	h|s^aap	-1	0	Well , uh , at some level {disfmarker} at some level .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact544	1127.13	1127.37	E	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	Is that {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact546	1127.83	1128.83	H	Grad	s	-1	0	I usually do a mix .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact547	1129.77	1131.55	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	But then , you know , there 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker}
Bmr011.E.dialogueact548	1131.33	1133.75	E	PhD	s^e	-1	0	What you save , I mean , if you 're going to do research with it . yeah
Bmr011.B.dialogueact549	1134.71	1135.21	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	There 's {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact550	1135.75	1138.37	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I don't know what they 're going to do and I don't know how big their array is .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact551	1138.37	1143.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Obviously if you were gonna save all of those channels for later research you 'd use up a lot of space .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact552	1142.85	1143.28	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact555	1143.52	1143.98	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	And , th
Bmr011.E.dialogueact554	1143.48	1143.67	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact553	1143.47	1150.51	H	Grad	s	-1	0	Well their software infrastructure had a very elaborate design for plugging in filters , and mixers , and all sorts of processing .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact556	1151.12	1154.88	H	Grad	s	-1	0	So that they can do stuff in real time and not save out each channel individually .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact557	1154.6	1154.95	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact559	1155.99	1156.24	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact558	1155.53	1156.09	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact560	1156.21	1156.81	H	Grad	%--	-1	0	So it was , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr011.D.dialogueact561	1156.75	1156.96	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact562	1157.46	1162.92	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	But I mean , uh , for optimum flexibility later you 'd want to save each channel .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact563	1162.92	1172.65	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	But I think in practical situations you would have some engine of some sort doing some processing to reduce this to some {disfmarker} to the equivalent of a single microphone that was very directional .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact564	1173.82	1175.11	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Uh , oh , OK , I see .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact565	1174.97	1175.26	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr011.A.dialogueact567	1175.99	1176.45	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , it seems {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact566	1175.87	1176.06	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr011.E.dialogueact568	1176.02	1177.59	E	PhD	s^bs	-1	0	Sort of saving the result of the beam - forming .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact569	1177.14	1177.42	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact570	1178.02	1183.64	A	PhD	s	+1	0	it seems to me that there 's {disfmarker} you know , there are good political reasons for {disfmarker} for doing this ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact571	1183.79	1184.67	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	just getting the data ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact572	1184.67	1186.73	A	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	because there 's a number of sites {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact573	1186.73	1193.63	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	like right now SRI is probably gonna invest a lot of internal funding into recording meetings also , which is good ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact574	1194.34	1196.77	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um , but they 'll be recording with video
Bmr011.A.dialogueact575	1196.87	1197.42	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and they 'll be {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact576	1197.95	1203.89	A	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	You know , it 'd be nice if we can have at least , uh , make use of the data that we 're recording as we go
Bmr011.A.dialogueact577	1203.89	1208.25	A	PhD	s^df	+1	0	since it 's sort of {disfmarker} this is the first site that has really collected these really impromptu meetings ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact578	1208.81	1211.59	A	PhD	s	+1	0	um , and just have this other information available .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact579	1211.68	1216.65	A	PhD	s^cs.%--	+1	0	So , if we can get the investment in just for the infra infrastructure
Bmr011.A.dialogueact580	1216.65	1217.14	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	and then ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact581	1217.87	1218.26	A	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	I don't know ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact582	1218.26	1218.86	A	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	save it out
Bmr011.A.dialogueact583	1218.86	1220.49	A	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	or have whoever 's interested
Bmr011.A.dialogueact584	1220.89	1221.98	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	save that data out ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact585	1221.98	1222.82	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	transfer it there ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact586	1223.34	1227.4	A	PhD	s	+1	0	it 'd be g it 'd be good to have {disfmarker} have the recording . I think .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact587	1226.63	1229.94	H	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	+1	0	You mean to {disfmarker} to actually get a microphone array and do that ?
Bmr011.A.dialogueact588	1229.59	1229.9	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	Well , if {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact590	1231.11	1231.99	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	Even if we 're not {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact589	1230.82	1231.91	H	Grad	qy^d^g.%--	-1	0	And video and {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact591	1232.45	1233.52	A	PhD	s^no^rt	-1	0	I 'm not sure about video .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact592	1233.52	1236.43	A	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	That 's sort of an {disfmarker} video has a little different nature since
Bmr011.A.dialogueact593	1236.87	1239.74	A	PhD	s	-1	0	right n right now we 're all being recorded but we 're not being taped .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact594	1240.33	1246.15	A	PhD	s.%-	+1	0	Um , but it {disfmarker} definitely in the case of microphone arrays , since if there was a community interested in this , then {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact595	1245.6	1249.54	H	Grad	fg|s^cs^ng	-1	0	Well , but I think we need a researcher here who 's interested in it . To push it along .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact596	1249.88	1261.33	B	Professor	s	-1	0	See the problem is it {disfmarker} it took , uh , uh , it took at least six months for Dan to get together the hardware and the software , and debug stuff in {disfmarker} in the microphones , and in the boxes .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact597	1261.33	1262.61	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	And it was a really big deal .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact598	1263.18	1268.04	B	Professor	s	+1	0	And so I think we could get a microphone array in here pretty easily
Bmr011.B.dialogueact599	1268.52	1272.55	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and , uh , have it mixed to {disfmarker} to one channel of some sort .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact600	1272.12	1272.46	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact601	1273.32	1274.99	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	But , e I think for
Bmr011.B.dialogueact602	1276.45	1278.2	B	Professor	qw.%--	-1	0	I mean , how we 're gonna decide {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact603	1280.13	1289.11	B	Professor	s	+1	0	For {disfmarker} for maximum flexibility later you really don't want to end up with just one channel that 's pointed in the direction of the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the p the person with the maximum energy or something like that .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact604	1289.11	1295.39	B	Professor	s^cs.%--	+1	0	I mean , you {disfmarker} you want actually to {disfmarker} you want actually to have multiple channels being recorded so that you can {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact605	1296.08	1300.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And to do that , it {disfmarker} we 're going to end up greatly increasing the disk space that we use up ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact606	1300.87	1304.7	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we also only have boards that will take up to sixteen channels
Bmr011.B.dialogueact607	1304.7	1308.37	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and in {pause} this meeting , we 've got eight people and {disfmarker} and six mikes .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact608	1308.37	1309.74	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	And there we 're already using fourteen .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact609	1309.95	1311.13	H	Grad	s^bc	-1	0	And we actually only have fifteen .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact611	1311.44	1311.64	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	E
Bmr011.H.dialogueact610	1311.25	1311.95	H	Grad	%--	-1	0	One of them 's {disfmarker}
Bmr011.D.dialogueact612	1312.85	1312.99	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact613	1313.09	1313.61	H	Grad	s	-1	0	Details .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact615	1313.67	1314.01	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact616	1314.07	1314.33	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact614	1313.61	1314.99	H	Grad	s	-1	0	But fifteen , not sixteen .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact618	1315.75	1319.59	A	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	Well if there 's a way to say time {disfmarker} to sort of solve each of these f those {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact617	1315.47	1315.82	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact619	1320.23	1325.91	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So suppose you can get an array in because there 's some person at Berkeley who 's interested and has some {pause} equipment ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact620	1326.34	1333.55	A	PhD	s	-1	0	uh , and suppose we can {disfmarker} as we save it we can , you know , transfer it off to some other place that {disfmarker} that holds this {disfmarker} this data ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact621	1333.79	1334.51	A	PhD	s	-1	0	who 's interested ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact622	1334.51	1337.08	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and even if ICSI it itself isn't .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact623	1337.79	1343.75	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Um , and it {disfmarker} it seems like as long as we can time align the beginning , do we need to mix it with the rest ?
Bmr011.A.dialogueact624	1343.75	1344.35	A	PhD	s^no^rt	-1	0	I don't know .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact625	1345.21	1346.2	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	You know ? The
Bmr011.B.dialogueact626	1345.24	1347.6	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah . So I think you 'd need a separate {disfmarker} a separate set up
Bmr011.A.dialogueact627	1346.19	1346.72	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact629	1347.76	1348.34	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact628	1347.6	1349.73	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and the assumption that you could time align the two .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact631	1350.26	1352.8	A	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	I mean it 's just {disfmarker} it 's worth considering as sort of
Bmr011.H.dialogueact630	1350.2	1351.43	H	Grad	s	-1	0	And y it 'd certainly gets skew .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact632	1353.53	1361.91	A	PhD	s	-1	0	once you make the up front investment {comment} and can sort of save it out each time , and {disfmarker} and not have to worry about the disk space factor , then it mi it might be worth having the data .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact633	1361.87	1363.45	B	Professor	s^nd	+1	0	I 'm not so much worried about disk space actually .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact634	1363.45	1365.15	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mentioned that , b as a practical matter ,
Bmr011.H.dialogueact635	1363.67	1363.85	H	Grad	%-	-1	0	Just {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact636	1365.15	1372.07	B	Professor	s	+1	0	but the real issue is that , uh , there is no way to do a recording extended to what we have now with low skew .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact637	1373.43	1375.96	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So {pause} you would have a t completely separate set up ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact639	1376.75	1377.0	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact638	1376.4	1380.42	B	Professor	s	-1	0	which would mean that the sampling times and so forth would be all over the place compared to this .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact640	1380.85	1384.13	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So it would depend on the level of pr processing you were doing later ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact641	1384.45	1389.12	B	Professor	s	+1	1	but if you 're d i the kind of person who 's doing array processing you actually care about funny little times .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact642	1389.73	1394.45	B	Professor	s^rt	+1	1	And {disfmarker} and so you actually wou would want to have a completely different set up than we have ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact643	1390.42	1390.87	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact644	1394.45	1396.49	B	Professor	s	+1	0	one that would go up to thirty - two channels or something .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact645	1396.84	1397.27	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact646	1397.15	1397.91	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	So basically {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact647	1397.42	1398.4	H	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	Or a hundred thirty - two .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact648	1398.49	1398.83	B	Professor	s^aa^m.%--	-1	0	or a hun
Bmr011.B.dialogueact649	1398.83	1399.28	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact650	1399.28	1401.3	B	Professor	s	+1	0	So , I 'm kinda skeptical ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact651	1401.75	1403.15	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but um I think that {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact652	1403.01	1403.26	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact653	1404.01	1406.63	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	So , uh , I don't think we can share the resource in that way .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact654	1406.63	1412.31	B	Professor	s	+1	0	But what we could do is if there was someone else who 's interested they could have a separate set up which they wouldn't be trying to synch with ours
Bmr011.B.dialogueact655	1412.83	1414.54	B	Professor	s	+1	0	which might be useful for {disfmarker} for them .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact656	1414.16	1417.32	A	PhD	s^bk|s^aap	-1	0	Right , I mean at least they 'd have the data and the transcripts ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact657	1415.07	1416.7	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	And then we can offer up the room ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact658	1417.35	1417.6	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact660	1417.86	1418.29	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact659	1417.48	1420.11	B	Professor	s^aa|s	+1	0	Yeah , we can o offer the meetings , and the physical space ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact661	1420.11	1422.37	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} yeah , the transcripts , and so on .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact662	1421.04	1421.26	A	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact663	1422.12	1426.59	A	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Right , I mean , just {disfmarker} it 'd be nice if we have more information on the same data .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact664	1426.59	1427.0	A	PhD	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	You know ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact666	1427.49	1427.78	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact665	1427.44	1427.66	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact667	1427.98	1432.05	A	PhD	s	-1	0	But it 's {disfmarker} if it 's impossible or if it 's a lot of effort then you have to just balance the two ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact668	1432.57	1432.91	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Well I thi
Bmr011.A.dialogueact670	1433.24	1433.35	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact669	1432.91	1438.92	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	yeah , the thing will be , u u in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} again , in talking to these other people to see what {disfmarker} you know , what {disfmarker} what we can do .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact671	1439.33	1439.52	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact672	1439.43	1439.9	B	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	Uh , we 'll see .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact673	1439.63	1442.44	E	PhD	qy^rt	+1	1	Is there an interest in getting video recordings for these meetings ?
Bmr011.E.dialogueact674	1443.0	1443.0	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	
Bmr011.B.dialogueact676	1443.77	1444.65	B	Professor	fg|%-	-1	0	Right , so we have {disfmarker} we {disfmarker}
Bmr011.E.dialogueact675	1443.3	1443.51	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I mean
Bmr011.H.dialogueact677	1444.19	1446.83	H	Grad	s^aa|s	+1	1	Yes , absolutely . But it 's exactly the same problem ,
Bmr011.H.dialogueact678	1447.99	1450.11	H	Grad	s	+1	1	that you have an infrastructure problem ,
Bmr011.H.dialogueact679	1450.11	1452.53	H	Grad	s	+1	0	you have a problem with people not wanting to be video taped ,
Bmr011.H.dialogueact680	1452.53	1456.98	H	Grad	s	+1	0	and you have the problem that no one who 's currently involved in the project is really hot to do it .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact681	1453.14	1453.47	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact682	1458.0	1459.73	E	PhD	s^bs.%-	+1	0	So there 's not enough interest to overcome all of {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact683	1459.07	1459.56	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact684	1459.58	1460.45	A	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	Right . Internally ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact685	1460.45	1467.24	A	PhD	s	+1	0	but I know there is interest from other places that are interested in looking at meeting data and having the video .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact686	1467.39	1467.97	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So it 's just {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact687	1468.34	1474.4	G	Postdoc	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , w although I {disfmarker} m {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I have to u u mention the human subjects problems , {pause} that i increase with video .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact688	1475.01	1475.91	A	PhD	s^bk|s^na	-1	0	Right , that 's true .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact689	1476.18	1479.75	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , so it 's , uh , people {disfmarker} people getting shy about it .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact690	1477.68	1477.93	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact691	1479.75	1481.26	B	Professor	s	+1	0	There 's this human subjects problem .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact692	1481.63	1483.89	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	There 's the fact that then um , if {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact693	1483.98	1485.86	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i I I 've heard comments about this before ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact694	1485.86	1487.42	B	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	" why don't you just put on a video camera ? "
Bmr011.B.dialogueact695	1487.42	1492.9	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But you know , it 's sort of like saying , " uh , well we 're primarily interested in {disfmarker} in some dialogue things ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact696	1493.47	1496.45	B	Professor	qo^df	-1	0	uh , but , uh , why don't we just throw a microphone out there . "

Bmr011.B.dialogueact751	1551.72	1551.95	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact752	1552.8	1554.26	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Uh , transcriptions .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact753	1554.19	1554.88	G	Postdoc	s^bk^m	-1	0	Transcriptions , OK .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact754	1555.24	1559.24	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Um , I thought about {disfmarker} there are maybe three aspects of this .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact755	1559.24	1562.68	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	So first of all , um , I 've got eight transcribers .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact756	1563.19	1564.83	G	Postdoc	s^rt	+1	0	Uh , seven of them are linguists .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact757	1565.51	1567.98	G	Postdoc	s^rt	+1	0	One of them is a graduate student in psychology .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact758	1568.4	1571.33	G	Postdoc	s^rt	-1	0	Um , Each {disfmarker} I gave each of them , uh , their own data set .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact759	1571.66	1573.65	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Two of them have already finished the data sets .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact760	1574.17	1578.64	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And {pause} the meetings run , you know , let 's say an hour . Sometimes as man much as an hour and a half .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact761	1577.26	1578.18	E	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	How big is the data set ?
Bmr011.G.dialogueact762	1579.07	1580.38	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Oh , it 's {disfmarker} what I mean is one meeting .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact764	1580.69	1581.37	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Ah , OK .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact763	1580.55	1581.92	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Each {disfmarker} each person got their own meeting .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact765	1581.92	1586.36	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I didn't want to have any conflicts of , you know , of {disfmarker} of when to stop transcribing this one
Bmr011.G.dialogueact766	1586.36	1586.57	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	or {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact767	1586.63	1589.27	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So I wanted to keep it clear whose data were whose ,
Bmr011.G.dialogueact768	1589.27	1590.82	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and so {disfmarker}
Bmr011.E.dialogueact769	1590.31	1590.54	E	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact770	1591.29	1596.96	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	And , uh , meetings , you know , I think that they 're {disfmarker} they go as long as a {disfmarker} almost two hours in some {disfmarker} in some cases .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact771	1596.95	1598.12	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	So , you know , that means {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact772	1598.44	1601.18	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	you know , if we 've got two already finished and they 're working on {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact773	1601.79	1609.66	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Uh , right now all eight of them have differe uh , uh , additional data sets . That means potentially as many as ten might be finished by the end of the month .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact775	1610.26	1610.55	E	PhD	s^ba^fe	-1	0	Wow .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact774	1610.19	1610.69	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Hope so .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact776	1610.92	1613.13	G	Postdoc	s	+1	1	But the pre - segmentation really helps a huge amount .
Bmr011.C.dialogueact777	1612.87	1613.09	C	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact778	1613.47	1622.6	G	Postdoc	s	+1	2	And , uh , also Dan Ellis 's innovation of the , uh {disfmarker} the multi - channel to here really helped a r a lot in terms of clearing {disfmarker} clearing up h hearings that involve overlaps .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact779	1623.09	1623.6	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	But , um ,
Bmr011.G.dialogueact780	1623.99	1628.82	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	just out of curiosity I asked one of them how long {pause} it was taking her , one of these two who has already finished her data set .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact781	1628.82	1633.44	G	Postdoc	s	+1	1	She said it takes about , uh , sixty minutes transcription for every five minutes of real time .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact782	1633.44	1634.53	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So it 's about twelve to one ,
Bmr011.G.dialogueact783	1634.53	1635.43	G	Postdoc	s^e	+1	1	which is what we were thinking .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact784	1635.01	1635.13	H	Grad	%--	-1	0	or
Bmr011.H.dialogueact785	1635.13	1635.38	H	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact786	1635.73	1636.47	G	Postdoc	s	+1	1	It 's well in the range .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact787	1635.93	1636.47	H	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	It 's pretty good .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact788	1637.24	1643.4	G	Postdoc	s^bk|s	-1	0	OK . Uh , these still , when they 're finished , um , that means that they 're finished with their pass through . They still need to be edited and all
Bmr011.G.dialogueact789	1643.4	1646.23	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	but {disfmarker} But it 's word level , speaker change , the things that were mentioned .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact790	1646.61	1651.32	G	Postdoc	s^t^tc	+1	0	OK , now I wanted to mention the , um , teleconference I had with , uh , Jonathan Fiscus .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact791	1651.76	1653.02	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	We spoke for an hour and a half
Bmr011.G.dialogueact793	1653.83	1655.96	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and , um , had an awful lot of things in common .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact792	1653.42	1653.72	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact794	1656.45	1661.96	G	Postdoc	s.%--	+1	0	He , um , um , he in indicated to me that they 've {disfmarker} that he 's been ,
Bmr011.G.dialogueact795	1662.28	1665.3	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	uh , looking , uh , uh , spending a lot of time with {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact796	1665.3	1666.53	G	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	I 'm not quite sure the connection ,
Bmr011.G.dialogueact797	1666.59	1668.44	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	but spending a lot of time with the ATLAS system .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact798	1668.99	1672.55	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And I guess that {disfmarker} I mean , I {disfmarker} I need to read up on that .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact799	1672.55	1674.41	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And there 's a web site that has lots of papers .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact800	1674.41	1682.42	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	But it looks to me like that 's the name that has developed for the system that Bird and Liberman developed {comment} for the annotated {pause} graphs approach .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact801	1679.95	1680.29	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact802	1682.61	1684.15	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	So what he wants me to do
Bmr011.G.dialogueact803	1684.15	1690.08	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and what we {disfmarker} what we will do and {disfmarker} uh , is to provide them with the u already transcribed meeting
Bmr011.G.dialogueact804	1690.53	1694.28	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	for him to be able to experiment with in this ATLAS System .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact805	1694.28	1695.53	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And they do have some sort of software ,
Bmr011.G.dialogueact806	1695.53	1697.43	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	at least that 's my impression , related to ATLAS
Bmr011.G.dialogueact807	1697.43	1699.91	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and that he wants to experiment with taking our data
Bmr011.G.dialogueact808	1699.91	1702.38	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and putting them in that format , and see how that works out .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact809	1702.74	1711.57	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I explained to him in {disfmarker} in detail the , uh , conventions that we 're using here in this {disfmarker} in this word level transcript .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact810	1711.98	1712.7	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	And , um ,
Bmr011.G.dialogueact811	1713.94	1717.87	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know , I {disfmarker} I explained , you know , the reasons that {disfmarker} that we were not coding more elaborately
Bmr011.G.dialogueact812	1717.87	1720.32	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and the focus on reliability .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact813	1720.57	1722.87	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	He expressed a lot of interest in reliability .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact814	1722.87	1724.48	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	It 's like he 's {disfmarker} he 's really up on these things .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact815	1724.48	1725.34	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	He 's {disfmarker} he 's very {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact816	1725.89	1728.17	G	Postdoc	s:qw	-1	0	Um , independently he asked , " well what about reliability ? "
Bmr011.G.dialogueact817	1728.17	1732.07	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So , {vocalsound} he 's interested in the consistency of the encoding and that sort of thing .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact818	1732.57	1733.37	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	OK , um {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact819	1734.77	1735.04	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Sorry ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact820	1735.04	1736.4	A	PhD	qy^rt.%--	-1	0	can you explain what the ATLAS {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact821	1736.81	1739.47	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	I 'm not familiar with this ATLAS system .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact822	1737.88	1740.33	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	Well , you know , at this point I think {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact823	1741.15	1744.25	G	Postdoc	s^bd^df	-1	0	Uh , well Adam 's read more {disfmarker} in more detail than I have on this .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact824	1744.25	1745.86	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I need to acquaint myself more with it .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact825	1745.86	1748.67	G	Postdoc	fh|s.%--	-1	0	But , um , there {disfmarker} there is a way of viewing {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact826	1748.99	1761.65	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Uh , whenever you have coding categories , um , and you 're dealing with uh , a taxonomy , then you can have branches that {disfmarker} that have alternative , uh , choices that you could use for each {disfmarker} each of them .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact827	1761.91	1764.36	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And it just ends up looking like a graphical representation .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact828	1761.93	1762.58	H	Grad	qy.%-	-1	0	Is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact829	1764.34	1768.61	H	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Is ATLAS the {disfmarker} his annotated transcription graph stuff ?
Bmr011.H.dialogueact830	1769.39	1770.49	H	Grad	s^no.x	-1	0	I don't remember the acronym .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact831	1770.66	1777.22	H	Grad	s.x	+1	0	The {disfmarker} the one {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} what I think you 're referring to , they {disfmarker} they have this concept of an an annotated transcription graph representation .

Bmr011.G.dialogueact862	1844.45	1851.76	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	And what he said was that , um , what they 'll be providing is {disfmarker} will not be as fine grained in terms of the time information .

Bmr011.H.dialogueact884	1892.34	1893.61	H	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	Well they {disfmarker} they do send it out
Bmr011.H.dialogueact885	1893.61	1898.62	H	Grad	s^e	-1	0	but my understanding is that that 's all this company does is transcriptions for IBM for their speech product .

Bmr011.G.dialogueact900	1913.81	1918.33	G	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	uh , cuz , you know , I mean , we wanted to have it so that they were in familiar f terms with what they wanted to do .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact901	1918.81	1921.36	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	He downloaded {pause} from the CD onto audio tapes .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact902	1921.36	1923.9	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	And apparently he did it one channel per audio tape .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact903	1923.9	1927.19	G	Postdoc	s	+1	1	So each of these people is {pause} transcribing from one channel .

Bmr011.G.dialogueact907	1930.49	1932.92	G	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	a before they go be beyond the first one .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact908	1933.15	1935.26	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Check it and , you know , adjust it , and all that .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact909	1934.62	1936.93	E	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	So each person gets one of these channels {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact910	1936.76	1937.0	H	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact912	1937.84	1941.53	B	Professor	s^bu.%--	-1	0	So if they hear something off in the distance they don't {disfmarker} they just go {disfmarker}

Bmr011.G.dialogueact1014	2091.58	2091.8	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1015	2095.22	2097.22	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	It 's very {disfmarker} a real benefit having Brian involved
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1016	2097.27	2102.35	G	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because of his knowledge of what the {disfmarker} how the data need to be used and so what 's useful to have in the format .

Bmr011.H.dialogueact1020	2102.14	2108.9	H	Grad	fg|qy^rt	+1	0	So , um , Liz , with {disfmarker} with the SRI recognizer , {comment} can it make use of some time marks ?
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1021	2109.44	2111.94	A	PhD	h|s.%-	-1	0	OK , so this is a , um ,
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1022	2109.68	2111.48	H	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I guess I don't know what that means .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1023	2112.26	2117.96	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and actually I should say this is what Don has b uh , he 's already been really helpful in , uh , chopping up these {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1024	2118.64	2120.25	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so first of all you {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1025	2120.62	2127.77	A	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	um , I mean , for the SRI front - end , we really need to chop things up into pieces that are f not too huge .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1026	2128.31	2135.72	A	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	Um , but second of all , uh {disfmarker} in general because some of these channels ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1027	2135.78	2140.69	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I 'd say , like , I don't know , at least half of them probably {comment} on average are g are ha are {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1028	2141.01	2141.91	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	have a lot of cross - ta
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1029	2141.95	2144.2	A	PhD	s^bsc	+1	0	sorry , some of the segments have a lot of cross - talk .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1030	2144.86	2150.44	A	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	Um , it 's good to get sort of short segments if you 're gonna do recognition ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1031	2150.44	2151.78	A	PhD	s^e	+1	0	especially forced alignment .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1032	2151.94	2152.25	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1033	2153.14	2159.14	A	PhD	s	-1	0	uh , Don has been taking a first stab actually using Jane 's first {disfmarker} the fir the meeting that Jane transcribed
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1034	2159.14	2161.05	A	PhD	s	-1	0	which we did have some problems with ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1035	2161.05	2164.09	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and Thilo , uh , I think told me why this was ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1036	2164.09	2166.84	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	but that people were switching microphones around {comment} in the very beginning ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1037	2166.92	2167.2	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1038	2167.68	2168.64	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	the SRI re
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1039	2167.77	2171.25	C	PhD	s^ar|s^ng	-1	0	No , th Yeah . No . They {disfmarker} they were not switching them but what they were {disfmarker} they were adjusting them ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1040	2168.64	2168.96	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	and they {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1041	2169.48	2169.88	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	They were not {disfmarker}
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1044	2171.33	2171.72	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	so .
Bmr011.F.dialogueact1042	2170.84	2171.23	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1043	2171.14	2172.09	H	Grad	s^m	-1	0	Adjusting . Oh .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1045	2172.01	2172.62	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1046	2172.24	2174.55	C	PhD	s	-1	0	And aft after a minute or so it 's {disfmarker} it 's way better .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1048	2175.15	2180.35	A	PhD	fg|s	+1	0	So we have to sort of normalize {comment} the front - end and so forth , and have these small segments .
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1047	2175.01	2175.19	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1049	2178.75	2178.91	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1050	2180.35	2188.83	A	PhD	s	+1	0	So we 've taken that and chopped it into pieces based always on your {disfmarker} your , um , cuts that you made on the mixed signal .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1051	2189.62	2192.87	A	PhD	s	+1	0	And so that every {disfmarker} every speaker has the same cuts .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1052	2192.87	2194.62	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And if they have speech in it we run it through .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1053	2194.62	2196.27	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And if they don't have speech in it we don't run it through .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1054	2196.27	2199.84	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And we base that knowledge on the transcription .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1055	2197.93	2198.88	H	Grad	s^2	-1	0	On {disfmarker} Just on the marks .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1056	2199.65	2199.9	H	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1057	2200.53	2203.2	A	PhD	fh|s.%--	+1	0	Um , the problem is if we have no time marks ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1058	2204.18	2209.86	A	PhD	s	+1	1	then for forced alignment we actually don't know where {disfmarker} you know , in the signal the transcriber heard that word .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1059	2209.86	2210.55	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	And so {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1060	2210.65	2211.06	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , I see ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1062	2211.37	2217.36	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , if {disfmarker} if it 's a whole conversation and we get a long , uh , you know , par paragraph of {disfmarker} of talk ,
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1061	2211.06	2211.77	H	Grad	s^bs	-1	0	it 's for the length .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1063	2211.77	2212.1	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1064	2217.36	2218.85	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	uh , I don't know how they do this .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1065	2219.47	2222.2	A	PhD	fh|s^no	-1	0	Um , we actually don't know which piece goes where .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1066	2221.75	2222.26	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	I understand .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1067	2222.7	2224.47	A	PhD	fh|s.%-	-1	0	And , um , I think with {disfmarker}
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1068	2224.12	2226.62	E	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	Well you would need to {disfmarker} like a forced alignment before you did the chopping ,
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1069	2226.62	2226.87	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1070	2227.96	2229.58	A	PhD	s^ar|s^ng.%--	-1	0	No , we used the fact that {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1071	2229.66	2233.09	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So when Jane transcribes them the way she has transcribers doing this ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1073	2233.2	2235.07	A	PhD	s	-1	0	whether it 's with the pre - segmentation or not ,
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1072	2233.02	2233.7	H	Grad	s^2	-1	0	It 's already chunked .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1074	2235.61	2238.48	A	PhD	s	-1	0	they have a chunk and then they transcribes {comment} the words in the chunk .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1075	2238.48	2243.48	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And maybe they choose the chunk or now they use a pre - segmentation and then correct it if necessary .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1077	2243.48	2245.99	A	PhD	s	-1	0	But there 's first a chunk and then a transcription .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1076	2243.07	2243.22	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1078	2245.99	2247.35	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Then a chunk , then a transcription .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1079	2247.35	2248.13	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That 's great ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1080	2248.59	2249.72	A	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	cuz the recognizer can {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1081	2249.96	2252.55	H	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Uh , it 's all pretty good sized for the recognizer also .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1082	2252.73	2258.59	A	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	Right , and it {disfmarker} it helps that it 's made based on sort of heuristics and human ear I think .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1083	2253.34	2253.69	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Good .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1084	2253.84	2254.26	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Oh good .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1085	2259.01	2261.24	A	PhD	s	+1	1	Th - but there 's going to be a real problem ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1086	2261.76	2271.39	A	PhD	s	+1	1	uh , even if we chop up based on speech silence these , uh , the transcripts from I B M , we don't actually know where the words were ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1088	2271.47	2272.59	A	PhD	s^e	+1	1	which segment they belonged to .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1087	2271.38	2271.72	H	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1089	2272.66	2276.71	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So that 's sort of what I 'm {pause} worried about right now .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1090	2273.96	2277.09	E	PhD	qw	-1	0	Why not do a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a forced alignment ?
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1091	2277.27	2278.71	H	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	That 's what she 's saying , is that you can't .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1092	2279.43	2282.07	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	If you do a forced alignment on something really {disfmarker}

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1094	2282.29	2285.31	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	well even if you do it on something really long you need to know {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1095	2285.58	2286.69	A	PhD	s	-1	0	you can always chop it up
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1096	2286.92	2290.55	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but you need to have a reference of which words went with which , uh , chop .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1097	2291.24	2295.52	G	Postdoc	s^bu	+1	0	Now wasn't {disfmarker} I thought that one of the proposals was that IBM was going to do an initial forced alignment ,

Bmr011.B.dialogueact1105	2302.74	2305.25	B	Professor	s^co	+1	0	and so we {disfmarker} we have to have a dialogue with them about it .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1106	2304.94	2305.33	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1107	2305.25	2307.14	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , it sounds like Liz has some concerns
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1108	2306.04	2311.86	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Maybe they have some {disfmarker} you know , maybe actually there is some , even if they 're not fine grained , maybe the transcribers {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1109	2307.14	2307.34	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1110	2312.72	2316.62	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	uh , I don't know , maybe it 's saved out in pieces or {disfmarker} or something . That would help .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1111	2316.1	2316.4	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1112	2316.68	2316.85	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	But ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1113	2317.44	2318.78	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	uh , it 's just an unknown right now .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1114	2318.86	2320.84	G	Postdoc	fg|s^cc	-1	0	Yeah . I {disfmarker} I need to {disfmarker} to write to him .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1115	2320.14	2320.49	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1116	2320.84	2323.15	G	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	I just {disfmarker} you know , it 's like I got over - taxed with the timing .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1117	2322.55	2327.75	A	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Right . But the {disfmarker} it is true that the segments {disfmarker} I haven't tried the segments that Thilo gave you
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1118	2327.81	2330.52	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	but the segments that in your first meeting are great .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1119	2329.63	2329.92	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1120	2330.52	2332.59	A	PhD	s^ba^e	-1	0	I mean , that 's {disfmarker} that 's a good length .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1121	2332.38	2332.88	G	Postdoc	s^bk^m	-1	0	A good size .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1122	2332.88	2333.08	G	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Good .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1123	2333.44	2334.06	A	PhD	fg|%-	-1	0	Right , cuz {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1124	2333.61	2340.31	G	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	Well , I {disfmarker} I was thinking it would be fun to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} uh , uh , if {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} wouldn't mind , {comment} {vocalsound} to give us a pre - segmentation .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1125	2334.52	2334.82	A	PhD	b	-1	0	y yeah .
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1126	2338.83	2339.07	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1127	2340.4	2345.16	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Uh , maybe you have one already of that first m of the meeting that uh , the first transcribed meeting ,
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1128	2345.46	2346.44	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	the one that I transcribed .
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1130	2346.79	2348.76	C	PhD	h|s	-1	0	Um , I 'm sure I have some
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1129	2346.67	2348.67	G	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	Do you have a {disfmarker} could you generate a pre - segmentation ?
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1131	2347.69	2349.02	H	Grad	s	-1	0	February sixteenth I think .
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1132	2348.76	2351.54	C	PhD	s	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but that 's the one where we 're , um , trai training on ,
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1133	2351.54	2352.44	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so that 's a little bit {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1134	2352.13	2352.28	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1135	2353.44	2353.97	G	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , I see .
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1137	2354.17	2355.33	C	PhD	s^r.%-	-1	0	It 's a little bit at odd to {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1136	2353.97	2354.52	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Oh , darn .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1138	2354.52	2355.9	G	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Of course , of course , of course .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1139	2355.9	2356.42	G	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , OK .
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1140	2356.46	2356.66	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1141	2358.03	2363.2	A	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	And actually as you get transcripts just , um , for new meetings , {comment} um , we can try {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1142	2361.47	2361.67	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1143	2363.54	2368.16	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	I mean , the {disfmarker} the more data we have to try the {disfmarker} the alignments on , um , the better .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1144	2368.16	2373.82	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So it 'd be good for {disfmarker} just to know as transcriptions are coming through the pipeline from the transcribers ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1145	2373.82	2378.46	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	just to sort of {disfmarker} we 're playing around with sort of uh , parameters f on the recognizer ,
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1146	2377.88	2378.14	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1147	2378.77	2379.65	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	cuz that would be helpful .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1149	2380.19	2381.96	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Especially as you get , en more voices .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1148	2379.78	2380.42	G	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Excellent , good .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1150	2381.96	2384.24	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	The first meeting had I think just four people ,
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1151	2383.62	2384.23	C	PhD	s^2^aa	-1	0	Four speakers ,
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1153	2384.23	2384.43	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1152	2384.1	2384.25	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1155	2384.99	2385.19	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1154	2384.91	2387.68	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Yeah , Liz and I spoke d w at some length on Tuesday
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1156	2387.91	2394.43	G	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and I {disfmarker} and I was planning to do just a {disfmarker} a preliminary look over of the two that are finished and then give them to you .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1157	2394.59	2395.06	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , great ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1158	2395.25	2395.45	A	PhD	s^bk^r	-1	0	great .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1159	2395.3	2395.57	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1160	2396.74	2396.91	A	PhD	b	-1	0	So .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1161	2398.86	2399.31	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	That 's great .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1162	2400.62	2401.34	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I guess the other thing ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1163	2401.34	2406.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I can't remember if we discussed this in the meeting but , uh , I know you and I talked about this a little bit ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1164	2406.68	2408.27	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	there was an issue of , uh ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1165	2408.65	2410.78	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	suppose we get in the , uh ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1166	2411.07	2416.29	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	I guess it 's enviable position although maybe it 's just saying where the weak link is in the chain ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1167	2416.84	2417.89	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh , where we {disfmarker} we ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1168	2417.89	2419.63	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker} uh ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1169	2420.88	2422.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we have all the data transcribed
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1170	2422.86	2424.27	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	and we have these transcribers
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1171	2424.67	2426.26	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and we were {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1172	2426.76	2428.32	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	we 're still a bit slow on feeding {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1173	2428.76	2429.81	B	Professor	s	-1	0	at that point we 've caught up
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1174	2429.93	2434.56	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the , uh , the weak link is {disfmarker} is recording meetings .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1175	2435.1	2435.45	B	Professor	s^f	-1	0	OK ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1176	2436.1	2436.68	B	Professor	h	-1	0	um ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1177	2437.49	2439.88	B	Professor	qw.%--	-1	0	two questions come , is you know what {disfmarker} how {disfmarker} how do we {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1178	2440.54	2442.85	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh , it 's not really a problem at the moment cuz we haven't reached that point
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1179	2442.85	2444.81	B	Professor	qw	+1	0	but how do we step out the recorded meetings ?
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1180	2445.54	2451.99	B	Professor	qy	+1	2	And the other one is , um , uh , is there some good use that we can make of the transcribers to do other things ?
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1181	2452.82	2456.54	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So , um , I {disfmarker} I can't remember how much we talked about this in this meeting
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1183	2456.54	2457.04	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	but there was {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1182	2456.07	2457.35	H	Grad	s	-1	0	We had spoken with them about it .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1184	2456.72	2461.65	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And there is one use that {disfmarker} that also we discussed which was when , uh , Dave finishes the {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1185	2462.06	2463.14	G	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	and maybe it 's already finished {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1186	2463.34	2469.0	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	the {disfmarker} the modification to multi - trans which will allow fine grained encoding of overlaps .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1187	2469.42	2475.84	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Uh , then it would be very {disfmarker} these people would be very good to shift over to finer grain encoding of overlaps .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1188	2475.84	2477.2	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	It 's just a matter of , you know , providing {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1189	2477.26	2480.33	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	So if right now you have two overlapping segments in the same time
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1190	2480.33	2493.9	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	bin , well with {disfmarker} with the improvement in the database {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the , uh , sorry , in the interface , it 'd be possible to , um , you know , just do a click and drag thing , and get the {disfmarker} uh , the specific place of each of those , the time tag associated with the beginning and end of {disfmarker} of each segment .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1191	2495.14	2496.98	B	Professor	fg|s	+1	0	Right , so I think we talking about three level {disfmarker} three things .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1192	2495.86	2496.38	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1194	2496.98	2503.0	B	Professor	s	+1	1	One {disfmarker} one was uh , we had s had some discussion in the past about some very high level labelings ,
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1193	2496.55	2496.8	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1195	2501.64	2502.93	G	Postdoc	s^2.%-	-1	0	The types of overlaps {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1196	2503.0	2505.68	B	Professor	s^bk^m	+1	0	types of overlaps , and so forth that {disfmarker} that someone could do .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1198	2506.1	2508.08	B	Professor	s	+1	0	Second was , uh , somewhat lower level
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1197	2505.8	2505.94	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1199	2508.08	2509.94	B	Professor	s	+1	0	just doing these more precise timings .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1200	2510.5	2514.9	B	Professor	s	+1	0	And the third one is {disfmarker} is , uh , just a completely wild hair brained idea that I have
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1201	2514.9	2525.33	B	Professor	s	+1	1	which is that , um , if , uh {disfmarker} if we have time and people are able to do it , to take some subset of the data and do some very fine grained analysis of the speech .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1202	2525.64	2529.01	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	For instance , uh , marking in some overlapping {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1203	2529.42	2534.51	B	Professor	s	+1	1	potentially overlapping fashion , uh , the value of , uh , ar articulatory features .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1204	2534.44	2534.63	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1205	2534.99	2537.76	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	You know , just sort of say , OK , it 's voiced from here to here ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1206	2537.76	2541.22	B	Professor	s	-1	0	there 's {disfmarker} it 's nasal from here to here , and so forth .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1207	2541.22	2548.42	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um , as opposed to doing phonetic {disfmarker} uh , you know , phonemic and the phonetic analysis ,
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1208	2542.0	2542.0	H	Grad	b.%	-1	0	
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1209	2548.41	2553.81	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and , uh , assuming , uh , articulatory feature values for those {disfmarker} those things .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1210	2554.68	2557.5	B	Professor	fh|s^bd^df	-1	0	Um , obviously that 's extremely time - consuming .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1211	2557.83	2558.29	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker}
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1212	2558.14	2559.36	E	PhD	s	-1	0	That would be really valuable I think .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1213	2559.17	2559.95	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but , uh ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1214	2560.06	2561.7	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	we could do it on some small subset .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1215	2562.08	2565.35	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Also if you 're dealing with consonants that would be easier than vowels ,
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1216	2565.35	2565.75	G	Postdoc	qy^g^rt	-1	0	wouldn't it ?
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1217	2565.75	2576.13	G	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	I mean , I would think that {disfmarker} that , uh , being able to code that there 's a {disfmarker} a fricative extending from here to here would be a lot easier than classifying precisely which vowel that was .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1218	2574.81	2575.26	H	Grad	qw	-1	0	Which one .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1219	2576.54	2576.89	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1221	2576.74	2577.17	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1220	2576.73	2578.47	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I think vowels {disfmarker} vowels are I think harder .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1223	2580.26	2580.88	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	Well , yeah ,
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1222	2580.24	2580.49	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1224	2581.17	2594.28	B	Professor	s^arp^ng	-1	0	but I think also it 's just the issue that {disfmarker} that when you look at the {disfmarker} u w u u when you look at Switchboard for instance very close up there are places where whether it 's a consonant or a vowel you still have trouble calling it a particular phone
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1225	2587.06	2587.45	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1228	2595.09	2595.78	B	Professor	s	-1	0	at that point
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1226	2594.72	2595.39	G	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm , OK .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1227	2594.87	2596.51	H	Grad	fg|s.%-	-1	0	Yeah , but {disfmarker} but just saying what the {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1229	2595.78	2599.07	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because it 's {disfmarker} you know , there 's this movement from here to here
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1230	2595.8	2596.31	G	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	Yeah , I 'm sure .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1231	2596.74	2597.83	G	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Uh , yeah , I {disfmarker} I know .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1232	2597.42	2597.64	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1233	2599.07	2600.52	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1235	2600.87	2601.13	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	so I
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1234	2600.62	2602.77	E	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	You 're saying r sort of remove the high level constraints
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1236	2602.77	2603.55	E	PhD	s^bu^e	-1	0	and go bottom - up .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1239	2604.17	2605.7	B	Professor	s^aa|s^cs	-1	0	Yeah , describe {disfmarker} describe it .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1238	2603.97	2604.56	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Then just say {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1237	2603.72	2604.91	H	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yep , just features .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1240	2605.15	2605.38	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1241	2605.7	2607.3	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Now I 'm suggesting articulatory features .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1242	2607.3	2608.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Maybe there 's {disfmarker} there 's even a better way to do it
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1243	2608.88	2613.26	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but it {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but that 's , you know , sort of a traditional way of describing these things ,
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1244	2613.32	2613.87	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1245	2613.88	2616.33	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um , and {disfmarker} uh ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1247	2616.33	2618.7	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , actually this might be a g neat thing to talk to {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1246	2616.19	2616.51	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	That 's nice .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1248	2617.69	2620.73	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Acoustic features versus psychological categories .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1249	2620.26	2620.65	B	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	Sort of .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1251	2620.96	2621.48	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , it 's still {disfmarker}
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1252	2621.24	2621.33	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1250	2620.92	2621.11	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1253	2622.16	2623.13	B	Professor	s	-1	0	some sort of categories
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1254	2623.13	2627.29	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but something that allows for overlapping change of these things
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1255	2627.29	2637.18	B	Professor	s^ba:s^fe	+1	0	and then this would give some more ground work for people who were building statistical models that allowed for overlapping changes , different timing changes as opposed to just " click ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1256	2637.18	2640.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you 're now in this state , which corresponds to this speech sound " and so on .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1257	2637.34	2638.67	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1258	2639.49	2642.01	A	PhD	s^bu.%--	-1	0	So this is like gestural {disfmarker} uh , these g
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1259	2641.32	2642.26	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	Yeah , something like that .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1260	2642.01	2642.16	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1262	2642.74	2642.88	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1261	2642.26	2648.56	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	I mean , actually if we get into that it might be good to , uh , uh , haul John Ohala into this
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1265	2648.92	2649.27	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Right .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1263	2648.56	2650.74	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and ask his {disfmarker} his views on it I think .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1264	2648.71	2648.88	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1266	2650.42	2653.55	A	PhD	qy^rt.%--	-1	0	But is {disfmarker} is the goal there to have this on meeting data ,
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1267	2650.48	2650.91	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Excellent .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1268	2653.55	2653.76	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	like
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1269	2653.99	2656.62	A	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	so that you can do far field studies {comment} of those gestures
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1270	2656.67	2658.25	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	or {disfmarker} um ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1271	2659.31	2663.44	A	PhD	qrr^rt	-1	0	or is it because you think there 's a different kind of actual production in meetings {comment} that people use ?
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1273	2663.44	2663.65	A	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	Or {disfmarker} ?
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1272	2663.31	2670.76	B	Professor	s	+1	0	No , I think {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for that purpose I 'm just viewing meetings as being a {disfmarker} a neat way to get people talking naturally .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1274	2671.25	2674.06	B	Professor	s	+1	0	And then you have i and then {disfmarker} and then it 's natural in all senses ,
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1275	2671.48	2672.36	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Just a source of data ?
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1276	2672.94	2673.37	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1277	2674.06	2677.58	B	Professor	s	+1	0	in the sense that you have microphones that are at a distance that you know , one might have ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1278	2677.58	2679.54	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and you have the close mikes ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1279	2679.87	2681.57	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and you have people talking naturally .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1280	2681.57	2684.51	B	Professor	s	+1	0	And the overlap is just indicative of the fact that people are talking naturally ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1281	2682.77	2683.14	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact1282	2683.73	2683.98	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1285	2684.98	2685.42	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1283	2684.51	2684.77	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1284	2684.77	2688.31	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so I think that given that it 's that kind of corpus ,
Bmr011.D.dialogueact1286	2685.6	2685.88	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1287	2688.3	2690.19	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	if it 's gonna be a very useful corpus
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1288	2690.89	2697.14	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	um , if you say w OK , we 've limited the use by some of our , uh , uh , censored choices ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1289	2697.59	2699.37	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we don't have the video , we don't {disfmarker} and so forth ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1290	2699.97	2705.32	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but there 's a lot of use that we could make of it by expanding the annotation choices .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1291	2705.31	2705.64	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1292	2706.16	2709.67	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And , uh , most of the things we 've talked about have been fairly high level ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1293	2709.67	2714.0	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and being kind of a bottom - up person I thought maybe we 'd , {vocalsound} do some of the others .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1294	2712.19	2712.57	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1296	2712.86	2714.57	A	PhD	fg|s^ba	-1	0	Right . Yeah , that would be good .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1295	2712.72	2713.66	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	It 's a nice balance .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1298	2714.0	2714.18	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1297	2713.96	2717.03	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	That would be really nice to offer those things with that wide range .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1299	2716.12	2716.48	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1300	2716.84	2716.95	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1301	2716.95	2718.55	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and hopefully someone would make use of it .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1302	2717.23	2717.8	G	Postdoc	s^ba^r	-1	0	Really nice .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1303	2718.55	2719.73	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , people didn't {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1304	2719.25	2719.55	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1305	2720.19	2722.61	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh , I mean , people have made a lot of use of {disfmarker} of TIMIT
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1306	2722.61	2724.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and , uh w due to its markings ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1307	2724.43	2726.58	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then {pause} the Switchboard transcription thing ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1308	2726.58	2729.1	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	well I think has been very useful for a lot of people .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1309	2728.43	2728.62	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1310	2729.01	2729.41	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That 's true .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1311	2729.1	2729.37	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1312	2730.93	2738.4	A	PhD	s^rt^tc	+1	1	I guess I wanted to , um , sort of make a pitch for trying to collect more meetings .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1313	2731.35	2731.51	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Cool .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1314	2738.64	2739.08	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1315	2738.93	2739.12	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1316	2740.11	2741.91	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I actually I talked to Chuck Fillmore
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1317	2741.91	2745.45	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	and I think they 've what , vehemently said no before
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1318	2745.45	2750.39	A	PhD	s:s^co	-1	0	but this time he wasn't vehement and he said you know , " well , Liz , come to the meeting tomorrow
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1319	2745.7	2745.88	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1320	2750.39	2751.46	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and try to convince people " .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1321	2751.46	2754.34	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So I 'm gonna {pause} try . Go to their meeting tomorrow
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1323	2754.34	2758.03	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and see if we can try , uh , to convince them
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1322	2753.97	2754.32	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1324	2755.81	2755.9	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Good .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1325	2757.23	2759.89	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	Cuz they have something like three or four different meetings ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1326	2758.03	2758.51	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	because they have {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1327	2759.8	2766.13	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And they have very interesting meetings from the point of view of a very different type of {disfmarker} of talk than we have here
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1328	2759.89	2760.14	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1329	2760.1	2760.33	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact1330	2765.34	2765.6	D	PhD	s^2.%-	-1	0	Talk {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1331	2766.13	2768.14	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and definitely than the front end meeting , probably .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1332	2768.89	2769.07	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1333	2768.95	2770.75	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	You mean in terms of the topic {disfmarker} topics ?
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1334	2770.37	2774.98	A	PhD	s^aap|s^rt	-1	0	Well , yes and in terms of the {disfmarker} the fact that they 're describing abstract things
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1335	2775.04	2776.26	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and , uh , just dialogue - wise ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1336	2775.56	2775.99	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1337	2776.26	2776.52	A	PhD	s^f	-1	0	right .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1338	2776.36	2776.92	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1339	2777.2	2778.87	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	Um , so I 'll try .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1340	2778.87	2779.82	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And then the other thing is ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1341	2780.15	2782.02	A	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	I don't know if this is at all useful ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1342	2782.02	2787.21	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	but I asked Lila if I can maybe go around and talk to the different departments in this building
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1344	2787.86	2790.19	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	to see if there 's any groups that , for a free lunch ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1343	2787.53	2787.86	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1345	2790.19	2791.35	A	PhD	s	-1	0	if we can still offer that ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1348	2791.41	2792.2	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	might be willing {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1347	2791.31	2791.64	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Great .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1346	2791.18	2792.08	H	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	You mean non - ICSI ?
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1349	2792.86	2794.52	A	PhD	s^m^na	-1	0	non - ICSI , non - academic ,
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1350	2793.45	2795.06	H	Grad	s^am	-1	0	Yeah , I guess you {disfmarker} you can try
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1351	2794.52	2795.72	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	you know , like government people ,
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1352	2795.06	2795.26	H	Grad	%-	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1353	2795.72	2796.33	A	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	I don't know .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1354	2796.28	2798.64	H	Grad	s^df	-1	0	The problem is so much of their stuff is confidential .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1355	2797.25	2797.53	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact1358	2799.19	2799.7	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1357	2798.79	2799.17	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1356	2798.74	2800.14	H	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	It would be very hard for them .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1361	2801.16	2803.0	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Is {disfmarker} is it in these departments ?
Bmr011.D.dialogueact1360	2800.85	2801.18	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1359	2800.75	2803.44	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Also it does seem like it takes us way out of the demographic .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1362	2803.44	2808.6	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean , it seems like we {disfmarker} we had this idea before of having like linguistics students brought down for free lunches
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1363	2804.77	2805.78	H	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Well , tha I think that 's her point .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1365	2808.6	2809.59	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	and that 's a nice idea .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1364	2808.6	2811.22	A	PhD	fg|s^cs	-1	0	Right , and then we could also {disfmarker} we might try advertising again
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1366	2811.22	2817.95	A	PhD	s^df	+1	1	because I think it 'd be good if {disfmarker} if we can get a few different sort of non - internal types of meetings
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1367	2811.81	2812.06	G	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1368	2817.35	2817.61	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1369	2817.95	2819.26	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and just also more data .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1373	2820.19	2820.62	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1372	2820.02	2823.32	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Does {disfmarker} does John Ohala have weekly phonetics lab meetings ?
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1370	2819.6	2819.91	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1371	2819.72	2821.31	H	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	And I think , uh , if we could get {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1374	2822.6	2826.75	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So I actually wrote to him and he answered , " great , that sounds really interesting " .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1375	2827.11	2828.06	A	PhD	s	-1	0	But I never heard back
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1376	2828.09	2830.07	A	PhD	s	-1	0	because we didn't actually advertise openly .

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1384	2839.22	2841.88	A	PhD	fh|s.%-	-1	0	Um , so it 's still worthwhile .
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1383	2839.0	2839.56	H	Grad	fg	-1	0	But , um ,
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1385	2840.36	2844.92	H	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	it would be nice if we got someone other than me who knew how to set it up and could do the recording
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1386	2844.65	2845.07	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1387	2844.92	2847.18	H	Grad	s	-1	0	so u I didn't have to do it each time .

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1391	2847.69	2848.82	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and I was thinking {disfmarker}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1392	2848.27	2851.5	B	Professor	s	-1	0	He - he 's supposed {disfmarker} he 's supposed to be trained {vocalsound} to do it .

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1398	2855.1	2856.6	A	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	I mean , I 'm {disfmarker} I would do my best .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1399	2857.42	2866.55	A	PhD	s	+1	2	Um , the other thing is that {disfmarker} there was a number of things at the transcription side that , um , transcribers can do , like dialogue act tagging ,
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1400	2858.37	2858.91	H	Grad	s^ba^na	-1	0	It 's not that hard .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1401	2866.61	2868.07	A	PhD	s	+1	1	disfluency tagging ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1402	2868.13	2874.3	A	PhD	s	+1	0	um , things that are in the speech that are actually something we 're y {comment} working on for language modeling .

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1404	2875.84	2876.75	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Andreas as well .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1405	2876.75	2885.12	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So if you wanna process a utterance and the first thing they say is , " well " , and that " well " is coded as some kind of interrupt u tag .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1406	2885.33	2887.29	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Uh , and things like that ,

Bmr011.G.dialogueact1408	2888.14	2889.87	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Of course some of that can be li done lexically .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1411	2890.51	2891.59	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	A lot of it can be done {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1410	2890.09	2893.63	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And I also {disfmarker} they are doing disfluency tagging to some degree already .

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1414	2895.83	2897.35	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I think there 's a second pass
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1415	2897.35	2898.88	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and I don't really know what would exist in it .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1416	2898.88	2904.85	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	But there 's definitely a second pass worth doing to maybe encode some kinds of , you know , is it a question or not ,
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1417	2900.38	2900.69	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1419	2905.78	2907.91	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	um , that maybe these transcribers could do .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1420	2908.7	2909.12	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1422	2909.98	2910.32	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1421	2909.53	2910.22	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	They 'd be really good .

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1739	3338.12	3339.15	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	but I 'm not an expert .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1741	3339.15	3341.25	A	PhD	s	-1	0	It seems like a problem with cross - talk .

Bmr011.E.dialogueact1756	3365.38	3373.05	E	PhD	qy^bu^rt	+1	1	So the problem is like , uh , on the microphone of somebody who 's not talking they 're picking up signals from other people {comment} and that 's {vocalsound} causing problems ?
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1757	3371.99	3378.14	A	PhD	s^aa|s	+1	0	R right , although if they 're not talking , using the {disfmarker} the inhouse transcriptions , were sort of O K

Bmr011.D.dialogueact1790	3482.0	3482.26	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact1792	3484.3	3486.67	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Yeah , yeah . The s the symbols , you {disfmarker} you talk of before .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1791	3483.89	3485.26	G	Postdoc	qrr	-1	0	Or some other kind of thing ?
Bmr011.D.dialogueact1793	3486.74	3487.02	D	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	No ?
Bmr011.D.dialogueact1794	3487.02	3488.36	D	PhD	s^e.%-	-1	0	To {disfmarker} to mark {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1795	3487.64	3489.78	G	Postdoc	s^nd	-1	0	Well , I wouldn't say {vocalsound} symbols so much .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1796	3489.84	3497.1	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	The {disfmarker} the main change that I {disfmarker} that I see in the interface is {disfmarker} is just that we 'll be able to more finely c uh , time things .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact1797	3495.65	3495.94	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact1798	3497.37	3497.56	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1799	3497.63	3501.5	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But I {disfmarker} I also st there was another aspect of your work that I was thinking about when I was talking to you
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1801	3501.55	3501.69	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1800	3501.5	3504.21	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	which is that it sounded to me , Liz , as though you {disfmarker}
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1802	3504.6	3506.22	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and , uh , maybe I didn't q understand this ,
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1803	3506.28	3512.52	G	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	but it sounded to me as though part of the analysis that you 're doing involves taking segments which are of a particular type and putting them together .
Bmr011.D.dialogueact1805	3513.33	3513.5	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1804	3512.99	3519.11	G	Postdoc	s^bu^e	-1	0	And th so if you have like a p a s you know , speech from one speaker , {pause} then you cut out the part that 's not that speaker ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1806	3516.82	3517.21	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1807	3519.11	3524.19	G	Postdoc	s^bu^e	-1	0	and you combine segments from {pause} that same speaker to {disfmarker} {comment} and run them through the recognizer .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1808	3524.19	3525.98	G	Postdoc	qy^bu^g^rt	-1	0	Is that {pause} right ?
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1809	3525.36	3531.65	A	PhD	s	+1	0	Well we try to find as close of start and end time of {disfmarker} as we can to the speech from an individual speaker ,
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1810	3531.18	3531.44	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1811	3532.1	3534.78	A	PhD	s^df.%--	+1	0	because then we {disfmarker} we 're more guaranteed that the recognizer will {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1812	3535.09	3537.88	A	PhD	s	+1	0	for the forced alignment which is just to give us the time boundaries ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1813	3538.28	3541.72	A	PhD	s	+1	0	because from those time boundaries then the plan is to compute prosodic features .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1814	3542.02	3542.32	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1815	3542.54	3549.08	A	PhD	s	+1	0	And the sort of more space you have that isn't the thing you 're trying to align the more errors we have .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1817	3549.65	3558.76	A	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Um , so , you know , that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} it would help to have either pre - processing of a signal that creates very good signal - to - noise ratio ,
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1816	3549.26	3549.42	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1818	3551.64	3552.15	G	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	Cuz i
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1819	3552.15	3552.31	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1820	3558.76	3561.13	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	which I don't know how possible this is for the lapel ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1821	3561.77	3570.32	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um , or to have very {disfmarker} to have closer , {vocalsound} um , time {disfmarker} you know , synch times , basically , around the speech
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1822	3570.32	3572.12	A	PhD	s	-1	0	that gets transcribed in it , or both .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1823	3572.78	3576.58	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And it 's just sort of a open world right now of exploring that .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1824	3576.58	3581.39	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	So I just wanted to {pause} see , you know , on the transcribing end from here things look good .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1825	3581.94	3584.69	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , the IBM one is more {disfmarker} it 's an open question right now .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1826	3585.05	3589.39	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And then the issue of like global processing of some signal
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1827	3589.39	3594.27	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and then , you know , before we chop it up is {disfmarker} is yet another way we can improve things in that .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1828	3593.92	3596.12	E	PhD	qw^cs	-1	0	What about increasing the flexibility of the alignment ?
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1829	3595.05	3595.27	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1830	3596.76	3598.39	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Do you remember that thing that Michael Finka did ?
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1832	3598.72	3599.28	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1831	3598.54	3599.83	E	PhD	qy^e^rt	-1	0	that experiment he did a while back ?
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1833	3600.72	3602.23	A	PhD	fg|s^cs.%--	-1	0	Right . You can , um {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1834	3603.21	3604.52	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1835	3605.3	3607.3	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	The problem is just that the acoustic {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1836	3607.44	3616.46	A	PhD	s	-1	0	when the signal - to - noise ratio is too low , um , you {disfmarker} you 'll get , a uh {disfmarker} an alignment with the wrong duration pattern
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1838	3616.46	3616.77	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	or it {disfmarker}
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1837	3616.25	3619.05	E	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	Oh , so that 's the problem , is the {disfmarker} the signal - to - noise ratio .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1839	3617.72	3619.9	A	PhD	s^na.%--	-1	0	Yeah . It 's not the fact that you have like {disfmarker}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1840	3620.07	3626.66	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , what he did is allow you to have , uh , words that were in another segment move over to the {disfmarker} at the edges of {disfmarker} of segmentations .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1841	3624.83	3625.27	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1842	3626.42	3628.63	E	PhD	s^2	-1	0	Or even words inserted that weren't {disfmarker} weren't there .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1843	3627.86	3631.36	A	PhD	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	Right , things {disfmarker} things near the boundaries where if you got your alignment wrong {disfmarker}
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1844	3629.72	3630.32	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1845	3631.36	3633.48	A	PhD	s	-1	0	cuz what they had done there is align and then chop .
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1846	3633.42	3633.94	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1847	3634.18	3637.29	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	Um , and this problem is a little bit j more global .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1848	3637.29	3639.94	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	It 's that there are problems even in inside the alignments ,
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1849	3640.56	3647.77	A	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	uh , because of the fact that there 's enough acoustic signal there t for the recognizer to {disfmarker} to eat , {vocalsound} as part of a word .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1850	3647.77	3648.7	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And it tends to do that .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1851	3648.7	3648.79	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	S
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1853	3650.26	3651.62	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So , uh ,
Bmr011.D.dialogueact1852	3649.91	3650.08	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1854	3652.93	3655.1	A	PhD	s	+1	0	but we probably will have to do something like that in addition .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1855	3656.43	3666.14	A	PhD	fh|s^bs	-1	0	Anyway . So , yeah , bottom {disfmarker} bottom line is just I wanted to make sure I can be aware of whoever 's working on these signal - processing techniques for , uh , detecting energies ,
Bmr011.D.dialogueact1856	3663.53	3663.67	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1857	3666.14	3667.75	A	PhD	s^df	+1	0	because that {disfmarker} that 'll really help us .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1858	3671.48	3671.99	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	O K ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1859	3671.99	3672.48	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1860	3673.27	3676.24	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	tea has started out there I suggest we c run through our digits
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1861	3676.24	3676.35	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and ,
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1862	3676.71	3676.94	G	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1863	3678.38	3678.83	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	Uh ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1864	3682.36	3682.73	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	So ,
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1865	4013.09	4014.6	B	Professor	s^t	-1	0	OK , we 're done .
