A paper has been submitted to Eurospeech , which also includes a section on new corpora.
The statistics in the paper are based on the transcripts of two meeting and two telephone conversation corpora.
In the first two , the overlapped words vary between 9% and 18%.
The telephone conversation results were in-between and very similar to each other.
On the other hand , the automatic recognition errors affected by overlaps were reduced dramatically by focusing on regions with the foreground speech.
Furthermore , it was shown that after spurts , backchannels , disfluencies and discourse markers , the likelihood of interruption by other speakers was much higher.
Files with the recordings , as well as some experimental data will be available for other researchers in an FTP directory that is being set up.
Parts of the recordings will have to be beeped out by a script that has already been developed.
Finally , EDU meetings already recorded have now been pre-segmented and assigned to the transcribers at ICSI.
