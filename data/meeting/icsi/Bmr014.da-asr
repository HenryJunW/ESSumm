Bmr014.F.dialogueact57	111.591	113.291	F	Postdoc	s^cs.%--	-1	0	you could then we don't really have to talk about that is i take it off 
Bmr014.B.dialogueact59	113.423	116.683	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	you could try and experiments ask him about the test for spikes and then is i take it off the agenda 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact58	113.291	114.491	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you could try and experiments is i take it off the agenda 
Bmr014.B.dialogueact60	116.683	118.043	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	for spikes and then we'll go the thing there and then yeah right 
Bmr014.B.dialogueact61	118.103	122.361	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and then go and when they go transcribe it it could ask him to come get you yeah right 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact62	118.306	118.546	C	Grad	b	-1	0	and then yeah right 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact63	118.636	118.896	C	Grad	b	-1	0	and then yeah right 
Bmr014.B.dialogueact65	123.401	125.201	B	PhD	s^cs^e	-1	0	come get me when you transcribe this if it it's

Bmr014.E.dialogueact70	129.251	143.14	E	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean were they say professional audio recording well we would do what you would do is in testing is you would actually do all this we're going and make sure that things are not giving that kind of performance if they are then they 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact71	143.14	144.79	E	Professor	s	-1	0	if they are then they can't be used

Bmr014.E.dialogueact74	148.974	149.894	E	Professor	fh|s^t1	-1	0	um let's see i guess 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact75	149.894	157.309	E	Professor	s^t^tc	+1	0	let's see i guess i would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on uh recording transcription you know basically 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact76	157.449	159.719	E	Professor	s	+1	0	you know basically you know where we are in the corpus 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact77	160.335	160.445	F	Postdoc	b.x	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact78	161.136	168.118	E	Professor	s^t	-1	0	and then um yeah the thing that i would like to talk about which is real medically thing deal is uh agendas 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact79	169.975	171.575	E	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	they also i'll start with that actually uh 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact80	171.575	179.977	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	actually uh andres brought up fact that he was kind of like to know if possible what we were going to be talking about because 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact81	179.977	184.365	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	to be talking about because sure peripherally involved to this point and 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact82	184.525	191.935	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and there's going to be a topic about discussion about something that he uh strongly cares about than he would come and 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact83	191.935	195.977	E	Professor	s	-1	0	than he would come and i think part of part of his motivation this he's trying to help us out and 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact84	195.977	203.592	E	Professor	s	-1	0	to help us out and uh because the fact that the meetings are are tending to become reasonably large now days when everybody shows up and 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact85	203.852	207.162	E	Professor	s	-1	0	shows up and so he figures he could help that out by not so and and i'm sure 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact87	207.469	207.869	C	Grad	b	-1	0	and and i'm sure 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact86	207.162	209.562	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and and i'm sure help out his own time 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact88	210.476	213.556	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	not showing up if it's a meeting that he's 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact89	214.076	215.466	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so uh in order i i 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact90	215.586	218.904	E	Professor	s	-1	0	order i i think that this is a wish on his part uh 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact91	218.904	220.644	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	on his part uh it's actually going to be hard because it 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact92	220.644	225.794	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	going to be hard because it seems like a lot of times uh things come up that are on anticipated 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact93	225.794	226.514	E	Professor	%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bmr014.E.dialogueact94	227.365	230.045	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	but um we could try anyway uh do another 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact96	230.235	235.615	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh do another try at coming up with each and uh uh at some point before the meeting 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact97	236.075	237.365	E	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	well maybe it would be a good idea uh see the day before 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact98	236.94	245.74	C	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us too like on wednesday or tuesday send out our mind or for people to send in agenda items uh see the day before

Bmr014.F.dialogueact121	282.543	286.273	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i'm wondering if you were just uh specify particular topics 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact122	286.273	286.693	F	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact123	288.048	292.488	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i would i would also maybe we be able to meet that requested his little 
Bmr014.B.dialogueact124	292.42	298.45	B	PhD	s	-1	0	i would i would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that that we more things of interest 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact125	292.985	293.455	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	i would i would also guess that as we 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact126	298.68	298.88	E	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact127	299.827	300.507	E	Professor	fg|%-	-1	0	actually it this 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact128	300.757	303.907	E	Professor	s^tc.%--	-1	0	it this this maybe brings up another topic which is um 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact129	304.627	305.607	E	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	sort of on that topic of the topic 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact130	305.607	311.467	E	Professor	s^t	+1	1	yeah actually i i was going to say we need that topic of the topic i was thinking it was just uh status on microphones and channel and all that 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact131	310.862	313.962	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah actually i i was going to say we need to talk about that too and channel and all that 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact132	312.8	312.96	E	Professor	b	-1	0	to 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact133	314.53	315.58	E	Professor	qh^cs	-1	0	okay well when we 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact134	315.706	315.926	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact135	316.106	318.706	C	Grad	fh|s	+1	2	um the new microphone the new ones are in 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact136	319.38	323.07	C	Grad	fh|s	+1	0	and they are being assembled as we speak i hope and i 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact137	323.57	326.34	C	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	and i didn't bring my car today so i'm going to pick them up tomorrow 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact138	327.056	330.786	C	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um and on the other question i was thinking about is well a couple of things first of 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact139	330.786	336.71	C	Grad	s^cs	+1	0	a couple of things first of all if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable we should probably just go ahead and get them 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact140	337.475	339.725	C	Grad	s	+1	0	so we'll have to evaluate that when they come in and get 
Bmr014.A.dialogueact142	339.865	339.945	A	PhD	b	-1	0	come in and get 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact141	339.725	342.185	C	Grad	s	+1	0	come in and get people's opinions on on what they think of them um 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact143	342.77	346.85	C	Grad	fh|s^cs	-1	0	um then the other question i had is maybe we should get another wireless 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact144	347.568	348.558	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	another wireless setup means expensive 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact145	348.558	353.518	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	setup means expensive but it does seem to be better than the wire wired 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact146	354.13	358.34	E	Professor	qw	+1	0	um so how many channels to get to you know wireless setup 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact147	358.997	362.777	C	Grad	h|s	+1	0	um well i'm pretty sure that you can daisy chained together so what setup 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact148	362.777	366.077	C	Grad	s	+1	2	chained together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless so we currently 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact149	366.791	369.661	C	Grad	s	+1	0	so we currently have one base station with six wireless mike 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact150	370.251	372.031	C	Grad	s	-1	0	possibility six wireless receivers and i'm currently you can't 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact151	372.031	373.901	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and i'm currently you can't chain those together 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact152	374.424	379.964	C	Grad	s	+1	2	and we could replace are wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mics 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact153	380.91	382.32	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	and so um so 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact154	382.052	382.372	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	and so 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact156	383.022	385.242	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so it you know it's still it's fifteen minus six do we 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact155	382.89	383.37	E	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	and so it you know it's still it's fifteen so do we 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact157	386.484	386.694	C	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right so we could have 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact158	386.694	388.044	C	Grad	s	-1	0	right so we could have up to nine 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact159	389.44	390.83	E	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	right and right now it's you know six 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact160	390.76	391.06	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right and we have five know six 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact161	391.52	393.13	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and we have five we're getting one more 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact162	393.53	393.82	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact163	396.41	399.6	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and it's um about nine hundred dollars for the base station and 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact164	399.94	401.55	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and then eight hundred per channel 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact165	403.8	404.02	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	oh so yeah so 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact166	404.09	405.56	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so yeah so the only on 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact167	405.79	409.34	E	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	right the only on the my cost of the mike's anything's today station is nine hundred dollars oh 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact168	408.676	408.916	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right is nine hundred dollars 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact169	409.942	410.572	E	Professor	s^co	-1	0	oh we should do it 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact170	411.078	411.298	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact172	412.2	416.51	C	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	i don't quite understand how that how okay so all look into how you daisy chain them and and then just go ahead and order 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact171	412.02	412.28	E	Professor	b	-1	0	okay so all look into 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact173	414.68	414.91	E	Professor	b	-1	0	and and 
Bmr014.B.dialogueact174	415.49	417.84	B	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	i don't quite understand how that how that works if then just go ahead and order 
Bmr014.B.dialogueact175	417.84	418.14	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	that works if 
Bmr014.B.dialogueact176	419.21	421.33	B	PhD	s^bu	+1	0	so we're not increasing the number of channels okay okay now we're just replacing 
Bmr014.B.dialogueact178	421.33	421.92	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay okay we're just replacing 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact177	420.955	424.755	C	Grad	s^ar|s	+1	2	the number of channels okay okay now we're just replacing the wired the too wired that are still working

Bmr014.E.dialogueact267	563.69	571.22	E	Professor	s	-1	0	so um dave isn't here but he was going to start working and some things with the digits 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact268	572.03	575.25	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	so he'll be interested in what's going on with that i guess 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact269	575.25	575.71	E	Professor	%--	-1	0	i guess 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact270	576.11	583.91	E	Professor	qy^bu^rt	+1	1	was a decision last time was that uh transcribers we're going to be doing stuff with that it just as well as 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact272	583.91	585.28	E	Professor	qr.%--	+1	1	that it just as well as it started uh it would be to 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact271	583.548	583.838	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	that it just as well as 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact273	584.048	584.208	F	Postdoc	s^aa	+1	1	it started uh 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact274	584.828	589.088	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	right so that it started uh it would be to use as interface and i was going to meet with him today about that 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact275	589.33	593.9	C	Grad	s^bk|fg|s	-1	0	right so that decision was that chain did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork so 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact276	593.9	596.13	C	Grad	s	-1	0	of the paperwork so i did all that last week so all 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact277	596.81	600.49	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so all in all the forms are now on the computer 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact278	601.51	607.73	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and uh then i have a bunch of scripts that will read those and like the uh transcribers use different tools i just 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact279	607.73	611.1	C	Grad	s	-1	0	use different tools i just want to talk to jane about how we transition to using those he has a nice 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact280	610.834	610.984	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	to using those 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact281	611.394	612.794	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	he has a nice setup that they 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact282	613.034	614.844	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it it will be fishing for them to do 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact283	615.08	615.41	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	i i don't okay so i would 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact285	615.64	616.9	C	Grad	s	+1	0	i i don't think it'll take too long okay so i would 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact284	615.56	615.98	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	i i don't okay so i would 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact286	617.23	620.52	C	Grad	s^e	+1	1	so you know just uh a matter of these days i suspect

Bmr014.F.dialogueact374	737.862	739.652	F	Postdoc	fg|s.%--	-1	0	okay and the transcribers i 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact375	739.732	741.152	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i uh i don't have the exact numbers but i 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact376	741.152	746.75	F	Postdoc	s.x	+1	2	but i would think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh transcribing from them right now 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact377	747.19	754.242	F	Postdoc	s.x	+1	2	the next step is too that i'm working on is to ensure that the date are clean first and then channel eyes what i mean by 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact378	754.672	757.152	F	Postdoc	s.x	+1	1	what i mean by clean is that they're spell checked that the markup is 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact379	757.272	759.332	F	Postdoc	s.x	+1	2	that the markup is consistent all the way throughout and also that we 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact380	759.402	772.691	F	Postdoc	s.x	+1	2	and also that we know of corporate these additional conventions that uh was requested in terms of uh in terms of having us uh systematic handling of numbers and akron m.'s which i hadn't been specific about 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact381	773.277	776.917	F	Postdoc	h|s	-1	0	um for example it they'll say uh ninety two 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact382	777.217	778.687	F	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	and you know so how you could 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact383	779.11	779.75	C	Grad	s^2	-1	0	nine too right exactly 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact384	779.234	780.404	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	nine too right exactly so if you just say nine 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact385	779.99	780.34	C	Grad	b	-1	0	nine too right exactly so if you just say nine 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact386	780.404	783.134	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so if you just say nine to the many sways i couldn't express and and i just had them 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact387	783.134	783.974	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and and i just had them 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact388	784.284	786.734	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i i mean certain number of them did put the words down 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact389	787.197	792.947	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know chain um but now we have a convention which also involves having followed by uh i lost

Bmr014.B.dialogueact394	794.85	801.584	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	already be doing this but i've noticed in the past when i've gone through transcription this and you know in order to build like the concept things if you 
Bmr014.B.dialogueact395	801.584	811.497	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	things if you um just take all the transcription separate him into words and then alphabetize them lot of times just scanning down that list you'll find a lot of inconsistency sickness misspelt you talking about that i took in frequency

Bmr014.F.dialogueact399	813.812	816.652	F	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	those two you mean just uh any show on each line there's the one word right just 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact400	816.652	816.882	F	Postdoc	qy^d^g	-1	0	the one word right just

Bmr014.F.dialogueact409	824.341	826.251	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know spell check basically does that but but in addition 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact410	826.251	827.251	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	that but but in addition yes that's that's 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact411	827.401	834.102	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	uhhuh pleasantville yes that's that's exactly the strategy i want to do in terms of locating these things which are you know cloak wheel spoken forms which are like on exactly and then 
Bmr014.B.dialogueact412	833.802	834.012	B	PhD	b	-1	0	uhhuh pleasantville which are like on exactly and then 
Bmr014.B.dialogueact414	834.452	837.162	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	pleasantville appear next to each other and uh in exactly and then you can then you can do it 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact413	834.102	834.582	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	pleasantville exactly and then 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact415	834.802	836.032	F	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	pleasantville appear next to each other and uh exactly and then you can then you can do it 
Bmr014.A.dialogueact416	835.726	836.366	A	PhD	b	-1	0	appear next to each other and uh you can then you can do it 
Bmr014.B.dialogueact417	837.922	841.452	B	PhD	s	-1	0	in the alphabetize list filter next each other and and that makes it easy absolutely i agree it's a very good it's a very 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact418	839.885	840.365	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	list filter next each other and and that makes absolutely i agree 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact419	840.485	840.915	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	and and that makes i agree 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact420	841.085	843.105	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	it easy it's a very good it's a very good uh suggestion and 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact421	843.667	847.977	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and that was that's my strategy travelling a lot of these things in terms of things that need to be closet 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact422	847.977	849.377	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that need to be closet and get to that point but so 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact423	849.377	849.617	F	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	point but so 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact424	849.916	852.096	F	Postdoc	s^rt	+1	1	point but so their numbers and they're akron m.'s and then 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact425	852.446	861.946	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and then um there's uh he she wants the uh actually it explicit marker uh what type of comment this is so

Bmr014.C.dialogueact462	945.56	949.76	C	Grad	qw	+1	0	how are you doing the uh akron and so if i say p. c. m. what would it here on the transcript it be separate the 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact463	949.226	949.896	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	the transcript it be separate the 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact464	949.896	951.986	F	Postdoc	s^e	+1	0	the transcript it be separate the letters would be separated in space

Bmr014.F.dialogueact473	962.255	971.073	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	maybe it's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is uh a step away from maybe indicating that it really is intentional those bases are there and indicating why didn't

Bmr014.F.dialogueact476	977.267	978.407	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	the psychic way but it's it's 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact477	978.547	983.357	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that sounds good way but it's it's week just stick uh ways stating these these letters 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact478	983.094	983.354	C	Grad	b	-1	0	that sounds good 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact479	983.424	984.044	C	Grad	s	-1	0	that sounds good 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact480	985.29	987.48	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and so anyway the clean those are those things and then channel 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact481	987.48	992.47	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	things and then channel eyes just to then um get it into this multi channel format at 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact482	992.929	996.429	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	format at that point then it's ready for use by listen dawn but that's been 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact483	996.669	999.759	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	dawn but that's been my top priority beyond getting it town channel the next 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact484	999.759	1002.99	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	channel the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of time vince

Bmr014.A.dialogueact631	1277.91	1279.91	A	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah that's that's basically the uh the thing 
Bmr014.A.dialogueact633	1282.26	1290.76	A	PhD	fg|s	+1	2	yeah and that that's that's been all my life uh the teachers felt nothing how about this uh within one channel

Bmr014.A.dialogueact634	1291.8	1298.03	A	PhD	s	+1	2	because there yeah to to be able to distinguish between four going to back on speech and

Bmr014.E.dialogueact643	1310.61	1311.52	E	Professor	%--	-1	0	i think they 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact644	1312.94	1314.09	E	Professor	qr^tc.%-	-1	0	we we've basically done with a prescription 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact645	1315.58	1318.28	E	Professor	s^t^tc	+1	2	right so i guess next thing is this uh we better 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact646	1318.63	1318.88	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right so 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact647	1318.88	1321.66	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	right so the the idea is that we need to have we need to 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact648	1321.74	1327.82	C	Grad	s	+1	2	to have we need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sex is they don't want 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact649	1328.35	1337.2	C	Grad	s	-1	0	however and a bunch of tools that will generate webpages uh with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and listen to peace pieces and they can scroll through and read them and then they can 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact650	1337.2	1340.32	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and then they can check on each one if they wanted excluded and 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact651	1340.96	1346.98	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and then it's uh more make won't form forms they can submitted and it wound up sending me e. mail with the times they want excluded 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact652	1347.64	1351.05	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and so uh some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue and so i 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact654	1351.76	1357.08	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and so i thought about this a little bit and i think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password a single password each person 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact653	1351.66	1352.39	E	Professor	b	-1	0	and so i thought about this a little bit 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact655	1357.08	1357.78	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	a single password each person 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact656	1357.78	1360.6	C	Grad	s	-1	0	a single password each person a lot of single password user name and password 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact657	1361.19	1366.14	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and then each meeting will only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact658	1367.14	1369.63	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and that way each person only has to remember one password 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact659	1371.98	1376.27	E	Professor	s	-1	0	i camp i wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed i mean 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact660	1376.52	1378.84	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i mean if people have 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact661	1380.47	1381.0	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	um i mean for 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact662	1381.79	1389.21	E	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean for me i would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription uh sort of flip through it 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact663	1390.07	1394.12	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and then um if i thought it was okay i'd say it's okay 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact664	1394.35	1394.66	C	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact665	1394.91	1395.92	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact666	1396.82	1399.88	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh i mean it depends how this really ends up working out but 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact667	1399.88	1409.96	E	Professor	s	-1	0	working out but i guess my thought was that thee occasion somebody wondering whether something was okay or not they needing to listen to it was going to be extremely rare 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact668	1410.37	1417.11	C	Grad	s^aa|s^df	-1	0	right i mean so that that the fact that you could listen to it over the web is a minor thing that i already had done for other reasons and so that's that's 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact669	1415.72	1416.14	E	Professor	b	-1	0	done for other reasons 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact670	1417.51	1419.02	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and so that's that's a minor part of it i just want some web 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact671	1419.02	1423.32	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i just want some web interface of the people you didn't actually have to send everyone the text some out 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact672	1423.83	1430.72	C	Grad	s	-1	0	some out what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready i would take them and generate the web pages and send 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact673	1430.72	1434.63	C	Grad	s	-1	0	the web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact674	1435.26	1438.32	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and just uh tell them here's a webpage 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact675	1438.99	1440.92	C	Grad	s	-1	0	you need a password so 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact676	1440.92	1443.66	C	Grad	qw	-1	0	need a password so that the question number one is how do we distribute passwords 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact677	1444.11	1448.34	C	Grad	qw	-1	0	question number two is how else do we want to provide this information if they want it 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact678	1448.89	1449.44	E	Professor	%--	-1	0	it 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact679	1449.92	1453.77	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	are sort are saying is that if you just say it yours 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact680	1454.56	1465.51	E	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	means maybe sounds trivial effect but but i thought if you handed them some sheets of paper that said uh here's what was said in this transcription is that okay with you and 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact681	1465.99	1470.07	E	Professor	s	-1	0	i think that um with you and if it is here's this other sheet of paper that you sign says that it's okay and then they 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact682	1470.35	1474.63	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i think that um there are subset of people who want printouts that we can certainly provide but and then they hand it back to you 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact683	1470.62	1471.95	E	Professor	s	-1	0	i think that um there are subset and then they hand it back to you 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact684	1474.95	1476.41	C	Grad	s	-1	0	provide but certainly i wouldn't want to print out these are big 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact685	1476.41	1477.05	C	Grad	s	-1	0	print out these are big and i would much 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact686	1477.5	1481.93	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	and i would much rather be be able to just sit and leafed through it you find it easier to go through a

Bmr014.E.dialogueact688	1482.34	1483.73	E	Professor	qw	-1	0	large i mean how do you read books 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact689	1484.35	1485.61	C	Grad	s	-1	0	well i certainly read books by hand for something 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact690	1485.61	1488.53	C	Grad	s	-1	0	by hand for something like this i think it's easier to do it on the web 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact691	1488.66	1488.94	E	Professor	qy^bh^rt	-1	0	it on the web 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact692	1489.84	1490.57	E	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	because you're going 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact693	1490.82	1495.13	C	Grad	s	-1	0	because you're going to get you know if i'm i mean a bunch of meetings and i don't want to get a stack of these i want to just be able to go 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact694	1495.13	1498.8	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i want to just be able to go to the website and visited as they want going 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact695	1498.88	1500.25	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	as they want going to a website is easy put flipping through 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact696	1500.25	1504.37	E	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	well i don't put flipping through a hundred pounds a hundred pages of stuff is not easy on the way 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact697	1504.73	1506.77	C	Grad	s^df^ng	-1	0	well i don't think it's that much harder than paper way

Bmr014.F.dialogueact702	1511.87	1516.0	F	Postdoc	s^df.%-	-1	0	so here's what i was imagining and from the transfer because i i do think that there's a benefit to being able to hear the tone of voice and uh 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact703	1515.75	1517.83	E	Professor	s	-1	0	so here's what i was imagining and maybe i'm wrong but the voice and uh 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact704	1516.82	1517.11	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	what i was imagining and maybe i'm wrong but the 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact705	1517.83	1526.65	E	Professor	s	+1	0	maybe i'm wrong but the way i imagined it was that um the largest set of people is going to go oh yeah i i didn't say anything funny that mean just go ahead 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact706	1526.65	1527.27	E	Professor	s^co	+1	0	that mean just go ahead where's where's the 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact707	1527.27	1528.5	E	Professor	qw	+1	0	where's where's the release 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact708	1529.95	1532.14	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and then they'll be a subset of people right 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact709	1532.42	1532.68	E	Professor	qy^f^rt	-1	0	right 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact710	1533.08	1533.47	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	there's this because think of 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact711	1533.47	1535.76	E	Professor	s^co	-1	0	there's this because think of who is we've been recording say 
Bmr014.A.dialogueact713	1536.23	1536.38	A	PhD	b	-1	0	cake they'll be a subset 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact712	1536.12	1542.7	E	Professor	s	+1	0	cake they'll be a subset of people who um will say um well yeah i really would like to see that 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact714	1543.1	1548.51	E	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	and for them the easiest way to flip through if it's a really large document me not sure 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact715	1548.68	1549.64	E	Professor	s	+1	0	me not sure searching searching 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact716	1549.64	1551.53	E	Professor	s	+1	0	searching searching course should be like time but if you're not 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact717	1551.61	1552.15	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	time but if you're not city price search 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact718	1552.15	1556.26	E	Professor	s	-1	0	city price search mechanism good every place they said something or something like that but see them are getting 
Bmr014.A.dialogueact719	1555.8	1556.22	A	PhD	b	-1	0	something or something like that but see them are getting 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact720	1556.26	1558.1	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but see them are getting more ladder of this thing 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact721	1558.88	1565.75	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really really long document i mean whenever 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact722	1565.75	1571.6	E	Professor	s	-1	0	document i mean whenever i've had are really really long document that that was sitting on the web i'd always ended up printing it out i mean 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact723	1571.73	1573.34	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it out i mean so it's it's i mean you're you're 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact724	1573.34	1576.75	E	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean you're you're you're you're not necessarily going to be sitting at the desk all the time you i 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact725	1576.75	1581.52	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	all the time you i figure you have a train ride is always situations where were i mean this 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact726	1581.53	1583.25	E	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean this i was managing anyway and then 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact727	1583.25	1590.66	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and then i figured that out of that group there would be a subset would go um you know i'm really not sure about the section here 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact728	1591.14	1592.56	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and then that group would eat it 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact729	1592.56	1594.37	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	eat it it seems like if i'm right 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact730	1594.43	1602.76	E	Professor	s	-1	0	if i'm right in that it seems like you're setting it up for the most infrequent case rather than for the most frequent case 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact731	1603.21	1605.89	E	Professor	s	-1	0	well no we so that uh now we have to worry about privacy we have 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact732	1605.34	1606.62	C	Grad	s^nd.%-	-1	0	well no we for the most about privacy we have to worry about all 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact733	1605.89	1609.13	E	Professor	s	-1	0	well no we for the most for the most frequent case they just about privacy we have to worry about all these passwords for different people 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact734	1608.75	1611.87	C	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	for the most frequent case they just say it's okay and for different people 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact735	1611.97	1612.71	C	Grad	s	-1	0	it's okay and then they're done 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact736	1614.01	1617.82	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i think almost everyone would rather do that by e. mail than any other method 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact737	1614.83	1615.28	E	Professor	b	-1	0	i think almost everyone would rather 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact738	1619.12	1620.6	F	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	yeah the thing too is it seems like good 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact739	1620.2	1621.64	E	Professor	h|s^aa	-1	0	i mean because you don't yeah that's true it seems like good 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact740	1620.85	1621.11	F	Postdoc	s^co	-1	0	i mean because you don't yeah that's true it seems like good 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact741	1621.49	1624.2	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	i mean because you don't have to visit the web page you want too yeah that's true i guess 
Bmr014.A.dialogueact742	1622.69	1622.94	A	PhD	b	-1	0	have to visit the web page 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact743	1624.59	1625.05	E	Professor	%--	-1	0	i guess yeah i guess we don't 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact744	1625.05	1627.11	E	Professor	s^am	-1	0	yeah i guess we don't need their signature i guess an email 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact745	1627.11	1628.96	E	Professor	s	-1	0	oh that was another i guess an email okay i'm uh 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact746	1628.43	1629.3	C	Grad	s	-1	0	oh that was another thing i i had assumed okay i'm uh 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact747	1629.3	1633.75	C	Grad	s	-1	0	thing i i had assumed that we didn't need their signature up that an email approval was sufficient 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact748	1635.0	1636.81	C	Grad	s^no	-1	0	are are i don't actually know 
Bmr014.B.dialogueact749	1636.08	1642.66	B	PhD	qy^rt	+1	1	are are people going to be allowed to leap out sections of the meeting where they weren't speaking don't actually know yes 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact750	1642.74	1643.05	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	speaking yes 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact752	1646.83	1651.52	C	Grad	s	+1	0	if someone feel strongly enough about it yeah and i i i think they should be allowed to do that i also 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact751	1646.44	1646.83	F	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	if someone i also 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact753	1646.83	1646.93	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	if someone i also 
Bmr014.B.dialogueact754	1652.94	1655.09	B	PhD	qy^bu^rt	+1	1	so that means other people or editing what you say uh i don't know but 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact755	1652.97	1656.45	E	Professor	s^nd^no	-1	0	so that means other people or editing what you say i don't know if i like uh i don't know but uh 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact756	1655.05	1655.15	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	i don't know but 
Bmr014.B.dialogueact757	1656.38	1657.27	B	PhD	s^no	-1	0	i don't know if i like that well the only uh 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact758	1657.65	1661.33	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	that well the only other choices that the person would say no don't distribute this meeting at all and i would rather they 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact759	1661.33	1665.12	C	Grad	s	-1	0	all and i would rather they were able to edit out other people and just it don't distributed at all 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact760	1667.81	1676.0	E	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	well but if but what they signed in the consent for with something that said you can't use mine 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact761	1676.29	1682.05	C	Grad	s	-1	0	well but if if someone is having a conversation and you only bleep out one side of it that's not sufficient yeah but that's 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact762	1676.73	1677.07	E	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	well but if if someone is having a conversation 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact763	1679.11	1679.32	E	Professor	b	-1	0	only bleep out one 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact764	1682.7	1683.9	E	Professor	s^bk|s^ng	-1	0	yeah but that's our decision then right 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact765	1683.9	1684.17	E	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	um our decision then right 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact766	1684.64	1686.1	C	Grad	h|s^nd	-1	0	um i don't think so because i think it 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact768	1686.61	1688.74	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	because if i object to the conversation of i say i think it 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact767	1686.43	1687.01	E	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	because if i object to i think it 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact769	1688.74	1700.39	C	Grad	s	-1	0	the conversation of i say we were having a conversation and i consider that conversation private and i consider that your side of it is enough for other people to win for i want to be able to believe out your site i 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact770	1700.93	1701.24	F	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	site i i agree that the consent 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact771	1701.24	1704.16	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	i agree that the consent forms were uh i can agree with what adam saying 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact772	1704.26	1713.26	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	okay agree with what adam saying that um they consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive what whether they said them or didn't say that and the 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact773	1712.46	1712.94	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	they said them or didn't say 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact774	1713.78	1714.89	E	Professor	s	-1	0	okay that's where it's at that and the thing is from the standpoint 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact775	1713.78	1715.98	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	okay that's where it's at that and the thing is from the standpoint of the of the 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact776	1716.1	1717.05	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i'm not a lot lawyer but it strikes me that 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact777	1717.05	1722.13	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but it strikes me that uh we wouldn't want someone to say oh yes i was a little concerned about it but it 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact778	1722.19	1724.3	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it but it was too hard to access 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact779	1725.05	1729.02	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so i think it's kind of nice to have this facility to listen to it not in terms of like 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact780	1729.02	1737.11	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	not in terms of like editing it by hand i mean i think it's if some people would find that easier to specify the bleep part by having a document they edit could but but it 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact781	1737.11	1749.45	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	next certainly but but it it seems to me that sometimes um you know he if a person had a bad day and they had a tone and they're boys that they didn't really like you know it's nice it's nice to be able to listen to it and be sure that that was okay 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact782	1749.45	1752.22	C	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	next certainly provided principal version if people want it um 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact784	1753.09	1753.58	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	i mean it's also a mixture 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact783	1752.81	1754.91	E	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	it um i mean it's also a mixture of people i mean 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact785	1754.91	1760.76	E	Professor	s	-1	0	of people i mean some people are do their work primarily by sitting at the computer flipping around the web others 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact786	1760.76	1761.66	E	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	around the web others to not 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact787	1761.81	1762.02	C	Grad	b	-1	0	to not others would consider 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact788	1762.24	1763.24	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	others would consider it this uh a 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact789	1763.24	1766.75	E	Professor	s	-1	0	it this uh a set of skills that they would have to gain 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact790	1767.18	1767.51	E	Professor	qy^f	-1	0	well 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact791	1767.96	1770.81	C	Grad	s	-1	0	well i think most of the people in the meetings are the former depends on what meetings that's true 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact792	1767.97	1769.39	E	Professor	s	-1	0	well i think most of the people in the meetings are depends on what meetings that's true 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact793	1768.31	1768.69	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	i think most of the people depends on what meetings that's true

Bmr014.C.dialogueact795	1772.3	1772.56	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	in 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact796	1772.76	1774.38	E	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	in the meeting so far yeah but we're trying 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact797	1774.08	1774.28	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah but we're trying 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact798	1774.66	1776.0	E	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah but we're trying to expand this right 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact799	1776.0	1776.27	E	Professor	qy^f	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact800	1776.64	1776.87	C	Grad	s^aa^m	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact801	1777.06	1781.24	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and that well but if they so i i i actually think the papers more universals 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact802	1778.35	1778.58	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	and that actually think 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact804	1781.6	1783.26	C	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	well but if they want to put it out that's all right i think everyone in the meeting 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact803	1781.53	1781.82	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	well but if they 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact805	1782.01	1782.19	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	want to put it out that's all right 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact806	1783.26	1785.08	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i think everyone in the meeting can access the web no i think we 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact807	1785.31	1787.32	E	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	no i think we have to be able to print it out it's not just that they 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact808	1787.32	1788.85	E	Professor	s	-1	0	out it's not just that they want to print 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact810	1789.18	1789.8	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	okay so does that 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact809	1789.18	1791.41	C	Grad	s^bk|qy^rt	-1	0	okay so does that mean that i can't use e. mail 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact811	1792.82	1793.3	C	Grad	qrr	-1	0	or what she just

Bmr014.C.dialogueact815	1796.58	1797.17	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	well i don't think i quite don't think we can send well where there was this 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact814	1796.22	1796.65	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	well i don't think well where there was this 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact816	1796.65	1797.18	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	well i don't think i quite don't think we can send well where there was this 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact817	1797.17	1800.53	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i quite don't think we can send attacks through email because the privacy issues good for security yeah okay good 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact819	1799.1	1799.64	E	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	because the privacy issues for security 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact818	1798.94	1799.17	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	attacks through email because the privacy issues good for security 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact820	1799.4	1800.12	F	Postdoc	qy^2^bu	-1	0	because the privacy issues for security yeah okay good

Bmr014.C.dialogueact825	1801.17	1808.12	C	Grad	fh|qy^bu	-1	0	um so giving them you think a website to say if you want to print it out here it is is not sufficient point 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact824	1800.89	1801.27	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	um yeah okay good point 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact826	1803.3	1803.7	F	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	so giving 
Bmr014.A.dialogueact827	1806.78	1807.08	A	PhD	b	-1	0	want to print it out here it is is not sufficient 
Bmr014.A.dialogueact828	1809.07	1810.1	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	certainly for everybody who's been in the meeting

Bmr014.C.dialogueact852	1848.82	1853.44	C	Grad	s	-1	0	it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we would do it this other parents level because 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact853	1853.85	1858.21	C	Grad	s	-1	0	level because this way and just delete an entire line out of it transferred file rather have to do it by hand there's another aspect 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact854	1858.29	1862.53	E	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	there's another aspect of this you maybe as part of vices bother 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact855	1863.19	1870.34	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	i think you're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do 
Bmr014.B.dialogueact857	1871.84	1872.11	B	PhD	b	-1	0	i mean that's why did the web form because 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact856	1871.79	1874.95	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	i mean that's why did the web form because for me that would be my most convenient i i i understand 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact858	1873.27	1875.05	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	i know where you're going for me that would be my most convenient i i i understand i think that's a bad idea

Bmr014.E.dialogueact863	1880.15	1880.6	E	Professor	s^fe	-1	0	really you're going to 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact864	1880.65	1887.85	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	really you're going to end up with all these little touchy things where is really what we want to do is have the the the bias towards letting it go

Bmr014.E.dialogueact872	1902.4	1904.09	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	you know this is this we're we're covering were playing the lawyers game 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact873	1904.09	1908.25	E	Professor	s	-1	0	were playing the lawyers game and we're playing we're we're we're looking for the extreme case if we 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact874	1908.74	1914.14	E	Professor	s	-1	0	if we really oriented towards that extreme case make it really easy we're going to end up encouraging ahead 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact875	1915.37	1916.41	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but i think that's sort 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact876	1916.82	1918.82	E	Professor	s	-1	0	sort of sinking myself out here i'm trying to 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact877	1918.86	1919.86	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i out here i'm trying to trying to uh but 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact879	1919.96	1925.67	C	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	i guess i don't see having a few phrases here and there and a meeting being that not much of a headache bleeped out so trying to uh but i i think that's well 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact878	1919.93	1920.76	E	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	i guess i don't see having trying to uh but i i think that's 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact880	1925.38	1926.26	E	Professor	s^nd.%-	-1	0	i think what bleeped out so well 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact881	1925.9	1926.18	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	i think what bleeped out so well 
Bmr014.B.dialogueact883	1926.69	1929.85	B	PhD	s^bs	-1	0	i think what morgan thing is the easier it is the more is going to be bleeped 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact882	1926.66	1927.19	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	i think what morgan thing is the easier 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact884	1930.4	1933.05	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	and and it really depends on what kind of research are doing i think some 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact885	1933.56	1941.73	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	i think some researchers are going to be working with this corpus years from now are really going to be cursing the fact that there's a bunch of stuff in there that's missing from the dialogue 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact886	1941.76	1942.05	C	Grad	b	-1	0	the dialogue yeah it depends on the 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact887	1942.33	1944.05	E	Professor	s^r	-1	0	yeah it depends on the kind of research they're doing that it might be 
Bmr014.A.dialogueact888	1942.9	1943.27	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah it depends on the kind of research they're doing 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact889	1944.05	1947.63	E	Professor	s	-1	0	that it might be uh it might be really of a pain 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact890	1948.36	1951.9	E	Professor	s	+1	0	and you know where it's really going to hurt somebody in some ways the 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact891	1951.9	1957.9	E	Professor	s	+1	0	in some ways the one who said it or someone who speaks spoken about we definitely want to allow the option of of being bleeped out 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact892	1958.26	1961.72	E	Professor	s	+1	1	but i really think we want to make it a rare 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact893	1962.37	1966.81	E	Professor	s	+1	1	and and uh i mean i'm just a little worry about making it so easy for people to do and so 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact894	1966.81	1970.34	E	Professor	s	-1	0	for people to do and so much fun that they're going to go through and plead that stuff thinking about that 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact895	1969.52	1970.03	F	Postdoc	s^m	-1	0	go through and plead that stuff thinking about that 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact896	1970.53	1972.1	E	Professor	s	-1	0	stuff thinking about that stuff they don't like to write from somebody else 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact897	1972.1	1972.28	E	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	write from somebody else 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact898	1972.28	1973.52	E	Professor	s	-1	0	write from somebody else as you say you know so 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact899	1973.52	1975.43	E	Professor	s^e	-1	0	well i don't see any way of avoiding as you say you know so like likely he said 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact900	1974.58	1976.39	C	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	well i don't see any way of avoiding that like likely he said 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact901	1977.18	1982.44	C	Grad	s	-1	0	it we have to provide we have promised that we would ride in the transcript and that they can remove bursts that they don't like 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact903	1983.66	1984.36	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	so that the no 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact902	1983.31	1983.49	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	so that the 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact904	1984.97	1985.95	E	Professor	s^bsc.%-	-1	0	the only question no no i i i don't 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact905	1985.6	1986.72	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	the only question is no i i i don't you've talked me into that 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact906	1985.95	1987.24	E	Professor	s	-1	0	the only question is no i i i don't you've talked me into that but i i just think 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact907	1987.24	1989.31	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	but i i just think that we should make 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact908	1990.9	1993.26	C	Grad	s^df^ng	-1	0	the problem is if it's harder for them it's also harder for me where's this web 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact909	1993.61	1995.78	C	Grad	s	-1	0	where's this web interface i just get email it's all 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact910	1995.78	1996.7	C	Grad	s	-1	0	get email it's all formatted it's all ready 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact911	1996.7	1998.65	C	Grad	s	-1	0	formatted it's all ready to go and i could just inserted so maybe you don't give them access to the 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact912	1997.43	2000.74	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	to go and i could just inserted so maybe you don't give them access to the weapon or face unless they really need it 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact914	2002.23	2003.27	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	so so so i'm sorry so i guess yeah 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact913	2001.9	2002.47	F	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	so so well i guess yeah 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact915	2002.63	2002.83	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	so so i guess yeah 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact916	2003.27	2003.59	E	Professor	s^fa	-1	0	so i'm sorry so 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact917	2003.59	2006.1	E	Professor	s	-1	0	so i'm sorry so so so maybe this is a way out of it you provide something that's 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact918	2003.96	2004.17	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	so i'm sorry so so so maybe this 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact919	2006.1	2008.9	E	Professor	s	-1	0	you provide something that's useful for you to do handle 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact920	2009.25	2011.81	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and useful for someone else if they need 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact921	2012.65	2019.24	E	Professor	s	-1	0	so you're well but i think the issue of privacy needs and so forth should be that uh they get access to this if they really need 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact922	2013.4	2013.58	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	well i think the issue 
Bmr014.B.dialogueact923	2019.86	2029.6	B	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	so you're saying that the the sequence would be more like first adam goes to the contact lists context m. b. a whatever their preferred method is to see if they want to review the meeting right 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact924	2029.82	2030.01	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	the meeting and then if they right 
Bmr014.B.dialogueact925	2030.55	2032.55	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and then if they don't you're done if 
Bmr014.B.dialogueact926	2032.88	2035.66	B	PhD	s	-1	0	you're done if they do then he provides them access to the website well 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact928	2036.0	2039.79	C	Grad	s	-1	0	or printed out for to some extent i have to do that anyway because i said we have to distribute passwords there's there

Bmr014.C.dialogueact935	2044.93	2045.43	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	only well but 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact934	2044.83	2045.19	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	only well but

Bmr014.C.dialogueact937	2046.41	2049.65	C	Grad	s	-1	0	if they want what i'm saying is that i can't just mail them the password because that's not secure so no no but 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact940	2049.99	2051.66	C	Grad	s	-1	0	not secure so they have to call me and ask no no but you aren't necessarily giving them

Bmr014.E.dialogueact942	2053.53	2057.32	E	Professor	s	-1	0	well we but we don't even necessarily need and it's turning passwords at all 
Bmr014.A.dialogueact943	2054.58	2054.67	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	we don't even necessarily 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact944	2057.75	2058.93	C	Grad	s^na	-1	0	well we do because of privacy we 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact945	2058.93	2060.92	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	do because of privacy we can't just make it openly available on the web no no you're missing 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact946	2060.45	2060.69	E	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	available on the web no no you're missing 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact947	2060.69	2061.55	E	Professor	s	-1	0	available on the web no no you're missing the point 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact948	2060.89	2061.13	F	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	available on the web no no you're missing the point 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact949	2062.11	2069.47	E	Professor	s	-1	0	where we're trying to we're trying to make it less of an obvious just do uh fall off a log to do this not 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact950	2069.92	2071.95	F	Postdoc	s^bs	-1	0	this right so not everyone gets a password unless they ask 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact951	2071.17	2071.44	E	Professor	qy^f^rt	-1	0	right so unless they ask 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact952	2071.91	2078.99	E	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	right so so what i would see is that first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for that not unless they ask 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact953	2072.56	2072.69	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	so what 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact954	2078.99	2079.91	E	Professor	s	-1	0	to check for that not just for fun 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact955	2080.73	2081.08	E	Professor	qy^f	-1	0	okay but to to to 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact956	2081.08	2089.44	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but to to to check this for uh things that they're worried about having said or if they're willing to just send approval of it it from their memory 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact957	2090.29	2095.91	E	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	um and uh and we should think carefully actually we should review go through how that's worded 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact958	2096.26	2096.61	E	Professor	qy^f^rt	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact959	2097.44	2101.66	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yes someone it uh wants to review it uh and 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact960	2101.71	2106.21	E	Professor	s^df|s^cs	-1	0	uh and i know you don't like this so offering this is a suggestion is that is that we've been given a printout 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact961	2107.36	2118.41	E	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	but the the problem with what you're suggesting and then if they say that i have a potential problem in these things and you you say okay we might want to hear this in context and think if you need that you should them the password in the 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact962	2117.58	2122.03	C	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	but the the problem with what you're suggesting is not just inconvenient for them it's inconvenient for me because that in the 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact963	2122.77	2128.65	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because that means multiple contacts every time for every single meeting every time anybody wants anything 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact964	2129.52	2133.45	C	Grad	s^cs^df	-1	0	i would much prefer to have it all be automatic they visit the website if they want to obviously 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact965	2133.88	2134.97	C	Grad	s	-1	0	to obviously they don't have to 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact966	2135.26	2136.86	E	Professor	s^aap|s^arp.%-	-1	0	i know you prefer the problem we 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact968	2137.15	2137.25	C	Grad	b	-1	0	so i think have there's a problem 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact967	2136.86	2137.19	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	so i think the problem we have there's a problem 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact970	2137.64	2142.52	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so i think you're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeding and i just don't think that's going to happen have there's a problem 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact969	2137.19	2138.07	E	Professor	s	-1	0	so i think you're thinking people have there's a problem 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact971	2143.05	2146.49	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i'm also concerned about the spirit of uh uh the informed consent thing because i think 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact972	2146.49	2150.44	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	thing because i think if they feel that uh it's i i you know if it turns 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact973	2150.44	2162.94	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i you know if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and didn't attacked then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn't pursue that next level and get the password and do that 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact974	2163.5	2171.11	F	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	but but they might be able to argue oh well it was cumbersome and i was busy and was going to take me too much time to trace it down so it could be at the 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact975	2171.11	2173.38	F	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	so it could be at the burden would come back on to us some little bit worried 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact976	2173.38	2176.86	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	we can go too far in that to us some little bit worried about uh making it harder for them from a legal standpoint 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact977	2175.61	2179.61	E	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	it seems we can go too far in that direction and need to find somewhere between i think because it harder for them from a legal standpoint 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact978	2177.89	2178.18	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	direction and need to find somewhere between 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact980	2179.74	2185.78	C	Grad	s	-1	0	it seems to me that sending them e. mail saying if you haven't okay okay so replies a female and say okay i think because 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact979	2179.68	2180.18	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	it seems to me that sending them e. i think because 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact981	2181.72	2182.19	E	Professor	b	-1	0	mail saying 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact982	2185.78	2188.72	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and say okay if you have a problem with it contact me and i'll give you a password 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact983	2189.38	2192.62	C	Grad	s	-1	0	seems like a perfectly reasonable compromise and if they want 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact984	2192.62	2194.75	C	Grad	s	-1	0	compromise and if they want to print out they can print it out themselves 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact985	2195.38	2196.4	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	or we could print up for them i mean could that 
Bmr014.A.dialogueact987	2196.67	2196.94	A	PhD	b	-1	0	for them i mean could that 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact986	2196.4	2197.13	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	for them i mean could that but but there's uh 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact988	2197.28	2207.79	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but but there's uh another aspect of and then is that in the informed consent form um my impression is that they that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript and 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact989	2207.79	2209.23	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	the transcript and i i don't know that there's

Bmr014.F.dialogueact992	2212.58	2213.65	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	mean i thought that you were made denison

Bmr014.E.dialogueact1094	2384.84	2385.61	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	all right so i think yeah so 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact1095	2385.69	2387.26	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so i think yeah so if we have if it again it's you know sort 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact1096	2387.26	2392.11	E	Professor	s	+1	1	well since you it again it's you know sort of circulate the the wording in each of these things and get it right but 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact1098	2392.67	2396.93	C	Grad	qy^rt	+1	0	well since you seem to feel market uh strongest about it would you like to do the first half but 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact1097	2392.3	2393.28	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	well since you seem to feel market uh but 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact1099	2397.73	2398.0	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact1100	2399.51	2400.67	E	Professor	s	-1	0	fair enough 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact1101	2401.54	2402.34	E	Professor	s	-1	0	turnabout script like oh so it 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact1102	2402.01	2411.09	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yeah like oh so it it there's this other question the legal question that that has raised about whether we need a concrete signature or e. mail pick suffices or whatever i don't know how that works it 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact1103	2403.31	2403.46	E	Professor	s^fa.x	-1	0	it there's this other question 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact1104	2409.41	2409.6	C	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah e. mail pick 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact1105	2411.09	2411.95	F	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	i don't know how that works it 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact1106	2411.95	2414.62	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	i don't i'm i'm i i don't know how that works it and there's something down there about if you agree too 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact1107	2414.19	2418.93	E	Professor	s	-1	0	i don't think so i'm i'm i i thought i i thought about it was one of my background prophecies and agree too 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact1108	2414.82	2415.75	C	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	i don't think so i'm i'm i i thought i i agree too 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact1109	2418.93	2422.79	E	Professor	s	-1	0	prophecies and uh it's yeah it's uh it's fine to be 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact1110	2420.45	2420.67	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	yeah it's 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact1111	2423.1	2423.64	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact1114	2424.11	2429.98	C	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	it because that that they're signing here that they were agreeing to the paragraph which says you'll be given an opportunity 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact1113	2423.81	2424.19	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	it because that that they're 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact1112	2423.78	2423.96	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact1115	2424.48	2424.73	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	it because that that they're 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact1116	2430.13	2430.31	E	Professor	b	-1	0	and so i 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact1118	2430.76	2432.7	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and so i don't think they need another signature well and 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact1117	2430.68	2430.98	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	and so i 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact1119	2432.77	2434.05	E	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	signature well and furthermore i it's now fairly routine 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact1120	2434.05	2439.06	E	Professor	s	-1	0	it's now fairly routine a lot of arrangements that i do with people on contracts and so forth that that uh if 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact1121	2439.06	2448.46	E	Professor	s	-1	0	that that uh if it's if it's that sort of thing where you're you're saying uh okay i agree we want to eighty hours of this person that's that's that's a mountain i agree that's okay uh 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact1122	2448.9	2453.63	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	right okay uh if it's a follow up to some other reading where there's a signature it's often done any mail 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact1123	2451.96	2452.18	C	Grad	b	-1	0	right reading where there's a signature it's often done any 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact1124	2453.81	2455.0	E	Professor	s	-1	0	mail 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact1125	2455.25	2455.49	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact1126	2456.33	2456.82	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact1127	2459.68	2464.48	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so i guess i probably should at the minimum think about how to present it in a printed form 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact1128	2467.97	2469.24	C	Grad	s^no	-1	0	i'm not really sure what's best for the problem is a lot of 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact1129	2469.24	2470.87	C	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	for the problem is a lot of them are really short 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact1130	2469.68	2469.91	F	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	for the problem is a lot of 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact1131	2471.32	2473.34	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and so i don't necessarily want to do one per line 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact1133	2474.55	2475.69	C	Grad	s^no^r	-1	0	but i don't know how else to do it well i i also 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact1132	2474.45	2474.95	F	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	but i don't know how well i 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact1134	2475.62	2476.53	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	else to do it i also have this i i think it's 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact1135	2476.53	2485.7	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	have this i i think it's nice yeah but uh you both her here ball on the on the web for those who might wonder about the non non verbal signed mean 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact1136	2485.7	2488.95	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	signed mean i greeted are by should be as as expressed here 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact1137	2489.19	2492.23	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but i i think it's nice to person could check sometimes you know you 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact1138	2492.23	2499.07	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	check sometimes you know you the words on the on the page come out so sounding different terms of the social dynamics of the here and i realize we shouldn't 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact1139	2496.74	2496.91	C	Grad	b	-1	0	different terms 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact1140	2497.97	2498.41	E	Professor	b	-1	0	of the social dynamics of the here 
Bmr014.E.dialogueact1142	2499.13	2499.75	E	Professor	b	-1	0	and i realize we shouldn't 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact1141	2499.07	2502.77	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and i realize we shouldn't emphasize the people you know shouldn't borrow trouble comes 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact1143	2502.83	2503.66	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	yeah i think i actually borrow trouble comes into it 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact1144	2503.37	2504.27	C	Grad	%--	-1	0	yeah i think i actually my pin into it 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact1145	2504.57	2511.06	C	Grad	s	-1	0	my pin probably is that the only time someone will need to listen to it is if the transcript is uh not good you know if 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact1146	2511.44	2514.9	C	Grad	s	-1	0	you know if there are lots of mumbled in parentheses and things like that oh you 
Bmr014.F.dialogueact1147	2514.65	2525.26	F	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	and things like that right that was all mumbled i think myself uh oh you know or what if there was an error in the transcript that didn't get detected and there was a whole uh segment ache against some personal 
Bmr014.C.dialogueact1148	2517.08	2517.33	C	Grad	b	-1	0	that didn't get detected
