Bed003.B.dialogueact234	433.857	434.077	B	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	that they should use right but the middle 
Bed003.B.dialogueact235	434.077	444.434	B	Grad	s	+1	2	but the middle thing we were thinking along lines of maybe trying to you figure out like the concept of whether a tourist or whether they're running an errand or something like that along those lines 
Bed003.B.dialogueact236	444.434	445.174	B	Grad	s	-1	0	like that along those lines

Bed003.B.dialogueact238	448.55	451.65	B	Grad	s^aa|s	+1	0	yes because things you could expect from the data that hidden variables yes

Bed003.B.dialogueact242	463.436	469.763	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	because we were thinking uh they're in a hurry there'd be less likely day like it one two just

Bed003.C.dialogueact453	813.34	814.02	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah it does okay so 
Bed003.D.dialogueact454	814.067	814.437	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay so 
Bed003.D.dialogueact455	814.807	817.127	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	everything is probably like okay so then you just have some probabilities of over okay or which

Bed003.C.dialogueact457	816.567	818.276	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	like some probabilities of over okay or which which of those is 
Bed003.D.dialogueact458	817.127	817.437	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay or which 
Bed003.D.dialogueact459	817.707	819.057	D	Grad	s	-1	0	okay or which which of those is

Bed003.C.dialogueact461	820.8	821.61	C	Grad	h|s^bk	-1	0	um right so then that

Bed003.C.dialogueact466	825.01	826.05	C	Grad	s	-1	0	now we don't get the values but in general they would be 
Bed003.C.dialogueact467	826.05	830.27	C	Grad	s	-1	0	but in general they would be a properties which overalls birds

Bed003.C.dialogueact748	1254.82	1255.02	C	Grad	h	-1	0	yeah it's it's it's an issue 
Bed003.C.dialogueact749	1255.02	1256.03	C	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	it's it's an issue right like

Bed003.B.dialogueact1204	2016.81	2017.64	B	Grad	s^t1.%-	-1	0	and actually as 
Bed003.B.dialogueact1205	2018.05	2019.26	B	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	i know last my car so 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1206	2019.82	2025.22	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so it's more general thing then discussed admission fee um could be i get just wondering 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1207	2025.22	2030.43	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i get just wondering whether the context the background context of the discourse might be i don't 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1208	2030.8	2031.3	D	Grad	s^no	-1	0	i don't know if there's a way to 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1209	2031.3	2034.51	D	Grad	s	-1	0	know if there's a way to fight it or maybe you know generalize in some way um 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1210	2034.82	2044.33	D	Grad	s:s	-1	0	way um there might be other cues that say um in the last few odder and says there's been something that strongly associate with say one of the particular modes 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1211	2045.17	2046.41	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	uh i don't know that might be 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1212	2046.49	2046.8	A	Grad	b	-1	0	be 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1214	2047.84	2048.26	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	i think we uh and in that note would be 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1213	2047.49	2051.75	D	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	i think we i uh and in that note would be various various things that that could specifically come up 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1215	2052.24	2054.78	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	think uh uh sort of general strategy here 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1216	2055.63	2060.15	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	you know this is this is accent because um it it's just taking all these terms just that maybe 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1217	2060.15	2070.9	A	Grad	s^rt	+1	3	just that maybe we took we could observe a couple of discourse phenomena such s. b. admission fee 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1218	2071.42	2076.31	A	Grad	s	+1	0	and something else and something else that happened in the discourse before 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1219	2075.14	2075.44	D	Grad	b	-1	0	in the discourse before 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1220	2076.36	2076.61	D	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed003.A.dialogueact1221	2077.07	2079.56	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and uh it's making those for 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1222	2080.58	2083.34	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and maybe they are tool 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1223	2085.36	2093.3	A	Grad	s	+1	2	so maybe this couldn't be of a separates region off the net which has tool has its own mid layer maybe 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1224	2094.0	2100.73	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	this you know it has some sucky thing that this if this 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1225	2100.74	2101.15	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	thing that this if this and this may influence 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1226	2101.16	2104.17	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and this may influence these hidden notes of the discourse which is maybe 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1227	2104.16	2114.66	A	Grad	s	+1	0	which is maybe something that is um what gen version of the actual phenomenon that you can observe so things 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1228	2114.66	2117.74	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	observe so things that point towards so instead of a single 
Bed003.B.dialogueact1229	2117.44	2121.5	B	Grad	s^bs.%--:s.%--	-1	0	so instead of a single noted for like if they said the word admission fee exactly yeah 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1230	2121.3	2121.67	D	Grad	b	-1	0	fee exactly yeah 
Bed003.B.dialogueact1232	2122.11	2125.24	B	Grad	s	-1	0	admission fee or maybe you know how much to enter or you know something 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1231	2121.67	2122.0	D	Grad	b	-1	0	fee admission fee or exactly yeah 
Bed003.B.dialogueact1233	2125.24	2126.51	B	Grad	s	-1	0	or you know something other opening 
Bed003.B.dialogueact1235	2126.79	2127.51	B	Grad	s	-1	0	other cues exactly opening hours or something 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1234	2126.76	2128.52	D	Grad	s^2^rt	-1	0	other cues exactly they would opening hours or something like that 
Bed003.B.dialogueact1236	2127.62	2128.29	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	cues exactly they would hours or something like that 
Bed003.B.dialogueact1237	2128.84	2134.02	B	Grad	s	+1	1	so if uh they said they would also funnel into one know that would constitute entrance requirements or something like that like that 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1238	2133.54	2134.72	A	Grad	s^bu.%-:s.%-	-1	0	so if uh they said or something like that 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1239	2133.68	2134.0	D	Grad	b	-1	0	so if uh they said or something like that 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1240	2136.0	2136.73	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	i mean 
Bed003.C.dialogueact1241	2136.11	2136.35	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	i mean 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1243	2136.82	2137.07	A	Grad	qy^bh	-1	0	i mean it sort of get 
Bed003.C.dialogueact1242	2136.44	2136.63	C	Grad	b	-1	0	i mean 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1244	2136.97	2140.86	D	Grad	s	+1	0	i mean it sort of get into plan recognition kinds of things in the discourse and it's 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1245	2140.86	2144.41	D	Grad	s	-1	0	expecting it and then maybe destined discourse in the discourse and it's it's the bigger 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1246	2141.57	2142.03	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	expecting it and then it's the bigger 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1247	2142.13	2142.31	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	it and then 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1248	2142.73	2147.25	A	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	it and then maybe destined discourse acts if they had before and 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1249	2147.77	2153.88	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and it's more for um q. that the person actually once i get some whereas in that 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1250	2153.88	2155.61	A	Grad	s	-1	0	get some whereas in that you're in a in a in a rowlett's um 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1251	2155.82	2159.14	A	Grad	s	-1	0	a rowlett's um sort of proceeding past these things so this would be 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1252	2159.14	2165.13	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so this would be just something that where you want to 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1253	2165.82	2165.97	A	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed003.A.dialogueact1254	2166.76	2167.21	A	Grad	qy^d^g	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed003.A.dialogueact1255	2170.92	2172.7	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	oh i have a self course stan 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1256	2173.46	2178.97	A	Grad	s	-1	0	be the know what's the obsessed no it's for you or mentally or 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1257	2179.17	2184.69	A	Grad	s:s	-1	0	so this again punch to find a destination doing business truest hurry and so forth okay

Bed003.A.dialogueact1260	2186.01	2186.2	A	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	and so 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1261	2186.66	2188.17	A	Grad	s:s	-1	0	and so then we can say okay we have a whole 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1262	2188.17	2192.26	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	we have a whole region that's the whole setup discourse related cues to your middle there

Bed003.A.dialogueact1267	2195.51	2202.95	A	Grad	s	-1	0	want to it because at the end the more we um add you know the more spider web is just going to become in the middle of the more of and and the thing it's 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1268	2202.95	2204.23	A	Grad	s	-1	0	of and and the thing it's going to get very active this 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1269	2204.8	2207.8	A	Grad	s	-1	0	this way we can say okay these conducive but disco cinnamon and they may 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1270	2207.8	2215.15	A	Grad	s	+1	3	disco cinnamon and they may may have their own hidden they are that points to some of the the real do today or um of the general had there and the same

Bed003.A.dialogueact1272	2215.7	2220.07	A	Grad	s	+1	0	and the same we will be able to do for some tactic information the burbs used 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1273	2220.07	2223.2	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	the burbs used the optic types used modify errors and maybe there's 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1274	2223.47	2225.46	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and maybe there's a hidden there for that and so something

Bed003.A.dialogueact1276	2225.46	2226.33	A	Grad	s	-1	0	for that and so something something grip context

Bed003.B.dialogueact1285	2245.11	2250.82	B	Grad	s	+1	1	i guess the fact that the there's a complete separation between the observed features and then the output

Bed003.C.dialogueact1294	2271.27	2271.57	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	yeah or because 
Bed003.C.dialogueact1295	2271.57	2274.61	C	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	yeah or because like i'd more uh middle of those like could get out

Bed003.A.dialogueact1358	2404.69	2408.2	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	the first thing we get is that already the intention is sort of they tried to figure 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1359	2408.2	2409.7	A	Grad	s	-1	0	they tried to figure our contention rights

Bed003.A.dialogueact1362	2412.02	2416.17	A	Grad	s	+1	1	this um it won't differentiate between it's uh but i do said 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1363	2416.23	2416.42	A	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	uh but i do said 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1364	2416.42	2419.11	A	Grad	s.%--	+1	0	uh but i do said it tell us okay here we have something that somebody that wants

Bed003.A.dialogueact1367	2427.82	2432.22	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and then if the discourse takes a couple of turns before everything all the information is needed what happens 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1368	2432.86	2434.85	A	Grad	s^rt	+1	0	what happens is you know the pasta pasta said and 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1369	2434.85	2442.02	A	Grad	s	+1	1	pasta said and then attended onto the discourse history which is and um one of the most elaborate leverage much of it's it's it's actually the the 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1370	2442.02	2449.27	A	Grad	s	-1	0	it's it's actually the the whole of memory of the entire system and knows what will was said watch which was what was presented to taps and and 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1371	2449.27	2455.2	A	Grad	s	+1	1	to taps and and enough for a solution and it and it fails in all the structures that are make tips so 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1372	2455.86	2457.25	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so and because 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1373	2458.03	2460.72	A	Grad	s:qw	-1	0	you say okay okay i get to the castle on 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1374	2460.94	2462.7	A	Grad	s:qw	-1	0	the castle on how how much is it 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1375	2463.18	2469.25	A	Grad	s:s	-1	0	and um yeah i would like uh um tube let's do it and so forth so even without in 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1376	2469.25	2476.57	A	Grad	s	-1	0	forth so even without in and not not for somebody has to make sure that information we had only on is still here 
Bed003.B.dialogueact1377	2477.06	2477.48	B	Grad	b	-1	0	gus not 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1378	2477.59	2480.49	A	Grad	s	-1	0	gus not every macho keeps of memory of everything that happened 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1379	2481.11	2486.51	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so whenever d. uh um person is not actually we checking what happened before as 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1380	2486.88	2489.83	A	Grad	s:s	-1	0	before as an no i really don't want to see that movie

Bed003.A.dialogueact1382	2492.37	2505.81	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um what movie was selected and what's in the mind what town it's it's going to be sort of added into the disk into the be representations of everything and it's a lock up the school smart or is this 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1383	2505.81	2506.6	A	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	this 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1384	2507.68	2511.38	A	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	and um it does some help any n. f. l. resolution and it also 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1385	2511.38	2516.62	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and it also helps in coordinate seeing the gesture screen issue so 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1386	2516.62	2519.5	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	issue so person parking to something on the screen you know the discourse 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1388	2519.67	2524.04	A	Grad	s	+1	0	you know the discourse much actually stores what was presented and what location on this on the screen so it's it's rather huge 
Bed003.B.dialogueact1387	2519.46	2519.96	B	Grad	b	-1	0	you know the discourse 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1389	2524.04	2526.52	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so it's it's rather huge interesting but um 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1390	2526.52	2531.98	A	Grad	fh|s.%--	-1	0	interesting but um um we can sort of 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1391	2531.98	2533.34	A	Grad	s	-1	0	can sort of as a very character fish we can quarry 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1392	2533.34	2538.05	A	Grad	s	+1	0	fish we can quarry it weathered admissions peas were discussed last turned and and the turn before

Bed003.B.dialogueact1395	2541.03	2541.29	B	Grad	b	-1	0	deeply want

Bed003.A.dialogueact1398	2545.76	2546.13	A	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	you do we want to search you know 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1399	2547.08	2552.85	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um but we should just try to keep in mind that you were doing this sort of for research so we 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1400	2552.85	2558.25	A	Grad	s	-1	0	research so we we should kind of image that's reasonable not go all the way back to adam and eve you know to the person

Bed003.D.dialogueact1405	2570.88	2579.75	D	Grad	s	+1	1	so one thing that might be helpful which is implicit in the use of admission fee discussion as a cue for entry is thinking about the plans that there's people might have like 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1406	2579.94	2583.05	D	Grad	s	-1	0	might have like all the different so general scheme is that they might be following okay this person

Bed003.D.dialogueact1409	2592.09	2600.46	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	um because then anything that's a cue for one of the steps would be like evidence for that overall plan um

Bed003.D.dialogueact1529	2798.49	2804.68	D	Grad	s^bu	+1	0	so by the way that that structured but robert on the board is like more um q. type based right here's 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1530	2804.68	2804.9	D	Grad	qy^d^g	-1	0	based right here's 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1531	2804.9	2808.17	D	Grad	s	-1	0	based right here's like you were going to segment off a bit of stuff that comes from discourse and then 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1532	2808.48	2810.87	D	Grad	s.%--	+1	0	and then some of things we're talking about here more 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1533	2811.05	2814.77	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	you know we mentioned maybe if they talk about um i don't 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1534	2814.77	2815.18	D	Grad	s^no	-1	0	um i don't know entering or something like 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1535	2815.18	2817.83	D	Grad	s^rt	+1	1	know entering or something like they might be more task based 
Bed003.B.dialogueact1536	2817.99	2818.26	B	Grad	b	-1	0	based so i i don't know 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1537	2818.18	2824.36	D	Grad	s^no	-1	0	i think that so i i don't know there's obviously some more than one way of organizing the variables in something so 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1539	2824.64	2832.26	A	Grad	s	-1	0	i think that um where'd you guys did this brilliant nicely sketching out different tasks and maybe some their conditions one task it's so 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1538	2824.36	2824.74	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	i think that so 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1540	2830.24	2830.6	D	Grad	b	-1	0	and maybe 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1541	2832.26	2837.29	A	Grad	s	-1	0	one task it's more like a you're in a hurry when you do that kind of doing business and and that's in a 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1542	2832.33	2832.77	D	Grad	b	-1	0	one task it's 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1543	2837.29	2839.44	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and and that's in a hurry rendered at first 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1544	2841.31	2846.99	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um terrorist may have never have time to destinations you know because they're totally traveling around so 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1545	2847.08	2855.43	A	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	maybe what what what happened what might happen if if we do get the sort of task based middle of they are and then 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1546	2853.4	2854.1	D	Grad	b	-1	0	of task based middle of 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1548	2855.83	2858.76	A	Grad	s	-1	0	they are and then we get to stop mid layer cinema q. based that feed into those 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1547	2855.5	2856.13	D	Grad	b	-1	0	they are and then we get to stop mid

Bed003.A.dialogueact1550	2859.9	2860.02	A	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	might be

Bed003.A.dialogueact1748	3266.8	3267.17	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	the technical issue yes except resist 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1749	3267.17	3270.88	A	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	except resist i think we still need a a recording device for the wizard 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1750	3271.53	3273.39	A	Grad	s^e^rt	-1	0	just a tape recorder that sprung a room but 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1751	3271.96	3272.29	D	Grad	b	-1	0	just a tape recorder that sprung 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1752	3273.87	3280.98	A	Grad	s	+1	2	a room but um in terms of specify in the scenario um the beefed up and it just further but 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1753	3277.66	3277.98	D	Grad	b	-1	0	scenario 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1754	3281.08	3286.71	A	Grad	fh|s^rt	+1	0	um we wanted to wait on too we know who is the wizard and 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1755	3286.7	3291.51	A	Grad	s	+1	0	the wizard and have the wizard partake in the that's the image of definition pro so so 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1756	3291.85	3303.81	A	Grad	s	+1	0	pro so so if if on tried it turns out that she really likes it i mean we really like earth then nothing's going to stop us from sitting down next weekend getting all the details completely figured out 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1757	3303.43	3303.81	D	Grad	b	-1	0	figured out 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1758	3305.71	3306.7	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed003.D.dialogueact1759	3308.22	3308.52	D	Grad	fg	-1	0	okay so the 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1760	3308.85	3311.66	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	okay so the ideal task um will have whatever i 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1761	3311.86	3317.23	D	Grad	s^no.%--	-1	0	whatever i don't know how much the structure of the evolving base that will it affect like we want we want 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1762	3317.23	3321.38	D	Grad	s^bu	+1	1	like we want we want to be able to collect as much of the variables that are needed for that 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1763	3322.01	3328.19	A	Grad	h|s.%--	-1	0	some it right in the course of the task when all of them but you know 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1764	3322.15	3322.4	D	Grad	qy^d^g	-1	0	right in the 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1765	3322.69	3324.09	D	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right in the course of the task 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1766	3325.74	3326.39	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	when all of them but you know 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1767	3326.39	3326.86	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	of them but you know 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1768	3328.7	3338.21	A	Grad	s	+1	0	it i mean this tango and for this uh is sort of it's self and add talk scenario 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1769	3334.63	3335.0	D	Grad	b	-1	0	this uh is sort of it's 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1770	3338.3	3338.68	D	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed003.A.dialogueact1771	3339.7	3346.43	A	Grad	s	+1	0	the the basic um idea behind the uh data connection with the funding 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1772	3347.57	3351.28	A	Grad	s	+1	0	the day that we get from munich is very command line simple 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1773	3351.38	3353.34	A	Grad	s	-1	0	simple linguistics stuff 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1774	3352.83	3353.27	D	Grad	b	-1	0	linguistics stuff 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1775	3354.05	3355.92	A	Grad	s	-1	0	hardly anything complicated 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1776	3356.45	3358.0	A	Grad	s	-1	0	nomadic force whatsoever not 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1777	3357.84	3358.15	D	Grad	b	-1	0	force whatsoever not 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1778	3358.95	3360.35	A	Grad	s	+1	0	not the rich language 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1779	3361.25	3369.53	A	Grad	s	+1	1	so we wanted just to collect data to get that that that this it's more uh the that it this is richard language 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1780	3367.64	3368.1	D	Grad	b	-1	0	the that it this is richard language 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1781	3370.52	3373.57	A	Grad	s	+1	0	and we actually did not want to constrain it too much 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1782	3372.43	3372.93	D	Grad	b	-1	0	it 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1783	3373.57	3374.2	A	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	too much and to see what people 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1784	3374.2	3375.31	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and to see what people say and then maybe 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1785	3375.71	3383.14	A	Grad	s	-1	0	say and then maybe we discovered the phenomenon the phenomenon that we want to solve know with whatever engines we we come up with 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1786	3384.06	3389.42	A	Grad	fh|s	+1	0	so this this this is a parallel track you know they're okay 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1788	3389.42	3391.4	A	Grad	s	-1	0	you know they're they're hopefully meet that okay so in other words the question 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1787	3389.35	3389.77	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	you know they're okay 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1789	3390.88	3393.45	D	Grad	s^bs	-1	0	they're hopefully meet that says so in other words the question is more general could it could 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1790	3391.97	3392.48	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	meet that says in other words the question is more general 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1791	3393.45	3396.95	D	Grad	s	-1	0	it should tell us you know what kind of phenomenon could it could be used for not just this past 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1792	3394.92	3398.39	A	Grad	s	-1	0	it should tell us you know what kind of phenomenon clip encouraging tennis be used for not just this past 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1793	3398.39	3405.31	A	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	tennis also maybe something about the difference between people who think they speak to a computer with people don't think just because you being at the foot of differences 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1794	3404.15	3404.63	D	Grad	b	-1	0	think just because you 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1795	3405.31	3406.63	A	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	being at the foot of differences there 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1796	3407.5	3416.03	A	Grad	s	+1	0	so it may get us some more information on the human machine pragmatics that no one knows anything about as was yesterday 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1797	3417.16	3419.5	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and uh and since then so 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1798	3419.66	3419.83	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	then so 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1799	3421.21	3427.42	A	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	uh and secondly now that of course we have sort of started to lick not to read this and especially 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1800	3427.71	3435.68	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and especially since um autocad stop tingling we may actually into it you know those those intentions 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1801	3436.23	3441.96	A	Grad	s^cs.%--	+1	1	so no i think we should maybe have at least one of additional task with with explicit that 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1802	3440.43	3441.08	D	Grad	b	-1	0	with explicit that 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1803	3442.07	3444.77	A	Grad	s^bsc	+1	0	not x. is interested that the personal centric 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1804	3444.82	3445.19	D	Grad	b	-1	0	centric 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1805	3445.92	3448.83	A	Grad	s^cs	+1	0	and maybe some task where it's more or less explicit 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1806	3449.82	3451.35	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	that the person wants to take a picture 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1807	3451.61	3451.85	D	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed003.A.dialogueact1808	3452.17	3455.5	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	or see it's or 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1809	3457.65	3458.63	A	Grad	s	+1	0	so that we can maybe that time and 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1810	3458.63	3460.63	A	Grad	s	-1	0	can maybe that time and that's work get a coke syrup and they will 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1811	3459.96	3460.4	D	Grad	b	-1	0	that's work get a coke syrup and they will 
Bed003.D.dialogueact1812	3460.56	3460.88	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	and they will 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1813	3461.74	3465.2	A	Grad	s	-1	0	whereas you know if we just get they don't we never know what they actually want it to get 
Bed003.A.dialogueact1814	3465.77	3466.48	A	Grad	s	-1	0	it to get the juice
