Although there is an effort to include some of the key features of the belief-net in the design of the data gathering , not all of them can be built in.
The tasks that the subjects will have to carry out will be categorised in ways that will indicate EVA intentions , however , this approach may limit the variety of possible constructions used within a single category of entities.
On the other hand , generating more diverse dialogues may have an adverse effect from a speech recognition perspective.
A minor problem has arisen with the laboratory where recordings are supposed to take place , but this is currently being sorted out.
As regards the completion of the belief-net , no work has been done on the CPT's yet.
Finally , it was noted that although a general overview of the pertinent constructions is attainable , no more than ten of them can be analysed in detail with the summer months.
