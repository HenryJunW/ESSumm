Topics discussed by the Berkeley Meeting Recorder group included the status of the first test set of digits data , naming conventions for files , speaker identification tags , and encoding files with details about the recording.
The group also discussed a proposal for a grant from the NSF's ITR ( Information Technology Research ) program , transcriptions , and efforts by speaker mn005 to detect speaker overlap using harmonicity-related features.
Particular focus was paid to questions about transcription procedures , i.e . how to deal with overlooked backchannels , and audible breaths.
