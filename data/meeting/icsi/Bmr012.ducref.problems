During recognition procedures , a fixable acoustic glitch was discovered that causes speech channels to become slightly asynchronized.
Poorer recognition performance was yielded for speech recorded via the use of lapel microphones.
Recognition errors were largely due to misrecogniton of the plural -s and out-of-vocabulary items.
The current recording setup is limited in that not all BMR meeting participants have their own close-talking microphone.
