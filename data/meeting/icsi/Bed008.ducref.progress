A simulator of the set of influence links forming the belief-net was created and put up for discussion.
Different sections of the analysis , such as the user model , the ontology and the discourse are represented as a layer of nodes each with its own EVA probabilities.
They form endpoints to which other nodes like Go-there , User_Budget , User_Thrift and Prosody feed into.
The second presentation concerned the set of computational rules that are to be used with the net.
The simple way to decide on the final output is the majority vote ( which E , V or A form the majority of the parent nodes' outputs ).
This assumes that all inputs are of equal importance.
Alternatively , each input can be weighted in a fixed way.
A third option is to create a hidden variable that makes the decision of which of the inputs is more trusted in a particular situation.
The same variable can potentially also change the weighting of each input.
