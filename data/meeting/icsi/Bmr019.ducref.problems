Digits training needs to be performed on a larger data set.
A significant loss in recognition resulted from not having included the type of phone-loop adaptation found in the SRI system.
Recognition performance was worse for digits recorded in closed microphone conditions versus those recorded in a studio ( e.g . TI-digits ).
A mismatch between the manner in which data were collected and the models used for doing recognition---e.g . bandwidth parameterization and the use of near- versus far-field microphones---was identified.
Too little data per speaker can have a negative effect on VTL estimation.
The PZM channel selected for obtaining digits data was too far away from most of the speakers.
Current speech alignment techniques assume that foreground speech must be continuous and , barring some isolated words and backchannels , can not cope with overlapping background speech.
Performing adaptations on both the foreground and background speaker produced a new variety of misalignments , a problem resulting , in part , from the fact that background speakers often match better to foreground conditionss.
Transcribers occasionally misidentified speakers and omitted backchannels that were more hidden in the mixed signal.
