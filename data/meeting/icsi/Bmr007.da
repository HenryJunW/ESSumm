Bmr007.D.dialogueact40	46.03	54.078	D	Professor	s^t	-1	0	s OK , so one item for an agenda is uh {pause} Jane has some uh {vocalsound} uh some research to talk about , research issues .

Bmr007.D.dialogueact59	104.405	106.125	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Sort of off - topic I guess .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact61	106.269	106.679	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact60	106.125	108.085	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Cuz that 's {pause} Cuz that was all {disfmarker} all about the , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr007.D.dialogueact62	108.305	110.905	D	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I can chat with you about that {pause} off - line .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact63	110.905	111.625	D	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's another thing .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact64	112.382	117.018	D	Professor	fh|qo^d^rt	-1	0	Um , And , Anything else ?
Bmr007.D.dialogueact65	117.018	118.248	D	Professor	qo^d	-1	0	Nothing else ?
Bmr007.D.dialogueact66	118.853	129.803	D	Professor	fh|s^tc	-1	0	Uh , there 's a {disfmarker} I mean , there is a {disfmarker} {pause} a , um {pause} uh {pause} telephone call tomorrow , {pause} which will be a conference call {pause} that some of us are involved in {pause} for uh a possible proposal .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact67	130.548	133.478	D	Professor	s^co.%-	-1	0	Um , we 'll talk {disfmarker} we 'll talk about it next week if {disfmarker} if something {disfmarker}
Bmr007.H.dialogueact68	132.712	133.802	H	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Do you want me to {pause} be there for that ?
Bmr007.H.dialogueact69	133.802	136.262	H	Grad	s	-1	0	I noticed you C C ' ed me , but I wasn't actually a recipient .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact70	137.2	138.63	H	Grad	s	-1	0	I didn't quite know what to make of that .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact71	138.766	141.196	D	Professor	h|s^co	-1	0	Uh Well , we 'll talk {disfmarker} talk about that after our meeting .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact73	141.456	141.596	D	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact72	141.077	141.347	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact74	142.622	143.172	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	Uh , OK .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact75	143.172	154.162	D	Professor	s^bs^t^tc	-1	0	So it sounds like the {disfmarker} the three main things that we have to talk about are , uh this list , uh Jane and {disfmarker} Jane and Adam have some research items , and , other than that , anything , {pause} as usual , {pause} anything goes beyond that .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact76	155.019	158.799	D	Professor	s^bk|qh^co^t	-1	0	OK , uh , Jane , since {disfmarker} since you were sort of cut off last time why don't we start with yours ,
Bmr007.D.dialogueact77	158.799	159.659	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	make sure we get to it .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact78	159.93	164.14	F	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	OK , it 's {disfmarker} it 's very {pause} eh {disfmarker} it 's {pause} very brief , I mean {disfmarker} just let me {disfmarker} just hand these out .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact79	164.66	164.94	F	Postdoc	s^fe	-1	0	Oops .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact80	165.997	167.457	H	Grad	qr	-1	0	Is this the same as the email or different ?
Bmr007.C.dialogueact82	168.304	168.724	C	PhD	s^ft	-1	0	Thanks .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact81	167.878	168.758	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It 's slightly different .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact83	168.858	171.288	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} {pause} basically the same .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact84	168.931	169.121	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact85	171.154	171.704	A	PhD	qy^2^d^rt	-1	0	Same idea ?
Bmr007.F.dialogueact86	171.428	172.648	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	But , same idea .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact87	172.648	173.988	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So , if you 've looked at this you 've seen it before ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact88	173.988	180.878	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	so {pause} Basically , {vocalsound} um {pause} as you know , uh {pause} part of the encoding {pause} includes a mark that indicates {pause} an overlap .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact89	182.281	196.506	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	It 's not indicated {pause} with , um {pause} uh , tight precision , it 's just indicated that {disfmarker} OK , so , It 's indicated to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} so the people know {pause} what parts of sp which {disfmarker} which stretches of speech were in the clear , versus being overlapped by others .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact90	196.506	202.256	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	So , I {pause} used this mark and , um {pause} and , uh {pause} uh , {pause} divided the {disfmarker}
Bmr007.F.dialogueact91	202.586	210.106	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I wrote a script {pause} which divides things into individual minutes , {pause} of which we ended up with forty {pause} five , and a little bit .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact92	210.856	216.276	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And , uh {pause} you know , minute zero , of course , is the first minute up to {pause} sixty seconds .
Bmr007.C.dialogueact93	215.78	215.89	C	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact94	217.025	224.622	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	And , um {pause} What you can see is the number of overlaps {pause} and then {pause} to the right , {pause} whether they involve two speakers , three speakers , or more than three speakers .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact95	225.371	233.811	F	Postdoc	fh|s	+1	0	And , {pause} um {pause} and , what I was looking for sp sp specifically was the question of {pause} whether they 're distributed evenly throughout or whether they 're {pause} bursts of them .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact96	234.654	235.004	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact97	235.204	236.684	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And {pause} it looked to me as though {disfmarker}
Bmr007.F.dialogueact98	237.321	248.478	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	uh , you know {disfmarker} y this is just {disfmarker} {pause} eh {disfmarker} eh , this would {disfmarker} this is not statistically {pause} verified , {pause} but it {pause} did look to me as though there are bursts throughout , rather than being {pause} localized to a particular region .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact99	248.83	263.26	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	The part down there , where there 's the maximum number of {disfmarker} {pause} of , um {pause} overlaps is an area where we were discussing {pause} {vocalsound} whether or not it would be useful to indi to s to {pause} code {pause} stress , {pause} uh , sentence stress {pause} as possible indication of , uh {pause} information retrieval .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact100	263.38	265.91	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So it 's like , {pause} you know , rather , {pause} lively discussion there .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact101	266.313	271.733	D	Professor	qw	-1	0	What was {disfmarker} what 's the {disfmarker} the parenthesized stuff {pause} that says , like {disfmarker} e the first one that says six overlaps and then two point eight ?
Bmr007.F.dialogueact102	269.602	269.822	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact103	269.932	272.497	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	th {vocalsound} {pause} That 's the per cent .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact104	272.023	272.173	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact105	272.597	277.227	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So , six is , uh {pause} two point eight percent {pause} of the total number of overlaps in the {pause} session .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact106	273.698	274.108	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact107	276.294	276.934	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Ah .
Bmr007.C.dialogueact108	277.503	278.113	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact109	277.715	281.545	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	At the very end , this is when people were , {pause} you know , packing up to go basically ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact110	281.545	282.785	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	there 's {pause} this final stuff ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact111	282.785	284.835	F	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	I think we {disfmarker} {pause} I don't remember where the digits {pause} fell .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact112	284.835	285.575	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I 'd have to look at that .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact113	285.575	287.805	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But {pause} the final three there are no overlaps at all .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact114	288.78	290.69	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And {pause} couple times there {pause} are not .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact116	290.977	291.437	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact115	290.69	294.35	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So , i it seems like it goes through bursts {pause} but , um {pause} that 's kind of it .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact117	292.992	293.272	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact118	294.35	301.22	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	Now , {pause} Another question is {pause} is there {disfmarker} are there {pause} individual differences in whether you 're likely to be overlapped with or to overlap with others .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact119	302.017	316.009	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And , again {pause} I want to emphasize this is just one {pause} particular {pause} um {disfmarker} {pause} one particular meeting , and also there 's been no statistical testing of it all , but {pause} I , um {pause} I took the coding of {pause} the {disfmarker}
Bmr007.F.dialogueact120	316.469	324.989	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	I , you know , my {disfmarker} I had this script {pause} figure out , um {pause} who {pause} was the first speaker , who was the second speaker involved in a two - person overlap , I didn't look at the ones involving three or more .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact121	325.789	333.289	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And , um {pause} {pause} this is how it breaks down in the individual cells of {pause} who tended to be overlapping most often with who {disfmarker} who else ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact122	333.289	338.869	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and {pause} if you look at the marginal totals , which is the ones on the right side and across the bottom , you get {pause} the totals for an individual .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact123	338.929	350.117	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	So , {vocalsound} um {pause} If you {pause} look at the bottom , those are the , um {pause} numbers of overlaps in which {pause} um {pause} Adam was involved as the person doing the overlapping and if you look {disfmarker}
Bmr007.F.dialogueact124	350.117	352.087	F	Postdoc	s^fa	-1	0	I 'm sorry , but you 're o alphabetical , that 's why I 'm choosing you
Bmr007.F.dialogueact125	352.752	360.482	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And then if you look across the right , {pause} then {pause} that 's where he was the {pause} person who was the sp first speaker in the pair {pause} and got overlap overlapped with by somebody .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact126	358.4	359.11	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm !
Bmr007.E.dialogueact127	359.808	360.138	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact128	361.362	370.4	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	And , {pause} then if you look down in the summary table , {pause} then you see that , um {pause} th they 're differences in {pause} whether a person got overlapped with or {pause} overlapped by .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact129	369.58	371.72	H	Grad	qr.%-	-1	0	Is this uh {pause} just raw counts or is it {disfmarker}
Bmr007.F.dialogueact130	371.72	372.31	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	Raw counts .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact131	372.398	375.47	H	Grad	s	-1	0	So it would be interesting to see how much each person spoke .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact132	375.726	375.996	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.C.dialogueact135	376.122	376.322	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact134	376.089	378.967	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah {vocalsound} Yeah
Bmr007.F.dialogueact133	375.923	377.483	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yes , very true {disfmarker} very true
Bmr007.H.dialogueact136	376.83	377.95	H	Grad	s^t1.%-	-1	0	Normalized to how much {disfmarker}
Bmr007.F.dialogueact137	377.483	378.893	F	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	it would be good to normalize with respect to that .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact138	378.893	384.113	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Now on the table I did {pause} take one step toward , uh {pause} away from the raw frequencies by putting , {pause} uh {pause} percentages .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact139	384.113	388.673	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	So that the percentage of time {pause} of the {disfmarker} of the times that a person spoke , {pause} what percentage {pause} eh , w
Bmr007.F.dialogueact140	388.773	397.806	F	Postdoc	qw	+1	1	so . Of the times a person spoke and furthermore was involved in a two two - person overlap , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} what percentage of the time were they the overlapper and what percent of the time were they th the overlappee ?
Bmr007.F.dialogueact141	398.454	400.424	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And there , it looks like you see some differences ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact142	400.894	406.774	F	Postdoc	s	+1	2	um , {pause} that some people tend to be overlapped {pause} with more often than they 're overlapped ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact143	406.774	417.364	F	Postdoc	s	+1	2	but , of course , uh i e {vocalsound} this is just one meeting , {pause} uh {pause} there 's no statistical testing involved , and that would be {pause} required for a {disfmarker} for a finding {pause} of {pause} any {pause} kind of {pause} scientific {pause} reliability .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact144	415.49	420.55	D	Professor	s^j	-1	0	S so , i it would be statistically incorrect to conclude from this that Adam talked too much or something .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact145	420.157	422.877	H	Grad	s^ar|s^nd	-1	0	No {disfmarker} no actually , that would be actually statistically correct ,
Bmr007.D.dialogueact147	421.13	421.6	D	Professor	s^aa.%	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact146	420.716	421.626	F	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	No , no , no .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact148	422.101	422.441	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact150	423.174	424.004	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact149	422.937	423.327	H	Grad	%--	-1	0	but
Bmr007.F.dialogueact151	423.56	424.2	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , that 's right .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact153	424.507	424.597	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact155	424.929	425.209	D	Professor	s^t3	-1	0	Excuse me .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact152	424.48	424.87	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	That 's right .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact154	424.87	427.05	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And I 'm {pause} you know , I 'm {disfmarker} I don't see a point of singling people out ,
Bmr007.D.dialogueact157	427.493	429.943	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	B I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I rather enjoyed it , but {disfmarker} but this
Bmr007.F.dialogueact156	427.05	428.58	F	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	now , this is a case where obviously {disfmarker}
Bmr007.A.dialogueact158	428.952	430.092	A	PhD	s	-1	0	But the numbers speak for themselves .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact159	429.331	430.041	E	PhD	s^t3	-1	0	He 's {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact161	430.185	433.755	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Well , {vocalsound} you know , it 's like {disfmarker} I 'm not {disfmarker} I 'm not saying on the tape who did {pause} better or worse
Bmr007.H.dialogueact160	429.923	431.243	H	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yes , that 's right , so you don't nee OK .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact163	433.859	434.119	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Sure .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact162	433.755	434.905	F	Postdoc	s^df.%--	-1	0	because {pause} I don't think that it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr007.F.dialogueact164	434.975	435.765	F	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	I {pause} you know ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact165	435.765	441.165	F	Postdoc	s|s^cs	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and th here 's a case where of course , human subjects people would say be sure that you anonymize the results , {pause} and {disfmarker} and , so , might as well do this .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact167	440.247	440.437	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact166	440.006	446.8	H	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , when {disfmarker} this is what {disfmarker} This is actually {disfmarker} when Jane sent this email first , is what caused me to start thinking about anonymizing the data .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact168	447.089	447.949	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Well , fair enough .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact169	448.089	448.479	F	Postdoc	s^bk^r	-1	0	Fair enough .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact171	449.043	449.483	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact170	448.739	454.719	F	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	And actually , {pause} you know , the point is not about an individual , it 's the point about {pause} tendencies toward {pause} you know , different styles , different speaker styles .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact172	454.456	454.816	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Oh sure .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact173	455.457	460.937	F	Postdoc	s	+1	2	And {pause} it would be , you know {pause} of course , {pause} there 's also the question of what type of overlap was this , and w what were they ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact174	461.157	465.85	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and i and I {disfmarker} and I know that I can distinguish at least three types and , probably more ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact175	465.85	477.626	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean , the {vocalsound} general {pause} {vocalsound} cultural idea which w uh , the conversation analysts originally started with in the seventies was that we have this {vocalsound} strict model where politeness involves that you let the person finish th before you start talking ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact176	477.626	486.542	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and {pause} and you know , I mean , {pause} w we know that {disfmarker} {pause} an and they 've loosened up on that too s in the intervening time , that {pause} that that 's {disfmarker} that 's viewed as being {pause} a culturally - relative thing ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact177	486.542	493.418	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	I mean , {pause} that you have the high - involvement style from the East Coast where people {vocalsound} will overlap often as an indication of interest in what the other person is saying .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact179	493.838	494.178	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And
Bmr007.H.dialogueact178	493.618	493.868	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact181	494.823	495.353	B	PhD	s^fe.%	-1	0	Exactly !
Bmr007.F.dialogueact180	494.518	495.358	F	Postdoc	s^fe	-1	0	Yeah , exactly !
Bmr007.E.dialogueact183	495.519	495.729	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah
Bmr007.F.dialogueact182	495.358	495.968	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Well , there you go .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact184	495.968	496.918	F	Postdoc	s^j	-1	0	Fine , that 's alright , that 's OK .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact185	497.311	501.131	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and , {pause} you know , in contrast , so Deborah {disfmarker} d and also Deborah Tannen 's {pause} thesis
Bmr007.F.dialogueact186	501.131	504.011	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	she talked about differences of these types , {pause} that they 're just different styles ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact187	504.011	508.991	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and it 's um {pause} you {disfmarker} you can't impose a model of {disfmarker} {pause} there {disfmarker} of the ideal being no overlaps ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact188	509.201	511.491	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and {pause} you know , conversational analysts also agree with that ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact189	511.491	513.811	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	so it 's {pause} now , universally {pause} a ag agreed with .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact190	513.991	514.771	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and , als
Bmr007.F.dialogueact191	514.771	516.171	F	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	I mean , I can't say universally ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact192	516.171	520.621	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but anyway , the people who used to say it was strict , {pause} um {pause} now , uh {pause} don't .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact193	520.801	528.991	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean they {disfmarker} they {pause} also {pause} {vocalsound} you know , uh {pause} uh , ack acknowledge the influence of {pause} sub of subcultural norms and {pause} cross - cultural norms and things .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact194	529.665	537.878	F	Postdoc	s	+1	2	So , um Then it beco {pause} though {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} just {disfmarker} just superficially to give {pause} um {pause} a couple ideas of the types of overlaps involved , I have at the bottom several that I noticed .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact195	537.878	540.626	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	So , {pause} {vocalsound} uh , there are backchannels , like what Adam just did now
Bmr007.F.dialogueact196	540.626	546.01	F	Postdoc	fh|s	+1	1	and , um {pause} {vocalsound} um , anticipating the end of a question and {pause} simply answering it earlier ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact197	546.01	548.2	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and there are several of those in this {disfmarker} in these data where {disfmarker}
Bmr007.B.dialogueact198	547.745	548.095	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact199	548.42	550.37	F	Postdoc	s^df^rt	-1	0	because we 're {pause} people who 've talked to each other ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact200	550.87	556.45	F	Postdoc	s^df^e	-1	0	um {pause} we know {pause} basically what the topic is , what the possibilities are and w and we 've spoken with each other
Bmr007.F.dialogueact201	556.45	558.97	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so we know basically what the other person 's style is likely to be
Bmr007.F.dialogueact202	558.97	563.075	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and so {vocalsound} and t there are a number of places where someone just answered early .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact203	563.98	564.35	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	No problem .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact204	564.729	571.18	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	And places {pause} also which I thought were interesting , where two or more people gave exactly th the same answer in unison {disfmarker} different words of course
Bmr007.F.dialogueact205	571.18	576.64	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but you know , the {disfmarker} basically , {pause} you know everyone 's saying " yes " or {disfmarker} you know , or ev even more sp specific than that .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact206	577.223	588.253	F	Postdoc	s	+1	2	So , uh , the point is that , um {pause} {vocalsound} overlap 's not necessarily a bad thing and that it would be im {pause} i useful to subdivide these further and see if there are individual differences in styles with respect to the types involved .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact207	588.373	590.713	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And that 's all I wanted to say on that , {pause} unless people have questions .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact208	591.548	604.452	D	Professor	s	+1	2	Well , of course th the biggest , {pause} um {pause} result here , which is one we 've {disfmarker} {pause} we 've talked about many times and isn't new to us , but which I think would be interesting to show someone who isn't familiar with this {vocalsound} {pause} is just the sheer number of overlaps .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact209	604.27	604.58	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact212	605.087	607.137	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	That {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} Right ? {pause} that {disfmarker} that , um
Bmr007.E.dialogueact210	604.741	605.131	E	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	Yes , yes !
Bmr007.F.dialogueact211	604.84	605.94	F	Postdoc	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	Oh , OK {disfmarker} interesting .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact213	605.516	605.996	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact214	607.477	608.937	D	Professor	s	+1	0	here 's a relatively short meeting ,
Bmr007.D.dialogueact215	608.937	612.147	D	Professor	s	+1	1	it 's a forty {disfmarker} {pause} forty plus minute {pause} {vocalsound} meeting ,
Bmr007.D.dialogueact216	612.147	622.35	D	Professor	s^rt	+1	0	and not only were there two hundred and fifteen overlaps {vocalsound} {pause} but , {pause} uh I think there 's one {disfmarker} {pause} one minute there where there {disfmarker} where {disfmarker} where there wasn't any overlap ?
Bmr007.H.dialogueact217	612.4	613.46	H	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	Hundred ninety - seven .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact218	622.35	625.08	D	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	I mean , it 's {disfmarker} {pause} {vocalsound} uh throughout this thing ?
Bmr007.A.dialogueact222	625.387	626.377	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	It 'd be interesting {disfmarker}
Bmr007.D.dialogueact220	625.08	627.063	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} You have {disfmarker}
Bmr007.F.dialogueact219	625.012	626.452	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Well , at the bottom , you have the bottom three .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact223	625.824	626.164	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact221	625.38	626.88	H	Grad	%-	-1	0	S n are {disfmarker}
Bmr007.F.dialogueact224	626.552	628.732	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So four {disfmarker} four minutes all together with none {disfmarker} none .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact226	628.818	629.438	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	But it w
Bmr007.D.dialogueact225	628.808	630.948	D	Professor	qy^bu^d	-1	0	Oh , so the bottom three did have s stuff going on ?
Bmr007.D.dialogueact228	631.218	631.798	D	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	There was speech ?
Bmr007.F.dialogueact227	631.179	631.579	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yes , uh - huh .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact229	631.649	631.869	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact230	631.989	632.979	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But just no overlaps .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact231	632.927	633.997	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	OK , so if {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} this {disfmarker}
Bmr007.A.dialogueact232	633.494	636.904	A	PhD	s^cs.%-	+1	0	It 'd be interesting to see what the total amount of time is in the overlaps , versus {disfmarker}
Bmr007.F.dialogueact233	636.728	639.498	F	Postdoc	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yes , exactly and that 's {disfmarker} that 's where Jose 's pro project comes in .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact235	637.32	642.105	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Yeah , yeah , I h I have this that infor I have th that information now .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact234	637.114	637.884	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I was about to ask {disfmarker}
Bmr007.A.dialogueact237	638.137	638.527	A	PhD	fh.%	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr007.D.dialogueact239	642.501	643.361	D	Professor	qw^rt	-1	0	Oh , about how much is it ?
Bmr007.E.dialogueact240	642.973	645.133	E	PhD	s	-1	0	The {disfmarker} the duration of eh {disfmarker} of each of the overlaps .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact241	645.414	648.654	D	Professor	qw^rt	-1	0	O oh , what 's {disfmarker} what 's the {disfmarker} what 's the average {pause} length ?
Bmr007.E.dialogueact242	648.37	650.42	E	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	M I {disfmarker} I haven't averaged it now
Bmr007.E.dialogueact243	650.42	661.14	E	PhD	s^cc	+1	0	but , uh {pause} I {disfmarker} I will , uh I will do the {disfmarker} the study of the {disfmarker} {pause} with the {disfmarker} with the program with the {disfmarker} uh , the different , uh {pause} the , nnn , {pause} distribution of the duration of the overlaps .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact244	653.094	653.474	D	Professor	qy^d	-1	0	You don't know ?
Bmr007.D.dialogueact245	661.79	664.86	D	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	OK , you {disfmarker} you don you don't have a feeling for roughly how {pause} much it is ?
Bmr007.D.dialogueact247	664.86	664.95	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact246	664.648	666.458	E	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	mmm , {pause} Because the {disfmarker} the uh , @ @ is @ @ .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact249	668.883	669.473	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact248	668.74	674.48	E	PhD	s^na.%--	+1	0	The duration is , uh {pause} the variation {disfmarker} the variation of the duration is uh , very big on the dat
Bmr007.A.dialogueact250	673.854	674.154	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact251	673.98	677.29	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I suspect that it will also differ , {pause} depending on the type of overlap {pause} involved .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact252	675.132	675.502	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	but eh {disfmarker}
Bmr007.D.dialogueact255	677.422	677.902	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Oh , I 'm sure .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact253	676.989	677.289	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact254	677.29	678.57	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So backchannels will be very brief
Bmr007.E.dialogueact256	677.852	687.51	E	PhD	s^na	-1	0	Because , on your surface eh {pause} a bit of zone of overlapping with the duration eh , overlapped and another very very short .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact257	678.57	678.76	F	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr007.D.dialogueact258	685.461	685.691	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact259	687.782	687.952	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact260	688.1	705.96	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Uh , i probably it 's very difficult to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} because the {disfmarker} the overlap is , uh on is only the {disfmarker} in the final " S " of the {disfmarker} of the {disfmarker} the fin the {disfmarker} the end {disfmarker} the end word of the , um {pause} previous speaker {vocalsound} with the {disfmarker} the next word of the {disfmarker} the new speaker .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact261	696.943	697.283	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact262	706.325	725.22	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Um , I considered {pause} that 's an overlap but it 's very short , it 's an " X " with a {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} the idea is probably , eh {pause} when eh {disfmarker} when eh , we studied th th that zone , eh {pause} {pause} eh , we h we have eh eh {pause} confusion with eh eh noise .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact263	725.542	725.872	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact264	726.29	732.91	E	PhD	s	-1	0	With eh {pause} that fricative sounds , but uh {pause} I have new information but I have to {disfmarker} to study .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact265	727.065	727.275	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact266	730.32	732.193	D	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah , but I {disfmarker} I 'd {disfmarker} {vocalsound} u
Bmr007.G.dialogueact267	731.005	731.365	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	Can I {disfmarker}
Bmr007.D.dialogueact268	732.413	732.823	D	Professor	s^cs.%	-1	0	go ahead .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact269	734.203	734.363	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact270	734.339	743.518	G	PhD	s	-1	0	You split this by minute , um {pause} so if an overlap straddles {pause} the boundary between two minutes , that counts towards both of those minutes .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact271	735.972	736.392	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact272	740.882	741.182	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact273	744.114	749.813	F	Postdoc	s^ar	-1	0	Actually , um {vocalsound} um {pause} actually not .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact274	750.33	758.277	F	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	0	Uh , so {pause} le let 's think about the case where {vocalsound} A starts speaking {pause} {vocalsound} and then B overlaps with A , {pause} and then the minute boundary happens .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact275	758.837	766.117	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	And let 's say that {vocalsound} after that minute boundary , {vocalsound} um {pause} B is still speaking , {pause} and A overlaps {pause} with B ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact276	766.479	767.599	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	that would be a new overlap .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact277	768.499	775.519	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	But otherwise {pause} um , let 's say B {pause} comes to the conclusion of {disfmarker} of that turn without {pause} anyone overlapping with him or her ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact278	776.024	778.424	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	in which case there would be no overlap counted in that second minute .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact279	777.749	786.538	G	PhD	s	-1	0	No , but suppose they both talk simultaneously {vocalsound} {pause} both a {disfmarker} a portion of it is in minute one and another portion of minute two .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact280	787.284	787.604	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact281	787.684	795.268	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	In that case , um {pause} my c {pause} the coding that I was using {disfmarker} {vocalsound} since we haven't , {pause} uh {pause} incorporated Adam 's , uh {pause} coding of overlap yets , the coding of
Bmr007.F.dialogueact282	797.019	798.119	F	Postdoc	s^t1	-1	0	Yeah , " yets " is not a word .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact283	798.445	806.681	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Uh {vocalsound} since we haven't incorporated Adam 's method of handling overl overlaps yet {vocalsound} um {pause} then {pause} that would have fallen through the cra cracks .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact284	806.681	813.471	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It would be an underestimate of the number of overlaps because , um {pause} I wou I wouldn't be able to pick it up from the way it was {pause} encoded so far .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact286	813.631	814.261	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	I I
Bmr007.F.dialogueact285	813.541	818.071	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	We just haven't done th the precise second to sec you know , {pause} second to second coding of when they occur .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact287	816.507	817.037	D	Professor	%--	-1	0	I I
Bmr007.D.dialogueact288	817.497	818.777	D	Professor	s	-1	0	I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm confused now .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact289	818.837	822.427	D	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	So l l let me restate what I thought Andreas was saying and {disfmarker} and see .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact290	820.993	821.283	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact291	823.092	833.005	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Let 's say that in {disfmarker} in second fifty - seven {pause} {vocalsound} of one minute , {pause} you start talking and I start talking and {pause} we ignore each other and keep on talking for six seconds .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact292	826.163	826.353	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact293	829.526	829.696	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact294	832.687	832.997	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact295	833.609	839.109	D	Professor	s	-1	0	So we go over {disfmarker} So we were {disfmarker} we were talking over one another , {pause} and it 's just {disfmarker} in each case , it 's just sort of one {pause} interval .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact297	839.489	839.729	D	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr007.F.dialogueact296	839.482	839.702	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm ?
Bmr007.D.dialogueact298	840.452	843.482	D	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	So , um {pause} we talked over the minute boundary .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact299	844.26	849.03	D	Professor	qy	+1	0	Is this {pause} considered as one overlap in each of the minutes , the way you have done this .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact300	849.152	849.582	F	Postdoc	s^ar	+1	0	No , it wouldn't .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact301	850.26	852.12	F	Postdoc	s^nd	+1	0	It would be considered as an overlap in the first one .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact302	852.64	857.32	D	Professor	s	-1	0	OK , so that 's {pause} good , i I think , in the sense that I think Andreas meant the question ,
Bmr007.B.dialogueact303	853.62	856.35	B	PhD	s^aa|s^na.%--	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker} {pause} that 's good , yeah , cuz the overall rate is {disfmarker}
Bmr007.C.dialogueact305	855.192	855.492	C	PhD	b	-1	0	
Bmr007.G.dialogueact304	854.944	855.224	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact306	855.545	856.225	H	Grad	s	-1	0	Statistical .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact307	856.691	857.091	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact309	856.811	857.101	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact311	857.32	857.5	D	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	right ?
Bmr007.F.dialogueact312	857.341	857.511	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact313	857.511	858.371	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	They 're not double counted .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact310	857.038	859.488	G	PhD	s	+1	0	Other - otherwise you 'd get double counts , here and there .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact308	856.802	857.132	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact315	858.34	859.33	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Ah but , yeah .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact314	857.888	858.408	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact317	859.704	859.944	B	PhD	%	-1	0	
Bmr007.G.dialogueact316	859.488	860.708	G	PhD	s	-1	0	And then it would be harder {disfmarker}
Bmr007.D.dialogueact318	860.047	860.297	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact319	860.072	860.492	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact320	860.408	868.632	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I should also say I did a simplifying , uh {pause} count in that {vocalsound} if A was speaking {pause} B overlapped with A and then A came back again and overlapped with B again ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact321	868.782	874.652	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I didn't count that as a three - person overlap , I counted that as a two - person overlap , {pause} and it was A being overlapped with by D .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact322	872.228	872.558	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact323	875.458	883.488	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Because the idea was the first speaker {pause} had the floor {pause} and the second person {pause} started speaking and then the f the first person reasserted the floor {pause} kind of thing .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact325	884.346	884.676	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact324	883.994	885.144	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	These are simplifying assumptions ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact326	885.144	886.054	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	didn't happen very often ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact327	886.054	888.614	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	there may be like three overlaps affected that way in the whole thing .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact328	889.052	890.822	H	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	I want to go back and listen to minute forty - one .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact329	891.208	891.868	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact330	892.042	896.522	H	Grad	s	+1	0	Cuz i i I find it interesting that there were a large number of overlaps and they were all two - speaker .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact331	892.68	892.86	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact332	897.515	906.269	H	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean what I thought {disfmarker} what I would have thought in {pause} is that when there were a large number of overlaps , it was because everyone was talking at once , {vocalsound} but uh apparently not .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact333	899.45	900.32	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	That 's interesting .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact334	900.819	901.319	F	Postdoc	s^ba^r	-1	0	That 's interesting .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact335	903.572	903.842	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact336	904.082	904.352	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact337	906.073	906.383	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact338	906.269	906.989	H	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's really neat .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact340	907.447	907.617	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact339	907.298	909.528	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	Yeah , there 's a lot of backchannel , a lot o a lot of {disfmarker}
Bmr007.H.dialogueact341	907.66	909.34	H	Grad	s	-1	0	This is {pause} really interesting data .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact342	910.178	910.558	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , it is .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact344	910.834	920.541	B	PhD	s	-1	0	I think what 's really interesting though , it is {pause} before d {pause} saying " yes , meetings have a lot of overlaps " is to actually find out how many more {pause} we have than two - party .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact343	910.558	911.478	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	I think so too , I think {disfmarker}
Bmr007.B.dialogueact345	920.541	926.441	B	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	Cuz in two - party conversations , like Switchboard , there 's an awful lot too if you just look at backchannels , if you consider those overlaps ?
Bmr007.B.dialogueact346	927.071	928.371	B	PhD	s	-1	0	it 's also ver it 's huge .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact347	928.411	934.501	B	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's just that people haven't been {pause} looking at that because they 've been doing single - channel processing for {pause} speech recognition .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact348	932.536	932.936	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact349	933.468	933.788	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm ?
Bmr007.B.dialogueact350	935.041	943.78	B	PhD	s	+1	2	So , the question is , you know , how many more overlaps {pause} {vocalsound} do you have {pause} of , say the two - person type , by adding more people . to a meeting ,
Bmr007.B.dialogueact351	944.01	946.99	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and it may be a lot more but i it may {disfmarker} {pause} it may not be .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact352	946.866	949.676	D	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Well , but see , I find it interesting even if it wasn't any more ,
Bmr007.B.dialogueact353	948.142	948.502	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact354	949.676	956.547	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because {pause} since we were dealing with this full duplex sort of thing in Switchboard where it was just all separated out {vocalsound} we just {disfmarker} everything was just nice ,
Bmr007.B.dialogueact355	954.973	955.263	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm ?
Bmr007.D.dialogueact356	956.547	959.997	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	so that {disfmarker} so the issue is in {disfmarker} in a situation {pause} where th that 's {disfmarker}
Bmr007.B.dialogueact357	959.209	960.729	B	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	Well , it 's not really {pause} " nice " .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact358	960.729	961.699	B	PhD	s	-1	0	It depends what you 're doing .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact359	961.699	964.129	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So if you were actually {pause} {vocalsound} having ,
Bmr007.B.dialogueact360	964.519	964.869	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bmr007.B.dialogueact361	965.389	966.349	B	PhD	s	-1	0	depends what you 're doing ,
Bmr007.B.dialogueact362	966.349	970.474	B	PhD	s	-1	0	if {disfmarker} Right now we 're do we have individual mikes on the people in this meeting .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact364	970.824	977.255	B	PhD	s	-1	0	So the question is , you know {disfmarker} " are there really more overlaps happening than there would be in a two - person {pause} party " .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact363	970.699	971.019	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm ?
Bmr007.B.dialogueact366	977.255	978.815	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and there well may be , but {disfmarker}
Bmr007.D.dialogueact365	977.078	980.078	D	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	Let {disfmarker} let m let me rephrase what I 'm saying cuz I don't think I 'm getting it across .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact367	980.078	983.378	D	Professor	s	-1	0	What {disfmarker} what I {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} I shouldn't use words like " nice " because maybe that 's too {disfmarker} i too imprecise .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact368	983.378	991.684	D	Professor	s	+1	0	But what I mean is {vocalsound} that , um in Switchboard , {pause} despite the many {disfmarker} many other problems that we have , one problem that we 're not considering is overlap .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact369	992.907	998.037	D	Professor	s	+1	2	And what we 're doing now is , {pause} aside from the many other differences in the task , we are considering overlap
Bmr007.D.dialogueact370	998.446	1014.42	D	Professor	s	+1	0	and one of the reasons that we 're considering it , {pause} you know , one of them not all of them , one of them is {vocalsound} that w uh at least , {pause} you know I 'm very interested in {vocalsound} the scenario in which , uh {pause} both people talking are pretty much equally {pause} audible , {vocalsound} and from a single microphone .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact371	1015.24	1022.39	D	Professor	s	+1	0	And so , {pause} in that case , it does get mixed in , {vocalsound} and it 's pretty hard to jus {pause} to just ignore it , to just do processing on one and not on the other .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact372	1023.12	1026.55	B	PhD	s	+1	0	I {disfmarker} I agree that it 's an issue here {pause} but it 's also an issue for Switchboard
Bmr007.B.dialogueact373	1026.55	1036.49	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and if you {pause} think of meetings {pause} being recorded over the telephone , which I think , you know , this whole point of studying meetings isn't just to have people in a room but to also have {pause} meetings over different phone lines .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact374	1030.68	1031.09	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact375	1036.97	1040.54	B	PhD	s	-1	0	Maybe far field mike people wouldn't be interested in that but all the dialogue issues still apply ,
Bmr007.D.dialogueact376	1040.31	1040.6	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact377	1040.86	1046.17	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so if each of us was calling and having {pause} {vocalsound} a meeting that way {pause} you kn you know like a conference call .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact378	1047.01	1054.99	B	PhD	s	-1	0	And , just the question is , {pause} y you know , in Switchboard {pause} you would think that 's the simplest case of a meeting of more than one person ,
Bmr007.D.dialogueact379	1053.51	1053.84	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact380	1054.99	1063.68	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and {pause} {vocalsound} I 'm wondering how much more {pause} overlap {pause} of {pause} the types that {disfmarker} that Jane described happen with more people present .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact381	1063.68	1068.85	B	PhD	s	+1	2	So it may be that having three people {pause} {vocalsound} is very different from having two people or it may not be .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact382	1069.12	1070.21	D	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	That 's an important question to ask .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact384	1070.58	1071.19	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact383	1070.21	1073.83	D	Professor	s	-1	0	I think what I 'm {disfmarker} {pause} All I 'm s really saying is that I don't think we were considering that in Switchboard .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact385	1074.47	1075.37	B	PhD	s^arp	-1	0	Not you , me .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact388	1075.73	1076.64	B	PhD	fg	-1	0	But uh {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but
Bmr007.D.dialogueact386	1075.64	1075.88	D	Professor	qy.%-	-1	0	Were you ?
Bmr007.H.dialogueact387	1075.72	1077.01	H	Grad	s	-1	0	Though it wasn't {pause} in the design .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact389	1077.28	1078.85	D	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Were you {disfmarker} were you {disfmarker} were you {disfmarker} were you measuring it ?
Bmr007.D.dialogueact390	1078.85	1079.56	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , w w were {disfmarker}
Bmr007.B.dialogueact391	1079.47	1080.24	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	There {disfmarker} there 's
Bmr007.B.dialogueact392	1081.35	1085.94	B	PhD	s^na.%--	-1	0	actually to tell you the truth , the reason why it 's hard to measure is because of
Bmr007.B.dialogueact393	1086.95	1094.91	B	PhD	s	+1	1	so , from the point of view of studying dialogue , I mean , which {pause} Dan Jurafsky and Andreas and I had some projects on , you want to know the sequence of turns .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact394	1092.19	1092.39	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact395	1095.54	1105.19	B	PhD	s	+1	0	So what happens is if you 're talking and I have a backchannel in the middle of your turn , and then you keep going what it looks like in a dialogue model is your turn and then my backchannel ,
Bmr007.D.dialogueact396	1099.51	1099.83	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact397	1105.19	1107.79	B	PhD	s	+1	0	even though my backchannel occurred completely inside your turn .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact398	1108.08	1108.37	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bmr007.B.dialogueact399	1108.87	1115.07	B	PhD	s	+1	1	So , for things like language modeling or dialogue modeling {pause} {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker} We know that that 's wrong in real time .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact400	1114.23	1114.38	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bmr007.B.dialogueact401	1115.53	1124.84	B	PhD	s	+1	0	But , because of the acoustic segmentations that were done and the fact that some of the acoustic data in Switchboard were missing , people couldn't study it ,
Bmr007.B.dialogueact402	1124.84	1127.48	B	PhD	s	-1	0	but that doesn't mean in the real world that people don't talk that way .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact404	1127.83	1129.57	B	PhD	fh|s.%-	-1	0	So , it 's {disfmarker} um
Bmr007.D.dialogueact403	1127.49	1128.19	D	Professor	fg|s^ng	-1	0	Yeah , I wasn't saying that .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact405	1128.64	1128.91	D	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr007.D.dialogueact406	1128.91	1130.61	D	Professor	s	-1	0	I was just saying that w now we 're looking at it .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact407	1131.91	1132.59	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Well , we 've als
Bmr007.D.dialogueact408	1131.91	1138.11	D	Professor	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , you {disfmarker} you maybe wanted to look at it before but , for these various technical reasons in terms of how the data was you weren't .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact409	1132.68	1133.0	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact410	1133.0	1134.04	B	PhD	s^na	-1	0	We 're looking at it here .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact411	1138.71	1140.31	D	Professor	s	-1	0	So that 's why it 's coming to us as new
Bmr007.D.dialogueact412	1140.65	1145.86	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	even though it may well be {pause} you know , if your {disfmarker} if your hypothes The hypothesis you were offering {vocalsound} eh {disfmarker}
Bmr007.B.dialogueact413	1145.35	1145.67	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Um .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact414	1145.86	1152.37	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Right ? {disfmarker} if it 's the null poth {comment} hypothesis , and if actually you have as much overlap in a two - person , {vocalsound} we don't know the answer to that .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact415	1152.37	1156.23	D	Professor	s	-1	0	The reason we don't know the answer to is cuz it wasn't studied and it wasn't studied because it wasn't set up . Right ?
Bmr007.B.dialogueact416	1155.19	1168.96	B	PhD	fg|s^df	-1	0	Yeah , all I meant is that if you 're asking the question from the point of view of {pause} what 's different about a meeting , studying meetings of , say , more than two people versus {pause} what kinds of questions you could ask with a two - person {pause} meeting .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact417	1161.3	1161.68	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm ?
Bmr007.B.dialogueact418	1169.7	1177.7	B	PhD	s	+1	0	It 's important to distinguish {pause} that , you know , this project {pause} is getting a lot of overlap {pause} but other projects were too , but we just couldn't study them .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact420	1177.87	1178.54	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And and so uh
Bmr007.D.dialogueact419	1177.75	1178.3	D	Professor	s^am	-1	0	May have been .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact421	1178.52	1179.06	D	Professor	s^am^r	-1	0	May have been .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact422	1179.06	1179.34	D	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr007.B.dialogueact424	1179.7	1181.17	B	PhD	h|s	-1	0	Well , there is a high rate ,
Bmr007.D.dialogueact423	1179.61	1180.88	D	Professor	s	-1	0	We do kn we don't know the numbers .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact425	1181.27	1181.59	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact426	1181.73	1183.79	B	PhD	s^no	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} but I don't know how high , in fact
Bmr007.A.dialogueact427	1183.46	1184.78	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , here I have a question .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact428	1184.41	1186.12	B	PhD	s	-1	0	that would be interesting to know .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact429	1185.07	1186.36	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	See , I mean , i i le let me t
Bmr007.D.dialogueact430	1186.86	1190.36	D	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , my point was just if you wanted to say to somebody , " what have we learned about overlaps here ? "
Bmr007.D.dialogueact431	1190.83	1192.48	D	Professor	s^co	-1	0	just never mind comparison with something else ,
Bmr007.B.dialogueact432	1192.54	1192.86	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact433	1192.84	1197.08	D	Professor	s	+1	2	what we 've learned about is overlaps in this situation , is that {disfmarker} the first {disfmarker} {pause} the first - order thing I would say is that there 's a lot of them .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact435	1198.68	1198.82	D	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr007.E.dialogueact434	1198.67	1198.98	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact436	1199.27	1201.82	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	In {disfmarker} in the sense that i if you said if {disfmarker} i i i
Bmr007.B.dialogueact437	1200.66	1203.78	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , I {disfmarker} I don't di I agree with that .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact438	1201.82	1206.82	D	Professor	s	-1	0	In a way , I guess what I 'm comparing to is more the common sense notion of {vocalsound} how {disfmarker} how much people overlap .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact439	1207.34	1214.96	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh {pause} you know the fact that when {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when , uh , Adam was looking for a stretch of {disfmarker} of speech before , that didn't have any overlaps , and he w he was having such a hard time
Bmr007.D.dialogueact440	1215.52	1218.14	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and now I look at this and I go , " well , I can see why he was having such a hard time " .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact441	1217.42	1217.65	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact442	1218.09	1219.26	B	PhD	s	-1	0	That 's also true of Switchboard .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact443	1218.14	1218.84	D	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's happening a lot .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact445	1219.79	1220.59	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	It may not be {disfmarker}
Bmr007.D.dialogueact444	1219.74	1220.43	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	I wasn't saying it wasn't .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact446	1220.89	1221.16	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact447	1221.16	1222.83	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So it 's just , um
Bmr007.D.dialogueact448	1221.23	1221.45	D	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr007.D.dialogueact449	1222.31	1223.21	D	Professor	s	-1	0	I was commenting about this .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact450	1223.85	1224.12	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact452	1224.78	1226.13	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	All I 'm saying is that from the
Bmr007.D.dialogueact451	1224.49	1231.72	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	I 'm saying if I {disfmarker} {pause} I 'm saying if I have this complicated thing in front of me , {vocalsound} and we sh which , {pause} you know we 're gonna get much more sophisticated about when we get lots more data ,
Bmr007.D.dialogueact453	1232.49	1240.82	D	Professor	s	-1	0	But {disfmarker} Then , if I was gonna describe to somebody what did you learn {pause} right here , about , you know , the {disfmarker} the modest amount of data that was analyzed I 'd say , " Well , the first - order thing was there was a lot of overlaps " .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact454	1240.82	1249.45	D	Professor	s	+1	2	In fact {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and it 's not just an overlap {disfmarker} bunch of overlaps {disfmarker} second - order thing is {vocalsound} it 's not just a bunch of overlaps in one particular point , {vocalsound} but that there 's overlaps , uh throughout the thing .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact455	1247.09	1247.39	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact457	1249.82	1250.18	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact458	1250.18	1251.2	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	No , I {disfmarker} I agree with that .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact456	1249.8	1250.4	D	Professor	s	-1	0	And that 's interesting .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact459	1250.59	1250.82	D	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's all .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact460	1251.46	1258.41	B	PhD	s	-1	0	I 'm just {pause} {vocalsound} saying that it may {disfmarker} {pause} the reason you get overlaps may or may not be due to sort of the number of people in the meeting .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact461	1257.72	1257.97	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Oh yeah .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact463	1259.24	1260.55	B	PhD	s	-1	0	And that 's all .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact462	1258.78	1258.98	D	Professor	s^aa^r	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact464	1259.56	1260.91	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Yeah , I wasn't making any statement about that .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact465	1260.55	1262.46	B	PhD	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and it would actually be interesting to find out
Bmr007.D.dialogueact466	1261.0	1261.08	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact467	1262.46	1268.64	B	PhD	s	-1	0	because some of the data say Switchboard , which isn't exactly the same kind of context ,
Bmr007.B.dialogueact468	1268.64	1270.76	B	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean these are two people who don't know each other and so forth ,
Bmr007.B.dialogueact469	1271.64	1283.84	B	PhD	s	+1	2	But we should still be able to somehow say what {disfmarker} what is the added contra contribution to sort of overlap time of each additional person , or something like that .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact470	1282.26	1282.5	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact472	1282.89	1283.64	D	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , that would be good to know ,
Bmr007.A.dialogueact474	1283.44	1283.6	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	What {disfmarker}
Bmr007.D.dialogueact475	1283.64	1284.02	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	but w we {disfmarker}
Bmr007.F.dialogueact473	1283.33	1284.06	F	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	OK , now .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact471	1282.87	1284.66	H	Grad	s	-1	0	I could certainly see it going either way .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact476	1284.44	1286.09	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Wh - yeah , I {disfmarker} I agree {disfmarker} I agree with Adam .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact477	1285.07	1285.76	B	PhD	b	-1	0	But yeah .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact478	1285.87	1286.35	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact479	1286.09	1292.24	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And the reason is because I think there 's a limit {disfmarker} {pause} there 's an upper bound {pause} on how many you can have , simply {pause} from the standpoint of audibility .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact480	1292.24	1295.54	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	When we speak we {disfmarker} we do make a judgment of {pause} " can {disfmarker} " you know , as adults .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact482	1292.94	1293.31	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact481	1292.73	1293.0	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact483	1295.54	1296.7	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean , children don't adjust so well ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact484	1296.82	1305.8	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	I mean , if a truck goes rolling past , {vocalsound} adults will well , depending , but mostly , adults will {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} {pause} will hold off to what {disfmarker} {pause} to finish the end of the sentence till the {disfmarker} till the noise is past .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact485	1299.36	1299.95	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact486	1305.8	1310.72	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	And I think we generally do {vocalsound} monitor things like that , {pause} about {disfmarker} whether we {disfmarker} whether our utterance will be in the clear or not .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact487	1308.48	1308.74	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact488	1311.05	1313.33	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	And partly it 's related to rhythmic structure in conversation ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact489	1313.33	1324.0	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so , {vocalsound} you know , you {disfmarker} you t Yeah , this is d also um , people tend to time their {disfmarker} their {disfmarker} {vocalsound} their , um {pause} when they {pause} come into the conversation based on the overall rhythmic , {pause} uh uh , ambient thing .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact490	1316.73	1316.91	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bmr007.B.dialogueact491	1323.21	1323.49	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact492	1324.26	1325.41	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So you don't want to be c cross - cutting .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact493	1325.69	1336.14	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	And {disfmarker} and , just to finish this , that um That I think that {vocalsound} there may be an upper bound on how many overlaps you can have , simply from the standpoint of audibility and how loud the other people are who are already {pause} in the fray .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact494	1336.58	1337.84	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	But I {disfmarker} you know , of certain types .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact495	1337.84	1345.58	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	Now if it 's just backchannels , {vocalsound} people {pause} may be doing that {pause} with less {pause} intention of being heard , {pause} just sort of spontaneously doing backchannels ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact496	1346.03	1349.47	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	in which case {pause} that {disfmarker} those might {disfmarker} there may be no upper bound on those .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact497	1349.11	1364.48	G	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I have a feeling that backchannels , which are the vast majority of overlaps in Switchboard , {pause} uh , don't play as big a role here , because it 's very unnatural I think , to backchannel if {disfmarker} in a multi - audience {disfmarker} you know , in a multi - person {vocalsound} {pause} audience .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact498	1363.64	1365.05	B	PhD	s	-1	0	If you can see them , actually .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact499	1365.23	1365.72	B	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's interesting ,
Bmr007.B.dialogueact500	1365.72	1369.38	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so if you watch people are going like {disfmarker} {comment} {comment} Right {disfmarker} right , like this here ,
Bmr007.G.dialogueact501	1366.07	1366.39	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact502	1367.83	1368.23	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact503	1369.38	1372.34	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	but That may not be the case if you couldn't see them .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact504	1370.18	1370.59	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	u
Bmr007.G.dialogueact505	1370.43	1374.09	G	PhD	s	-1	0	But {disfmarker} {pause} but , it 's sort of odd if one person 's speaking and everybody 's listening ,
Bmr007.G.dialogueact506	1374.09	1377.42	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and it 's unusual to have everybody going " uh - huh , uh - huh "
Bmr007.D.dialogueact507	1377.72	1379.77	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Actually , I think I 've done it {pause} a fair number of times today .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact509	1380.43	1380.83	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact508	1380.06	1380.18	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	But .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact510	1381.19	1382.91	B	PhD	s	-1	0	There 's a lot of head - nodding , in this
Bmr007.H.dialogueact511	1381.28	1381.74	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Um .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact512	1382.93	1383.35	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact513	1383.29	1385.09	H	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	Yep , we need to put trackers on it .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact514	1385.07	1386.15	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	In {disfmarker} in the two - person {disfmarker}
Bmr007.E.dialogueact515	1385.63	1385.83	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact516	1387.0	1388.45	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	He could , he could .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact517	1387.03	1388.39	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Plus {disfmarker} plus {disfmarker} plus the {disfmarker}
Bmr007.G.dialogueact518	1388.86	1389.35	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact519	1389.35	1396.35	G	PhD	s	+1	0	So {disfmarker} so actually , um That 's in part because the nodding , if you have visual contact , {pause} the nodding has the same function ,
Bmr007.G.dialogueact520	1396.35	1399.12	G	PhD	s	-1	0	but on the phone , in Switchboard {vocalsound} you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} that wouldn't work .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact522	1399.12	1401.27	G	PhD	s	-1	0	So {vocalsound} so you need to use the backchannel .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact521	1398.91	1399.69	H	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Yeah , you don't have it .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact523	1401.16	1401.85	H	Grad	s^t3.%--	-1	0	Your mike is {disfmarker}
Bmr007.A.dialogueact524	1403.05	1410.58	A	PhD	qy^r^rt	-1	0	So , in the two - person conversations , {pause} when there 's backchannel , is there a great deal of {pause} overlap {pause} in the speech ?
Bmr007.H.dialogueact525	1407.76	1410.64	H	Grad	s^co^t3	-1	0	That is an earphone , so if you just put it {pause} so it 's on your ear .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact526	1410.58	1410.81	A	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker}
Bmr007.A.dialogueact527	1410.88	1414.76	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Cuz my impression is sometimes it happens when there 's a pause ,
Bmr007.B.dialogueact528	1411.18	1411.58	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact529	1411.26	1411.67	H	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	There you go .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact530	1412.17	1412.39	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact532	1413.09	1413.89	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	E for example .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact531	1412.64	1412.95	H	Grad	s^ft^t3	-1	0	Thank you .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact533	1415.37	1418.04	A	PhD	s	-1	0	you know , like you {disfmarker} you get a lot of backchannel , when somebody 's pausing
Bmr007.B.dialogueact534	1415.87	1416.12	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact535	1417.01	1417.37	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact536	1419.06	1419.8	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	She 's doing that .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact537	1420.62	1421.4	B	PhD	s^fa|qw^rt	-1	0	Sorry , what were you saying ?
Bmr007.A.dialogueact538	1422.97	1423.64	A	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's hard to do both ,
Bmr007.A.dialogueact539	1423.64	1423.76	A	PhD	qy^d^g^j	-1	0	huh ?
Bmr007.A.dialogueact540	1424.32	1435.84	A	PhD	fh|s.%--	+1	0	Um {pause} no , when {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when there 's backchannel , I mean , just {disfmarker} I was just listening , and {disfmarker} and when there 's two people talking and there 's backchannel it seems like , {pause} um the backchannel happens when , you know , the pitch drops and the first person {disfmarker}
Bmr007.B.dialogueact541	1425.15	1425.42	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact542	1436.43	1440.89	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and a lot of times , the first person actually stops talking and then there 's a backchannel {pause} and then they start up again ,
Bmr007.A.dialogueact543	1440.89	1444.14	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and so I 'm wondering about {disfmarker} h I just wonder how much overlap there is .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact544	1444.39	1445.05	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Is there a lot ?
Bmr007.B.dialogueact545	1445.59	1459.13	B	PhD	s^na	+1	0	I think there 's a lot of the kind that Jose was talking about , where {disfmarker} {pause} I mean , this is called " precision timing " in {pause} conversation analysis , where {pause} {vocalsound} they come in overlapping , {pause} but at a point where the {pause} information is mostly {pause} complete .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact546	1459.7	1465.29	B	PhD	s	+1	0	So all you 're missing is some last syllables or something or the last word or some highly predictable words .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact547	1462.88	1463.65	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact548	1465.38	1465.77	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact549	1465.75	1467.08	B	PhD	s	+1	0	So technically , it 's an overlap .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact551	1468.12	1469.71	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	But maybe a {disfmarker} just a small overlap ?
Bmr007.B.dialogueact550	1468.09	1473.79	B	PhD	s	+1	0	But {pause} you know , from information flow point of view it 's not an overlap in {pause} the predictable information .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact552	1469.78	1470.49	E	PhD	b	-1	0	More , yeah .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact553	1473.25	1475.34	H	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	It 'd be interesting if we could do prediction .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact554	1473.75	1476.46	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I was just thinking more in terms of alignment , alignment overlap .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact555	1476.55	1476.88	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact556	1476.93	1479.72	H	Grad	s	+1	1	Language model prediction of overlap , that would be really interesting .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact557	1479.48	1480.55	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker} {pause} so {disfmarker}
Bmr007.B.dialogueact559	1480.11	1487.26	B	PhD	s^na	+1	1	Well , that 's exactly , exactly why we wanted to study the precise timing of overlaps ins in uh Switchboard ,
Bmr007.D.dialogueact558	1479.72	1479.88	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact560	1483.89	1484.14	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact561	1484.46	1484.74	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact563	1487.42	1488.53	B	PhD	s	-1	0	say , because there 's a lot of that .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact562	1487.4	1490.94	G	PhD	s	+1	0	So {disfmarker} so here 's a {disfmarker} here 's a first interesting {pause} labeling task .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact564	1491.22	1505.77	G	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	Uh , to distinguish between , say , backchannels {vocalsound} {pause} precision timing {disfmarker} Sort of {vocalsound} you know , benevolent overlaps , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {pause} and w and {disfmarker} and sort of , um {pause} I don't know , hostile overlaps , where {vocalsound} someone is trying to grab the floor from someone else .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact565	1491.24	1491.6	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact566	1499.25	1500.17	H	Grad	s^j^t3	-1	0	Let 's pick a different word .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact567	1505.39	1505.6	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact568	1506.55	1509.51	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Uh , that {disfmarker} that might be an interesting , um {pause} problem to look at .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact570	1509.04	1510.0	A	PhD	s^j	-1	0	Hostile takeovers .

Bmr007.F.dialogueact573	1510.4	1511.28	F	Postdoc	s^ng	-1	0	Well , I mean you could do that .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact575	1511.28	1516.13	F	Postdoc	s^nd	-1	0	I ju I {disfmarker} I think that {pause} in this meeting I really had the feeling that wasn't happening , that {pause} the hostile {disfmarker} hostile type .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact576	1516.21	1521.32	F	Postdoc	s^nd	+1	2	These were {disfmarker} these were {pause} benevolent types , as people {pause} finishing each other 's sentences , and {pause} stuff .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact577	1516.31	1516.79	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact578	1517.03	1517.97	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact579	1520.01	1536.86	G	PhD	fg|s^df^nd	-1	0	Um , I could imagine that as {disfmarker} there 's a fair number of {vocalsound} um cases where , and this is sort of , not {pause} really hostile , but sort of competitive , where {vocalsound} one person is finishing something and {vocalsound} you have , like , two or three people jumping {disfmarker} trying to {disfmarker} {pause} trying to {disfmarker} {pause} trying to , uh grab the next turn .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact580	1533.9	1534.81	H	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Trying to get the floor .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact581	1537.22	1537.43	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact582	1538.07	1542.66	G	PhD	s	-1	0	And so it 's not against the person who talks first {pause} because actually we 're all waiting for that person to finish .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact583	1543.04	1544.5	G	PhD	s	-1	0	But they all want to {pause} be next .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact584	1544.87	1554.99	D	Professor	s^na	+1	0	I have a feeling most of these things are {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} {pause} that are not {pause} a benevolent kind are {disfmarker} are {vocalsound} {pause} are , uh {pause} um {pause} {vocalsound} are {disfmarker} are competitive as opposed to real really {disfmarker} really hostile .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact585	1554.09	1554.46	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact588	1555.26	1556.94	A	PhD	qw^d	-1	0	I wonder what determines who gets the floor ?
Bmr007.D.dialogueact587	1555.23	1555.4	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	But .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact586	1554.83	1555.59	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , I agree .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact589	1555.75	1556.09	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	I agree .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact591	1557.72	1558.05	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I mean {disfmarker}
Bmr007.F.dialogueact590	1557.64	1559.12	F	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	Well , there are various things , you {disfmarker} you have the {disfmarker}
Bmr007.D.dialogueact592	1558.46	1559.92	D	Professor	fg|s^j	-1	0	Uh a vote {disfmarker} vote in Florida .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact593	1558.98	1559.85	H	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's been studied a lot .

Bmr007.E.dialogueact595	1560.59	1561.51	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Voting for {disfmarker}
Bmr007.D.dialogueact596	1562.94	1567.19	D	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Um , o one thing {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I wanted to {disfmarker} or you can tell a good joke and then everybody 's laughing and you get a chance to g break in .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact597	1566.09	1566.73	G	PhD	s	-1	0	Seniority .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact598	1567.19	1567.43	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	But .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact599	1567.43	1567.61	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	But .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact600	1569.61	1569.95	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact601	1571.05	1579.37	D	Professor	s	+1	1	You know , the other thing I was thinking was that , {pause} um {pause} these {disfmarker} all these interesting questions are , of course , pretty hard to answer with , uh u {pause} you know , a small amount of data .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact602	1579.83	1579.89	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Ach .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact603	1580.65	1593.27	D	Professor	s	-1	0	So , um {pause} I wonder if what you 're saying suggests that we should make a conscious attempt to have , um {vocalsound} a {disfmarker} a fair number of meetings with , uh a smaller number of people .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact604	1593.89	1594.18	D	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr007.D.dialogueact605	1594.18	1600.29	D	Professor	s	+1	0	I mean {vocalsound} we {disfmarker} most of our meetings are {pause} uh , meetings currently with say five , six , seven , eight people
Bmr007.D.dialogueact606	1600.79	1610.49	D	Professor	qy^cs	+1	0	Should we {pause} really try to have some two - person meetings , {pause} or some three - person meetings and re record them {vocalsound} just to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to beef up the {disfmarker} the statistics on that ?
Bmr007.F.dialogueact607	1608.54	1609.2	F	Postdoc	s^t3	-1	0	That 's a control .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact608	1611.79	1613.81	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Well , {vocalsound} it seems like there are two possibilities there ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact609	1613.81	1623.88	F	Postdoc	s^ng	-1	0	I mean {pause} i it seems like {vocalsound} if you have just {pause} two people it 's not {pause} really , y like a meeting , w is not as similar as the rest of the {disfmarker} {pause} of the sample .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact610	1624.15	1625.65	F	Postdoc	s^arp	-1	0	It depends on what you 're after , of course ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact611	1625.65	1630.9	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but {vocalsound} It seems like that would be more a case of the control condition , compared to , uh {pause} an experimental {pause} condition , with more than two .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact612	1628.56	1629.09	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact613	1631.38	1638.18	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , Liz was raising the question of {disfmarker} of whether i it 's the number {disfmarker} there 's a relationship between the number of people and the number of overlaps or type of overlaps there ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact614	1637.17	1637.46	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact615	1638.79	1643.85	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and , um {vocalsound} If you had two people meeting in this kind of circumstance then you 'd still have the visuals .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact616	1643.85	1648.39	D	Professor	s	-1	0	You wouldn't have that difference {pause} also that you have in the {vocalsound} say , in Switchboard data .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact618	1649.18	1650.25	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh
Bmr007.F.dialogueact617	1648.82	1649.09	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact619	1649.21	1651.16	F	Postdoc	s^nd	-1	0	Yeah , I 'm just thinking that 'd be more like a c control condition .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact620	1651.25	1651.54	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact621	1651.67	1651.88	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .

Bmr007.H.dialogueact622	1652.36	1654.97	H	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , but from the acoustic point of view , it 's all good .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact624	1654.95	1655.63	E	PhD	s^2^aa	-1	0	Is the same .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact625	1655.78	1656.72	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	Yeah , acoustic is fine ,
Bmr007.D.dialogueact627	1656.72	1656.83	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bmr007.G.dialogueact626	1656.65	1664.23	G	PhD	s	+1	0	If {disfmarker} if the goal were to just look at overlap you would {disfmarker} you could serve yourself {disfmarker} save yourself a lot of time but not even transcri transcribe the words .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact629	1666.1	1671.08	B	PhD	s	+1	0	Well , I was thinking you should be able to do this from the {pause} acoustics , on the close - talking mikes ,

Bmr007.H.dialogueact637	1673.36	1676.04	H	Grad	s	-1	0	so {vocalsound} {pause} Once we 're done with this stuff discussing ,
Bmr007.B.dialogueact638	1673.91	1674.29	B	PhD	b	-1	0	right .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact640	1674.44	1678.41	B	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , not as well as what {disfmarker} I mean , you wouldn't be able to have any kind of typology , obviously ,
Bmr007.D.dialogueact639	1674.37	1674.63	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact642	1678.41	1681.2	B	PhD	s	-1	0	but you 'd get some rough statistics .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact641	1678.04	1678.47	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact644	1681.6	1681.76	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact643	1681.45	1683.2	D	Professor	fg|qo	-1	0	But {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what do you think about that ?
Bmr007.D.dialogueact645	1683.2	1684.05	D	Professor	qy	-1	0	Do you think that would be useful ?
Bmr007.D.dialogueact646	1684.05	1687.92	D	Professor	s	-1	0	I 'm just thinking that as an action item of whether we should try to record some two - person meetings or something .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact647	1686.78	1696.81	B	PhD	s^co	+1	0	I guess my {disfmarker} my first comment was , um {pause} only that {vocalsound} um we should n not attribute overlaps only to meetings ,
Bmr007.B.dialogueact648	1696.81	1697.82	B	PhD	s	-1	0	but maybe that 's obvious ,
Bmr007.B.dialogueact649	1697.95	1699.69	B	PhD	s	-1	0	maybe everybody knew that ,
Bmr007.D.dialogueact650	1698.88	1699.16	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact651	1699.69	1705.87	B	PhD	s	+1	0	but that {vocalsound} in normal conversation with two people there 's an awful lot of the same kinds of overlap ,
Bmr007.B.dialogueact653	1706.15	1720.04	B	PhD	s	+1	2	and that it would be interesting to look at {pause} whether there are these kinds of constraints that Jane mentioned , that {vocalsound} what maybe the additional people add to this competition that happens right after a turn ,
Bmr007.D.dialogueact652	1706.08	1706.32	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact654	1720.18	1722.48	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	you know , because now you can have five people trying to grab the turn ,
Bmr007.B.dialogueact655	1722.48	1725.0	B	PhD	s	-1	0	but pretty quickly there 're {disfmarker} they back off
Bmr007.B.dialogueact656	1725.0	1729.74	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and you go back to this sort of only one person at a time with one person interrupting at a time .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact657	1728.8	1729.12	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact658	1730.8	1731.45	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	So , I don't know .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact659	1731.45	1736.47	B	PhD	s	+1	0	To answer your question I {pause} it {disfmarker} I don't think it 's crucial to have controls
Bmr007.B.dialogueact660	1736.47	1739.79	B	PhD	s	+1	0	but I think it 's worth recording all the meetings we {pause} can .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact661	1739.18	1739.47	H	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Can .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact664	1740.65	1742.5	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	So , um {pause} you know .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact662	1740.52	1741.1	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Well , {vocalsound} OK .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact663	1740.54	1740.89	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact665	1741.34	1742.27	G	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I have an idea .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact666	1743.52	1746.96	B	PhD	s	-1	0	D I wouldn't not record a two - person meeting just because it only has two people .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact667	1745.46	1745.76	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact668	1746.29	1748.25	G	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	Could we {disfmarker} Could we , um {disfmarker}
Bmr007.G.dialogueact669	1749.97	1755.18	G	PhD	s	+1	0	we have {disfmarker} have in the past and I think continue {disfmarker} will continue to have a fair number of {pause} uh phone conference calls .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact670	1755.78	1756.0	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact672	1756.39	1771.84	G	PhD	fh|s^cs	+1	0	And , {vocalsound} uh , {pause} and as a {disfmarker} to , um {vocalsound} as another c {pause} c comparison {pause} condition , {pause} we could um see what {disfmarker} what what happens in terms of overlap , when you don't have visual contact .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact671	1755.98	1757.8	H	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , we talked about this repeatedly .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact673	1773.12	1773.99	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	So , um {disfmarker}
Bmr007.B.dialogueact674	1773.74	1774.97	B	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Can we actually record ?
Bmr007.H.dialogueact675	1774.15	1777.2	H	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	It just seems like that 's a very different {pause} thing than what we 're doing .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact676	1775.88	1778.35	D	Professor	fh|s^ng	-1	0	Uh Well , we 'll have to set up for it .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact677	1776.77	1779.73	B	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	I mean {pause} physically {pause} can we record the o the other {disfmarker}
Bmr007.D.dialogueact678	1778.46	1778.84	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact679	1779.78	1781.83	D	Professor	s^ng	+1	0	Well , we 're not really set up for it {pause} to do that .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact680	1781.96	1782.14	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	But .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact681	1782.2	1790.77	G	PhD	fg|s^cs	+1	2	Or , this is getting a little extravagant , we could put up some kind of blinds or something to {disfmarker} {pause} to remove , uh {pause} visual contact .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact682	1783.41	1783.62	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.C.dialogueact684	1788.04	1788.28	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr007.B.dialogueact685	1789.75	1792.63	B	PhD	s	-1	0	That 's what they did on Map Task , you know , this Map Task corpus ?
Bmr007.B.dialogueact686	1792.63	1796.63	B	PhD	s	-1	0	They ran exactly the same pairs of people with and without visual cues
Bmr007.B.dialogueact687	1796.63	1797.68	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and it 's quite interesting .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact688	1798.13	1804.77	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , we {disfmarker} we record this meeting so regularly it wouldn't be that {disfmarker} I mean {pause} a little strange .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact689	1803.53	1805.57	H	Grad	s^co^j	-1	0	OK , we can record , but no one can look at each other .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact690	1805.76	1807.41	B	PhD	fg|s^cs^j	-1	0	Well , we could just put {pause} b blindfolds on .
Bmr007.C.dialogueact691	1806.04	1806.22	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact693	1806.32	1807.29	G	PhD	fg|%--	-1	0	Well y no you {disfmarker} f

Bmr007.B.dialogueact697	1809.13	1811.7	B	PhD	s^j	-1	0	and we 'd take a picture of everybody sitting here with blindfolds .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact698	1811.7	1811.96	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	That would {disfmarker}
Bmr007.D.dialogueact699	1812.92	1814.09	D	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Oh , th that was the other thing ,
Bmr007.D.dialogueact700	1814.09	1817.56	D	Professor	qy^rt	+1	0	weren't we gonna take a picture {pause} at the beginning of each of these meetings ?
Bmr007.H.dialogueact701	1817.73	1824.28	H	Grad	h|s^nd	+1	0	Um , what {disfmarker} I had thought we were gonna do is just take pictures of the whiteboards . rather than take pictures of the meeting .

Bmr007.F.dialogueact706	1825.97	1831.34	F	Postdoc	s^ng	-1	0	Linguistic anthropologists would {disfmarker} would suggest it would be useful to also take a picture of the meeting .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact707	1827.72	1829.35	D	Professor	s	-1	0	There 's a head nodding here vigorously , yeah .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact708	1831.75	1833.18	A	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	Why {disfmarker} why do we want to have a picture of the meeting ?
Bmr007.B.dialogueact710	1832.24	1834.49	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Ee - {pause} you mean , transc {pause} no {disfmarker}
Bmr007.F.dialogueact709	1831.75	1836.16	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	The {disfmarker} because you get then the spatial relationship of the speakers .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact713	1836.31	1837.13	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah Yeah .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact712	1836.16	1837.09	F	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	And that {pause} could be
Bmr007.G.dialogueact711	1835.72	1839.54	G	PhD	s^cs^ng	+1	0	Well , you could do that by just noting on the enrollment sheet the {disfmarker} {pause} the seat number .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact714	1837.95	1838.19	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact715	1838.28	1839.46	H	Grad	s	+1	0	Seat number , that 's a good idea .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact716	1839.64	1840.14	H	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	I 'll do that .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact717	1840.33	1840.46	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact718	1840.37	1841.67	H	Grad	s^cc	+1	1	I 'll do that on the next set of forms .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact720	1841.94	1842.0	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact719	1841.78	1843.04	G	PhD	s	-1	0	So you 'd number them somehow .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact721	1842.4	1847.19	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Is possible to get information from the rhythmic {disfmarker} f from the ge , eh {pause} uh , files .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact722	1844.22	1849.89	H	Grad	s	-1	0	I finally remembered to put , uh put native language on the newer forms .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact723	1847.55	1849.61	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	We can {disfmarker} can't you figure it out from the mike number ?
Bmr007.H.dialogueact724	1851.32	1851.53	H	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact725	1851.87	1852.09	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .

Bmr007.B.dialogueact729	1859.17	1861.04	B	PhD	s^arp	-1	0	But probably from these you could 've {comment} infer it .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact730	1861.66	1863.75	G	PhD	s^nd.%-	-1	0	Yeah , but It 's {disfmarker} it would be trivial {disfmarker}
Bmr007.H.dialogueact731	1862.16	1863.4	H	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	It would be another task .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact732	1862.97	1864.1	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	It would be a research task .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact733	1863.4	1866.84	H	Grad	s	-1	0	Having {disfmarker} having ground tu truth would be nice , so {pause} seat number would be good .

Bmr007.F.dialogueact775	1913.97	1916.01	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Yeah . {comment} Well , I mean you black out the {disfmarker} that part .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact776	1914.99	1915.42	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact777	1916.0	1917.27	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But it 's just , you know , the {disfmarker} the body
Bmr007.A.dialogueact778	1918.14	1918.51	A	PhD	s	-1	0	He agreed .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact779	1918.37	1918.61	F	Postdoc	qy^d^g	-1	0	you know ?
Bmr007.H.dialogueact780	1920.2	1926.69	H	Grad	s	-1	0	Of course , the {disfmarker} where we sit at the table , I find is very interesting , that we do tend to {pause} cong {pause} to gravitate to the same place each time .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact781	1926.3	1926.53	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact782	1927.11	1928.62	H	Grad	s	-1	0	and it 's somewhat coincidental .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact783	1928.62	1934.17	H	Grad	s	-1	0	I 'm sitting here so that I can run into the room if the hardware starts , you know , catching fire or something .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact784	1933.04	1935.76	G	PhD	s^j.%--	-1	0	Oh , no , you {disfmarker} you just like to be in charge , that 's why you 're sitting {disfmarker}
Bmr007.H.dialogueact785	1935.15	1936.62	H	Grad	s^j	-1	0	I just want to be at the head of the table .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact786	1936.35	1936.68	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact787	1937.36	1938.09	H	Grad	s^j	-1	0	Take control .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact788	1938.47	1941.54	D	Professor	s^t^tc	-1	0	Speaking of taking control , you said you had some research to talk about .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact789	1940.74	1940.83	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact791	1941.32	1941.41	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact790	1940.96	1946.08	H	Grad	s	+1	2	Yeah , I 've been playing with , um uh , using the close - talking mike to do {disfmarker} to try to figure out who 's speaking .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact792	1946.69	1951.35	H	Grad	s	+1	2	So my first attempt was just using thresholding and filtering , that we talked about {disfmarker} about two weeks ago ,
Bmr007.H.dialogueact793	1951.91	1961.78	H	Grad	s	-1	0	and so I played with that a little bit , and {vocalsound} it works O K , {pause} except that {pause} it 's very sensitive to your choice of {vocalsound} your filter width and your {vocalsound} threshold .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact794	1962.33	1968.3	H	Grad	s	+1	1	So if you fiddle around with it a little bit and you get good numbers you can actually do a pretty good job of segmenting when someone 's talking and when they 're not .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact795	1968.78	1971.86	H	Grad	s	+1	1	But if you try to use the same paramenters on another speaker , it doesn't work anymore ,
Bmr007.H.dialogueact796	1971.86	1975.5	H	Grad	s	+1	0	even if you normalize it based on the absolute loudness .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact797	1975.98	1978.5	B	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	But does it work for that one speaker throughout the whole meeting ?
Bmr007.H.dialogueact798	1978.63	1980.64	H	Grad	s^na	+1	1	It does work for the one speaker throughout the whole meeting .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact799	1981.03	1982.51	H	Grad	fh|s^na	-1	0	Um Pretty well .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact801	1982.78	1983.6	A	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	How did you do it Adam ?
Bmr007.H.dialogueact800	1982.67	1983.09	H	Grad	s^na^r	-1	0	Pretty well .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact802	1984.0	1984.62	H	Grad	qw^bu^rt	-1	0	How did I do it ?
Bmr007.A.dialogueact804	1984.75	1984.95	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact803	1984.62	1985.15	H	Grad	qw^bu	-1	0	What do you mean ?
Bmr007.A.dialogueact805	1985.34	1986.29	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , wh what was the {disfmarker}
Bmr007.H.dialogueact806	1986.91	1994.87	H	Grad	s	+1	0	The algorithm was , uh take o every frame that 's over the threshold , and then median - filter it , {vocalsound} and then look for runs .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact807	1987.72	1988.01	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact808	1993.41	1993.76	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact809	1996.88	1998.2	H	Grad	s	+1	0	So there was a minimum run length ,
Bmr007.A.dialogueact810	1998.15	1999.66	A	PhD	qw^d^rt	-1	0	Every frame that 's over what threshold ?
Bmr007.H.dialogueact811	1998.2	1998.44	H	Grad	%-	-1	0	so that {disfmarker}
Bmr007.H.dialogueact812	2000.01	2001.07	H	Grad	s	-1	0	A threshold that you pick .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact813	2001.54	2002.32	A	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	In terms of energy ?
Bmr007.A.dialogueact815	2002.71	2002.9	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Ah !
Bmr007.H.dialogueact814	2002.37	2002.53	H	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact816	2003.07	2003.23	A	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact817	2004.14	2004.63	F	Postdoc	s^br	-1	0	Say that again ?
Bmr007.F.dialogueact818	2004.93	2006.12	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Frame over fres threshold .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact819	2005.82	2008.29	H	Grad	s	+1	0	So you take a {disfmarker} each frame , and you compute the energy
Bmr007.H.dialogueact820	2008.29	2014.52	H	Grad	s	+1	0	and if it 's over the threshold you set it to one , and if it 's under the threshold you set it to zero , {vocalsound} so now you have a bit stream {pause} of zeros and ones .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact821	2012.25	2012.42	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact822	2013.85	2014.15	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact823	2014.94	2019.65	H	Grad	s	+1	0	And then I median - filtered that {vocalsound} using , um {pause} a fairly long {pause} filter length .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact824	2020.87	2025.14	H	Grad	fh|s	+1	0	Uh {pause} well , actually I guess depends on what you mean by long , you know , tenth of a second sorts of numbers .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact825	2025.74	2031.74	H	Grad	fh|s	+1	0	Um and that 's to average out you know , pitch , you know , the pitch contours , and things like that .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact826	2032.39	2034.92	H	Grad	s	+1	0	And then , uh looked for long runs .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact827	2035.99	2036.17	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK
Bmr007.H.dialogueact828	2038.63	2046.72	H	Grad	s	+1	1	And that works O K , if you fil if you tune the filter parameters , if you tune {vocalsound} how long your median filter is and how high you 're looking for your thresholds .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact829	2047.82	2051.2	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Did you ever try running the filter before you pick a threshold ?
Bmr007.H.dialogueact830	2051.36	2051.57	H	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact831	2052.03	2052.68	H	Grad	s	-1	0	I certainly could though .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact832	2054.65	2058.68	H	Grad	s	-1	0	But this was just I had the program mostly written already so it was easy to do .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact833	2059.06	2068.13	H	Grad	s	+1	2	OK and then the other thing I did , was I took {vocalsound} Javier 's speaker - change detector {disfmarker} acoustic - change detector , and I implemented that with the close - talking mikes ,
Bmr007.H.dialogueact834	2068.7	2073.32	H	Grad	s.%--	+1	1	and {pause} unfortunately that 's not working real well , and it looks like it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr007.H.dialogueact835	2073.74	2075.61	H	Grad	s	+1	0	the problem is {disfmarker} he does it in two passes ,
Bmr007.H.dialogueact836	2075.61	2078.69	H	Grad	s	+1	0	the first pass {vocalsound} is to find candidate places to do a break .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact837	2079.58	2087.61	H	Grad	s	+1	0	And he does that using a neural net doing broad phone classification and he has the {vocalsound} the , uh {pause} one of the phone classes is silence .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact838	2088.15	2090.81	H	Grad	s	-1	0	And so the possible breaks are where silence starts and ends .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact839	2091.4	2094.87	H	Grad	s	+1	0	And then he has a second pass which is a modeling {disfmarker} a Gaussian mixture model .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact840	2095.4	2102.84	H	Grad	fh|s	+1	0	Um looking for {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} whether it improves or {disfmarker} or degrades to split at one of those particular places .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact841	2103.73	2111.59	H	Grad	s	+1	1	And what looks like it 's happening is that the {disfmarker} even on the close - talking mike the broad phone class classifier 's doing a really bad job .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact842	2112.74	2113.49	A	PhD	qw	-1	0	Who was it trained on ?
Bmr007.H.dialogueact843	2113.78	2114.52	H	Grad	h|s^no	-1	0	Uh , I have no idea .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact845	2114.82	2115.23	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact844	2114.75	2115.34	H	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I don't remember .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact846	2116.01	2117.13	H	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Does an do you remember , Morgan ,
Bmr007.H.dialogueact847	2117.13	2118.22	H	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	was it Broadcast News ?
Bmr007.D.dialogueact848	2118.72	2119.48	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	I think so , yeah .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact849	2119.83	2130.3	H	Grad	fg|s	+1	2	Um {pause} So , at any rate , my next attempt , {pause} which I 'm in the midst of and haven't quite finished yet was actually using the {vocalsound} uh , thresholding as the way of generating the candidates .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact850	2131.04	2135.51	H	Grad	s	-1	0	Because one of the things that definitely happens is if you put the threshold low {vocalsound} you get lots of breaks .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact851	2135.88	2138.11	H	Grad	s	-1	0	All of which are definitely acoustic events .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact852	2138.66	2140.91	H	Grad	s	-1	0	They 're definitely {vocalsound} someone talking .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact853	2141.33	2146.12	H	Grad	s	-1	0	But , like , it could be someone who isn't the person here , but the person over there or it can be the person breathing .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact854	2146.9	2149.02	H	Grad	s	+1	0	And then feeding that into the acoustic change detector .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact855	2150.89	2151.96	H	Grad	s	-1	0	And so I think that might work .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact856	2152.79	2154.18	H	Grad	s	-1	0	But , I haven't gotten very far on that .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact857	2155.71	2157.6	H	Grad	s	+1	2	But all of this is close - talking mike ,
Bmr007.H.dialogueact858	2157.79	2158.11	H	Grad	fh	-1	0	so
Bmr007.H.dialogueact859	2159.07	2162.18	H	Grad	s	-1	0	it 's , uh {pause} just {disfmarker} just trying to get some ground truth .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact860	2159.6	2162.07	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Only with eh uh ,
Bmr007.E.dialogueact861	2162.19	2172.33	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but eh I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think , eh when {disfmarker} when , y I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I saw the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the speech from PDA and , eh {pause} close {pause} {vocalsound} talker .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact862	2172.33	2176.98	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I think the there is a {disfmarker} a great difference in the {disfmarker} in the signal .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact863	2176.76	2177.34	H	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Oh , absolutely .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact865	2177.47	2192.67	E	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Um but eh I {disfmarker} but eh I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean that eh eh {pause} in the {disfmarker} in the mixed file {vocalsound} you can find , uh {pause} zone with , eh {pause} great different , eh {pause} level of energy .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact864	2177.34	2181.02	H	Grad	s	+1	0	So {pause} s my intention for this is {disfmarker} is as an aide for ground truth .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact866	2181.55	2181.87	H	Grad	%-	-1	0	not {disfmarker}
Bmr007.E.dialogueact867	2193.65	2206.63	E	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	Um {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I think for , eh {pause} algorithm based on energy , {pause} eh , that um h mmm , {disfmarker} more or less , eh , like eh {pause} eh , mmm , first sound energy detector .

Bmr007.E.dialogueact906	2335.62	2342.64	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Because , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think it 's more realistic that , uh {pause} only consider the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the silence between the speaker .

Bmr007.E.dialogueact911	2354.96	2360.72	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I found that the , eh {pause} silence in {disfmarker} in many occasions in the {disfmarker} in the speech file ,
Bmr007.E.dialogueact912	2361.3	2383.62	E	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	but , eh {pause} when you have , eh {pause} eh , two speakers together without enough silence between {disfmarker} between them , eh {pause} {vocalsound} I think eh {pause} is better to use the acoustic change detector basically and I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I IX or , mmm , BIC criterion for consider all the frames in my opinion .

Bmr007.D.dialogueact914	2383.96	2392.37	D	Professor	fg|s^ng	-1	0	Yeah , the {disfmarker} you know , the reason that he , uh {pause} just used silence {vocalsound} was not because he thought it was better , it was {disfmarker} it was {disfmarker} it was the place he was starting .

Bmr007.D.dialogueact920	2394.56	2401.65	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and , uh e e you know , as {disfmarker} as {disfmarker} {vocalsound} as is in your case , if you 're here for only a modest number of months you try to pick a realistic goal ,

Bmr007.D.dialogueact924	2401.94	2406.67	D	Professor	s	-1	0	But his {disfmarker} his goal was always to proceed from there to then allow broad category change also .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact925	2407.01	2407.24	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact926	2407.85	2420.61	E	PhD	fg|qy	-1	0	But , eh {pause} do {disfmarker} do you think that if you consider all the frames to apply {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the , eh {pause} the BIC criterion to detect the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the different acoustic change , {vocalsound} eh {pause} between speaker ,

Bmr007.E.dialogueact929	2424.37	2431.31	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I think like {disfmarker} like , eh {pause} eh a general , eh {pause} eh {pause} way of process the {disfmarker} the acoustic change .

Bmr007.E.dialogueact933	2434.16	2443.98	E	PhD	s	-1	0	An - and then , eh {pause} {vocalsound} eh {pause} without considering the you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you , um {pause} you can consider the energy {vocalsound} like a another parameter in the {disfmarker} in the feature vector ,
Bmr007.E.dialogueact936	2443.98	2444.08	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	eh .

Bmr007.E.dialogueact939	2445.79	2462.49	E	PhD	s	-1	0	And if , if you do that , eh {pause} eh , with a BIC uh criterion for example , or with another kind of , eh {pause} of distance in a first step , {vocalsound} and then you , eh {pause} you get the , eh {pause} the hypothesis to the {disfmarker} this change acoustic , {vocalsound} eh {pause} {vocalsound} to po process
Bmr007.H.dialogueact940	2462.69	2463.0	H	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact941	2463.44	2479.05	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Because , eh {pause} eh , probably you {disfmarker} you can find the {disfmarker} the {vocalsound} eh {pause} a small gap of silence between speaker {vocalsound} with eh {pause} eh {pause} a ga mmm , {pause} {vocalsound} small duration Less than , {vocalsound} eh {pause} two hundred milliseconds for example

Bmr007.E.dialogueact943	2479.42	2493.22	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and apply another {disfmarker} another algorithm , another approach like , eh {pause} eh {pause} detector of ene , eh detector of bass - tone energy to {disfmarker} to consider that , eh {vocalsound} that , eh {pause} zone . of s a small silence between speaker ,

Bmr007.E.dialogueact946	2505.64	2520.62	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I think is , eh {pause} nnn , it will be a an {disfmarker} an {disfmarker} a more general approach {vocalsound} the {pause} if we compare {disfmarker} with use , eh {pause} a neural net or another , eh {pause} speech recognizer with a broad class or {disfmarker} or narrow class ,
Bmr007.E.dialogueact948	2520.96	2543.98	E	PhD	s	-1	0	because , in my opinion eh {pause} it 's in my opinion , {vocalsound} eh if you {disfmarker} if you change the condition of the speech , I mean , if you adjust to your algorithm with a mixed speech file and to , eh {vocalsound} to , eh {pause} {vocalsound} adapt the neural net , eh {pause} used by Javier with a mixed file .

Bmr007.D.dialogueact965	2570.03	2575.79	D	Professor	s	-1	0	One {disfmarker} once {disfmarker} It 's a {disfmarker} I used to work , like , on voiced {disfmarker} on voice silence detection , you know , and this is this {pause} kind of thing .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact964	2569.68	2569.94	E	PhD	qy^bh	-1	0	Really ?
Bmr007.E.dialogueact966	2574.99	2575.23	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact967	2576.4	2585.65	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Um {pause} If you {vocalsound} have somebody who has some experience with this sort of thing , and they work on it for a couple months , {vocalsound} they can come up with something that gets most of the cases fairly easily .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact968	2586.12	2589.41	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Then you say , " OK , I don't just wanna get most of the cases I want it to be really accurate . "
Bmr007.D.dialogueact969	2589.41	2591.15	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Then it gets really hard no matter what you do .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact970	2591.9	2602.48	D	Professor	s	-1	0	So , the p the problem is is that if you say , " Well I {disfmarker} I have these other data over here , {vocalsound} that I learn things from , either explicit training of neural nets or of Gaussian mixture models or whatever . "
Bmr007.E.dialogueact971	2597.46	2597.73	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr007.D.dialogueact973	2604.95	2606.72	D	Professor	s	-1	0	You say you have looked for acoustic change .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact974	2606.72	2607.72	D	Professor	qw	-1	0	Well , what does that mean ?
Bmr007.D.dialogueact975	2608.18	2610.5	D	Professor	s	-1	0	That {disfmarker} that means you set some thresholds somewhere or something ,
Bmr007.E.dialogueact976	2608.2	2608.58	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact977	2610.5	2610.69	D	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr007.D.dialogueact979	2611.41	2614.02	D	Professor	qw	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and so {vocalsound} where do you get your thresholds from ?
Bmr007.E.dialogueact978	2611.14	2611.38	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact980	2614.14	2615.76	D	Professor	s	-1	0	From something that you looked at .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact981	2615.76	2618.38	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	So {vocalsound} you always have this problem , you 're going to new data
Bmr007.D.dialogueact982	2618.9	2626.8	D	Professor	fh|qw	+1	0	um {pause} H how are you going to adapt whatever you can very quickly learn about the new data ? {vocalsound} Uh , if it 's gonna be different from old data that you have ?
Bmr007.D.dialogueact983	2626.8	2628.73	D	Professor	s	+1	0	And I think that 's a problem {pause} with this .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact984	2628.1	2633.66	H	Grad	fg|s	+1	0	Well , also what I 'm doing right now is not intended to be an acoustic change detector for far - field mikes .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact985	2633.66	2644.96	H	Grad	s	+1	2	What I 'm doing {vocalsound} is trying to use the close - talking mike {vocalsound} and just use {disfmarker} {pause} Can - and just generate candidate and just {pause} try to get a first pass at something that sort of works .

Bmr007.G.dialogueact998	2650.8	2667.44	G	PhD	s	+1	0	but , um {pause} I can imagine {pause} uh building {pause} a {pause} um {pause} model of speaker change {pause} detection {pause} that {vocalsound} takes into account {pause} both the far - field and the {vocalsound} uh {pause} actually , not just the close - talking mike for that speaker , but actually for all of th {pause} for all of the speakers .

Bmr007.G.dialogueact1003	2678.31	2685.64	G	PhD	s	-1	0	basically I think you 'd {disfmarker} you would {pause} build a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} an HMM that has as a state space all of the possible speaker combinations

Bmr007.D.dialogueact1020	2712.32	2712.57	D	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1022	2712.69	2715.39	D	Professor	s	-1	0	And then he had some sort of {vocalsound} reasonable way of doing that ,
Bmr007.G.dialogueact1021	2712.49	2713.0	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1023	2715.44	2724.8	D	Professor	qw^cs	+1	0	but {vocalsound} uh , what if you were just looking at very simple measures like energy measures but you don't just compare it to some threshold {pause} overall but you compare it to the {vocalsound} energy in the other microphones .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact1024	2725.19	2728.33	H	Grad	s^na	+1	0	I was thinking about doing that originally to find out {pause} who 's the loudest ,
Bmr007.H.dialogueact1025	2728.5	2729.9	H	Grad	s^e^rt	-1	0	and that person is certainly talking .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1026	2730.43	2730.86	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact1027	2730.64	2733.86	H	Grad	s	+1	0	But I also wanted to find threshold {disfmarker} uh , excuse me , mol overlap .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1028	2734.58	2734.96	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact1029	2735.43	2737.57	H	Grad	s	-1	0	So , not just {disfmarker} just the loudest .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact1031	2736.66	2736.95	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	But , eh
Bmr007.F.dialogueact1030	2736.26	2736.64	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact1032	2736.95	2738.68	E	PhD	s^fa	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I Sorry .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact1033	2738.83	2753.28	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I have found that when {disfmarker} when I I analyzed the {disfmarker} the speech files from the , {pause} eh {pause} mike , eh {pause} from the eh close eh {pause} microphone , eh {pause} I found zones with a {disfmarker} a different level of energy .
Bmr007.G.dialogueact1034	2739.66	2740.35	G	PhD	s	-1	0	Sorry , I have to go .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact1035	2740.56	2740.83	H	Grad	s^bk^t3	-1	0	OK .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact1036	2743.83	2744.87	H	Grad	qy^cs^t3	-1	0	Could you fill that out anyway ?
Bmr007.H.dialogueact1037	2745.44	2746.78	H	Grad	s^co^t3	-1	0	Just , {pause} put your name in .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact1038	2747.86	2748.59	H	Grad	qy^d^rt^t3	-1	0	Are y you want me to do it ?
Bmr007.H.dialogueact1039	2748.76	2749.1	H	Grad	s^cc^t3	-1	0	I 'll do it .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact1040	2749.53	2750.54	A	PhD	s^ng^t3	-1	0	But he 's not gonna even read that .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact1042	2750.62	2750.82	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact1041	2750.6	2750.9	H	Grad	s^na^t3	-1	0	I know .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact1043	2754.44	2756.36	E	PhD	s	-1	0	including overlap zone .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact1044	2756.59	2757.06	E	PhD	s^bsc	-1	0	including .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact1045	2757.78	2770.52	E	PhD	s	-1	0	because , eh {pause} eh {pause} depend on the position of the {disfmarker} of the microph of the each speaker {vocalsound} to , eh , to get more o or less energy {vocalsound} i in the mixed sign in the signal .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact1046	2771.09	2782.9	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and then , {vocalsound} if you consider energy to {disfmarker} to detect overlapping in {disfmarker} in , uh , and you process the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the speech file from the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the mixed signals .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact1047	2783.32	2784.84	E	PhD	s^bsc	-1	0	The mixed signals , eh .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact1048	2785.69	2799.3	E	PhD	s	+1	0	I {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's difficult , um {vocalsound} {pause} only to en with energy to {disfmarker} to consider that in that zone We have eh , eh , overlapping zone Eh , if you process only the the energy of the , of each frame .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1049	2799.69	2800.59	D	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	Well , it 's probably harder ,
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1050	2800.59	2812.17	D	Professor	s	+1	0	but I {disfmarker} I think what I was s nnn noting just when he {disfmarker} when Andreas raised that , was that there 's other information to be gained from looking at all {vocalsound} of the microphones and you may not need to look at very sophisticated things ,
Bmr007.E.dialogueact1051	2810.92	2811.23	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1052	2812.17	2822.49	D	Professor	s	-1	0	because if there 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if most of the overlaps {disfmarker} you know , this doesn't cover , say , three , but if most of the overlaps , say , are two , {vocalsound} if the distribution looks like there 's a couple high ones and {disfmarker} and {pause} the rest of them are low ,
Bmr007.E.dialogueact1053	2812.26	2812.64	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact1054	2816.34	2816.59	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr007.H.dialogueact1056	2821.36	2822.77	H	Grad	s^2	-1	0	And everyone else is low , yeah .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1058	2822.49	2822.97	D	Professor	qy^d^f^rt	-1	0	you know , what I mean ,
Bmr007.E.dialogueact1059	2822.55	2822.8	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1060	2823.24	2826.37	D	Professor	s	-1	0	there 's some information there about their distribution even with very simple measures .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact1061	2824.93	2825.19	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact1062	2826.37	2826.57	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1063	2827.05	2834.76	D	Professor	s^cs^j	-1	0	Uh , by the way , I had an idea with {disfmarker} while I was watching Chuck nodding at a lot of these things , is that we can all wear little bells on our heads , {vocalsound} so that {vocalsound} then you 'd know that {disfmarker}
Bmr007.E.dialogueact1064	2832.68	2832.82	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr007.F.dialogueact1068	2834.67	2835.38	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	That 's cute !
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1069	2835.53	2838.21	B	PhD	s^cs^na	-1	0	I think that 'd be really interesting too , with blindfolds .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1071	2839.69	2839.9	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	Then {disfmarker}
Bmr007.H.dialogueact1070	2839.41	2840.46	H	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	Nodding with blindfolds ,
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1072	2840.46	2840.83	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1074	2840.83	2842.86	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	The question is , {pause} like {pause} whether {disfmarker}

Bmr007.B.dialogueact1075	2842.99	2846.14	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Well , trying with and {disfmarker} {pause} with and without , yeah .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact1076	2843.1	2844.57	H	Grad	s^fa^j	-1	0	" Sorry , I 'm just {disfmarker} I 'm just going to sleep . "

Bmr007.A.dialogueact1079	2848.67	2854.95	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Actually , I saw a uh {disfmarker} a woman at the bus stop the other day who , um , was talking on her cell phone {vocalsound} speaking Japanese , and was bowing .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact1081	2855.34	2856.45	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	you know , profusely .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1082	2855.49	2857.5	B	PhD	s	-1	0	Oh , yeah , that 's really common .
Bmr007.C.dialogueact1083	2855.76	2855.93	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.E.dialogueact1080	2855.28	2856.15	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah {comment} Yeah .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact1085	2856.58	2857.27	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Just , kept {disfmarker}
Bmr007.E.dialogueact1086	2856.94	2857.23	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr007.D.dialogueact1087	2857.85	2858.15	D	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Wow .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1088	2858.65	2864.07	B	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	It 's very difficult if you try {disfmarker} while you 're trying , say , to convince somebody on the phone it 's difficult not to move your hands .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1089	2864.89	2867.31	B	PhD	s	-1	0	Not {disfmarker} You know , if you watch people they 'll actually do these things .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1090	2865.12	2865.6	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm ?
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1091	2867.31	2867.59	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1092	2868.72	2871.39	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	I still think we should try a {disfmarker} a meeting or two with the blindfolds ,
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1093	2871.39	2873.68	B	PhD	s	-1	0	at least of this meeting that we have lots of recordings of
Bmr007.H.dialogueact1094	2873.12	2873.55	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1096	2874.52	2877.36	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Um , maybe for part of the meeting , we don't have to do it the whole meeting .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1095	2874.27	2875.09	D	Professor	s^aa.%-	-1	0	Yeah , I think th
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1097	2877.45	2878.28	D	Professor	s^ba^na	-1	0	I think it 's a great idea .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1098	2878.05	2878.66	B	PhD	s	-1	0	That could be fun .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1099	2879.0	2882.61	B	PhD	s	+1	0	It 'll be too hard to make barriers , I was thinking because they have to go all the way
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1100	2879.05	2882.77	D	Professor	b	-1	0	W Yeah .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1101	2883.19	2885.59	B	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	you know , I can see Chuck even if you put a barrier here .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact1102	2884.37	2886.24	H	Grad	fg|s^cs	-1	0	Well , we could just turn out the lights .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact1103	2885.61	2894.36	F	Postdoc	fg|s^rt	-1	0	Actually {pause} well also {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I can say I made barr barriers for {disfmarker} so that {disfmarker} the {pause} stuff I was doing with Collin wha {pause} which {pause} just used , um {pause} this {pause} kind of foam board .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1104	2889.94	2890.62	B	PhD	qy^bh^d^rt	-1	0	Y Yeah ?
Bmr007.F.dialogueact1105	2894.46	2895.47	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	R really inexpensive .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact1106	2895.47	2897.27	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	You can {disfmarker} you can masking tape it together ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact1107	2897.27	2899.74	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	these are {pause} you know , pretty l large partitions .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1108	2898.03	2898.29	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1109	2898.53	2901.47	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	But then we also have these mikes , is the other thing I was thinking ,
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1110	2901.47	2905.04	B	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	so we need a barrier that doesn't disturb {pause} the sound ,
Bmr007.F.dialogueact1112	2903.67	2906.12	F	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	It 's true , it would disturb the , um {pause} the {disfmarker} the long - range {disfmarker}
Bmr007.H.dialogueact1111	2903.63	2904.45	H	Grad	s^2	-1	0	The acoustics .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1113	2905.43	2905.89	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	um
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1114	2906.07	2906.95	D	Professor	s^cs^na	-1	0	Blindfolds would be good .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact1116	2906.12	2906.31	F	Postdoc	%	-1	0	it would {disfmarker}
Bmr007.H.dialogueact1115	2906.07	2907.2	H	Grad	s^cs^na	-1	0	I think , blindfolds .
Bmr007.B.dialogueact1117	2907.48	2915.36	B	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , it sounds weird but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} {pause} you know it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's cheap and , uh Be interesting to have the camera going .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1118	2907.51	2909.67	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Probably we should wait until after Adam 's set up the mikes ,

Bmr007.F.dialogueact1120	2913.77	2914.05	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr007.F.dialogueact1121	2916.7	2920.44	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	I think we 're going to have to work on the , uh {disfmarker} {pause} on the human subjects {vocalsound} form .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact1122	2917.5	2918.13	A	PhD	s^j	-1	0	I 'll be peeking .
Bmr007.H.dialogueact1123	2919.38	2921.56	H	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , that 's right , we didn't tell them we would be blindfolding .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1124	2920.31	2920.49	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker}

Bmr007.D.dialogueact1126	2923.66	2925.48	D	Professor	s^co^j	-1	0	that 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that 's the one that we videotape .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1127	2925.56	2925.89	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1128	2927.13	2928.51	D	Professor	fh|s^co^tc	-1	0	Um , I {disfmarker} I wanna move this along .

Bmr007.D.dialogueact1130	2936.76	2940.5	D	Professor	s	+1	1	So this is the things that I think we did {vocalsound} in the last three months
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1131	2940.98	2948.12	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	obviously not everything we did but {disfmarker} but sort of highlights that I can {disfmarker} {pause} can {pause} tell {pause} s some outside person , you know , what {disfmarker} what were you {pause} actually working on .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1132	2948.76	2957.63	D	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	Um {pause} in no particular order {vocalsound} uh , one , uh , ten more hours of meeting r meetings recorded , something like that , you know from {disfmarker} from , uh {pause} three months ago .
Bmr007.D.dialogueact1133	2958.23	2963.0	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh {pause} XML formats and other transcription aspects sorted out {pause} and uh {pause} sent to IBM .

Bmr007.D.dialogueact1139	2981.43	2987.06	D	Professor	s^rt	+1	0	so the meeting participants have a chance to request audio pixelization of selected parts of the spee their speech .

Bmr007.D.dialogueact1193	3120.82	3125.9	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	so that at the moment tho th the idea we 're running with is {disfmarker} is h putting the beep over it .

Bmr007.H.dialogueact1202	3136.28	3138.86	H	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	but for software it 's probably better for it to be silence .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact1203	3139.0	3139.2	A	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No , no .
Bmr007.A.dialogueact1204	3139.2	3143.75	A	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	You can {disfmarker} you know , you could make a m as long as you keep using the same beep , people could make a model of that beep ,

Bmr007.A.dialogueact1207	3143.85	3144.04	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
