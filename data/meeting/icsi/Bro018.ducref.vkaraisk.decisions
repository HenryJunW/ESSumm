For possible improvements in the voicedness detection , it was suggested that the MLP inputs become simpler: the net can be fed just with the log magnitude ( perhaps along with the variance ) over multiple frames.
The accuracy of the two nets should be compared by adding all the probabilities of voiced/unvoiced phones in the 56-output MLP; the respective result in the other MLP should be at least as good.
At the same time , the France Telecom proposal and code will be studied closely for useful ideas.
Regarding the acoustic events experiment , it was recommended that a simpler task be done first: event/phone co-occurrences should be counted in order to get phone probabilities for a discrete HMM.
The results can be used as base for the evaluation of more sophisticated methods.
An appropriately modified version of TIMIT can be used as training data.
As for the PLP/mel cepstrum comparison , a test is going to be carried out to check whether the pruning threshold is causing the search errors.
Finally , the subtraction method for spectral means will also be tested on SRI , since the base results for this were much better that for Aurora.
