Bmr018.F.dialogueact9	5.86	6.48	F	PhD	z	-1	0	yeah that 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact10	7.31	8.61	D	PhD	z	-1	0	it never crashes on me i think 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact11	8.849	9.929	E	Grad	z	-1	0	on me what is i think it's actually 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact12	9.54	10.84	D	PhD	z	-1	0	what is what is that it's actually it depends on if the 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact13	10.029	12.829	E	Grad	z	-1	0	what is that it depends on if the temp files are there or not at least 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact14	12.829	14.849	E	Grad	z	-1	0	uh are there or not at least that's my current working hypothesis 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact15	14.03	14.76	D	PhD	z	-1	0	hypothesis 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact16	15.371	19.521	E	Grad	z	-1	0	that i think what happens is it tries to clear the temp files and if they're too big crashes 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact17	19.53	20.0	D	PhD	z	-1	0	when the power went out the 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact18	20.2	23.75	B	PhD	z	-1	0	when the power went out the other day and i restart it crashed the first time oh that's right 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact19	22.59	23.24	E	Grad	z	-1	0	it crashed the first time oh that's right 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact20	24.849	25.649	B	PhD	z	-1	0	after that time so then there would be no temp files 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact21	24.86	26.36	D	PhD	z	-1	0	after that time so then there would be no temp files 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact22	27.346	27.606	C	Professor	z	-1	0	i 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact24	28.395	28.455	D	PhD	z	-1	0	right know it doesn't it doesn't 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact23	27.94	30.35	E	Grad	z	-1	0	right it it doesn't count i know it doesn't it doesn't clear this necessarily so 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact25	28.455	29.265	D	PhD	z	-1	0	right it it doesn't count know it doesn't it doesn't clear this necessarily 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact26	29.585	30.265	D	PhD	z	-1	0	it it doesn't count clear this necessarily so 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact27	30.265	30.485	D	PhD	z	-1	0	so 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact28	30.45	30.63	E	Grad	z	-1	0	so 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact29	31.327	32.237	C	Professor	z	-1	0	huh okay it's it there called temp files 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact30	31.748	33.238	E	Grad	z	-1	0	huh okay it's it there called temp files but they're not actually in the 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact31	33.238	35.448	E	Grad	z	-1	0	but they're not actually in the temp directory there and scratch so 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact32	35.758	35.968	E	Grad	z	-1	0	scratch so 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact33	36.596	39.976	E	Grad	z	-1	0	they're not backed up they're not erased either on terror

Bmr018.B.dialogueact151	220.41	222.49	B	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	uh yeah oh i i think i mentioned last meeting he said that 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact152	222.49	224.972	B	PhD	s	-1	0	meeting he said that um you talk to them and 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact153	224.972	226.232	B	PhD	s	-1	0	you talk to them and it was fine with the beach they would be 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact154	226.232	228.812	B	PhD	s	-1	0	they would be that's easy for them to 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact155	227.91	228.13	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	that's easy for them to 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact156	229.14	229.34	E	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact157	230.29	232.31	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	so uh of two kilos in here um but 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact158	232.31	233.26	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	um but uh 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact159	234.68	236.83	E	Grad	s.x	+1	1	i i have the program to insert the beats what i 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact160	236.83	243.36	E	Grad	s	+1	0	to insert the beats what i don't have is something to percy out but uh of the channel lies transcripts to find out where to put the beats but that should be really 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact161	243.36	244.64	E	Grad	s	+1	0	beats but that should be really easy to do 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact162	245.58	247.48	E	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	so do we have a meeting but that's been done with 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact164	248.86	249.39	A	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	he sees that we've kind of up to the point where 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact163	248.69	252.54	E	Grad	s^e^rt	-1	0	he sees he generated that we've kind of up to the point where we can actually give it i b. m. and try it out 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact165	252.77	257.55	A	Postdoc	s^na	+1	2	he generated um uh channel wise peace but segmented version uh meeting but it try it out 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact166	257.82	263.7	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	meeting but it was robust lesser of the need to use so i guess it depends on whether we are willing to use buses well for this experiment i think 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact168	262.77	265.86	B	PhD	s	-1	0	to use buses well for this experiment i think we can use or pretty much anything 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact167	262.61	263.02	E	Grad	b	-1	0	to use buses well for this experiment i think 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact169	266.118	266.428	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	okay this experiment well we 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact170	266.6	267.71	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	okay this experiment and just well we had we had talked about maybe 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact171	266.869	270.982	E	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	okay this experiment and just well we had we had talked about maybe doing do you is a good choice though well 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact172	271.042	272.195	E	Grad	s	-1	0	well we talked about that as being the whatever we have 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact173	271.57	274.48	B	PhD	s	-1	0	well we talked about that as being the next one's we wanted to transcribe whatever we have right 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact174	274.765	275.085	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	but for the purpose of sending right 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact176	275.4	275.64	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	but for the purpose of sending 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact175	275.126	278.356	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	great oh but for the purpose of sending him a sample one to uh yeah maybe it doesn't matter 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact177	277.466	278.456	E	Grad	s^am	-1	0	great oh to uh yeah maybe it doesn't matter 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact178	278.34	278.67	A	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	great oh uh matter 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact179	278.416	279.266	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	great oh oh oh well uh matter 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact180	278.94	281.92	A	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	great oh oh oh well get make that available uh matter okay 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact181	281.999	283.589	E	Grad	s^bk|qy^rt	-1	0	that available okay and has it been corrected 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact182	284.35	285.19	A	Postdoc	h|s^co	-1	0	oh well we um and check because that 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact183	285.19	285.56	A	Postdoc	h	-1	0	um and check because that 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact184	285.233	285.683	E	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	um and check because that 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact185	285.683	289.27	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	um that's right right so we need to run and check because that was one of the versus these were talking about as well 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact186	288.51	291.07	B	PhD	fh|s^co	+1	0	that's right right so we need to run kilos thing on it and then we go in and just were talking about as well 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact187	289.72	290.38	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	that's right run kilos thing on it well 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact188	291.07	292.83	B	PhD	s	+1	2	yeah that's right and then we go in and just the boundaries 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact189	292.385	293.075	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yeah that's right and we haven't done that the boundaries 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact190	293.255	294.105	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and we haven't done that i i could and time how 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact192	294.315	296.425	A	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	i i could set someone on that tomorrow okay and time how long it takes 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact193	294.318	294.588	B	PhD	b	-1	0	i i could and time how 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact191	294.29	295.78	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	i i could set someone on that tomorrow and time how long it takes 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact194	296.827	297.037	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay we probably don't have 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact196	297.372	297.782	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	we probably don't have 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact195	297.037	302.407	B	PhD	s	-1	0	what would be we probably don't have to do necessarily a whole meeting for that if we just want to send them a sample to try 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact197	300.615	300.885	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	for that if we just want 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact198	302.67	304.5	A	Postdoc	qw	-1	0	what would be a good number of minutes try 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact199	306.37	306.58	B	PhD	s^no	-1	0	you know maybe we could figure 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact200	306.58	310.2	B	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	you know maybe we could figure out how long it'll take uh to to do i know it seems 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact201	308.97	309.49	E	Grad	fg	-1	0	uh to to do 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact202	310.59	310.82	E	Grad	s^no	-1	0	i know it seems 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact203	310.82	313.878	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	i know it seems to we probably should go ahead and do a whole meeting because 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact204	313.878	316.678	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	and do a whole meeting because we'll have to transcribe the whole meeting anyway sometime 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact205	320.13	320.63	C	Professor	s^arp	-1	0	yes except 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact206	320.63	330.079	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yes except that if they had if there's a choice between having fifteen minutes of toys away one and having a whole meaning that didn't get at what you wanted for them just 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact207	331.06	332.09	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	kind of how much yeah i mean i guess we have to do it again anyway 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact208	331.088	333.198	E	Grad	s	-1	0	kind of how much yeah i mean i guess we have to do it again anyway but uh 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact209	333.368	333.868	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	but uh 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact210	334.75	335.0	C	Professor	s^am	-1	0	i guess the 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact211	335.61	338.28	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i guess the only thing i'm not sure about is um how quickly 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact212	338.93	342.58	B	PhD	qw	+1	1	how quickly can the transcribers scan over and fix the boundaries 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact213	341.951	342.291	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	fix the boundaries 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact214	343.2	343.61	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	and 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact215	345.24	346.71	B	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	i mean is it pretty easy i think it's going to be one 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact216	346.23	348.08	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	pretty easy i think it's going to be one or two times realtime at well 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact217	348.518	350.808	E	Grad	s^fe|s^bsc	+1	0	well excuse me two or more times realtime right because 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact218	350.808	350.938	E	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	times realtime right because 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact219	350.938	352.378	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	times realtime right because they have to at least listen to it 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact220	353.35	361.35	C	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	can reply finance so that say there's uh the transcriber gets on with a quarter of the meeting and then you run into this other other stuff well 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact222	362.016	362.546	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	the other stuff is i. b. 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact221	361.971	363.271	E	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	well the other stuff is i. b. m. 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact223	364.311	373.632	E	Grad	s	-1	0	okay so oh that's i'm just thinking that from a gate uh keeping track of the data point of view and maybe pass to send them a little meetings at the time and not try to send them bits and pieces 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact224	365.82	366.56	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	okay so from a gate 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact225	373.76	374.2	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	oh that's right so the first thing is the pieces 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact226	374.2	375.81	C	Professor	s^bu	+1	1	right so the first thing is the automatic thing right 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact228	376.225	379.305	C	Professor	s^e	+1	2	and then it's then it's the the transcribers taking stuff up and then it's 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact227	375.76	376.05	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	automatic thing and then it's then it's right 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact230	379.439	379.759	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	up and then it's 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact229	379.305	380.525	C	Professor	s^e	+1	1	uhhuh up and then it's i. b. m. right 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact231	380.721	381.161	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	uhhuh i. b. m. okay so you right 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact232	380.822	381.072	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	uhhuh i. b. m. okay so you right 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact233	381.435	384.325	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	okay so you might as well have run out of maxing over the entire meeting and 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact234	385.09	390.96	C	Professor	s	-1	0	then and then uh you give i. b. m. whatever was 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact235	391.576	393.486	A	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	and have them fix it or the entire meeting too right 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact236	391.699	391.959	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	and have them right 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact237	394.59	396.18	C	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	well yeah but starts in beginning or the end right so if they were 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact238	396.18	396.4	C	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right so if they were 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact239	396.4	399.49	C	Professor	s	-1	0	right so if they were only halfway through and that's what you give i b. m. 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact240	399.798	400.048	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	as i b. m. 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact241	400.414	400.644	C	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	as 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact242	401.08	402.0	B	PhD	qw^bu^rt	-1	0	of what point 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact243	405.029	405.429	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	i mean the 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact244	405.93	411.87	B	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	i mean the i guess the question my mind is do we wait for the transcribers to adjust the marks for the whole meeting before we give anything to i b. m. or 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact245	411.87	413.45	B	PhD	qrr	-1	0	anything to i b. m. or do we go ahead and send them a sample well at 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact247	414.088	414.658	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	lester least what 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact246	413.8	414.59	C	Professor	qw.%-	-1	0	lester well at least what 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact248	414.71	419.42	C	Professor	qw.%--	-1	0	lester least what if they were my sequentially it why wouldn't we give them i mean it 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact249	419.53	422.31	C	Professor	qy	-1	0	well i them i mean it i we're trying to get something done by the time brian comes 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact250	422.57	423.89	B	PhD	s^no	-1	0	well i i mean i don't know that was the question 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact251	423.514	424.774	E	Grad	s	-1	0	i mean i don't know that was the question though 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact252	425.12	432.26	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that i agree i agree so if we if we were then it seems like giving them something whatever they had gotten up to you know nothing well i don't think i mean 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact253	427.32	427.48	B	PhD	b	-1	0	then it seems 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact254	429.479	430.549	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	that i agree i agree whatever they had gotten up to 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact255	430.919	431.299	B	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	agree i agree up to you know nothing well i don't 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact256	431.594	432.344	E	Grad	fg|s^no.%-	-1	0	you know nothing well i don't think i mean 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact257	432.57	435.6	E	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	mm think i mean they they typically work for what four or something like that 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact258	436.0	436.87	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	i guess huh 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact259	437.163	439.843	E	Grad	s	-1	0	i think that they should be able to get through a whole meeting in one sitting 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact260	441.061	441.611	E	Grad	s	-1	0	i would think unless it's 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact261	441.611	443.291	E	Grad	s	-1	0	i would think unless it's a lot harder than we think it is which it could be 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact262	443.291	444.811	E	Grad	s	-1	0	is which it could be certainly 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact263	445.617	451.144	A	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	it's got like four speakers then i guess i mean it we're just doing the individual or seven or 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact265	450.96	452.66	B	PhD	s^bu	+1	0	guess i mean it we're just doing the individual channels right or seven or eight 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact264	450.57	452.35	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	guess i mean it we're just doing the individual channels right or seven or eight 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact266	452.66	452.91	B	PhD	qy^bu^d^g^rt	+1	0	channels right eight 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact267	453.599	454.869	A	Postdoc	s^m^rt	-1	0	digital channels yeah 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact268	454.869	455.349	A	Postdoc	s^aa^rt	+1	0	channels yeah so 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact269	455.82	458.68	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so it's going to be depending on the number of people in the meeting 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact270	459.47	459.84	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr018.A.dialogueact271	460.09	467.39	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	i guess there is this issue of you know if if the segment or thought there was no speech on on a particular stretch on a particular channel and they're really was well 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact272	460.64	460.85	E	Grad	fg	-1	0	i guess there is this issue well 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact273	467.39	474.873	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	channel and they're really was it than if it didn't show up in a mixed signals to verify and it might be overlooked 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact274	475.36	481.205	A	Postdoc	fh|qr	+1	1	so mean question is should should ever listen to the entire thing or can it it can't be based on the mic signal and i'd as 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact275	481.325	484.755	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and i'd as far as i'm concerned spun base in mexico this point and that's 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact276	484.825	485.205	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	this point and that's what it seems to me too and that 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact277	484.88	490.39	E	Grad	s	-1	0	this point and and that cuts down the time that's what it seems to me too and that if they need to just like any other cases they can listen to the individual if they need to 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact278	486.33	487.4	A	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	and that cuts down the time if they need to just like any other cases 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact279	490.54	490.85	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	to 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact280	491.168	492.568	E	Grad	s	-1	0	but they don't have to for most of it 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact281	493.13	493.59	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	that's good so you i 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact282	493.76	494.18	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	that's good so you to it i don't see how that war 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact284	494.31	494.85	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	to it don't see how that war

Bmr018.A.dialogueact285	496.13	496.98	A	Postdoc	qw^rt	-1	0	what what like you're talking about 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact286	496.53	498.67	C	Professor	s^bu	+1	1	what what like you're talking about tightening up time boundaries

Bmr018.C.dialogueact289	499.18	499.65	C	Professor	qw.%-	-1	0	so they have the normal 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact288	499.11	504.81	E	Grad	s	+1	0	so they have the normal channel trans interface where they have each individual speaker has their own line 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact290	505.185	505.445	B	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah but you're listening 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact291	505.512	508.122	E	Grad	s	+1	0	yeah but you're listening to the mix signaling your tightening the boundaries correcting 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact292	508.752	509.522	E	Grad	s^bsc	+1	0	correcting the boundaries you shouldn't have to tighten 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact293	509.522	512.522	E	Grad	s	+1	0	should be pretty good yeah except for the boundaries you shouldn't have to tighten too much because dealers program does that 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact294	511.323	512.173	A	Postdoc	s.x	-1	0	should be pretty good yeah except for dealers program does that 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact295	512.553	512.843	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	yeah except for that 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact296	512.56	515.72	D	PhD	s^arp	+1	1	yeah except for doesn't do on short things rhyme or it that right so so 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact297	515.25	516.68	E	Grad	fg|s.%-	-1	0	rhyme or it will miss them it right so so you'll have to lie 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact298	516.05	516.98	D	PhD	s	-1	0	will miss them it you'll have to lie 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact299	516.98	519.08	D	PhD	s^r	-1	0	will miss them it wellness most of the really short thing you'll have to lie

Bmr018.D.dialogueact301	520.18	520.74	D	PhD	s	+1	0	but like that 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact302	521.04	522.45	A	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	those would be this would be uhhuh will it uh 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact303	521.362	521.622	D	PhD	s^m	-1	0	those would be this uhhuh 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact305	522.47	523.39	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	would be will it yeah you have to uh 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact304	522.01	523.4	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	would be will it yeah you have to uh 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact306	523.48	526.62	D	PhD	s^co.%--	-1	0	yeah you have to say aha more slowly to to get no sorry oh 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact307	525.269	525.679	E	Grad	s^fa	-1	0	to sorry 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact309	526.93	528.28	D	PhD	s	-1	0	to get no i'm i'm actually serious so it will miss stuff oh worked on that 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact308	526.92	527.56	E	Grad	s^cc^j	-1	0	to get no i'm i'm actually serious oh worked on that 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact310	528.28	529.91	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	so it will miss stuff like that which well 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact312	529.948	530.108	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	like that which well so so that's something that the transcribers 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact311	529.87	532.97	E	Grad	fg|s	+1	2	yeah but like that which well so so that's something that the transcribers will have to have to do 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact313	532.32	539.4	A	Postdoc	fg|s	+1	1	yeah but presumably most of those they should be able to hear from the mixing all unless they're better than the havel heavy overlap section in which case that's that's right have to do 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact314	539.4	541.42	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	in which case it was news channels anyway that's that's what i'm i'm concerned about that part right that's what i'm not sure about

Bmr018.A.dialogueact319	542.653	543.243	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yeah i am too and i think it's 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact320	543.453	545.023	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and i think it's an empirical question can't we it couldn't 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact321	544.715	547.195	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	an empirical question can't we it couldn't we just have um 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact322	548.4	550.15	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and maybe that's just doesn't fit with the software but i guess 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact323	550.15	562.4	B	PhD	s.%-	+1	0	oh they can but i guess i didn't know anything about transcriber i was going to make something to let them adjust boundaries i would just show them one channel at a time with the marks and let them into well but then they have to do but then they for this meeting they would have 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact324	559.73	560.22	A	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	oh they can with the marks well but then they have to do 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact325	559.948	561.228	E	Grad	s^nd.%--	-1	0	oh they can with the marks and let well but then they have to do but then they 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact326	561.728	566.23	E	Grad	s^nd.x	+1	0	yeah that's it and let them into but then they for this meeting they would have to do seven times real time and it would probably be more than that 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact327	564.79	565.33	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yeah that's it time and it would probably be more than 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact328	566.66	566.87	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	that 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact329	567.58	567.68	E	Grad	qy^d^g	-1	0	right because they have 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact330	567.68	572.086	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	and if but you but it's very right because they have to at least listen to it each channel all the way through 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact332	572.31	572.59	A	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	and if but it's very 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact331	571.91	573.7	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and if but you but it's very quick right all the way through 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact333	572.72	573.01	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	and if but it's very quick right 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact334	573.81	574.03	B	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	quick right i mean you scan i mean 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact335	574.03	576.78	B	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean you scan i mean if you have a display of the way form 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact337	577.32	577.5	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	are you talking about visually 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact336	577.16	578.2	E	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	well are you talking about visually i just don't think 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact339	578.23	580.65	A	Postdoc	fg|s^arp	-1	0	well yeah the problem is the abreast because you also i just don't think 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact338	578.2	579.15	E	Grad	s^nd.%-	-1	0	well yeah the problem is i just don't think 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact340	580.65	582.35	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	the abreast because you also see the press on the way through i've i've looked at the 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact341	582.35	585.7	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	way through i've i've looked at the it uh if i tried to do that with a single channel and 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact342	585.919	589.769	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	single channel and and you do see all sorts of other stuff besides just the voice 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact343	586.16	586.46	B	PhD	b	-1	0	and you do see all 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact344	590.287	594.057	E	Grad	s	-1	0	well yeah i i think that they're going much more in acoustics in there and visuals 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact345	595.06	596.15	A	Postdoc	s^am	-1	0	that's that i'm not sure what you did digital 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact346	595.48	595.74	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	that's that i'm not sure 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact347	596.15	599.15	A	Postdoc	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	what you did digital what the digital test you had your interface um i 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact348	599.612	606.562	A	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	um i know for a fact that one of those she she could really well she could judge what the what the number was based on the on the way form yeah that's actually true yeah you're right you're absolutely right mean i found 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact349	603.502	604.482	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	could judge what the what the number was yeah that's actually true yeah 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact350	604.842	605.552	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	what the number was based on the on the way true yeah you're right you're absolutely 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact351	605.672	606.512	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	based on the on the way form you're right you're absolutely right mean i found 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact352	606.622	612.33	E	Grad	s	-1	0	form yeah she could tell which right mean i found the same thing that when i was scanning the way form i could see when someone surgery digits just by the shapes 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact353	612.35	613.92	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yeah she could tell which one was seven uh maybe 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact354	613.381	614.021	E	Grad	s^am	-1	0	one was seven so uh maybe 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact355	614.49	614.66	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	so 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact356	614.9	615.43	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	so i don't i'm but 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact358	615.77	618.16	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i don't i'm i'm not entirely confused about what they do so but 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact357	615.531	615.721	E	Grad	fg	-1	0	i don't i'm but 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact359	618.16	622.05	C	Professor	fh|qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	so they're they're looking act a mixed signals or the looking 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact360	622.05	622.99	C	Professor	qrr^rt.%--	-1	0	or the looking 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact361	623.13	624.54	C	Professor	qw	-1	0	well what are what are they looking at visually 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact362	624.86	625.96	A	Postdoc	fg|s	-1	0	well it they have a choice they visually 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact363	625.96	627.43	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	it they have a choice they could choose any signal to look at i've tried 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact364	627.689	629.859	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	look at i've tried looking but usually the look at the next 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact365	630.154	635.895	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	but i've i've tried looking at the single single and and in order to judge when it when it was station when it wasn't but 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact366	634.425	634.565	E	Grad	b	-1	0	when it when it was station 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact367	635.895	639.495	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	when it wasn't but the problem is then you have breasts which would show up on the signal but 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact368	639.884	646.814	C	Professor	s^bu	+1	0	signal yes yes but the procedure that you're imagining i mean people vary from this is that they have to make signals away form in front of them 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact369	641.755	642.225	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	yes you're imagining i mean people vary from this 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact370	643.974	644.264	F	PhD	%	-1	0	is that they have to make signals 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact371	646.758	647.178	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	yes in front of them and 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact372	647.8	651.0	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and they have multiple uh well 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact373	651.24	654.4	C	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	uh well see there's and we don't have transcription yet 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact374	655.49	658.78	C	Professor	fh|s^bu	+1	0	yes so but there's markers of some sort that it didn't happen automatically know show right 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact376	657.48	657.93	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yes some sort that it didn't right 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact375	657.06	657.38	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yes some sort that it didn't right 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact377	658.78	660.68	C	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	+1	0	happen automatically know show up on the next signal there's 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact380	661.26	661.55	A	Postdoc	s^fe	-1	0	oh they show up uh oakland not that 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact378	660.79	662.38	C	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	oh they show up on the separate ribbons signal there's uh oakland not that 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact379	661.037	661.807	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	oh they show up uh oakland not that 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact381	661.65	663.09	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	oh they show up on the separate ribbons so you have a separate uh oakland separate ribbons not that right 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact383	663.24	665.13	A	Postdoc	s^rt	-1	0	so you have a separate one for each channel and and separate ribbons right 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact384	663.372	664.332	C	Professor	s^bk^m	-1	0	so you have a separate one for each channel separate ribbons right 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact382	663.2	663.45	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	so you have a separate separate ribbons right 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact385	665.619	671.949	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and and it it'll be because it's being segmented at challenge time with his with you is new procedure then 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact386	671.949	677.173	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	new procedure then you don't have a correspondence of the times across the bins that crosses ribbons it you could have and this airline 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact387	677.173	677.803	A	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	it you could have and this airline 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact388	677.49	680.62	C	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	it you could have yes and this airline moving across the way for him just goes yes 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact389	679.89	680.2	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yes the way for him just goes yes 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact390	680.41	680.71	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yes goes 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact391	681.08	683.714	C	Professor	s^bk|s^bu	+1	0	okay so the way imagine if they can't play it and they see 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact392	683.714	688.294	C	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	can't play it and they see how this happened then this happened then and if it's about right they just sort of let it slide and if right 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact394	685.97	686.12	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	this happened then and if it's about right they just 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact393	685.899	686.179	E	Grad	b	-1	0	this happened then and if it's about right they just 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact395	688.28	688.59	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	and if right 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact396	688.796	693.536	C	Professor	s^bu	+1	0	oh and if it if it there's a question on something they stop and maybe look at individual way for right right 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact398	694.0	695.57	A	Postdoc	s^bk|s^nd	-1	0	well not not look well they wouldn't look at it 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact397	693.793	694.043	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	oh well not not way for right well they wouldn't 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact399	694.591	696.901	E	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	well not not look well they wouldn't look at it at this point they 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact400	696.951	697.911	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	at this point they would just listen 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact401	698.305	699.945	C	Professor	s	-1	0	they might look at it right well the 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact403	700.175	700.355	C	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	problem is that the 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact402	699.819	704.629	E	Grad	s	-1	0	not might look at it right well the problem is that the e. interface doesn't really allow users which visuals 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact404	704.85	705.67	A	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	not very quickly you can't the problem is that that 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact405	705.034	711.121	E	Grad	s	+1	1	very quickly you can't but it takes time that's it the problem is that that that tickle t. k. interface with the visuals it's very slow to load way for us 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact406	705.67	706.81	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	very quickly you can't but it takes time the problem is that that that tickle t. k. interface

Bmr018.C.dialogueact408	711.36	712.16	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	it and so when i tried 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact409	712.34	715.45	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	oh okay visually you can you and so when i tried that that was the first thing i tried when i first started it right 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact410	713.65	713.92	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay that that was the first thing 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact411	714.56	715.09	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	visually you can you i tried when i first started it right 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact413	715.62	717.62	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	you can you can switch quickly between the audio but you just can't it right 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact412	715.45	715.75	E	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	you can you it right 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact414	717.62	720.38	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	the audio but you just can't get the visual display to show quickly you have to 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact415	720.706	721.236	A	Postdoc	s^co.%--	-1	0	you have to it takes i

Bmr018.E.dialogueact423	733.089	737.524	E	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah well it it does something or shape re computations so that it can then scroll it quickly yeah but then you can cancel that 
Bmr018.G.dialogueact424	735.64	736.76	G	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	so that it can then scroll it you can cancel that 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact426	737.71	738.15	D	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah quickly yeah but then you can't change the resolution 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact425	737.524	737.774	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah quickly yeah but then 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact427	737.834	740.254	E	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	yeah quickly yeah but then you can't change the resolution nurse cruel quickly oh really 
Bmr018.G.dialogueact428	739.91	740.47	G	Grad	qy^bh^d	-1	0	nurse cruel quickly oh really 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact431	741.6	748.4	A	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	i you could set up multiple windows each one with a different signal showing and then looked between the windows maybe that's mean 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact429	741.189	741.479	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	i you could 
Bmr018.G.dialogueact430	741.287	741.547	G	Grad	b	-1	0	i you could 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact432	748.4	749.66	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	maybe that's the solution mean we we could do different what's you pre 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact433	748.971	750.901	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	maybe that's the solution mean we we could do different interfaces right what's you pre but the phone 
Bmr018.G.dialogueact434	749.451	750.671	G	Grad	qw^cs	-1	0	the solution we we could do different interfaces right what's you pre but the phone 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact435	750.901	751.211	E	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	interfaces right mean so so we could but the phone 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact436	751.211	754.481	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	mean so so we could use like x. waves instead of transcriber 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact437	755.35	755.63	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	and it loads faster 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact438	755.39	757.1	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and it loads faster certainly what if you were to pre load 
Bmr018.G.dialogueact439	757.15	759.47	G	Grad	qr^cs	-1	0	what if you were to pre load all the channels or initially like 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact441	760.37	761.6	E	Grad	s	-1	0	well that's what i try to originally so i i doesn't 
Bmr018.G.dialogueact440	759.96	760.53	G	Grad	%-	-1	0	well that's what i try like doesn't 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact442	761.6	768.6	E	Grad	s	-1	0	to originally so i i actually before that they've goal directed this i didn't interface which showed each away form and you a ribbon for each way more 
Bmr018.G.dialogueact443	767.81	768.44	G	Grad	b	-1	0	you a ribbon for each way more 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact444	769.099	774.079	E	Grad	s	-1	0	the problem with it is even with just three wave forms it was just painfully slow to scroll so you just okay 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact446	774.742	778.002	E	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	so you just roll screen and would you know go her chunk and so okay 
Bmr018.G.dialogueact445	774.27	774.59	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	so you just okay 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact447	778.853	779.253	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	and so it just was not 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact448	778.897	781.887	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and so it just was not dual with the current interface 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact449	782.216	784.806	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know i'm thinking if we have a meeting with only four speakers and 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact450	784.856	792.34	A	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	four speakers and you know you could fire up the transcriber interface free you know in in different windows multiple ones one for each channel and a sort of a a 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact451	792.34	796.18	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	and a sort of a a hack but i mean it would be one way of seeing the visual form i think that if we decide 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact452	795.969	802.812	E	Grad	s^cs	+1	1	the visual form i think that if we decide that we need that they need to see the visuals we need to change the interface so that they can do that 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact453	802.424	802.614	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	they can do that

Bmr018.D.dialogueact468	821.39	823.93	D	PhD	s^ar|s.%-	-1	0	i mean the individual channels that were chopped up that it'd

Bmr018.A.dialogueact515	913.09	915.61	A	Postdoc	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	you can get thee uh you can get a switch audio yeah

Bmr018.A.dialogueact518	917.327	919.157	A	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	but um it maybe change it again we should get them to do that because uh i 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact519	918.153	919.183	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	maybe change it again we should get them to do that because uh i 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact520	919.183	922.443	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	i disagree the reason i because uh i think i would be much much faster than going to the menu 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact521	921.148	921.778	A	Postdoc	s^ar	-1	0	i disagree faster than going to 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact522	922.59	928.13	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	the reason i disagree and that is that i you it's very good to have a just so station between the visual in the audience they're times when the menu 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact523	928.13	930.668	A	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	they're times when i want to hear the mixed signal bought but 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact524	930.668	933.298	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	mixed signal bought but i want to transcribe on the single channel so right then maybe 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact525	933.678	934.538	A	Postdoc	fh|s.%-	-1	0	so right now then maybe just buttons down 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact526	933.747	937.28	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	so right now maybe i just don't i don't see then maybe just buttons down at the bottom next to it just something so that it's 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact527	936.45	938.6	A	Postdoc	s^am|s^no.%-	-1	0	maybe i just don't i don't see that it's uh next to it just something so that it's not in the menu option 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact528	937.28	940.66	E	Grad	s	-1	0	don't i don't see that it's uh to it just something so that it's not in the menu option so that you can do it much faster 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact529	941.374	945.504	A	Postdoc	h|s	-1	0	well i mean that's the way i i think that might be a personal style thing i find it really 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact530	945.504	948.294	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	thing i find it really convenient the weight the weight set up right now well 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact531	948.76	954.888	E	Grad	fg|s:qy	-1	0	well it just seems to me that if you want to quickly well was that chain no was that chuck no was that morgan right now you have to go up to the menu 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact532	955.174	958.704	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and each time go up to the menu select it listen to that channel then click below and then 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact533	958.874	961.294	E	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah true click below and then go back to the menu select the next one then click below so you could 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact534	959.631	959.921	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	go back to the menu select 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact535	961.58	962.08	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yeah true so you could definitely streamline 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact536	961.762	964.372	E	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah true yeah to be faster but you know i mean the so you could definitely streamline that with you with you know this 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact537	963.4	964.28	A	Postdoc	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah to be faster but you know i mean the that with you with you know this

Bmr018.E.dialogueact552	988.845	991.185	E	Grad	s	-1	0	next friday so we have to do the experiments and write the paper 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact553	992.725	993.635	E	Grad	fh|s^cc	-1	0	so i'm going to try but uh

Bmr018.E.dialogueact555	996.314	996.934	E	Grad	s	-1	0	just have to see so 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact556	996.934	1004.59	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	just have to see so actually i when i get together with both address and uh stefan with their respective assistants

Bmr018.C.dialogueact560	1007.99	1015.56	C	Professor	s	+1	0	yeah it was a it's we other one conversation about uh what what what did it mean for one of those speakers to be pathological was it right 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact562	1015.75	1016.2	C	Professor	qy.%-	-1	0	was it uh right and i haven't had set 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact561	1015.7	1016.0	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	was it uh right and i haven't had set 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact563	1016.09	1018.07	E	Grad	s	-1	0	uh and i haven't had set a chance to sit down listen i was going to do that this afternoon oh i haven't i haven't listened to him 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact564	1017.48	1019.39	F	PhD	s	-1	0	a chance to sit down listen i was going to do that this afternoon oh i haven't i haven't listened to him either but there 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact565	1018.07	1019.32	E	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	i was going to do that this afternoon i haven't listened to him either but there 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact566	1019.81	1021.01	F	PhD	s	-1	0	well mirror either but there must be something wrong i mean oh sorry 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact567	1021.01	1021.42	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	well mirror i mean oh sorry 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact569	1021.71	1023.85	E	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	well mirror and i we're we're having indicated out that i mean oh sorry 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact568	1021.68	1022.26	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	well mirror and i we're we're having indicated i mean oh sorry 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact570	1024.17	1026.37	E	Grad	s	+1	0	course i think it it's probably something pathological actually still phones 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact571	1026.37	1029.01	E	Grad	s	+1	0	actually still phones results i think confirmed that he said he did 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact572	1029.01	1031.87	E	Grad	s	+1	0	he said he did the were system 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact573	1032.2	1037.29	E	Grad	s^rt	+1	0	also got very lousy average error like fifteen or or uh fifteen to twenty percent average but 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact574	1037.82	1042.59	E	Grad	s^rt	+1	0	but then he right just on the lapel and got about five or six percent were there 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact575	1043.31	1047.72	E	Grad	s	+1	0	so that that means to me that somewhere in the other work or things there are some pathological cases but 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact576	1047.72	1050.21	E	Grad	fh|s^am	-1	0	cases but you know what that may not be true maybe just some of the 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact577	1050.21	1052.84	E	Grad	s^am	+1	0	maybe just some of the segments they're just doing a lousy job on 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact578	1053.85	1057.89	E	Grad	s^cc	+1	0	so i listen to it and find out since you'd actually split it up by segment 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact579	1054.4	1054.68	C	Professor	b	-1	0	i listen to it and find out 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact580	1058.47	1059.54	E	Grad	s	-1	0	did you run so i can actually listen to it

Bmr018.F.dialogueact686	1213.15	1226.03	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um so this scheme that i through on the board last time where we tried to um a lot reject models with uh speech from other speakers um 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact687	1226.68	1229.77	F	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	um most of the time it doesn't work very well so 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact688	1229.97	1242.8	F	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	work very well so and that i haven't done i mean the only way to texas right now is for me to actually low decent ex waves and you know plus the alignments and play them see where the 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact689	1232.0	1232.37	C	Professor	b	-1	0	and that 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact690	1243.43	1249.16	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and it looks and so i look at all of the other others this from you chalk on that one conversation i don't know which 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact691	1249.59	1255.84	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i don't know which you probably know which one i mean it's with you were on the love pal and morgan was sitting next to you and 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact692	1255.84	1257.51	F	PhD	s	-1	0	next to you and we can hear everything like that 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact693	1258.41	1259.01	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	but and 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact694	1259.13	1263.85	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	but and and some of what you i mean you also appear quite a bit in the cross talk 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact695	1264.54	1267.9	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	so went to one of those there 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact696	1268.0	1275.31	F	PhD	s	-1	0	were i think fifty five segments um and annex waves and and synthetic crude check and 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact697	1275.31	1278.86	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	and more often than not it it gets it wrong 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact698	1279.02	1286.81	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so there's either the beginning mostly the beginning word where do you um you know talk talk somewhere into the segment 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact699	1287.73	1292.58	F	PhD	s:s	-1	0	but the first um word forty says often high but it's 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact700	1292.81	1294.1	F	PhD	s:s	-1	0	high but it's very reduced i that's just 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact701	1294.47	1299.79	F	PhD	s	-1	0	that's just aligned to the beginning off someone else's each uh nothing it's 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact702	1299.79	1300.71	F	PhD	s:s	-1	0	nothing it's cost so 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact703	1300.71	1304.88	F	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	cost so i'm still tinkering with it but 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact704	1304.88	1311.19	F	PhD	s	+1	1	unless tinkering with it but it my grubby that we can't get penalized and so this this uh so 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact705	1311.19	1311.6	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	unless 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact706	1311.86	1316.17	C	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	+1	1	unless maybe we do this uh um cancellation is right but that's i mean that was our plan but yeah right 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact707	1315.07	1316.91	D	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	is but that's i mean that was our plan but yeah right 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact708	1315.58	1316.44	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	is but that's i mean that was our plan but yeah right 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact709	1316.91	1321.05	D	PhD	s	+1	1	oh the short mean that was our plan but it's clear from dan that this is not something you can do in a short amount of time so right 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact710	1321.68	1323.41	C	Professor	s|s^bk	-1	0	oh the short amount of time saying right so so we you know we had spent a long 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact711	1321.71	1322.09	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	oh the short amount of time saying so so we 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact712	1322.53	1326.66	D	PhD	s	-1	0	amount of time saying right so we you know we had spent a long time um writing up the h. o. p. paper and we wanted 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact713	1326.66	1329.37	D	PhD	s	-1	0	o. p. paper and we wanted to use that uh kind of analysis that utility 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact714	1328.29	1328.63	C	Professor	b	-1	0	uh kind of analysis 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact715	1329.37	1334.15	D	PhD	s	-1	0	that utility paper has you know it's very crude measure of overlap it's not really something 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact716	1334.15	1337.58	D	PhD	s	-1	0	it's not really something you could scientifically say is overlap it's just whether 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact717	1337.58	1345.02	D	PhD	s	-1	0	overlap it's just whether or not uh the segments that were all synchronized whether there was some overlap somewhere and hike relation 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact718	1340.05	1341.39	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	the segments that hike relation 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact719	1345.94	1348.01	D	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	and you know it pointed out some differences so i thought well if we 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact720	1348.01	1355.04	D	PhD	s	+1	1	so i thought well if we can do something quick and dirty because dan said the cross cancellation it's not straightforward if it were straightforward 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact721	1355.04	1356.85	D	PhD	s	-1	0	if it were straightforward know it try it but 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact722	1356.99	1357.24	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	know it try it but so sort of 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact723	1357.59	1369.59	D	PhD	s	+1	1	so sort of good to hear that was not straight forward thinking if we can get decent force alignments then at least we can just sort of overall report of what happens with actual overlap in time but 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact724	1369.59	1371.1	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	i didn't think that his time but well 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact725	1371.19	1373.74	B	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	i didn't think that his message that it wasn't straightforward well we just 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact726	1371.9	1372.44	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	i didn't think that his message that it wasn't well we just 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact727	1374.76	1375.23	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	i thought he just well 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact729	1375.67	1378.09	B	PhD	s^bu	+1	0	i thought he just saying it to look over a longer time window need that but there are some issues 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact728	1375.6	1375.81	E	Grad	b	-1	0	i thought he just 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact730	1377.86	1382.25	D	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	time window need right so that but there are some issues of this timing um in the recordings and 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact731	1381.12	1381.57	C	Professor	b	-1	0	in the recordings 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact733	1382.45	1382.67	B	PhD	fg	-1	0	right so and 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact732	1382.31	1382.79	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	right so and 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact734	1383.03	1385.81	B	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	you just have to look over longer time when you're trying to align the things you can't 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact735	1385.81	1387.54	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	to align the things you can't you can't just look well are 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact736	1387.61	1392.39	E	Grad	fg|qy^rt.x	-1	0	just look well are you talking about the fact that the recording software doesn't do time synchronized is that where you're 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact737	1392.39	1393.67	E	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	synchronized is that where you're referring to 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact738	1394.19	1394.45	C	Professor	b	-1	0	that seems to be you can 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact739	1394.29	1397.56	E	Grad	s	-1	0	that seems to be you can do that over the entire filing get a very accurate i don't i i don't think 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact740	1396.52	1398.76	F	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	i yeah get a very accurate i don't i i don't think that was the issue the issue 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact741	1398.54	1398.67	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	i yeah that was the issue the issue 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact742	1398.67	1400.75	D	PhD	fg|s^rt	-1	0	i yeah that was sort of a side issue i didn't think so either that was the issue the issue is that you have that you have have 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact744	1399.15	1400.0	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	that was sort of a side issue i didn't think so either is that you have that you have have 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact743	1398.76	1404.35	F	PhD	s	+1	0	i yeah that was sort of a side issue i didn't think so either that was the issue the issue is that you have that you have have you first have to have a pretty good speech detection and individual channels 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact745	1405.22	1411.89	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and it's dynamic so i guess it was more dynamic than some simple models would be able to to so 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact746	1412.0	1413.87	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so there are some things available and i 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact747	1413.87	1415.36	D	PhD	s^no	-1	0	available and i don't know too much about this area where 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact748	1415.36	1418.82	D	PhD	s	-1	0	area where if people aren't moving around much then you could apply them and it should 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact749	1418.82	1423.29	D	PhD	s	+1	0	could apply them and it should work pretty well if you took care of this recording time difference right which should be pretty 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact750	1423.21	1424.9	E	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	which it right which should be pretty straightforward 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact751	1424.45	1427.04	D	PhD	s	-1	0	which it at least is twelve defined and um straightforward 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact752	1427.04	1427.2	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact753	1427.12	1427.26	E	Grad	b	-1	0	and um 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact754	1427.99	1433.8	D	PhD	fh|s.%--	+1	1	and um but then if you add the dynamic aspect of adapting distances then it wasn't 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact755	1434.66	1440.94	D	PhD	s	-1	0	i guess it just wasn't something that he could do quickly not in time for us to be able to do something my two weeks now so 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact756	1440.94	1441.07	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	two weeks now so 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact757	1441.07	1442.58	D	PhD	s^bsc	-1	0	so 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact758	1443.09	1450.07	D	PhD	fh|s^no	+1	0	well under dress how um so i don't know what we can do if anything that's sort of worse you know you're a speech paper at this point 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact759	1450.49	1453.76	B	PhD	qy^rt	+1	0	well under dress how well did it work on on the towel stuff yeah 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact760	1453.86	1454.87	E	Grad	s	-1	0	stuff yeah so it's think i haven't checked our 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact761	1454.31	1455.29	F	PhD	s^no	+1	0	so it's think i haven't checked our senate safety just 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact762	1454.87	1455.02	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	so it's think i haven't checked our senate safety just 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact763	1455.29	1456.75	F	PhD	s^df	+1	1	senate safety just to check these 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact764	1457.15	1457.4	B	PhD	b	-1	0	um we 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact765	1457.46	1466.79	F	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	um we would really need ideally uh transcriber to time mark it uh you know the big at least the beginnings and of contiguous speech 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact766	1467.53	1475.26	F	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	because really the you know then with the time marks you can do an automatic comparison if you're if you're forced alignment 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact767	1474.46	1485.91	B	PhD	s	+1	0	because really the the at least in terms of how we were going to use this in our system wise to get an ideal an idea uh for each channel about the starting in boundaries we if you're forced alignment 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact768	1474.67	1475.6	E	Grad	s.%	-1	0	because really the if you're forced alignment 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact769	1474.7	1475.59	E	Grad	s	-1	0	because really the if you're forced alignment 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact770	1478.55	1479.06	F	PhD	b	-1	0	going to use this in our system wise 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact771	1485.91	1488.4	B	PhD	s	+1	0	in boundaries we don't really care about like an immediate word boundaries so no that's how i've 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact773	1488.4	1488.6	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	so no that's how i've 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact772	1488.37	1489.75	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	so no that's how i've been looking at it i mean i 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact776	1489.93	1490.21	B	PhD	b	-1	0	been looking at it i mean i don't care that individual 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact775	1489.84	1490.1	D	PhD	b	-1	0	been looking at it i mean i don't care that individual 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact774	1489.75	1492.18	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	been looking at it i mean i don't care that individual words incorrectly but you 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact777	1491.87	1492.2	B	PhD	b	-1	0	words incorrectly but you 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact778	1492.18	1497.24	F	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	right exactly but you don't want to uh in for from the alignment that someone spoke who did at the time 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact779	1497.47	1498.13	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right exactly so that's why i was wondering if at the time so so 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact781	1498.13	1499.17	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so that's why i was wondering if it i mean so so 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact780	1498.02	1498.63	F	PhD	fh.%	-1	0	so that's why i was wondering if so so 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact782	1499.9	1503.14	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	it i mean maybe if it doesn't work for the towel stuff we can just not use that i haven't i 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact783	1502.35	1502.53	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	just not use that i 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact785	1503.14	1503.32	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	haven't i 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact784	1503.07	1510.3	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	haven't i i just haven't had the time to um to the same procedure um one of the i would 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact786	1510.8	1522.03	F	PhD	s	+1	0	i would need a kid i would need a channel that has speaker who was whereas a lot of overlap but you know is uh not lapel mike and 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact787	1522.75	1528.63	F	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	and um or preferably also there's someone sitting next to them who talks a lot 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact788	1528.87	1529.17	E	Grad	b	-1	0	a lot so 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact789	1529.45	1531.43	F	PhD	fh|%-	-1	0	and so meeting with me in so i maybe someone 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact790	1531.17	1532.24	E	Grad	s^bs	-1	0	so meeting with me in it maybe someone can help you find 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact791	1531.56	1535.98	F	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	so meeting with me in it maybe someone can help you find a good candidate and then i would be willing to 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact792	1536.28	1536.79	B	PhD	qh	-1	0	week you know what maybe 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact793	1536.87	1539.33	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	week you know what maybe the best way to find that would be to look through these 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact794	1537.09	1537.61	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	the best way to find that 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact795	1540.39	1541.88	B	PhD	s^df^rt	-1	0	because you can see the seat numbers 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact796	1542.29	1544.19	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and then you can see what type of mike they were using and 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact797	1544.93	1549.46	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and so we just look for you know somebody sitting next to adam that one of the meetings actually you we can tell 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact798	1548.78	1551.7	D	PhD	s	+1	0	that one of the meetings actually you we can tell from the data that they have from the session maybe 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact799	1550.71	1552.01	F	PhD	qy^2^d^rt	-1	0	from the data that they have um yeah there's from the session maybe 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact801	1552.29	1553.99	D	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um yeah there's a way to tell it 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact800	1552.01	1553.89	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	um yeah there's a way to tell it 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact802	1553.99	1559.17	D	PhD	s	-1	0	a way to tell it might not be a single person who's always overlapping that person but any number of people and 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact803	1558.58	1558.83	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	number of people 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact804	1559.75	1568.41	D	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	and um if you align the two hypothesis files across the channels you know just were alignment you be able to find uh 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact805	1569.4	1571.83	D	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	so i guess that's sort of a last 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact806	1573.7	1575.36	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	they're they're sort of a few things they could do one is just 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact807	1575.36	1578.91	D	PhD	s	-1	0	could do one is just do like nama pals of putting it good enough alignments 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact808	1579.34	1580.65	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	another one was to try to get 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact809	1581.43	1585.63	D	PhD	s	-1	0	somehow align kilos energy second patience with what we have but 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact810	1585.91	1592.16	D	PhD	s	-1	0	we have but then you have the problem of not knowing where the words are because these meetings were done before that temptation but maybe there's something 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact811	1592.16	1594.61	D	PhD	s	-1	0	what what is why do you need but maybe there's something that could be done 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact812	1593.6	1599.82	B	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	what what is why do you need the um this worked on it for the h. l. t. i mean for the your speech paper that could be done 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact813	1600.51	1608.19	D	PhD	h|s	-1	0	i guess i i wanted to just do something not on recognition experiments because it's just way 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact814	1608.19	1613.15	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because it's just way too early but to be able to report you know actual numbers like if we if we had 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact815	1613.15	1619.56	D	PhD	s	-1	0	like if we if we had hand transcribed perk good alignments or hand checked alignments then we could do this paper it's not that 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact816	1619.56	1621.33	D	PhD	s	-1	0	do this paper it's not that needed to be automatic 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact817	1622.18	1626.1	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	it was to get it was to get more data and but without knowing where the real words are in time 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact818	1625.33	1629.44	B	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	it was to get it was to get more data and better fit to squeeze the boundaries that in time to to know what an overlap 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact819	1628.22	1636.2	D	PhD	s	-1	0	fit to squeeze the boundaries that uh okay yeah to to know what an overlap really it's it's really an overlap or if it's just uh and a segment correlate with an overlapping because it's a difference 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact820	1630.34	1631.05	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	uh okay yeah really it's it's really an overlap or 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact821	1631.49	1631.81	B	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah an overlap or 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact822	1636.2	1641.37	D	PhD	s	-1	0	because it's a difference to me between like a real paper and uh promise very paper 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact823	1642.01	1644.64	D	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	um if we did 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact824	1645.58	1647.81	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	it might be possible to take peels output 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact825	1648.35	1654.15	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and like if you have um the great no these meetings are all throughout the digital camera 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact826	1651.74	1651.8	E	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	the great no 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact827	1654.16	1655.66	E	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	um throughout the digital camera again every 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact828	1655.42	1656.23	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	um again every meeting 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact829	1655.87	1656.5	E	Grad	s^e^t1	-1	0	um again every meeting 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact830	1657.15	1658.31	D	PhD	s	-1	0	you know their time and lines with these are two different 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact831	1658.31	1664.73	D	PhD	s	-1	0	with these are two different channels and somebody's talking here and somebody else's talking here just that word 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact833	1665.28	1670.18	D	PhD	s	+1	0	if kilos can tell us that their boundaries here we should be able to figure that out because the only thing transcribed 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact832	1664.87	1665.38	E	Grad	b	-1	0	that word if kilos 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact834	1670.18	1673.16	D	PhD	s^df	+1	0	out because the only thing transcribed in this channel is this war 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact835	1674.21	1677.05	D	PhD	fh|s.%--	+1	0	but um you know if there are things two words 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact836	1677.3	1677.81	E	Grad	s^2	+1	0	two words 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact837	1678.08	1681.48	D	PhD	s^aa|s	+1	0	yeah if you have to and they're at d. i just like here in here in their speech 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact838	1681.74	1684.04	D	PhD	s	+1	0	in their speech here then it doesn't really help you so 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact839	1684.2	1685.33	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact840	1686.26	1688.31	B	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	those won't put down to separate mark right well it would it would kilos well but 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact841	1687.91	1696.08	D	PhD	s^arp|s^no	-1	0	to separate mark right well it would it would but um we don't know exactly where the words are because the transcriber gave us two words and this time in and we don't really know kilos well but 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact842	1688.03	1688.91	E	Grad	s^aa|%-	-1	0	it would it would well but 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact843	1696.08	1697.17	D	PhD	s^no.%-	-1	0	and we don't really know 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact845	1698.45	1698.82	D	PhD	s	-1	0	that's emerging i mean 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact844	1698.45	1699.42	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that's emerging prom if you had a if i mean yeah it's 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact847	1699.42	1701.82	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	prom if you had a if you has if you had a script which would i've thought yeah it's 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact846	1699.37	1700.12	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	prom if you had a if you has if you had a script yeah it's 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact848	1701.82	1702.7	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	which would i've thought about this 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact850	1703.2	1705.54	A	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	um and i discuss discuss it with you know i mean if you have any ideas 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact849	1703.07	1704.18	D	PhD	s	-1	0	um and i discuss discuss it i mean if you have any ideas 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact851	1705.15	1705.34	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	with you know 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact852	1706.24	1713.48	A	Postdoc	fh|s^cs	-1	0	um be i mean i i in principle i could imagine writing a script which would approximation to some degree but 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact853	1713.48	1715.66	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	degree but there's just promise that bitch yeah well maybe maybe 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact854	1714.07	1718.02	E	Grad	fg|s^am^rt	-1	0	there's just promise that bitch yeah right i mean that that would be well maybe maybe that will get enough of the cases to be useful 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact855	1715.71	1715.92	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	that bitch yeah maybe 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact856	1717.3	1717.74	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	right to be useful 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact857	1718.06	1719.74	D	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean that that would be really helpful that was 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact858	1719.74	1721.88	D	PhD	s	-1	0	really helpful that was sort of another possibility yes because it seemed like most of the cases 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact859	1720.22	1725.28	E	Grad	s	-1	0	sort of another possibility yes because it seemed like most of the cases are in fact the single word sorts or at least a single 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact860	1725.28	1726.8	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	or at least a single phrase 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact862	1727.31	1728.51	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	well like they can be stressed i wouldn't make in most of the bands 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact863	1727.67	1728.79	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	well like they can be stressed i wouldn't make in most of the bands 
Bmr018.F.dialogueact861	1727.27	1728.23	F	PhD	b	-1	0	well like they can be stressed i wouldn't make in most of the bands 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact864	1728.51	1729.86	A	Postdoc	s^ng	-1	0	stressed i wouldn't make that generalization because yeah of the bands 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact866	1729.86	1733.44	A	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	that generalization because sometimes people say and then i and then long pause and yeah 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact865	1729.5	1730.03	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	that generalization because sometimes people say yeah 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact867	1733.87	1734.96	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	pause and finish the sun's and 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact868	1734.96	1737.97	A	Postdoc	s.%--	+1	0	finish the sun's and and sometimes it looks coherent and and the i mean 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact869	1737.97	1739.51	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and and the i mean it's it's not a simple problem 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact870	1740.38	1741.29	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	but it's really and then it's coupled 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact871	1741.37	1747.93	A	Postdoc	s^rt	+1	0	and then it's coupled with the problem that sometimes you know with with if it could give you might get the beginning of the word cutoff and 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact872	1747.93	1750.99	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	word cutoff and so it's coupled with the problem that he was isn't perfect either i 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact873	1750.99	1756.84	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	perfect either i mean we've it it's like you have emerging problem plus emerging plus this problem of uh not you right 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact874	1751.14	1751.49	E	Grad	b	-1	0	mean we've it it's like right 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact875	1754.83	1755.07	E	Grad	b	-1	0	plus this problem of 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact876	1757.26	1762.32	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you if he sees nazi's were perfect in to begin with the detector that would already be an improvement but that's impossible 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact877	1762.32	1764.6	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but that's impossible you know it does too much to ask and 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact878	1762.76	1763.1	D	PhD	b	-1	0	but that's impossible you know it does too 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact879	1763.34	1763.72	E	Grad	b	-1	0	you know it does too 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact880	1764.98	1767.4	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	much to ask and so it intimate and you know means 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact881	1768.14	1770.3	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i think that they're always that they would have to be cement we can but it's possible that 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact882	1770.3	1773.85	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	can but it's possible that a script could be renter merge those two types of things i've 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact883	1773.85	1775.65	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	types of things i've i've discussed it with you 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact884	1776.42	1777.59	A	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	in terms of not him doing it but we we 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact885	1777.59	1779.55	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	him doing it but we we discuss some of the premieres of that and how hard it 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact886	1779.55	1782.83	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	of that and how hard it would be to in principle to write something that would do that 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact887	1785.77	1791.76	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and i guess in the future it won't be as much of an issue it's transcribers are using the titan boundaries to start with then we have 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact888	1791.75	1795.62	D	PhD	s	-1	0	well it's just to start with then we have a good idea of where the foursome lyman is constrained too 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact889	1795.52	1803.24	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	well it's just you know a matter of we had the revolution we had the revolution enough improved uh interface um one months too late but it's like too so i'm not i don't know it's just like oh 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact891	1796.31	1798.04	D	PhD	s^no.%-	-1	0	you know a matter of we had the revolution we had the revolution enough so i'm not i don't know it's just 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact890	1795.89	1795.92	E	Grad	b	-1	0	well it's just too 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact892	1800.47	1800.94	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	uh interface 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact893	1803.52	1805.78	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but it's like you know it's wonderful to have the revolution so it's like oh uh 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact894	1803.96	1804.93	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	but it's like you know it's wonderful to have like oh uh 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact895	1805.84	1811.06	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	the revolution so it's just a matter of of you know from now on will be able to have things generalize to begin with right it will just have to see 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact896	1805.87	1806.46	D	PhD	b	-1	0	the revolution so it's just a matter of of 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact897	1811.1	1811.29	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right it will just have to see 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact898	1811.29	1813.01	E	Grad	s	+1	0	yeah right it will just have to see how hard that 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact899	1813.8	1814.05	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yeah that's right so so 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact900	1814.15	1814.55	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	that's right so so 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact901	1814.38	1817.02	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	that's right that's right so so whether the corrections take too much time i was just thinking about the fact 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact902	1815.07	1815.5	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	that's right whether the corrections 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact903	1817.02	1823.63	E	Grad	s	+1	0	good point i was just thinking about the fact that it she lives miss the short segments that might be quite time consuming for them to insert them 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact904	1818.05	1818.33	D	PhD	b	-1	0	that it she lives 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact905	1823.8	1824.2	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	good point he he them 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact906	1824.35	1831.15	D	PhD	s	-1	0	he he also kind of justice minimum time duration constrain and then what you get is noises mostly but that might be okay serious 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact907	1824.85	1825.03	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	he he also kind of justice 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact908	1829.41	1830.1	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	noises mostly serious 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact909	1831.15	1832.49	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	but that might be okay yeah it might be 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact911	1832.74	1832.98	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	yeah it might be 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact910	1832.72	1836.66	E	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah right and you can also see in away from that it might be easier to delete something that's wrong then to insert something that's missing what do you think 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact912	1834.17	1834.56	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right and that's wrong 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact913	1834.86	1836.75	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	right and you can also see in away from that that's wrong then to insert something that's missing what do you think 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact915	1836.75	1837.21	D	PhD	s^aa.%-	-1	0	if you can in away from that yeah that's missing what do you think chain

Bmr018.C.dialogueact917	1837.72	1841.07	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	if you can feel confident that what that yeah but there's actually something that yeah yeah chain because then then 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact918	1841.28	1842.26	D	PhD	b	-1	0	that you're not going to miss something yeah because then then you just delete 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact921	1841.9	1843.06	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that you're not going to miss something yeah i think it's because then then you just delete it and you don't 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact919	1841.43	1841.49	E	Grad	b	-1	0	that yeah because then then 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact920	1841.49	1845.11	E	Grad	s	-1	0	well the problem that you're not going to miss something yeah i think it's because then then you just delete it and you don't have to pick a time 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact922	1843.31	1843.44	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	i think it's it and you don't

Bmr018.A.dialogueact924	1845.18	1848.84	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	well the problem i you know i i it's it's a really good question and i 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact925	1848.84	1851.0	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	a really good question and i really find a pain in the neck to delete things because you have to get the mouse 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact926	1851.0	1854.18	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	you have to get the mouse up there on that on the text line in it and otherwise 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact927	1854.18	1856.78	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	in it and otherwise you just use an to get down me 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact928	1856.93	1858.4	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	to get down me it it it depends on how locking there there's so 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact929	1858.58	1864.57	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	locking there there's so many extra things that would make it one of them harder than the other or vice versa sign a simple 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact930	1864.57	1866.02	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	versa sign a simple question but you know mean principle 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact931	1866.02	1870.86	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know mean principle like you know if one of them is easier than tobias it or whichever one's easier yeah i guess 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact932	1870.59	1873.6	E	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	one's easier yeah i guess the semantics aren't clear when you a segment right because 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact933	1873.76	1874.02	E	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	segment right because you would say you 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact934	1874.02	1877.03	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	you could just say it's a noise you would say you would have to determine what the surroundings were 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact935	1877.0	1880.68	D	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	could just say it's a noise so and right you know post processor will just

Bmr018.A.dialogueact940	1887.03	1889.56	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i think it's easier to add and delete frankly because then you can get

Bmr018.D.dialogueact946	1898.98	1900.45	D	PhD	fg|%-	-1	0	anyway so i i guess maybe 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact945	1898.52	1898.86	E	Grad	s^bk^rt	-1	0	anyway 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact947	1900.39	1904.16	E	Grad	s^am	-1	0	oh guess maybe that's an interface issue that might be stressful i think it's 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact949	1904.18	1904.61	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	oh i think it's 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact948	1904.16	1907.23	E	Grad	s	-1	0	oh i think it's the semantics that are that are questionable to me that you believe 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact950	1907.23	1908.66	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	me that you believe something so 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact951	1908.97	1912.94	E	Grad	s	-1	0	something so let's say someone is talking to here and then you have a little segment here 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact952	1913.49	1914.68	E	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	well is that part of the speech as a part 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact953	1914.68	1916.44	E	Grad	qy	-1	0	of the speech as a part of the non speech 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact954	1917.45	1918.71	E	Grad	qw	-1	0	mean what you embedded in 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact955	1920.35	1931.02	D	PhD	s	-1	0	there's something nice though about keeping and it's probably another discussion keeping the stuff that he lives detector detected as possible speech and just marking it as not speech than deleting it then when you oh i see so 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact956	1931.42	1936.36	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	then when you align it then they lie they can you can put a reject model or whatever and your oh i see so then they could just like put out that's what you meant by just put an x. there oh that's 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact957	1931.49	1931.88	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	then when you oh i see so 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact958	1931.88	1933.18	E	Grad	s^cs.%-	-1	0	then when you align it then they lie they can oh i see so then they could just like put out that's what you meant by just 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact959	1933.18	1935.01	E	Grad	s	-1	0	then they lie they can you can put a reject model or whatever out that's what you meant by just put an x. there 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact960	1936.36	1939.32	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	and your consistent with the automatic system whereas if you delete oh that's an interesting idea so so all 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact961	1936.89	1937.97	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	and your consistent with oh that's an interesting idea 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact962	1939.32	1940.41	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	whereas if you delete it so so all they so that all they would 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact963	1939.45	1942.62	E	Grad	s^bs	-1	0	whereas if you delete it yeah or so so all they so that all they would have to do is put like an x. there 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact964	1942.34	1946.34	D	PhD	s^aa|s.%-	-1	0	yeah or some you know dummy reject well not x. there so blank for blank for silence ass for speech 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact965	1943.77	1946.42	E	Grad	s	-1	0	some you know dummy reject well not so blank for blank for silence ass for speech 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact966	1946.42	1947.28	E	Grad	s	-1	0	ass for speech x. for 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact967	1947.28	1949.55	E	Grad	s	-1	0	whatever yeah that's actually x. for something else 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact968	1948.21	1948.71	D	PhD	s^2	-1	0	whatever yeah something 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact969	1948.84	1949.04	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	whatever yeah that's actually something else 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact970	1949.56	1951.2	D	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	that's actually a better way to do it because feel the else 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact971	1951.2	1954.94	D	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	well like it because feel the force one it would probably be more consistent 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact972	1954.71	1959.52	A	Postdoc	fg|s.%--	-1	0	well like i think there's a complication which is that that you can have speech annoys i mean if it's just as easy but 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact973	1955.24	1956.71	D	PhD	s	-1	0	i think there's a complication which is i mean if it's just as easy but 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact974	1956.71	1956.94	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	which is easy but 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact975	1960.3	1963.33	A	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	uh you know on the same channel the same speaker so nelson 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact976	1963.33	1965.38	A	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	so nelson as you might microphone pop and 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact977	1965.64	1970.05	A	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	pop and uh i mean they're these fuzzy hybrid cases and then the 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact978	1970.76	1973.09	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and then the problem with the boundaries that have to be shipped around so 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact979	1973.92	1976.14	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so simple simple 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact980	1977.41	1979.93	D	PhD	fg|qy.%--	-1	0	anyway quick question not a high level to people think 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact981	1980.52	1989.88	D	PhD	s	-1	0	let's just say that we're moving to this new era of like using uh um pre segment to keep you know non thinking conversations doesn't 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact982	1990.02	2008.85	D	PhD	qr.%-	+1	0	make sense to try to take what we have now which are the ones that you know we have recognition on which are synchronized and not time tightened and try to get something out of those four sort of purposes of those strains uh structure and the nature of the meetings or is it better to just you know forget that and it's well i think we'll have 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact984	2008.85	2009.6	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	and it's well i think we'll have to eventually 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact983	2008.53	2009.91	E	Grad	s	+1	0	and it's well i think we'll have to eventually 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact985	2010.38	2013.35	E	Grad	s.x	+1	0	right and my hope is that we would be able to use the forced alignment to get it but if we 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact986	2013.61	2013.94	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right it but if we 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact988	2013.94	2015.23	D	PhD	s	-1	0	right bodies hope and maybe it but if we can't but if we can't 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact987	2013.83	2014.61	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	right bodies hope it but if we can't 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact990	2015.7	2017.78	D	PhD	s^am.%--	-1	0	and maybe weekend for the non motel but is it but if we can't then maybe we just have to 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact989	2015.66	2017.2	E	Grad	s^r.%-	-1	0	and maybe weekend for the non motel but is it but if we can't then maybe we just have to 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact991	2017.78	2018.45	D	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	but is it worth if we can't 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact992	2018.45	2024.9	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	worth if we can't then we can fake it even if we're we report you know we're wrong twenty percent time or ten percent of the time well i think 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact993	2024.24	2024.92	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	percent of the time well i think 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact994	2025.13	2027.62	E	Grad	qr.x	-1	0	are you talking about for a paper is for the corpus 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact995	2028.66	2030.36	D	PhD	h|s^ba	-1	0	uh it's a good question actually because for the corpus 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact996	2030.23	2032.87	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	actually that's a good question because we'd because for the corpus it would be nice if everything were 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact997	2031.37	2032.62	D	PhD	s^ba^r	-1	0	actually that's a good question because we'd it would be nice if everything were 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact998	2032.62	2037.29	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	question because we'd have to completely redo those meetings and we have like ten of them now were we would have 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact999	2037.72	2038.66	E	Grad	s	-1	0	we would have to redo them we would just

Bmr018.A.dialogueact1012	2053.58	2054.52	A	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	good question well trying to come no that's a good point though because

Bmr018.D.dialogueact1015	2059.82	2061.27	D	PhD	s	+1	0	is a good chunk of data uh we yep

Bmr018.D.dialogueact1018	2063.24	2063.77	D	PhD	s^t	-1	0	okay 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1019	2064.4	2065.5	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that's my hope is that and that's what that's we should at least try it even if 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1020	2064.4	2066.08	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	that's my hope is that and that's what that's what ever since we should at least try it even if 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1021	2065.5	2074.43	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	is that and that's what that's what ever since that that's ever meeting that i transcribed from last year for someone has been on the on the table as a way of cleaning up later and and it even if on the table right 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1022	2067.55	2067.81	D	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	that that's ever

Bmr018.D.dialogueact1031	2085.75	2089.53	D	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean you sort of have a good estimate where these places are because the recognition support

Bmr018.E.dialogueact1237	2448.61	2450.29	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	crown and so that should be should be 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1239	2451.66	2451.92	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	it's right against 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1238	2451.54	2454.78	E	Grad	s	-1	0	it's right against your head there which is what it's supposed to be that balances it 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1240	2455.39	2456.4	E	Grad	s	+1	0	so this is supposed to be so it doesn't flight up yep

Bmr018.E.dialogueact1244	2461.48	2463.61	E	Grad	fh|s	+1	0	so it's really supposed um and so it's supposed to be right under that 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1246	2463.59	2465.77	B	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	so it's really supposed to go more like this and like this under that yes exactly

Bmr018.B.dialogueact1248	2466.23	2467.88	B	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	but then isn't that going too that 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1250	2468.19	2469.56	B	PhD	s	-1	0	well i guess you can control it that that tilts right

Bmr018.E.dialogueact1360	2693.03	2695.11	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and then all the other tasks were much simpler 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1361	2695.92	2696.26	C	Professor	b	-1	0	so they were command and control 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1362	2696.17	2699.23	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	kid it just was one of so they were command and control and that sort of thing

Bmr018.E.dialogueact1375	2715.6	2716.73	E	Grad	s	-1	0	it was better which i thought was pretty interesting that's because 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1376	2716.73	2718.45	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	was pretty interesting that's because they in control for parameters

Bmr018.D.dialogueact1447	2840.13	2849.05	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	and i think like when mari and countrymen jeff are here be good to figure out some kinds of things that we can start doing maybe just on the transcripts because we already have

Bmr018.A.dialogueact1455	2859.58	2861.82	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that we have because it would be easy to to do that just 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1456	2861.96	2862.83	A	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	to do that just so and 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1458	2862.9	2863.42	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	so and and it has to be

Bmr018.A.dialogueact1459	2863.5	2867.35	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and it has to be though someone from this group because of the technical nature of this thing

Bmr018.E.dialogueact1480	2899.74	2905.56	E	Grad	s	-1	0	the day that issue comes up all the time it it it was the only one it was the only one that had any sort of real disagreement about

Bmr018.C.dialogueact1483	2906.23	2908.24	C	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	but i didn't have as much disagreement as i would have liked that i didn't want to i wouldn't so 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1482	2905.83	2906.42	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	but i didn't have as much about so 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1484	2908.24	2913.87	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	liked that i didn't want to i wouldn't did want to get into it because uh you know it was the applications when i didn't know anything about uh yep 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1485	2913.28	2913.51	E	Grad	b	-1	0	anything about uh yep 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1486	2913.87	2916.97	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	anything about uh so it just would have been you know getting up to be argumentative but yep 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1487	2916.97	2918.47	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	to be argumentative but but uh i mean the missing 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1488	2918.47	2919.39	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh i mean the missing things so so what 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1489	2919.39	2923.66	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	things so so what they were saying so i think is you know boy and he's more data sort of but 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1490	2924.11	2927.56	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean it it that's that's dissing it uh improperly i mean it was and 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1491	2927.56	2928.76	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean it was and i study uh 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1492	2928.84	2932.09	C	Professor	fh|s.%-	-1	0	i study uh they were doing this was the word since disintegration it was was it was which yeah yeah yeah well it's sort of was 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1493	2931.57	2932.97	D	PhD	s^ar.%--	-1	0	it was was it was which yeah yeah yeah well it's sort of was 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1494	2931.63	2932.55	E	Grad	fg|s^ng	-1	0	it was was it was which yeah yeah yeah well it's sort of was 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1495	2932.44	2933.49	C	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	was it was which and yeah yeah of was but it was it was a very 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1497	2933.49	2933.71	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	and yeah but it was it was a very 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1496	2933.32	2937.89	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and yeah yeah okay they're there and that but it was it was a very simple case of two versus two versus too and there there there 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1498	2936.13	2937.47	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	yeah okay they're there and that versus too and there there there 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1499	2936.87	2937.1	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah okay they're there and that versus too and there there there 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1500	2937.59	2937.93	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	okay and that there there 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1501	2937.7	2942.57	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	okay right and so what they did was they had and that you could do better with more date i mean that's clearly statistically there there 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1502	2940.16	2940.62	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	right clearly 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1503	2940.3	2940.55	E	Grad	b	-1	0	right clearly 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1504	2941.33	2946.47	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	and so what they did was they had these different kinds of learning machines and the a different amounts of data and so they statistically 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1505	2946.71	2953.3	C	Professor	s	-1	0	of data and so they did like any different methods everybody you know uh argues about about all my my kind of learning machines that are and you're kind of learning machine and 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1506	2954.04	2957.67	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh they were started off with a million words that they use which was 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1507	2957.67	2961.61	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	they use which was evidently a number that a lot of people doing that particular kind of task had been using so 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1508	2961.99	2963.94	C	Professor	s	-1	0	had been using so they end up being like a stuff and two billion 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1509	2965.01	2966.89	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	then there's like scales feeling that 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1510	2967.46	2969.9	C	Professor	fh|s.%-	-1	0	you know and and actually everything gets them being 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1511	2969.12	2971.17	E	Grad	s^j	-1	0	everything gets them being they went up to the 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1512	2972.61	2972.93	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	they 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1513	2973.19	2973.92	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that's a big company i 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1514	2974.19	2976.04	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i did i didn't mean is in anything negative but it mean the bigger the company well 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1515	2974.21	2974.47	E	Grad	b	-1	0	i did i didn't mean is 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1516	2976.19	2977.2	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	but it mean the bigger the company the more words to use well i think 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1517	2976.34	2978.88	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	but it mean the bigger the company the more words to use well i think the reason they can do 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1518	2977.01	2984.49	E	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	the more words to use i think the reason they can do that is that they assumed that that they get off the web like from wall street journal is correct and and it it 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1520	2985.21	2985.46	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	so that's what they use this training 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1519	2985.1	2986.47	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	so that's what they use this training data it's just saying 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1521	2986.55	2988.79	E	Grad	s	-1	0	okay data it's just saying it's in this corpus it's correct 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1522	2988.81	2989.03	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay but i mean yes it's correct 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1523	2989.28	2990.26	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but i mean yes of course there was 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1524	2990.26	2996.07	C	Professor	s	-1	0	of course there was the kind of affected you know one would expect that uh that you got better and better performances warmer data 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1525	2997.14	3003.43	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um but the they're real point was that the the different learning machines are sort of all over the place and and 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1526	3003.43	3009.91	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and and by by going up significantly in data you get much bigger effect then by switching learning machines and 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1527	3009.91	3014.36	C	Professor	s	-1	0	learning machines and furthermore which learning machines on top kind of depended on where you were in this picture so 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1528	3014.36	3014.7	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1529	3015.16	3017.67	B	PhD	s	-1	0	this is my concern about the recognize earner or 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1530	3015.17	3015.59	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	this is my concern 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1531	3020.26	3020.68	C	Professor	qw^d.%--	-1	0	that 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1532	3021.08	3024.16	B	PhD	s^m.%-	-1	0	the differences we're seeing in the front and his beak are relevant are irrelevant 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1533	3023.31	3023.59	C	Professor	b	-1	0	his beak are irrelevant 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1534	3023.7	3024.44	E	Grad	s^2^rt	-1	0	his beak are relevant are irrelevant 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1535	3024.48	3025.27	B	PhD	s^aa^m	-1	0	are relevant once you get a if you 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1536	3025.27	3027.79	B	PhD	s	-1	0	once you get a real recognize that the back end if you had more data 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1537	3025.47	3026.13	C	Professor	b	-1	0	once you get a real recognize if you had more data 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1538	3025.87	3026.9	D	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	once you get a real recognize if you had more data 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1539	3027.31	3027.36	D	PhD	qrr.%-	-1	0	that the back end 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1541	3028.49	3028.8	B	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1540	3028.0	3028.27	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1542	3028.51	3028.72	D	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1543	3029.07	3029.26	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	could well be 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1544	3029.62	3030.22	C	Professor	s^am	-1	0	could well be so 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1545	3030.9	3034.4	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	so so i mean that was that was kind of you know it's a good point 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1546	3035.28	3044.14	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but the problem i had with it was that the implications out of this was that uh that kind of choices you make about learning machines were there for a relevant which is not 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1547	3044.66	3050.26	C	Professor	s	-1	0	which is not a and as far as i know and and test i'm more familiar with and is not at all true what what 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1548	3050.76	3054.1	C	Professor	s	-1	0	what what is is true is a different learning machines have different properties and 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1549	3054.99	3056.99	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and you want to know what those properties are in 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1550	3056.99	3061.43	C	Professor	s	-1	0	properties are in someone else sort of implied that we always you know all this learn machines you still don't know what those properties or we don't know 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1551	3061.75	3068.18	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	or we don't know them perfectly but we know that some kind use more memory and and some other kind of juice more complication and some 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1552	3068.18	3073.81	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	but they're and some uh our our of of limited kind of discrimination but there just easy to use and others are 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1553	3073.61	3077.82	B	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	but they're their conclusion just sort of you could have guessed that before they even started because and others are 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1554	3077.82	3082.46	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	they even started because if you assume that these learning things get better and better and better then you would guess 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1555	3079.96	3080.86	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	you assume that these learning things you would guess 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1556	3083.71	3086.69	B	PhD	s	-1	0	as you approach to the point where you can't get any better right you get 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1557	3086.69	3086.83	B	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	get any better right you get

Bmr018.B.dialogueact1576	3102.01	3102.28	B	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	so you have to eventually

Bmr018.C.dialogueact1585	3108.38	3108.74	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	close i mean 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1586	3109.93	3112.19	C	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	yeah the spread was still pretty wise that's that's true but but yep 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1587	3111.5	3111.65	E	Grad	b	-1	0	that's that's true yep 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1588	3112.19	3117.68	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but but uh i think it would be into into intuition that this would be the case but 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1589	3117.76	3120.72	C	Professor	s	-1	0	case but uh to really see it and have intuition is quite different i mean i 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1590	3120.72	3129.92	C	Professor	fh|s^rt	-1	0	is quite different i mean i think so what she was talking about earlier that the effect of having a lot more data is quite different in switchboard damages in in broadcast news well it's different for different tasks yeah it was 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1591	3128.0	3129.96	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	in in broadcast news it's different for different tasks yeah it was 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1592	3128.64	3128.73	E	Grad	b	-1	0	in in broadcast it's different for different yeah it was 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1593	3128.73	3129.33	E	Grad	s.%	-1	0	in in broadcast news it's different for different tasks yeah it was 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1594	3129.33	3129.57	E	Grad	b	-1	0	news tasks 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1595	3130.09	3130.35	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah so it depends 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1596	3130.09	3135.61	D	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah so it depends a lot on whether you know it's just a continuation is exactly the case for more data is better right you're 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1597	3135.61	3135.78	D	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	is better right you're 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1598	3135.78	3138.94	D	PhD	s	-1	0	is better right you're you're you can assume similar distribution but 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1599	3136.35	3136.66	C	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	you're you 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1600	3138.94	3146.21	D	PhD	s	-1	0	distribution but if you wanted to do just to make you a on a different type of uh testing and then you're trained data then that extra did it wouldn't generalize so

Bmr018.D.dialogueact1602	3146.21	3146.64	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1603	3147.14	3147.38	C	Professor	b	-1	0	but i think one of their 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1604	3147.15	3149.49	E	Grad	s	-1	0	but i think one of their they they had a couple points uh 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1605	3149.55	3154.29	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	uh i think one of them was that well maybe simpler algorithms and more day there is better less memory 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1606	3154.41	3155.12	E	Grad	s	-1	0	less memory pastor operation 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1607	3155.29	3156.15	E	Grad	s	-1	0	pastor operation simpler 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1608	3156.15	3156.61	E	Grad	s	-1	0	simpler 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1609	3158.03	3158.2	E	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right because they're simplistic 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1610	3158.2	3161.55	E	Grad	s	-1	0	right because they're simplistic most brain dead algorithm did pretty darn well 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1611	3161.87	3162.37	C	Professor	b	-1	0	well when you got gave it a lot 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1612	3162.12	3163.49	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	when you got gave it a lot more day and then also 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1613	3163.49	3167.78	E	Grad	s	-1	0	more day and then also they were saying well we you have access to a lot more data why 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1614	3167.78	3169.43	E	Grad	qw	-1	0	to a lot more data why are you sticking with a million words mean their point 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1615	3169.43	3174.86	E	Grad	s	-1	0	words mean their point was that this million word corpus that everyone uses apparently ten or fifteen years old 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1616	3175.85	3177.06	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and everyone is still using it 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1617	3177.55	3177.85	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1618	3178.53	3178.75	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1619	3179.95	3193.68	C	Professor	s^tc.x	-1	0	but anyway i i think it's it's just the it's it's it's not really the conclusion they came to so much as the conclusion that some of the uh a comment hers in the crowd came up with that but we could talk about this stuff things you want to do yeah right 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1620	3181.79	3182.99	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	it's it's just the it's but we could talk about this stuff things 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1621	3182.99	3184.0	E	Grad	s	-1	0	it's it's it's not really the conclusion talk about this stuff things you want to do 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1622	3185.71	3189.15	E	Grad	b^rt	-1	0	they came to so much as the conclusion that some of the yeah 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1623	3192.3	3192.6	E	Grad	b.x	-1	0	came right 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1624	3193.68	3198.87	C	Professor	s	-1	0	up with that uh you know this therefore is further evidence that you know more data is really only she care about and 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1625	3198.97	3202.89	C	Professor	s	-1	0	she care about and that i thought was just kind of going too far the other way and machine learning 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1626	3201.79	3202.57	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	going too far the other way and machine learning 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1627	3202.89	3204.48	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	the other way and and the d. uh learning 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1628	3205.32	3209.36	C	Professor	s	-1	0	one one person get get get got up and made a brief defense uh but it was 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1629	3209.36	3210.96	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh but it was a different kind of grounds was 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1630	3210.96	3221.11	C	Professor	s	-1	0	a different kind of grounds was that that uh it the reason people were not using so much data before was not because they were stupid or didn't realize they it was important but in fact they didn't have it available um 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1631	3221.84	3227.22	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um but the other place to make again is that uh machine learning still does matter but 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1632	3227.96	3231.27	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	but it it there's more in some situations than others and you know also 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1633	3231.27	3237.29	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and you know also there's there's not just matter being or not battering but there's battering in different ways i mean you might be in 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1634	3237.29	3242.29	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean you might be in some situation where you care how much memory or using are 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1636	3243.07	3244.98	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you carrying a what recall times and 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1635	3242.87	3243.09	E	Grad	b	-1	0	are you carrying a what recall 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1637	3244.98	3246.44	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	times and you care you know and and for you only have a 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1638	3246.21	3249.4	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and yeah or or uh or does for you only have a million words for some new task 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1639	3248.13	3248.46	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah or for some new task 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1640	3248.63	3250.27	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	yeah or or uh or does another language for some new task yeah 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1641	3249.9	3251.25	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	or uh or does another language or i mean you so there's yeah 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1643	3251.25	3255.18	D	PhD	s	-1	0	or i mean you so there's papers on portability in rapid prototype thing and blah blah blah and then there's people saying right 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1642	3251.05	3251.32	E	Grad	b	-1	0	or i mean you so there's 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1644	3251.79	3252.01	C	Professor	b	-1	0	or i mean you so there's papers on portability 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1645	3253.43	3253.69	E	Grad	b	-1	0	in rapid prototype right 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1647	3255.29	3255.52	C	Professor	b	-1	0	and then there's people saying 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1646	3255.18	3256.97	D	PhD	s^e:s	-1	0	and then there's people saying oh just have more data 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1649	3257.29	3258.13	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and his cause so you like two different religions cost 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1648	3257.1	3257.36	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	and his cause so you like 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1651	3257.74	3260.06	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and his cause is just plain cost you know so so you like two different religions basically cost yeah it's a big one 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1650	3257.46	3258.03	E	Grad	b	-1	0	and his cause so you like two different religions cost 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1652	3258.89	3259.26	E	Grad	s^aa^m	-1	0	is just plain cost two different religions basically cost yeah it's a big one 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1654	3259.47	3260.49	C	Professor	s^r	-1	0	is just plain cost you know so basically yeah it's a big one 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1653	3259.37	3259.57	E	Grad	b	-1	0	is just plain cost basically yeah it's a big one 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1655	3259.57	3260.17	E	Grad	s	-1	0	is just plain cost you know so basically yeah it's a big one 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1656	3260.62	3260.88	C	Professor	qh	-1	0	you know so 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1657	3260.88	3266.77	C	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	you know so so these i mean the in the in the speech side the thing that always occurs to me is that if you 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1658	3267.34	3268.26	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	if you uh one person 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1659	3268.33	3274.7	C	Professor	s	-1	0	one person has a system that requires ten thousand dollars to train on any other mean choirs a hundred 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1660	3275.25	3278.67	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and they both do about the same because the hundred hour one was smarter 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1661	3279.3	3281.1	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	that's that's got to be better because people yep 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1663	3281.62	3285.19	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because people i mean there's going to be just one system that people train on and then that's it further yep 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1662	3281.23	3281.42	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	because people yep 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1664	3285.19	3287.04	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and then that's it further for all time and people are going to be 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1665	3287.04	3292.43	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah and people are going to be doing other different things and so it these basics manners 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1666	3293.05	3293.66	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	it's it's uh this yeah so that's 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1668	3293.66	3295.04	E	Grad	s	-1	0	it's it's uh this is a very provocative flight she put this up yeah so that's why the flights they put up 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1667	3293.66	3295.55	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it's it's uh this is a very provocative flight she put this up yeah so that's why the flights they put up 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1669	3295.55	3299.74	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	flight she put this up and it's like this is just pick people kept saying can i see that's like you can't yeah 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1670	3295.59	3295.84	C	Professor	b	-1	0	flight she put this up 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1671	3299.58	3299.82	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	like you can't yeah 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1673	3300.13	3307.75	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and then they make a comment one person said well known person said um you know before you dismiss forty five years including my work yeah forty five years race or 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1672	3300.05	3300.33	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and then they make a comment yeah 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1674	3305.68	3307.1	E	Grad	s^2^m	-1	0	forty five years including my work forty five years race or 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1676	3307.9	3307.97	D	PhD	b	-1	0	my work 
Bmr018.G.dialogueact1675	3307.64	3307.87	G	Grad	b	-1	0	my work 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1677	3308.92	3311.94	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but you know the same thing has happened in computational linguistics 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1678	3312.06	3312.28	D	PhD	qy^d^f^rt	-1	0	right you look at be a. 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1679	3312.28	3316.99	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	right you look at be a. sale papers coming and now there's sort of a turn back for the okay we've learned statistic you 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1680	3316.99	3320.85	D	PhD	s	-1	0	learned statistic you know we're basically getting what we expect out of some statistical methods and 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1681	3320.85	3321.05	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	methods and you know the 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1682	3321.19	3323.76	D	PhD	s	-1	0	you know the there's arguments on both sides i 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1683	3323.45	3323.66	E	Grad	b	-1	0	sides i 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1685	3324.12	3324.45	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	so think the matters 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1684	3324.03	3327.49	E	Grad	s	-1	0	that was very offending very offending so yeah think the matters is the thing that that was misleading is that 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1686	3326.51	3327.61	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that was very offending very offending yeah that was misleading is that 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1688	3327.69	3328.36	A	Postdoc	s^r	-1	0	offending very offending yeah is that all all of 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1687	3327.67	3329.28	D	PhD	b	-1	0	offending very offending yeah yeah is that all all of them are based on all the 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1689	3327.81	3330.52	E	Grad	s	-1	0	offending very offending yeah yeah is that all all of them are based on all the others right just you 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1690	3330.52	3330.7	E	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	others right just you 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1691	3330.7	3331.84	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	maybe they should have said others right just you you can't say 
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1693	3331.2	3333.27	B	PhD	s^cs:s	-1	0	maybe they should have said focus or something you can't say yeah me 
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1692	3330.75	3330.97	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	others right just you 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1694	3333.51	3333.82	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	yeah me 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1695	3333.94	3334.48	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	yeah me so yeah 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1696	3334.74	3336.73	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so yeah i think same thing happened with speech recognition right for 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1697	3336.73	3336.88	E	Grad	qh	-1	0	recognition right for 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1698	3336.88	3339.33	E	Grad	s	-1	0	recognition right for a long time before hand code coding linguistic rules and then they discovered 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1699	3339.33	3341.72	E	Grad	s^e^rt	-1	0	and then they discovered machine learning worked better 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1700	3342.2	3349.28	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and and then you hit yes and now they're throwing more and more data and worrying perhaps worrying less and less about uh the exact details of the algorithms 
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1701	3344.43	3345.57	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and and then you hit yes worrying perhaps worrying less and 
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1702	3350.12	3351.72	E	Grad	s	-1	0	except when they have years 
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1704	3353.13	3353.38	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	anyway
