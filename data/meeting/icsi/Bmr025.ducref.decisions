DARPA demo illustrating prosody of meeting events will be completed by the end of the ( next ) month , so as to allow a week or so for transferring data across to laptops.
After consulting others , the group decide that not backing up their meeting data is a bad idea , since this cannot be recovered.
Therefore , meeting recorder data will be backed up , and also stored manually using the NW archive.
More disk space will be purchased , however for now , data which is easily re-creatable will not be backed up.
After evaluating the use of the CrossPads , the group decide to return one , and also keep one which will be left out in meetings to encourage its use.
Use of PDAs and buttons for note-taking will be investigated , along with using the data for a student research project.
Because of time constraints , the group decide to do simultaneous digits.
