Although the Meeting Recorder group only list two agenda items , this meeting explores transcription , and in particular , consent forms in depth , and at times results in heated debate.
With regard to obtaining consent , the group discuss the extent to which they need to attempt to contact people , which methods are most appropriate , and how much responsibility rests on participants being available and checking their e-mail regularly.
The group suggest sending reminder e-mails , although since many participants are local they can be contacted by other means if necessary.
Transcriptions are back from IBM , and the group discuss the checking of these , particularly since the pre-segmenter has interfered with back-channel data.
Checking of the NSA meetings has revealed that this non-native English meeting data contains transcription inaccuracies due to the use of foreign language terms and technical vocabulary.
Additional topics covered more briefly in this meeting are disk space , the DARPA annual report , progress with the demo , conference submissions and attendance , and requests from the University of Washington for data.
