For language and dialogue modelling , current methods of marking and segmenting overlap are abstracted from real time , as individual speaker turns are indicated sequentially.
A large amount of data must be collected to address research questions concerning overlapping speech.
For automatic speaker identification , thresholding and filtering methods are sensitive regarding the particular filter width and threshold selected.
While such parameters can be finely tuned for one speaker to achieve good results , extending the same parameters to another speaker is problematic.
The broad phone classifier of the speaker-change detector is peforming poorly.
The prospect of erecting visual barriers during meetings would require partitioning off each of the participants.
Also , barriers that do not affect the overall room acoustics would be required.
