Bmr012.A.dialogueact139	162.083	162.443	A	PhD	b	-1	0	then 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact138	161.916	171.087	E	Grad	s	-1	0	age is all right and then um there will be attached to this a or to these forums uh so that you'll be able to extract the day off that 
Bmr012.A.dialogueact140	168.722	169.132	A	PhD	%	-1	0	uh so that you'll be able to extract

Bmr012.E.dialogueact420	569.804	572.774	E	Grad	s	-1	0	if the first run i ran the switchboard i got a hundred twenty percent were there 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact422	572.774	572.884	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	were there 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact423	574.063	576.203	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so i went all also this means is that um uh 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact424	575.28	575.46	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	this means is that

Bmr012.C.dialogueact430	579.833	583.493	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	various people especially i guess um with jane that that would help since we have this 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact431	583.493	593.403	C	PhD	s	-1	0	since we have this new data now uh you know to go from the transcripts more easily too just the words that the recognize or would use for scoring i had to 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact432	593.713	598.583	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	well one thing i guess i had to do it some of it by hand but i think a lot of it can be automated 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact433	598.114	599.504	B	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	well one thing i guess i didn't get so 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact434	599.504	603.304	B	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	i didn't get so have language follow straight from from by gram from switchboard acoustic

Bmr012.C.dialogueact502	679.092	681.242	C	PhD	fh|s^ba	-1	0	and uh that's interesting because i think 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact503	681.242	684.062	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because i think the their language miles are quite different so and i'm pretty

Bmr012.C.dialogueact505	684.562	693.992	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so and i'm pretty sure from listening to eric that you've given the word she was saying and given has been n. c. asian that the reason that he's so much worse is the little pal 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact508	694.516	694.836	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	right that makes us

Bmr012.G.dialogueact507	694.47	695.37	G	Postdoc	s^ba^na	-1	0	so it's nice right that makes us 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact509	695.092	699.962	C	PhD	fh|s^cs	-1	0	so it's nice now if we can just sort of eliminate phillip how when when we get new mexico that 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact510	695.42	695.62	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	so it's nice

Bmr012.A.dialogueact544	750.079	752.079	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	i think 
Bmr012.A.dialogueact545	752.079	753.829	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	it's pretty 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact546	752.803	753.103	C	PhD	b	-1	0	it's pretty 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact547	753.763	754.583	C	PhD	s	-1	0	it's pretty good um 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact548	755.013	756.283	C	PhD	fh|s.%-	-1	0	so then and i have tried on the 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact549	755.832	757.322	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so then and i have tried on the far field like 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact550	756.14	757.83	E	Grad	s	+1	2	and i have tried on the far field like 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact551	757.322	757.512	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	far field like 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact553	758.163	758.683	C	PhD	s	-1	0	easy i'm and then there's 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact552	757.83	758.06	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	easy i'm and then there's far field like 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact554	758.683	765.603	C	PhD	s	-1	0	easy i'm and then there's things like for the transcription i got when someone has a digit in the transcript i don't know if they said you know one one or eleven and i don't know 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact555	765.603	768.543	C	PhD	s	-1	0	eleven and i don't know if they said pickler t. c. l. this 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact556	769.023	775.343	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	things like that where you know the um would probably have to ask the transcribers to indicate some of those kinds of things but 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact557	775.343	777.743	C	PhD	s	-1	0	things but in general it was really good and 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact558	777.743	778.623	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	really good and i'm hoping this 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact559	778.913	781.263	C	PhD	s	+1	1	i'm hoping this is this is good news because that means 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact560	781.263	783.713	C	PhD	s^df	+1	2	because that means the forced alignment should be good enough 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact561	783.713	784.883	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	should be good enough force alignments 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact562	785.163	786.063	C	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	means good news anyway but if the foursome limits 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact563	786.063	789.373	C	PhD	s	+1	2	but if the foursome limits are good we can get all kinds of information for 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact564	790.013	793.043	C	PhD	s^e	+1	2	example about you know pathetic information and speaker overlaps 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact565	793.043	797.483	C	PhD	s^e	+1	2	and speaker overlaps and so forth directly from the aligned times 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact566	798.513	800.213	C	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	um so that'll be something that actually 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact567	800.923	808.933	C	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	actually in order to assess the forced alignment um we need some linguists or some people to look at and say or these boundaries in about the right place 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact568	809.453	810.963	C	PhD	s	-1	0	because it's going to give us a timer you know well we've done that 
Bmr012.D.dialogueact570	810.42	810.76	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	to give us a timer you know well we've done that 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact569	810.39	811.97	E	Grad	s	-1	0	to give us a timer you know well we've done that for one meeting 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact571	811.103	811.383	C	PhD	b	-1	0	for one meeting 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact572	813.648	814.798	C	PhD	s^aap	-1	0	for forced alignment 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact573	815.7	816.39	E	Grad	h|s^bk	-1	0	uh oh not for work 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact574	816.39	817.07	E	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	right not for work i'm sorry just for overlaps 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact575	816.993	817.763	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right not for work i'm sorry just for overlaps 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact576	817.07	820.24	E	Grad	s^bs^fa	-1	0	right right so this would be like if you take the words i'm sorry just for overlaps is for not offer words 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact577	818.423	818.863	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right is for 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact578	819.273	830.823	C	PhD	qh	+1	0	so this would be like if you take the words um you know enforce online among all the individual close like uh close second makes then how good are these sort of in reality and then not offer words right 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact579	829.68	829.97	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	are these sort of in right 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact580	830.823	831.763	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	reality and then i was thinking so we might want to take 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact581	831.19	835.18	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	i was thinking so we might want to take twenty minutes and do a closer word level transcription maybe actually 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact582	835.74	837.33	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	maybe actually marked work boundaries 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact583	838.062	838.302	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	uh or you have someone 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact584	838.302	840.352	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	uh or you have someone look at the alignments uh maybe 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact585	840.412	846.912	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	uh maybe a linguist who can say you know roughly if these are okay and how far away they are 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact586	846.98	847.77	B	Professor	b	-1	0	far away they are um but 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact587	847.512	849.472	C	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	um but i think it's got to be pretty good because otherwise 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact588	849.472	851.862	C	PhD	s^df	+1	0	good because otherwise the word recognition would be really crummy it 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact589	851.36	852.36	E	Grad	b	-1	0	really crummy it wouldn't necessarily be 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact590	851.952	853.822	C	PhD	s	-1	0	really crummy it wouldn't necessarily be the other way around if there 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact591	853.822	856.532	C	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	the other way around if there were word recognition was crummy neil lime it might be okay but 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact592	856.952	860.892	C	PhD	s	-1	0	be okay but if the word recognition is this good alignment should be pretty good 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact593	861.182	862.892	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	wonder if this is a 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact595	862.247	863.137	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	wonder if this is a good thing or a bad thing 
Bmr012.D.dialogueact594	862.191	864.531	D	PhD	s	-1	0	wonder if this is a good thing or a bad thing now i mean if we're never 
Bmr012.D.dialogueact596	864.531	865.801	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	now i mean if we're yeah never starting so well 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact597	864.89	865.94	E	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	now i mean if we're yeah never starting so well 
Bmr012.D.dialogueact598	865.971	869.241	D	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	oh yeah for producing a database that everybody's going to do well on starting so well don't worry about what that's that's the close talking 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact599	866.5	866.93	B	Professor	b	-1	0	oh for producing a database 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact600	867.33	867.94	E	Grad	s^co^ng	-1	0	that everybody's don't worry about what 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact601	867.94	870.65	E	Grad	s	-1	0	that everybody's going to do well on don't worry about what that's that's the close talking mike's tried 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact602	870.81	872.48	E	Grad	s^co.%-	-1	0	yeah which i would so the real value mike's tried on the p. c. m. and and 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact603	871.779	872.209	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah which i would so the real value on the p. c. m. and and 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact604	872.209	875.229	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	yeah which i would which one mm so the real value the databases these and yeah well no but 
Bmr012.D.dialogueact606	872.42	874.07	D	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	yeah which i would which one mm so the real value the databases these and yeah well 
Bmr012.H.dialogueact605	872.23	874.85	H	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah which i would which one mm so the real value the databases these and yeah well

Bmr012.E.dialogueact608	874.87	875.99	E	Grad	h|s^ar.%-	-1	0	one mm yeah well no but 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact609	876.37	878.76	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean there's still just do the percentages and i mean 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact610	878.76	879.85	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	the percentages and i mean that i 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact612	880.06	882.15	B	Professor	s	-1	0	as we talk about before there's probably overlaps probably overlaps this is yeah it's not that good 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact611	880.042	880.482	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	as we talk about before there's this is yeah 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact613	880.482	880.932	C	PhD	b	-1	0	as we talk about before there's this is yeah 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact614	881.052	882.242	C	PhD	s	-1	0	probably overlaps probably overlaps it's not that good 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact615	882.62	886.91	B	Professor	s	-1	0	probably overlaps in in uh in fair number and switchboard as well so 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact616	886.91	887.24	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	as well so but but 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact617	887.7	888.78	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but but there's other phenomena it's a meeting 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact618	888.78	889.35	B	Professor	s	-1	0	there's other phenomena it's a meeting it's a different thing 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact619	889.35	892.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it's a different thing there's lots of stuff to learn that close talking mike's but uh 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact620	892.65	893.55	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but uh yeah certainly 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact621	893.72	896.14	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	2	yeah certainly i'd like to see soon as we could i mean maybe 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact622	896.14	898.43	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	i mean maybe get some of the questions out of the way this is could 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact623	898.43	902.44	B	Professor	s^cs.%--	+1	2	out of the way this is could how well it does with say well easy m.'s or maybe 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact624	902.58	902.92	C	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr012.B.dialogueact625	903.08	904.62	B	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	and uh see if it's you know is a hundred 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact626	904.62	905.75	B	Professor	qy	-1	0	if it's you know is a hundred and twenty percent or maybe not 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact627	905.75	906.24	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and twenty percent or maybe not maybe if 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact628	906.24	911.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	maybe if with meditation get this down to fifty percent or forty five percent or something and and then if 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact629	911.1	914.07	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and and then if easy and it's seventy or something like that that's actually something 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact630	914.07	916.98	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that's actually something sort of work with a little bit 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact631	917.48	917.75	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah no 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact633	918.187	918.897	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	i think it's really 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact632	917.98	918.9	C	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	yeah no i think it's really 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact634	918.9	921.13	C	PhD	s	-1	0	i think it's really and this way we at least have a baseline we know that presses 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact635	921.13	923.97	C	PhD	s	-1	0	we know that presses the transcripts are very good so 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact636	923.97	930.83	C	PhD	s	-1	0	are very good so once you can get the words that the recognize or which is it's total subset of the things you need to understand the tax 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact637	931.53	933.05	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um yeah they're pretty good so and then it 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact638	933.05	938.74	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so and then it converting automatically from the x. amount chopping up the way forms and so forth that's not 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact639	938.74	945.83	C	PhD	s	+1	0	and so forth that's not the case that the end of one audience is in the next segment and things like that which we had more problems with and switchboard 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact640	946.45	947.11	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so that's good and 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact641	947.8	948.9	C	PhD	fh|s^t1	-1	0	and um see there was 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact642	948.9	951.636	C	PhD	s	-1	0	um see there was one more thing i wanted to remember

Bmr012.C.dialogueact956	1454.96	1457.01	C	PhD	s	-1	0	interesting as a complement to are fun and meeting and dot e. d. u. 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact955	1454.73	1455.35	E	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	interesting as a complement to are dot e. d. u. 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact957	1457.99	1459.87	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	and um so that's going to start monday and 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact958	1459.87	1473.74	C	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	to start monday and one of the things that i was realizing is um it would be really great if anyone has any ideas on some kind of time sinks in this way that people in the meeting can make a comment to the person who's going to transcribe it 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact959	1474.28	1481.89	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	or or but um push a button or something when they want to make i know about oh boy you should probably erase those last few or 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact960	1481.89	1485.76	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	those last few or uh wait i want this not to be recorded now or 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact961	1485.76	1488.55	C	PhD	s^cs.%-	-1	0	were they going to do something with a pad now or uh something like that 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact962	1487.02	1490.36	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	they going to do something with a pad at one point something like that yeah we could uhhuh cross paths 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact963	1490.07	1490.76	G	Postdoc	qy^d^rt	-1	0	yeah we could cross paths 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact964	1490.79	1492.19	E	Grad	s^na	+1	1	because i was thinking you know if yeah we could do was across pets cross paths 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact965	1491.37	1498.04	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	because i was thinking you know if if the person sets up the meeting isn't there and it's a group that we don't know um and this do was across pets 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact966	1498.49	1501.54	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um and this came up talking to to jerry also that you 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact967	1501.54	1509.21	C	PhD	qy	-1	0	also that you know is there any way for them to indicate to make sure that the request that they have that they make explicitly get addressed somehow so i don't know if anyone 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact968	1508.82	1509.13	B	Professor	b	-1	0	somehow so i don't know if anyone 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact969	1509.21	1510.76	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so i don't know if anyone has ideas or 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact970	1510.76	1514.24	C	PhD	s^cs.%-	-1	0	well what i was just suggesting this is has ideas or you could even write down oh it's about three twenty five 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact971	1513.67	1517.66	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	well what i was just suggesting this is we have these this crossed that just for this purpose and just use twenty five that'd yeah and use that it's not a bad idea 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact972	1516.42	1517.32	E	Grad	s^cs^na	-1	0	that just for this purpose and just use that'd yeah and use that it's not a bad idea 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact974	1517.66	1518.28	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	for this purpose and just use that may be sinking in that'd be great it's not a bad idea 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact973	1517.32	1518.33	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	for this purpose and just use that may be sinking in that'd be great it's not a bad idea 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact976	1518.28	1519.05	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	that may be sinking in yeah be great 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact975	1517.99	1518.68	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	for this purpose and just use that may be sinking in that'd be great it's not a bad idea 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact977	1519.05	1520.39	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah things i don't know if you 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact978	1519.3	1519.75	C	PhD	s^ba^r	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact979	1520.39	1524.09	B	Professor	s	-1	0	things i don't know if you know the surface a question for to mail to dan but 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact980	1524.09	1531.2	B	Professor	qr^rt	+1	0	but is this thing of two eight channel boards a maximum for the setup or could we go to a third board i don't know i'll send mail down 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact981	1528.81	1529.24	E	Grad	s^no	-1	0	for the setup or could i don't know 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact982	1529.78	1530.37	E	Grad	s^no^r	-1	0	or could we go to a third board know 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact983	1531.28	1532.64	E	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	i'll send mail down and ask i i 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact984	1532.64	1537.01	E	Grad	s	+1	0	and ask i i think that it's the maximum we can do without a lot of effort because it's one bored 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact985	1537.01	1540.97	E	Grad	s	+1	0	because it's one bored with two digital channels 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact986	1539.56	1540.33	B	Professor	s^bk^m	-1	0	digital channels 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact987	1541.91	1542.57	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	age so it it takes 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact988	1542.64	1544.92	E	Grad	s	+1	0	so it it takes two five percent of the one board 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact989	1545.29	1548.8	E	Grad	s	+1	0	so we i think if we want to do that more than that would have to have two ports 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact990	1549.12	1550.52	E	Grad	s	+1	0	and then you have the same conversation if 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact991	1552.64	1553.95	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but that's a question because that would 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact992	1554.1	1556.27	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	if it was possible because it is it you know already 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact993	1556.4	1560.4	B	Professor	s	+1	1	it you know already we have a a group of people just from the cannot all be my and 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact994	1560.34	1560.55	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	my and 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact995	1560.98	1562.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	my and it's not just because we haven't been to the store what 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact996	1562.59	1562.78	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	the store what 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact997	1562.78	1563.22	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	the store what is the limit on each of 
Bmr012.D.dialogueact998	1562.92	1565.35	D	PhD	qw	-1	0	the store what is the limit on each of those fiber challenges that this 
Bmr012.D.dialogueact999	1565.35	1566.02	D	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	challenges that this eight 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1000	1566.01	1566.22	E	Grad	s	-1	0	eight 
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1001	1567.52	1568.84	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	it's just it's eight channels coming to that 
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1003	1568.84	1570.21	D	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	eight channels coming to that has to do with sampling i have no idea 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1002	1568.8	1569.34	E	Grad	s.%	-1	0	eight channels coming to that has to do with sampling 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1004	1570.28	1570.86	E	Grad	s^no	-1	0	i have no idea 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1005	1572.62	1576.36	E	Grad	s	-1	0	but each each fibers channel has eight eight channels and 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1006	1576.81	1580.52	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and there are two two two fibers that go into the car 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1007	1581.82	1582.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it might be hard limitation i mean 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1008	1582.15	1582.31	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	be hard limitation i mean 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1009	1582.94	1587.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	be hard limitation i mean one thing is that the whole thing is is that is is all structured in terms of worry killer sampling so that pushes 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1010	1587.59	1590.14	B	Professor	s	-1	0	sampling so that pushes requirements out but i was wondering if that could change yep i mean they would also have 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1011	1588.94	1589.11	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	requirements out i was wondering yep 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1013	1590.14	1590.85	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but if that could change i mean they would also have 
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1012	1589.67	1591.48	D	PhD	s	-1	0	requirements out but i was wondering if that could change i mean they would also have to get another eighty d. 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1014	1590.37	1594.62	E	Grad	s	-1	0	but if that could change if we could drop that i mean they would also have to get another eighty d. in another mixer and all that sort of stuff 
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1015	1592.23	1593.13	D	PhD	s	-1	0	if we could drop that in another mixer and all that 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1016	1595.59	1596.43	B	Professor	b	-1	0	dawson emailed and asked 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1017	1595.77	1597.26	E	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	dawson emailed and asked them 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1018	1598.25	1598.53	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	they on the 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1019	1598.3	1599.31	E	Grad	qy^bu^t.%--	-1	0	they on the other we don't with to 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1020	1599.31	1600.04	E	Grad	qy^rt^t	-1	0	other we don't with to the other topic 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1021	1600.04	1603.71	E	Grad	s^t^tc	+1	1	the other topic is uh getting more my and different mikes 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1022	1604.07	1604.94	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so i got a quote 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1023	1605.17	1605.48	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1024	1606.33	1608.91	E	Grad	s	+1	0	we can fit we have room for one more wireless 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1025	1609.36	1610.03	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and the wireless this unit here is 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1026	1610.03	1612.96	E	Grad	s	-1	0	this unit here is three fifty three hundred fifty dollars 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1027	1613.22	1616.65	E	Grad	s^co	-1	0	it i didn't realize but we also have to get a tutor the receiver or the other and that's uh 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1028	1616.65	1617.81	E	Grad	s	-1	0	or the other and that's uh four thirty 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1029	1618.71	1620.67	E	Grad	fh|s.%-	-1	0	for for each um and then also 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1031	1619.97	1621.0	C	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	for for each city the tutors and then also 
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1030	1619.76	1620.05	D	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	for for each and then also 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1032	1621.33	1623.3	C	PhD	qy^bsc^bu^d^rt	-1	0	city the tutors for thirty for each yep 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1033	1623.38	1623.62	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yep 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1034	1623.96	1624.38	C	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	yep and we just need one 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1035	1624.37	1626.04	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	yeah they said we got the good ones and we just need one more so so 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1036	1625.51	1626.95	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah they said we got the good ones more so so 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1037	1627.1	1627.3	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yep 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1038	1628.23	1631.42	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so that's you know something like seven hundred eighty bucks for one more of these i'm and 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1039	1629.12	1629.58	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	seven hundred eighty bucks 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1040	1631.29	1631.6	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	i'm and 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1041	1631.76	1638.56	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	i'm and then also um it turns out that the connector that this thing uses his proprietary of sony 
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1042	1638.71	1638.74	D	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	sony 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1043	1639.32	1639.91	E	Grad	s	-1	0	believe it or not and 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1044	1639.91	1641.97	E	Grad	s	-1	0	believe it or not and sony only sells this headset 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1045	1640.0	1640.7	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	sony only sells 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1046	1643.13	1652.2	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so if we want to use a different set headset the solution that the guy suggested and apparently lots of people have done if sony will sell you the jack with just wires coming out the end and then 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1047	1652.2	1657.02	E	Grad	s	-1	0	the end and then you can buy a headset that has take kale and solder yourself and that's 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1048	1657.87	1659.0	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and that's the other solution and so the jacks are 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1049	1659.0	1661.29	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so the jacks are forty bucks a piece and 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1050	1661.71	1669.66	E	Grad	s	-1	0	isn't and that he recommended um i ground c. m. three eleven e. set for two hundred bucks a piece 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1051	1669.86	1671.9	B	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	isn't this some sort of thing that plugs in you actually a piece 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1052	1671.9	1674.0	B	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	thing that plugs in you actually have to go into the side rain so because the reason 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1053	1674.42	1683.83	E	Grad	s	-1	0	i understand that reason i ask is these sort of because the reason is the only only thing you can get that will plug into this is this mike or justin thee connector 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1054	1680.49	1681.21	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	i understand that or justin thee 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1055	1682.84	1688.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	reason i ask is these sort of handmade uh wiring jobs fall apart connector 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1056	1689.36	1695.94	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so the other thing is to see if we can uh get them to do a custom job and put it together oh i'm sure they would 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1057	1695.34	1697.05	E	Grad	s^na	-1	0	well and they probably want quantity oh i'm sure they would they would just charge us 
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1058	1697.08	1698.64	D	PhD	s	-1	0	well and they probably want quantity too 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1059	1697.32	1697.54	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	well and they probably want quantity 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1061	1699.09	1699.46	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	no 
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1060	1698.64	1698.8	D	PhD	%	-1	0	too 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1062	1700.06	1700.98	B	Professor	s^ar|s^ng	-1	0	the sturgis one 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1063	1701.15	1702.48	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	so it's so so my question 
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1064	1701.16	1701.46	D	PhD	b	-1	0	so it's 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1065	1702.28	1708.61	E	Grad	qy	-1	0	so so my question is should we go ahead and get that nine identical had noun it's ground mike 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1066	1708.9	1712.9	B	Professor	s^arp^co	-1	0	before having one come here and have some people try 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1067	1712.7	1712.99	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	try 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1068	1714.1	1716.72	B	Professor	s	-1	0	because there's no point in doing that it's not going to be any bad so why 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1069	1716.86	1720.96	E	Grad	qw^cs	+1	0	be any bad so why do we get one of these with the ground with a different headset 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1070	1721.57	1721.91	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1071	1722.41	1723.83	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	and see if and and see if that works 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1072	1723.54	1726.21	B	Professor	s^2^cs	-1	0	and see if it's preferable and if it is will get more comfort if that works yep 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1073	1725.48	1726.22	C	PhD	s	-1	0	if it is will get more comfort yep

Bmr012.C.dialogueact1076	1728.42	1730.84	C	PhD	s	-1	0	because i mean i think the microphones arcade right 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1077	1730.84	1731.87	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	arcade the uh right it's just they're not comfortable

Bmr012.B.dialogueact1080	1734.24	1734.66	B	Professor	b	-1	0	could make our own 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1081	1734.4	1736.24	C	PhD	s^cs^j.%-	-1	0	could make our own headbands and um and he said they 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1082	1735.98	1739.61	E	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	headbands and um and he said they don't have any of these in stock but they have them in l. a. and so will 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1083	1739.66	1741.37	E	Grad	s	-1	0	them in l. a. and so will take about a week to get here um

Bmr012.G.dialogueact1270	1974.31	1976.87	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but there are other groups of similar size have very little in know 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1271	1976.87	1978.67	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	have very little in know part of this is norma the group and all that they have various 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1272	1978.67	1981.0	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that's a great idea yeah i'd like to hear what group and all that they have various observations it would be fun i think 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1273	1980.4	1981.22	C	PhD	s^ba	+1	0	that's a great idea yeah i'd like to hear what it would be fun i think

Bmr012.B.dialogueact1278	1983.13	1988.31	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	so maybe we could they could have i mean more or less without us that and to do this and we should record it and then 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1277	1982.65	1982.89	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	they said say 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1279	1988.71	1993.77	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	it and then maybe one or two of them could come to one of these meetings and and could you could tell us given the status oh 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1280	1988.82	1989.03	G	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	it and then maybe one or two of them 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1281	1991.93	1992.78	E	Grad	s^2^cs	-1	0	meetings and and could you could tell given the status

Bmr012.C.dialogueact1288	1996.77	2000.54	C	PhD	s	-1	0	they will get to transcribe their own meaning but they also get paid for having a break and i think that's that would be weird what what yeah that's right yeah exactly 
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1287	1996.61	1997.22	E	Grad	s	-1	0	they will get to transcribe their that would be weird what what 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1286	1996.15	1996.5	G	Postdoc	qw.%-	-1	0	they will that would be weird what what 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1289	1998.42	1998.77	G	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	own meaning but they also yeah that's right 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1290	2000.54	2001.93	C	PhD	s	-1	0	a break and i think that's a good idea get yeah exactly yeah

Bmr012.G.dialogueact1295	2002.92	2003.07	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	them involved 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1296	2003.79	2005.15	C	PhD	fh|s^ba	-1	0	it's a great idea really sorry i have 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1297	2003.97	2004.14	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	it's a great idea 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1298	2004.47	2004.82	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	it's a great idea 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1299	2005.15	2006.58	C	PhD	s^fa.%--	-1	0	really sorry i have to 
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1300	2007.2	2008.48	C	PhD	s	-1	0	have to go 
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1301	2008.89	2009.24	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	and then i wanted 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1302	2009.5	2015.32	G	Postdoc	s^rt^t	-1	0	and then i wanted to also um say something about this this this uh john john discus visit tomorrow 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1303	2016.15	2018.87	G	Postdoc	s^rt	-1	0	and which is to say that we will be from nine to one 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1304	2019.12	2024.11	G	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	that i'm going too i i offer the organization allow him to uh adjusted if he wishes but to be basically 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1305	2024.11	2026.08	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but to be basically in three parts could stick part 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1306	2026.08	2030.5	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	could stick part coming first which would be basically the room engineering aspects um 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1307	2030.5	2031.85	G	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	um uh other things 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1308	2032.03	2033.95	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and he'll be also presenting what this is doing 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1309	2034.11	2036.27	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	uh then uh number two would be 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1310	2036.27	2039.47	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	uh number two would be sort of a they the transcription process so this would be a focus 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1311	2039.47	2044.25	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so this would be a focus on like pre segment patient and the modifications to them multi trans interface which allows more refined 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1312	2044.25	2048.25	G	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	which allows more refined in coding of the beginnings and ends of the overlapping segments which 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1313	2049.01	2050.31	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i did go parts doing and then 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1314	2050.79	2054.48	G	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	doing and then um and of course the peace imitation too has been doing and 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1315	2054.98	2056.38	G	Postdoc	fh|s.%--	-1	0	been doing and then um the third part would panic and he has 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1316	2056.38	2059.66	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	would panic and he has some stuff it's irrelevant with respect to nest and then the third 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1317	2059.66	2062.1	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	to nest and then the third one would be focus on transcription standards so at nist 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1318	2062.1	2067.87	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so at nist he's interested in this establishment of a global including standard i guess i would say and 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1319	2067.87	2068.45	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i guess i would say and i want to you know 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1320	2068.52	2069.04	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	i want to you know see what they're doing 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1321	2069.18	2069.29	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	see what they're doing 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1322	2069.58	2074.81	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	see what they're doing and also present what what we've chosen sars and and discuss that kind of thing 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1323	2075.97	2078.44	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and so but he's only hear chill chill one and actually we're 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1324	2078.44	2080.85	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	one and actually we're thinking of noon being uh lunchtime so basically 
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1325	2080.85	2084.28	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	uh lunchtime so basically hoping that we can get as much of the stunts possible before
