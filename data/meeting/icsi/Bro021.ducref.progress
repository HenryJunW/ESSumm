This week , speaker mn007 has mostly been focusing on trying different approaches to on-line normalization , but making little impact on results.
He has also been playing with thresholding , effectively adding white noise to the data , but again with minimal affect.
Also making little improvement is fn002's work with Vectorial Taylor series , as a means of dealing with noise.
Mn052 has been adding Wiener filtering to the aurora task , and is thinking about future work on subspace.
Speaker me026 has been investigating phase normalization , and the possibility of adding spectral subtraction to an existing system.
Speaker me006 is still planning some cheating experiments to investigate features for recognition , alongside preparing for his quals.
also , the groups submission to the Eurospeech conference has been accepted.
