Bed008.B.dialogueact13	285.998	286.258	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	uh there you go 
Bed008.B.dialogueact14	286.428	286.878	B	Professor	s	-1	0	there you go 
Bed008.B.dialogueact15	293.319	295.509	B	Professor	s^t^tc.%--	-1	0	yeah so my idea for today we can 
Bed008.B.dialogueact16	295.509	300.317	B	Professor	s	-1	0	today we can uh decide that that isn't the right thing to do was 
Bed008.B.dialogueact17	300.697	309.277	B	Professor	s^t	-1	0	do was you who it it'll spend at least part of the time trying to build the influence links you know which 
Bed008.B.dialogueact18	309.437	315.727	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	you know which sets of things are uh relevant to which decisions 
Bed008.B.dialogueact19	317.396	326.33	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and actually i had uh specifics justin to start first with the past ones 
Bed008.B.dialogueact20	327.11	331.12	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	the database ones being in some sense less interesting to us although probably have 
Bed008.B.dialogueact21	331.12	332.83	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	although probably have to be done 
Bed008.B.dialogueact22	333.62	335.86	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and so to do that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact23	336.33	339.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so there's and the idea was we were going to do two things sure my gone 
Bed008.C.dialogueact24	337.807	338.877	C	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	the idea was we were going to do two things sure my gone 
Bed008.B.dialogueact25	343.746	344.096	B	Professor	h	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.B.dialogueact26	344.616	345.326	B	Professor	s^bk|%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.B.dialogueact27	349.039	349.099	B	Professor	b	-1	0	we're going to do two 
Bed008.B.dialogueact28	349.409	350.529	B	Professor	s	+1	0	we're going to do two things one 
Bed008.B.dialogueact29	350.819	357.819	B	Professor	s	+1	3	things one of which is just lay out the influence structure of what we think influences what 
Bed008.D.dialogueact30	351.034	351.284	D	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	of which is 
Bed008.B.dialogueact31	358.119	362.129	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and then as they uh real separate but related to ask uh pacific 
Bed008.B.dialogueact32	362.479	374.314	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh pacific buster and i were going to try to decide what claims of belief nodes are needed in order to do what we what we need to do once 
Bed008.B.dialogueact33	374.314	374.684	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	to do once 
Bed008.B.dialogueact34	375.094	387.203	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	so but then we should sort of have all of the um design of what influences what done before we decide exactly how to computed 
Bed008.B.dialogueact35	388.403	390.823	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	so i didn't get a chance to look at all the yeah yeah that's that's 
Bed008.D.dialogueact36	390.446	391.636	D	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	all the yeah great yeah that's that's tough stuff 
Bed008.B.dialogueact37	391.708	391.978	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	great tough stuff 
Bed008.B.dialogueact38	392.138	399.866	B	Professor	s^co^t	-1	0	okay so let's start with thee uh believe that's general influence stuff and then 
Bed008.B.dialogueact39	399.866	404.226	B	Professor	s^t	-1	0	influence stuff and then we'll then we'll also at some point break and talk about the techie stuff 
Bed008.E.dialogueact40	405.839	408.981	E	Grad	s^cs.%--	-1	0	well okay like a girl does 
Bed008.E.dialogueact41	409.611	411.461	E	Grad	s^t	-1	0	i think we conduct discuss everything first 
Bed008.E.dialogueact42	412.001	417.151	E	Grad	s	-1	0	of all this i i knew from um basically this has to be there right um 
Bed008.E.dialogueact43	417.151	417.491	E	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right um 
Bed008.E.dialogueact44	417.801	418.611	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	oh right um 
Bed008.B.dialogueact45	419.02	420.32	B	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	you're going to go there or not yeah so what given 
Bed008.B.dialogueact46	420.32	421.85	B	Professor	fh|s.%-	-1	0	not yeah so what given given uh 
Bed008.E.dialogueact47	420.946	426.866	E	Grad	qrr.%-	-1	0	not yeah so what right true given given uh uh not friends whereas the castle the decision is this person went to go there or is it just 
Bed008.B.dialogueact48	426.278	426.548	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right true or is it just 
Bed008.B.dialogueact49	426.738	426.988	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right true or is it just 
Bed008.B.dialogueact50	427.378	428.108	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	does have to be there 
Bed008.B.dialogueact52	429.321	431.111	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	i'm sure we'll find more as we go that 
Bed008.E.dialogueact51	429.012	429.482	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	i'm sure we'll find 
Bed008.E.dialogueact53	430.895	431.715	E	Grad	b^rt	-1	0	more as we go that 
Bed008.E.dialogueact54	433.019	436.929	E	Grad	s	+1	0	go there in the first base and not this definitely uh one of the basic once we can 
Bed008.E.dialogueact55	436.929	439.734	E	Grad	s^cs^rt	-1	0	of the basic once we can start but that's 
Bed008.E.dialogueact56	440.144	440.934	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	interesting 
Bed008.E.dialogueact57	442.32	446.991	E	Grad	fh|qy^rt	-1	0	um basically to a false 
Bed008.E.dialogueact58	447.621	450.349	E	Grad	qrr.%-	-1	0	well maybe but that's 
Bed008.B.dialogueact59	451.808	452.198	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	well 
Bed008.D.dialogueact60	451.921	452.221	D	Grad	qw^bu^rt	-1	0	well 
Bed008.E.dialogueact61	452.95	453.29	E	Grad	qw	-1	0	go there but 
Bed008.A.dialogueact62	453.544	454.044	A	Grad	s	-1	0	go there so but right 
Bed008.E.dialogueact63	453.68	454.89	E	Grad	fg	-1	0	go there so but right 
Bed008.B.dialogueact64	454.436	456.506	B	Professor	fg|s.%-	-1	0	so there's this question about right here we 
Bed008.E.dialogueact65	455.11	455.82	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	there's this question here we 
Bed008.E.dialogueact66	457.228	459.258	E	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	we actually got just probably the cheese fries for each 
Bed008.B.dialogueact67	458.512	458.832	B	Professor	b	-1	0	probably the cheese 
Bed008.E.dialogueact68	459.258	459.558	E	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	fries for each 
Bed008.E.dialogueact69	459.558	460.708	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	fries for each down here 
Bed008.B.dialogueact70	461.697	462.657	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	when were you when we're not so 
Bed008.B.dialogueact72	462.987	463.557	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	you when we're not so it's eleven states 
Bed008.E.dialogueact71	462.717	463.047	E	Grad	b	-1	0	you when we're not so it's eleven states 
Bed008.B.dialogueact73	463.937	470.637	B	Professor	s^df:s	-1	0	it's eleven states the reason it might not be true or false you is that we didn't have this idea of when 
Bed008.B.dialogueact74	471.347	475.557	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so it's you know a current furniture and so forth and so on or not at all right 
Bed008.E.dialogueact75	475.035	476.415	E	Grad	b	-1	0	at all right and 
Bed008.B.dialogueact76	475.857	476.197	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	at all right and 
Bed008.B.dialogueact77	476.817	483.631	B	Professor	fh|s.%--:qy	-1	0	and so that's a decision would be do we want and that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact78	484.351	485.961	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so you quit have two different things you could do you 
Bed008.B.dialogueact79	485.961	489.191	B	Professor	s^cs:s	+1	0	different things you could do you could have all those values forego there or you to 
Bed008.B.dialogueact80	489.191	494.746	B	Professor	s^cs:qw	+1	0	or you to go there be binary and given that you're going there friend how 
Bed008.E.dialogueact81	493.834	494.684	E	Grad	s^2:qw	-1	0	friend how 
Bed008.E.dialogueact82	494.684	495.014	E	Grad	s^2:qw	-1	0	yeah it's how why 
Bed008.B.dialogueact83	495.516	495.716	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah it's why 
Bed008.B.dialogueact85	495.876	496.356	B	Professor	s^2	-1	0	yeah it's over so why 
Bed008.E.dialogueact84	495.822	496.112	E	Grad	s^2:qw	-1	0	yeah it's over so why 
Bed008.B.dialogueact87	496.816	497.616	B	Professor	s^co.%--	-1	0	over so let we'll 
Bed008.E.dialogueact86	496.502	496.672	E	Grad	b	-1	0	over so 
Bed008.B.dialogueact88	497.756	498.326	B	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	let we'll see 
Bed008.E.dialogueact89	498.377	498.947	E	Grad	b^rt	-1	0	see 
Bed008.A.dialogueact90	499.375	505.524	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	i mean it seems that you could um it seems that those things would be logically independent like you would want 
Bed008.A.dialogueact91	505.524	507.994	A	Grad	s^cs^e	-1	0	independent like you would want to have some separate a binary go 
Bed008.A.dialogueact92	507.994	510.164	A	Grad	s:s	-1	0	separate a binary go there and then uh the possibility of how to go there because 
Bed008.A.dialogueact93	510.164	510.714	A	Grad	s^df.%-	-1	0	because 
Bed008.B.dialogueact94	511.37	513.09	B	Professor	s^aa|s^co	-1	0	okay let's let's start that way 
Bed008.A.dialogueact95	514.482	519.272	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because you know it might be easy to figure out that this person's going to need more film eventually from their and spot it's 
Bed008.A.dialogueact96	519.272	523.442	A	Grad	s^df^e	-1	0	spot it's much more complex to a query when would be the most appropriate time 
Bed008.E.dialogueact97	519.856	520.616	E	Grad	b	-1	0	spot it's much more complex to 
Bed008.E.dialogueact98	523.116	523.986	E	Grad	b	-1	0	time 
Bed008.E.dialogueact99	524.827	525.167	E	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.E.dialogueact100	526.461	531.294	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and so that's got to come up with some initial things one could surf so who is 
Bed008.E.dialogueact101	531.294	532.784	E	Grad	qh^rt	-1	0	so who is the user 
Bed008.E.dialogueact102	533.545	535.585	E	Grad	s:s	+1	0	everything that is user comes the use immortal everything that 
Bed008.E.dialogueact103	535.585	538.275	E	Grad	s:s	+1	0	use immortal everything that a situation comes in the situation one way 
Bed008.E.dialogueact104	539.065	541.021	E	Grad	s	-1	0	should be care but when 
Bed008.E.dialogueact105	541.671	543.951	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	but when it comes to sort of writing down 
Bed008.E.dialogueact106	544.081	545.981	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	when you when you do these things 
Bed008.E.dialogueact107	546.421	546.981	E	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	that you're 
Bed008.E.dialogueact108	548.284	552.95	E	Grad	s	-1	0	you sort of have to add right the value is this can take 
Bed008.B.dialogueact109	553.416	553.716	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.E.dialogueact110	554.376	561.566	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and here i was really in some sometimes it was really sort of standing in front of a wall feeding very stupid because 
Bed008.E.dialogueact111	561.566	564.725	E	Grad	s	-1	0	stupid because um in this case it's pretty simple but 
Bed008.E.dialogueact112	564.725	567.925	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	pretty simple but as we will see the other ones 
Bed008.E.dialogueact113	568.859	574.103	E	Grad	s:qw	-1	0	for example if it's a running budgets so what other discrete values or running budgets 
Bed008.E.dialogueact114	576.823	579.263	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so maybe my understanding there's too impoverished 
Bed008.A.dialogueact115	579.764	580.114	A	Grad	b	-1	0	no okay not right 
Bed008.B.dialogueact117	580.203	580.753	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	no okay not right 
Bed008.E.dialogueact116	580.196	584.656	E	Grad	qw	-1	0	no okay not right here that this is something that number that could keeps on changing 
Bed008.E.dialogueact118	585.464	585.854	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	but okay 
Bed008.E.dialogueact119	589.314	590.314	E	Grad	qy^d^f^rt	-1	0	this is understandable 
Bed008.A.dialogueact121	591.815	592.235	A	Grad	s^aa^rt	-1	0	yes for here 
Bed008.C.dialogueact120	591.36	591.62	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yes 
Bed008.E.dialogueact122	592.741	594.011	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	so have you seen this before all to for here for example 
Bed008.B.dialogueact123	593.451	596.161	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	uh no but so have you seen this before all to these that things for example 
Bed008.A.dialogueact124	596.25	596.8	A	Grad	h|s^ar	-1	0	uh no but 
Bed008.A.dialogueact125	596.8	598.04	A	Grad	s^e^rt	-1	0	uh no but i think i'm following it 
Bed008.A.dialogueact126	599.43	599.77	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	so far so here's the 
Bed008.E.dialogueact127	599.483	604.753	E	Grad	s	+1	1	so far so here's the the we had that the user sponsored me influence the outcome of decisions

Bed008.B.dialogueact149	641.93	642.11	B	Professor	b	-1	0	there this 
Bed008.E.dialogueact150	642.75	643.16	E	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah there this 
Bed008.B.dialogueact151	643.796	652.296	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	yeah so keen what's behind this is actually a program that will once you feel all this and actually solve your belief that for you and stuff so this is not just 
Bed008.A.dialogueact152	649.548	649.828	A	Grad	b	-1	0	and actually 
Bed008.B.dialogueact153	652.296	653.536	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so this is not just displayed this is actually 
Bed008.B.dialogueact154	653.536	663.99	B	Professor	s	+1	1	displayed this is actually a two week to me simulator that will if we eat all the right things will wind up with the functioning belief in it at the other end 
Bed008.A.dialogueact155	661.227	661.617	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	wind up with the 
Bed008.A.dialogueact156	664.246	664.496	A	Grad	s^bk^r	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.E.dialogueact157	667.54	669.23	E	Grad	s	-1	0	well and it's so simple even i can use it 
Bed008.A.dialogueact158	669.91	670.95	A	Grad	s^fe^j	-1	0	well that is simple it 
Bed008.E.dialogueact159	672.431	673.531	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	okay so here was okay 
Bed008.E.dialogueact160	673.531	680.551	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	does matter was okay i can think of people it would be and she's irish or spendy we can even have a finer scale moderate to cheap doesn't not 
Bed008.B.dialogueact161	679.52	679.97	B	Professor	s^aa^m	-1	0	does matter moderate 
Bed008.E.dialogueact162	680.551	680.961	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	to cheap doesn't not 
Bed008.E.dialogueact163	681.461	682.041	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	agree that but here 
Bed008.E.dialogueact164	682.411	686.33	E	Grad	s	-1	0	but here i wasn't sure what to ride in 
Bed008.B.dialogueact165	687.14	687.45	B	Professor	s^co.%-	-1	0	let's 
Bed008.B.dialogueact166	688.1	688.35	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	well 
Bed008.D.dialogueact167	688.86	692.39	D	Grad	s	-1	0	well i mean you've ridden didn't even in what uh seems to be quiet like what it's just 
Bed008.D.dialogueact168	692.39	694.17	D	Grad	qw^rt	-1	0	like what it's just is you want 
Bed008.E.dialogueact169	695.88	697.55	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so here's here's if that's permissible and i'm happy 
Bed008.B.dialogueact170	697.1	699.25	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	so here's here's what's permissible is happy 
Bed008.B.dialogueact171	699.63	711.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	is that you kind of range so that the um um the value of that he's going to have to be updated now it's not a belief 
Bed008.B.dialogueact172	711.43	712.61	B	Professor	s	-1	0	updated now it's not a belief update right it's you 
Bed008.B.dialogueact173	712.61	712.78	B	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	update right it's you 
Bed008.B.dialogueact174	712.78	714.93	B	Professor	s	+1	0	update right it's you took some action just spent money and stuff of 
Bed008.B.dialogueact175	714.93	718.64	B	Professor	s	-1	0	spent money and stuff of the update of that you have to be essentially startled to the belief that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact177	719.83	720.02	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right and 
Bed008.E.dialogueact176	719.608	719.818	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right 
Bed008.B.dialogueact178	720.82	727.63	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and then what you're going to need is um four things it influences with 
Bed008.B.dialogueact179	727.83	729.91	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	with what seats doesn't want anything 
Bed008.B.dialogueact180	730.63	739.39	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	and if it doesn't fluent anything then you're going to need something that converts from the the number here it to something that's relevant to the decision there so 
Bed008.B.dialogueact181	739.86	744.71	B	Professor	s	-1	0	there so it could be right there be different ranges that are relevant for different decisions or or but for the moment 
Bed008.B.dialogueact182	744.71	754.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	or but for the moment this is just a no that is conditioned externally and might influence various things 
Bed008.E.dialogueact183	754.31	755.02	E	Grad	b	-1	0	things 
Bed008.E.dialogueact184	756.48	758.92	E	Grad	fg|s.%--	-1	0	this is where um okay 
Bed008.E.dialogueact185	758.99	759.71	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	um okay anyways 
Bed008.E.dialogueact186	760.16	761.33	E	Grad	s^co	-1	0	that's 
Bed008.B.dialogueact187	762.26	762.73	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	that's fine 
Bed008.B.dialogueact188	763.19	764.15	B	Professor	s^co^tc	-1	0	okay and uh so 
Bed008.E.dialogueact189	763.89	767.43	E	Grad	fg|%--	-1	0	yeah the thing is that um every time okay and uh so so but 
Bed008.D.dialogueact190	766.95	769.94	D	Grad	s	+1	0	yeah the thing is that um every time that updated believes that the property it but so but 
Bed008.D.dialogueact191	769.94	774.65	D	Grad	qr	+1	1	that the property it but the the question is do you do you want to propagates movies every single time it's updated ernie when we need to 
Bed008.B.dialogueact192	775.41	776.74	B	Professor	fg|s^ba	-1	0	yeah that's a good question 
Bed008.B.dialogueact193	777.42	780.67	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	and um doesn't have a lazy mode 
Bed008.B.dialogueact194	783.15	783.79	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	i don't remember 
Bed008.D.dialogueact195	783.18	783.61	D	Grad	h	-1	0	i don't remember 
Bed008.D.dialogueact196	784.9	792.325	D	Grad	s	-1	0	right it's probably does yeah what track well i mean and she needs thing there was this thing there was this um altered like probably entrances it suggests that uh doesn't happen 
Bed008.B.dialogueact197	787.87	788.14	B	Professor	s^bk^fe	-1	0	right was this um altered like probably 
Bed008.B.dialogueact198	790.081	790.261	B	Professor	b	-1	0	it's probably that uh 
Bed008.B.dialogueact199	790.511	791.551	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it's probably does yeah that uh doesn't happen 
Bed008.B.dialogueact200	791.941	792.291	B	Professor	b	-1	0	does yeah what track doesn't happen 
Bed008.B.dialogueact201	792.631	793.641	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	what track it down but uh 
Bed008.B.dialogueact202	793.641	795.111	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it down but uh but 
Bed008.B.dialogueact204	804.322	806.472	B	Professor	s^t1.%--	-1	0	and and i think actually um uh so that's 
Bed008.E.dialogueact203	803.859	804.989	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	and and i uh just uh so that's 
Bed008.E.dialogueact205	806.19	806.48	E	Grad	s^fe^t1	-1	0	um 
Bed008.B.dialogueact206	807.75	819.8	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	one of the items for thee um user home base uh should be uh especially non local 
Bed008.B.dialogueact207	820.55	823.02	B	Professor	s	-1	0	they're only there for the day and they don't have a place to stay

Bed008.E.dialogueact294	1017.52	1017.7	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah is it that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact296	1018.75	1022.5	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and the and the third thing we talked about with something from the discourse 
Bed008.E.dialogueact297	1024.46	1025.64	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	what is mentioned before 
Bed008.B.dialogueact298	1027.6	1028.91	B	Professor	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	okay so this is 
Bed008.B.dialogueact299	1029.8	1032.61	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	right so what what we seem to need here this is why 
Bed008.B.dialogueact300	1032.61	1035.31	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	need here this is why it starts getting into the technical stuff we had 
Bed008.A.dialogueact301	1035.45	1035.79	A	Grad	b	-1	0	stuff we had 
Bed008.B.dialogueact302	1035.6	1039.01	B	Professor	s	+1	2	stuff we had been designing is there were three intermediate nodes 
Bed008.B.dialogueact303	1040.32	1050.94	B	Professor	fh|s^e	+1	2	uh which were the end point decision as seen from the uh user model has seen from the on college in a scene from the discourse 
Bed008.B.dialogueact304	1051.74	1052.84	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so each of those 
Bed008.B.dialogueact305	1053.82	1054.72	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	we had design now we can 
Bed008.B.dialogueact306	1054.72	1055.73	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	had design now we can change design to design 
Bed008.B.dialogueact307	1055.73	1057.52	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	change design to design we had was there was a 
Bed008.B.dialogueact308	1057.66	1065.91	B	Professor	s	+1	0	was there was a decision with the same three outcomes uh based on just those three separate considerations 
Bed008.A.dialogueact309	1061.06	1061.49	A	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.B.dialogueact310	1066.72	1081.79	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so we wanted to do that would have to put in uh three intermediate nodes every daughter kept it very simple 
Bed008.E.dialogueact311	1068.44	1070.63	E	Grad	s^cs^rt	-1	0	would every daughter kept it very simple 
Bed008.A.dialogueact312	1071.2	1071.42	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	have to put 
Bed008.B.dialogueact313	1082.8	1089.07	B	Professor	s^co:qw	-1	0	then what you and i have to talk about is okay if we doing that then they get combined somehow uh how do you combined but there are 
Bed008.B.dialogueact314	1089.4	1091.88	B	Professor	s	+1	0	but there are undoubtedly going to be more things to worry about 
Bed008.E.dialogueact315	1092.7	1095.06	E	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	so this was just that for this one more thing 
Bed008.D.dialogueact316	1094.39	1094.88	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	one more thing 
Bed008.B.dialogueact317	1096.08	1096.15	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.E.dialogueact318	1103.3	1113.7	E	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	so that's or know or uh and in toronto so they could gram everything that could contribute to weather person wants interview or approach something 
Bed008.B.dialogueact319	1113.57	1114.55	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so this is this something 
Bed008.B.dialogueact320	1114.55	1122.23	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so this is this is mm my food here means the same as in point okay the snow as and poured 
Bed008.E.dialogueact321	1119.49	1121.41	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	means the same as in point the snow as and poured 
Bed008.C.dialogueact322	1122.2	1122.55	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	okay 
Bed008.B.dialogueact323	1123.07	1124.51	B	Professor	fg|qy^rt	-1	0	one which we change that just rename that 
Bed008.E.dialogueact324	1123.09	1124.83	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	one which we change that just rename that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact325	1142.62	1142.89	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.B.dialogueact326	1147.07	1148.01	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but that was actually yeah unfortunately 
Bed008.B.dialogueact327	1148.01	1158.63	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	unfortunately that was a um of an intermediate version that's 
Bed008.B.dialogueact328	1158.63	1162.09	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i ask about version that's i don't think what we would currently do 
Bed008.A.dialogueact329	1162.46	1165.67	A	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	i ask about slurred and angry as inputs to this 
Bed008.B.dialogueact330	1167.93	1168.8	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	well why that's it like the 
Bed008.A.dialogueact331	1168.6	1169.2	A	Grad	qw^rt	-1	0	well why it like they're either true or false the president 
Bed008.D.dialogueact332	1168.66	1170.35	D	Grad	s	-1	0	well why it like they're either true or false and the president 
Bed008.E.dialogueact333	1168.79	1169.73	E	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	well why it like they're either true or false the president 
Bed008.A.dialogueact335	1170.67	1171.0	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	and they uh 
Bed008.D.dialogueact334	1170.35	1172.16	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and they uh 
Bed008.D.dialogueact336	1173.44	1173.83	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	oh i see 
Bed008.C.dialogueact337	1174.32	1180.25	C	Grad	s	+1	0	okay drunk if the if if the person talking is angry or slurs or speech and not be tired or you know 
Bed008.A.dialogueact338	1178.41	1178.81	A	Grad	b	-1	0	and not 
Bed008.A.dialogueact339	1180.22	1180.6	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay drunk know 
Bed008.A.dialogueact340	1180.89	1181.24	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	okay drunk know therefore 
Bed008.D.dialogueact341	1181.9	1182.24	D	Grad	qo^d.%--	-1	0	therefore 
Bed008.C.dialogueact342	1183.24	1185.24	C	Grad	h|s.%-	-1	0	less likely to and you know possibly uh 
Bed008.A.dialogueact343	1185.41	1186.53	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	less likely to enter 
Bed008.C.dialogueact344	1187.21	1187.55	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	mm mm some yeah uh 
Bed008.A.dialogueact347	1187.79	1188.28	A	Grad	b	-1	0	mm mm yeah that's that some yeah uh unless like the you 
Bed008.C.dialogueact346	1187.73	1188.05	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	mm mm yeah that's that some yeah uh unless like the you 
Bed008.D.dialogueact345	1187.68	1188.96	D	Grad	s^nd	+1	0	mm mm yeah that's that some yeah uh unless like the you 
Bed008.B.dialogueact348	1188.29	1188.39	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah that's that unless like the you 
Bed008.B.dialogueact349	1188.63	1189.57	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah that's that seems to be yeah so unless like the you 
Bed008.B.dialogueact350	1189.57	1189.86	B	Professor	b	-1	0	seems to be yeah so 
Bed008.B.dialogueact351	1189.86	1197.82	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	seems to be yeah so to do is is get this down to what we think is actually likely to to be uh a strong influence 
Bed008.A.dialogueact352	1197.72	1198.05	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	influence but yeah that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact354	1198.75	1200.04	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but yeah that was what he had in mind 
Bed008.D.dialogueact353	1198.69	1199.22	D	Grad	b	-1	0	but yeah that was what he had in mind 
Bed008.B.dialogueact355	1205.22	1210.48	B	Professor	s^co.%--:qw	-1	0	so let's think about this this question of how're we want to handle 
Bed008.B.dialogueact356	1211.01	1211.91	B	Professor	s	-1	0	the two separate things one 
Bed008.B.dialogueact357	1211.91	1212.4	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	the two separate things one is 
Bed008.B.dialogueact358	1213.08	1214.21	B	Professor	fh|s^bsc	-1	0	uh these two one is how 
Bed008.B.dialogueact359	1214.44	1219.15	B	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	two one is how do we want to handle the notion of the on apology 
Bed008.B.dialogueact360	1220.25	1226.09	B	Professor	s.%--:qy	-1	0	now what we talked about this is another technical thing great is uh can we arrange so that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact361	1227.06	1227.9	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i think we can't 
Bed008.B.dialogueact362	1228.32	1231.91	B	Professor	s	+1	0	so that the belief in itself has properties 
Bed008.B.dialogueact363	1232.6	1236.18	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and the properties are filled in uh from on on polls yet it's so the let's 
Bed008.B.dialogueact364	1236.42	1241.24	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	so the let's take the case of the uh the standpoint thing the notion 
Bed008.B.dialogueact365	1241.57	1248.53	B	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	the notion was it that if you had a few key properties like is this a tours site you know some kind of landmark is 
Bed008.B.dialogueact366	1248.82	1250.47	B	Professor	s^e:qy	-1	0	is it a place of business um 
Bed008.B.dialogueact367	1250.47	1253.35	B	Professor	fh|s^e:qy	-1	0	um is it something you physically quit enter okay 
Bed008.A.dialogueact368	1253.5	1254.1	A	Grad	b	-1	0	okay et cetera 
Bed008.B.dialogueact369	1254.08	1254.35	B	Professor	qy^d^f	-1	0	et cetera 
Bed008.B.dialogueact370	1254.35	1254.72	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	et cetera 
Bed008.B.dialogueact371	1254.72	1259.68	B	Professor	s	+1	0	et cetera that had to be certain properties that would fit in into the decision that that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact372	1260.16	1266.39	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and and again it's the heart of the i outer controlling conditioning of this thing those would be set so that some 
Bed008.B.dialogueact373	1266.39	1276.94	B	Professor	s^df	+1	0	so that some somehow someone would find this word look it up in neon pathology pull out these properties put it in two the belief in that and then the decision would flow 
Bed008.A.dialogueact374	1277.05	1277.4	A	Grad	b	-1	0	no 
Bed008.B.dialogueact375	1278.18	1278.86	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.E.dialogueact376	1279.29	1289.4	E	Grad	s	-1	0	seems to me that we sort of it in bought it about and embedded a lot of these things we had and they're pretty risky and and and some of the other final decisions on here for example 
Bed008.E.dialogueact377	1289.4	1295.81	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	right right on here for example if we would know that this thing is exhibiting something um if 
Bed008.B.dialogueact378	1292.33	1292.67	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right thing is exhibiting 
Bed008.B.dialogueact379	1294.4	1294.59	B	Professor	b	-1	0	right 
Bed008.E.dialogueact380	1295.99	1298.77	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	um if it's exhibiting it's outside is that mark 
Bed008.B.dialogueact382	1299.28	1299.47	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah meaning more likely to 
Bed008.E.dialogueact381	1299.08	1300.88	E	Grad	s^e^rt	-1	0	yeah meaning more likely to give you what 
Bed008.B.dialogueact383	1301.1	1301.3	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yep if it is exhibiting 
Bed008.E.dialogueact384	1301.44	1307.09	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	yep if it is exhibiting pictures source contras and stuff like this then it's more likely to be and church 
Bed008.B.dialogueact385	1308.46	1310.35	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	i i that's i think that's completely right and 
Bed008.B.dialogueact386	1311.02	1314.17	B	Professor	fh|s^ba	-1	0	um i think it's good right 
Bed008.B.dialogueact387	1314.53	1314.84	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right 
Bed008.B.dialogueact388	1315.2	1323.84	B	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	so what what that says is that we might be able to uh take and 
Bed008.B.dialogueact389	1325.93	1326.86	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	in particular so 
Bed008.B.dialogueact390	1326.86	1333.22	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	particular so so the ones we talked about were uh exhibiting and selling accessible 
Bed008.E.dialogueact391	1333.72	1334.69	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	accessible the too 
Bed008.B.dialogueact392	1335.16	1336.2	B	Professor	s^nd.%-	-1	0	no sensibility man's if it's 
Bed008.E.dialogueact393	1336.63	1339.25	E	Grad	s	-1	0	if it's close to one probably won't answer if it's 
Bed008.E.dialogueact394	1339.76	1345.74	E	Grad	s	-1	0	if it's not accessible to the tourist ever the likelihood of that person actually wanting to answer it given 
Bed008.B.dialogueact395	1342.98	1343.35	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	ever the likelihood 
Bed008.E.dialogueact396	1345.74	1347.07	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	all right let to answer it given that you know so of course 
Bed008.B.dialogueact397	1347.38	1347.67	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	all right let 
Bed008.B.dialogueact398	1347.83	1348.9	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	all right let me suggest there's 
Bed008.B.dialogueact399	1349.35	1354.85	B	Professor	fh|qy	-1	0	uh well could you move those up about halfway 
Bed008.B.dialogueact400	1357.86	1361.75	B	Professor	fh|s^e	-1	0	uh the ones that use and selling i guess 
Bed008.E.dialogueact401	1363.26	1364.38	E	Grad	s^na	-1	0	yeah all on of these if it's fixing 
Bed008.E.dialogueact402	1364.38	1369.41	E	Grad	s	+1	1	these if it's fixing things setting things or servicing things 
Bed008.B.dialogueact403	1369.93	1370.21	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	so here's things 
Bed008.B.dialogueact404	1370.68	1373.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so here's here's what it looks like to me 
Bed008.B.dialogueact405	1374.14	1387.07	B	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	is that you wanted intermediate structure which uh is essentially the order of uh for this purpose of of uh selling fixing or servicing so 
Bed008.B.dialogueact406	1388.03	1390.21	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	that it's uh 
Bed008.B.dialogueact407	1391.59	1393.63	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that is for certain purposes it becomes important but 
Bed008.B.dialogueact408	1393.63	1398.79	B	Professor	s	+1	0	important but for this kind of purpose uh one of these places is quite like the other 
Bed008.B.dialogueact409	1401.39	1401.94	B	Professor	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	system right 
Bed008.B.dialogueact410	1403.0	1403.49	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	we get if we visit basically 
Bed008.C.dialogueact411	1403.08	1403.3	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	we get if we visit basically 
Bed008.C.dialogueact412	1403.3	1407.09	C	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	we get if we yes so if well visit basically just merging those for just to take event points decision 
Bed008.B.dialogueact413	1403.82	1404.14	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	we get if we visit basically just merging those 
Bed008.B.dialogueact414	1407.09	1407.39	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	so if well 
Bed008.C.dialogueact415	1407.09	1407.22	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	so if well 
Bed008.A.dialogueact417	1407.62	1408.01	A	Grad	b	-1	0	so if well i maybe more than then 
Bed008.B.dialogueact416	1407.57	1409.74	B	Professor	s^arp	-1	0	so if well i maybe more than then point decision so the idea 
Bed008.B.dialogueact418	1409.74	1413.13	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	point decision so the idea would be that you might want to merge those three this 
Bed008.E.dialogueact419	1413.84	1414.28	E	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	yeah so this thing 
Bed008.B.dialogueact420	1414.49	1414.62	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah so thing 
Bed008.B.dialogueact421	1414.62	1417.14	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah so it's uh selling fixing in servicing what um thing 
Bed008.E.dialogueact422	1414.85	1415.08	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah so it's uh selling thing 
Bed008.D.dialogueact423	1417.26	1420.13	D	Grad	qy^rt	+1	0	what um so you those is true or false 
Bed008.B.dialogueact425	1420.79	1425.22	B	Professor	h|s	-1	0	uh well it's eighty years where it gets a little tricky uh 
Bed008.D.dialogueact424	1420.69	1421.01	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.B.dialogueact426	1425.92	1428.09	B	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	uh from the belief that point of view it is from another 
Bed008.B.dialogueact427	1428.43	1434.58	B	Professor	s	-1	0	from another point of view of course it's interesting it's it's important know what it's selling for servicing and so forth so 
Bed008.A.dialogueact428	1432.82	1433.11	A	Grad	b	-1	0	selling for servicing and so 
Bed008.B.dialogueact430	1434.9	1440.29	B	Professor	s^bs	+1	0	forth so for this decision it's just uh tour falls 
Bed008.D.dialogueact429	1434.56	1434.85	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	forth so 
Bed008.D.dialogueact431	1436.61	1436.81	D	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.B.dialogueact432	1441.45	1444.83	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and and it is a case where they were seems just what you want 
Bed008.D.dialogueact433	1446.6	1446.84	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.B.dialogueact434	1447.53	1454.7	B	Professor	s.%-	+1	0	that that if any of those things is true then it's the kind of place that you uh 
Bed008.E.dialogueact435	1455.78	1456.94	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	i'm more likely to enter 
Bed008.B.dialogueact436	1457.14	1458.18	B	Professor	s^aa^m	+1	0	are more likely dinner so you just want to have them 
Bed008.D.dialogueact437	1458.33	1461.56	D	Grad	qy^cs^rt	-1	0	you quite yeah let's do that so you just want to have them all pointing to a 
Bed008.B.dialogueact438	1460.0	1460.55	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	quite yeah

Bed008.B.dialogueact445	1475.18	1476.17	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	so i made it but is it the kind 
Bed008.E.dialogueact446	1475.34	1479.7	E	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	well @reject@ so i made it but is it the kind of object that sells takes a services things 
Bed008.B.dialogueact447	1479.26	1481.92	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	well @reject@ unless see was values are things i 
Bed008.E.dialogueact448	1482.02	1483.88	E	Grad	s	-1	0	just created it depending on so far 
Bed008.B.dialogueact449	1484.92	1486.76	B	Professor	s	-1	0	oh well let's not objects we called 
Bed008.B.dialogueact450	1486.76	1487.68	B	Professor	s^e^rt	-1	0	not objects we called them entities right 
Bed008.B.dialogueact452	1487.68	1487.88	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	them entities right

Bed008.B.dialogueact454	1509.2	1510.19	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	that they put commercial yeah 
Bed008.E.dialogueact455	1510.8	1510.99	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah 
Bed008.E.dialogueact456	1511.19	1512.27	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	oh i was just going to commercial 
Bed008.E.dialogueact457	1512.47	1515.42	E	Grad	s^cs.%-	-1	0	or does it is to commercial action insides recruit or 
Bed008.B.dialogueact458	1515.01	1516.95	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	does it is a commercial or

Bed008.E.dialogueact461	1527.39	1530.11	E	Grad	s^2^cs	-1	0	well successful i number westies accessible that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact462	1529.21	1529.46	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	well accessible that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact463	1530.54	1532.01	B	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	successful i think is different but that's temper 
Bed008.B.dialogueact465	1532.35	1534.4	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but that's temper that they're very temporally whereas 
Bed008.E.dialogueact464	1531.95	1532.07	E	Grad	b	-1	0	think is different but that's temper 
Bed008.B.dialogueact466	1534.4	1537.19	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	whereas this is a 
Bed008.E.dialogueact467	1534.44	1535.19	E	Grad	b	-1	0	whereas this 
Bed008.C.dialogueact468	1538.25	1539.37	C	Grad	qw^rt	-1	0	what what a hotel fall under 
Bed008.B.dialogueact469	1541.54	1542.75	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i would call that a service but 
Bed008.B.dialogueact470	1542.75	1543.63	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	that a service but but i don't know 
Bed008.C.dialogueact471	1544.15	1545.37	C	Grad	qo^e^rt	-1	0	well i mean in terms of entertainment 
Bed008.B.dialogueact472	1546.96	1549.05	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	too well it's good i would again for this 
Bed008.B.dialogueact473	1549.05	1551.3	B	Professor	s	-1	0	again for this purpose i think it's commercial someplace 
Bed008.B.dialogueact474	1552.02	1553.88	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	you want to go in to do some kind of business 
Bed008.C.dialogueact475	1554.69	1554.91	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.D.dialogueact476	1556.9	1560.32	D	Grad	fg|qw^rt	-1	0	um what is it underscored t. the end of each of those things that if i um things 
Bed008.E.dialogueact477	1560.01	1561.34	E	Grad	h|s	-1	0	things some 
Bed008.E.dialogueact478	1561.88	1569.4	E	Grad	s	-1	0	some places that service things so things or fix things and it says acidic exhibit things 
Bed008.D.dialogueact479	1563.8	1564.18	D	Grad	b	-1	0	things so 
Bed008.D.dialogueact480	1565.82	1566.12	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	things or fix things and 
Bed008.D.dialogueact481	1569.51	1569.74	D	Grad	s^bk^r	-1	0	things 
Bed008.D.dialogueact482	1571.73	1573.16	D	Grad	s	-1	0	@reject@ i guess 
Bed008.A.dialogueact483	1574.55	1587.15	A	Grad	qy^bu^rt	+1	0	so we're derived thing um this uh this future of whether the the main action at this place happens inside or outside or what we're driving that from what kind of activities down there can you have 
Bed008.A.dialogueact484	1587.66	1590.88	A	Grad	qy^cs^rt	-1	0	can you have it as just a primitive future of the entity well you probably that's it that's a choice 
Bed008.B.dialogueact485	1589.97	1590.41	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	of the entity well you probably that's it that's a choice 
Bed008.B.dialogueact486	1590.41	1591.55	B	Professor	s	-1	0	entity probably that's it that's a choice 
Bed008.A.dialogueact487	1592.28	1592.53	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	so 
Bed008.B.dialogueact488	1592.34	1594.16	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	i mean it seems like it's much more so uh 
Bed008.A.dialogueact489	1594.1	1595.87	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	i mean it seems like it's much more reliable because 
Bed008.A.dialogueact490	1595.87	1598.42	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	reliable because you could have outdoor places that sell things and 
Bed008.A.dialogueact491	1598.42	1601.42	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and you know indoor places that do something else yeah the problem 
Bed008.B.dialogueact492	1600.85	1607.18	B	Professor	s^arp	-1	0	places that do something else yeah the problem with it is that it's sort of putting in the future just for one decision now but we may wined 
Bed008.A.dialogueact493	1601.42	1601.62	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	else the problem 
Bed008.A.dialogueact495	1607.64	1608.0	A	Grad	b	-1	0	now but we may wined up having to do that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact494	1607.18	1609.16	B	Professor	s	-1	0	now but we may wined up having to do that

Bed008.B.dialogueact498	1611.0	1613.26	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	edelman level that we were going to have to sort out so you know what 
Bed008.A.dialogueact499	1613.23	1613.58	A	Grad	s^bk^r	-1	0	so you know what 
Bed008.B.dialogueact500	1613.64	1614.78	B	Professor	s:qw	+1	0	so you know what is this look like what are 
Bed008.B.dialogueact501	1614.78	1618.03	B	Professor	s:qw	+1	0	is this look like what are what are uh intermediate things that are worth computing one of the features we need 
Bed008.B.dialogueact502	1618.03	1623.21	B	Professor	s:qw	+1	0	one of the features we need in order to make all these decisions and what's the best 
Bed008.A.dialogueact503	1619.45	1619.77	A	Grad	b	-1	0	in order 
Bed008.B.dialogueact504	1623.49	1632.29	B	Professor	s:qw	+1	0	i'm just thinking about how and what's the best way to organize this so that it's clean and and consistent and all that sort of stuff 
Bed008.A.dialogueact505	1630.78	1631.04	A	Grad	b	-1	0	consistent and all that sort of stuff 
Bed008.A.dialogueact506	1632.22	1638.75	A	Grad	s	-1	0	i'm just thinking about how people human beings who know about places and places to go and someone would store the center would 
Bed008.A.dialogueact507	1638.75	1645.98	A	Grad	s	-1	0	would store the center would probably you wouldn't just sort of remember that they sell stuff and then deduce from that and then it must be going on inside well i i think and and two maybe 
Bed008.E.dialogueact508	1644.47	1649.38	E	Grad	s	-1	0	it must be going on inside well i i think and and two maybe should be regarded as a victor of several possible things that could either 
Bed008.E.dialogueact509	1649.38	1658.68	E	Grad	s	-1	0	things that could either do is to sell things fixing six service things but things can be a landmark at the same time as doing these things 
Bed008.A.dialogueact510	1658.95	1659.19	A	Grad	b	-1	0	these things not either or 
Bed008.E.dialogueact511	1659.07	1660.14	E	Grad	s	-1	0	not either or suddenly 
Bed008.E.dialogueact512	1660.87	1663.44	E	Grad	s	-1	0	suddenly pissed to be able to tell and the same sites

Bed008.E.dialogueact514	1665.27	1666.14	E	Grad	s	-1	0	many come to mind things 
Bed008.E.dialogueact515	1666.74	1670.73	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	things can be generally um and then and be accessible 
Bed008.E.dialogueact516	1672.06	1673.14	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	a counselor or can be 
Bed008.E.dialogueact517	1673.14	1676.77	E	Grad	s	-1	0	or can be a landmark and not excessive of some statue

Bed008.B.dialogueact521	1679.49	1681.85	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	and i said let me suggest do something else 
Bed008.B.dialogueact522	1683.17	1693.33	B	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	uh which is the get rid rid of that @reject@ long link between who the user and the end point they're just 
Bed008.E.dialogueact523	1693.66	1695.07	E	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	not the like there at all they're just would like that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact524	1695.1	1696.22	B	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	the like there at all oh okay 
Bed008.E.dialogueact525	1696.49	1696.91	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay 
Bed008.B.dialogueact526	1699.29	1704.29	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	be cries what we're going to want is an intermediate thing which is 
Bed008.B.dialogueact527	1704.29	1712.19	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	which is uh be in point decision point decision based on the user box so what we what we 
Bed008.B.dialogueact528	1712.19	1716.6	B	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	so what we what we talked about is three separate in point decision so that's like 
Bed008.B.dialogueact529	1716.6	1717.74	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	decision so that's like a new that

Bed008.B.dialogueact678	2031.47	2033.16	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well it that's we just we can't do that so we're we're going to have be 
Bed008.B.dialogueact679	2033.16	2034.53	B	Professor	s^cc.%--	-1	0	so we're we're going to have two 
Bed008.C.dialogueact680	2033.33	2033.42	C	Grad	b	-1	0	so we're we're going to have 
Bed008.B.dialogueact681	2035.13	2036.18	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	this is good discussion we're going to have to 
Bed008.B.dialogueact682	2036.18	2041.57	B	Professor	s	+1	0	we're going to have to somehow figure out uh somewhat encapsulated that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact683	2042.5	2060.05	B	Professor	s	+1	0	uh so if there is some general notion uh for example the uh relation to the time to do this to the amount of time the guy has or something like that is is be um compatibility with his current state that's what you have to do you 
Bed008.B.dialogueact684	2060.16	2061.01	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	that's what you have to do you have to get it down to something 
Bed008.B.dialogueact685	2061.01	2067.73	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	have to get it down to something which um was it self relatively compacts so could 
Bed008.B.dialogueact686	2067.79	2070.37	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	compacts so could be compatibility with this current state which 
Bed008.B.dialogueact687	2070.91	2073.91	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	which would include is money in this time in in his energy yeah it just 
Bed008.C.dialogueact688	2073.79	2076.01	C	Grad	s^ng	+1	0	his energy it does yeah it just seems like a push the problem back a level yeah but no 
Bed008.D.dialogueact689	2074.09	2074.5	D	Grad	b	-1	0	seems like a push the problem 
Bed008.B.dialogueact690	2075.79	2076.45	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	it does back a level yeah but no 
Bed008.A.dialogueact692	2076.55	2076.9	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah but no 
Bed008.C.dialogueact691	2076.22	2077.22	C	Grad	s^bk|%-	-1	0	yeah but no but it's more than that like 
Bed008.D.dialogueact693	2076.72	2077.99	D	Grad	s^nd	+1	0	yeah but no but it's more than that like 
Bed008.D.dialogueact694	2077.99	2079.92	D	Grad	s^e	-1	0	but it's more than that like the the more so if you make about 
Bed008.D.dialogueact695	2080.66	2083.82	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	it like because if you have everything pointing to want to know what it's like explanation 
Bed008.D.dialogueact696	2084.8	2087.43	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so they get a two where's that can up more and more it's not expensive 
Bed008.B.dialogueact697	2087.61	2088.58	B	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	so they get a two advantages that that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact698	2088.58	2090.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	advantages that that is the technical one yeah 
Bed008.C.dialogueact699	2089.19	2089.91	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	is the technical yeah 
Bed008.C.dialogueact700	2089.91	2090.31	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	is the technical one yeah 
Bed008.B.dialogueact701	2091.05	2092.59	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and the other is that it gets used to it so we basically doing sub grouping

Bed008.A.dialogueact714	2111.16	2111.56	A	Grad	b	-1	0	so you 
Bed008.B.dialogueact715	2111.74	2120.85	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so you have this idea of the compatibility with the requirements of an action to the state of the user one could well imagine that that was 
Bed008.D.dialogueact716	2112.84	2113.1	D	Grad	b	-1	0	have this idea of the compatibility 
Bed008.B.dialogueact717	2121.54	2126.93	B	Professor	s	-1	0	not only is it it is it cleaner to computed separately but it could be that used multiple places

Bed008.E.dialogueact729	2161.45	2162.13	E	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	that's with the g.

Bed008.B.dialogueact731	2166.0	2166.0	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	then 
Bed008.B.dialogueact732	2166.17	2166.56	B	Professor	s	-1	0	then 
Bed008.E.dialogueact733	2166.97	2169.14	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	then we can make uh do this state 
Bed008.B.dialogueact734	2170.39	2172.63	B	Professor	s	-1	0	what what we're talking about is compatibility 
Bed008.B.dialogueact735	2174.78	2175.95	B	Professor	s^e^no	-1	0	uh or something i don't know but 
Bed008.B.dialogueact736	2176.02	2176.18	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.C.dialogueact737	2184.05	2185.54	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	guess the the question that it's 
Bed008.C.dialogueact738	2186.39	2190.53	C	Grad	s	+1	0	it's hard for me to imagine how everything wouldn't just contribute to use state again 
Bed008.C.dialogueact739	2191.77	2192.81	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	or use a compatibility 
Bed008.B.dialogueact740	2193.58	2200.15	B	Professor	fg|s.%--	+1	0	oh but the thing is that we we had some things that um 
Bed008.E.dialogueact741	2201.67	2202.28	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	they don't that don't 
Bed008.B.dialogueact742	2202.36	2202.92	B	Professor	s^aa^m	-1	0	they don't 
Bed008.E.dialogueact743	2203.13	2213.16	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	sure use interests and the user who who what the user is oh completely apart from the fact whether he is tired broke 
Bed008.C.dialogueact744	2213.85	2218.55	C	Grad	s^aap|s^bu^df	-1	0	sure but the thought those end up regretting right now know your compatibility to the current action right 
Bed008.C.dialogueact745	2218.55	2218.85	C	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	action right 
Bed008.B.dialogueact746	2219.34	2219.54	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	right 
Bed008.B.dialogueact747	2219.68	2219.97	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right 
Bed008.C.dialogueact748	2220.39	2224.9	C	Grad	s	-1	0	seems like everything in using model would contribute to whether or not these are was compatible with something 
Bed008.B.dialogueact749	2226.64	2227.56	B	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	oh maybe not i mean that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact750	2227.56	2230.52	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	not i mean that that's the the issue is um would 
Bed008.B.dialogueact751	2230.95	2240.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	would even if it was true in some abstract general sense it might not be true in terms of the information we actually had an can make you so 
Bed008.B.dialogueact752	2241.6	2248.1	B	Professor	s^co	+1	0	and anyway we're going to have to find some way to uh get this sufficiently simple to make it feasible 
Bed008.E.dialogueact753	2249.99	2254.25	E	Grad	s^cs.%--	-1	0	maybe food could be if we started up again entered so of um 
Bed008.E.dialogueact754	2255.24	2262.77	E	Grad	s	-1	0	if we look at thee uh the end point again we we said that for each of these things there's certain preconditions 
Bed008.E.dialogueact755	2263.08	2267.79	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	so you can only enter pays if you are not too tired to do so 
Bed008.E.dialogueact756	2268.31	2272.58	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and also have the money to do so across something so 
Bed008.E.dialogueact757	2273.02	2278.4	E	Grad	s	-1	0	if you can afford it and performance preconditions 
Bed008.E.dialogueact758	2280.55	2282.93	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	ewing usually is cheap

Bed008.B.dialogueact764	2289.48	2293.11	B	Professor	s	-1	0	without uh doing without and to if you start definition of view it's free

Bed008.E.dialogueact766	2297.67	2298.59	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	so is approaching

Bed008.A.dialogueact768	2301.09	2302.18	A	Grad	qo^rt	-1	0	about the grand canyon right now and i

Bed008.A.dialogueact770	2302.35	2303.05	A	Grad	s^bd	-1	0	right now and i mean are there are 
Bed008.A.dialogueact771	2303.05	2306.95	A	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	mean are there are there are large things that you have to pay to get up close too 
Bed008.A.dialogueact772	2307.12	2307.76	A	Grad	s^e.%--	-1	0	like i mean 
Bed008.A.dialogueact773	2308.61	2308.98	A	Grad	s^bd	-1	0	right not 
Bed008.A.dialogueact774	2308.98	2309.96	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	right not in the car and have to enter the park 
Bed008.B.dialogueact775	2309.19	2310.25	B	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	in the car and have to enter the park

Bed008.B.dialogueact777	2311.11	2315.56	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah almost by definition um paying involves entering get going 
Bed008.A.dialogueact778	2312.59	2312.8	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah um 
Bed008.B.dialogueact779	2315.56	2316.69	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	okay entering get going through some 
Bed008.A.dialogueact780	2316.79	2317.09	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay right sure through some 
Bed008.A.dialogueact781	2317.27	2317.87	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right sure 
Bed008.B.dialogueact782	2318.97	2319.17	B	Professor	s^bk^m	-1	0	um 
Bed008.B.dialogueact783	2319.8	2320.05	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	um so me suggest 
Bed008.B.dialogueact784	2320.58	2323.45	B	Professor	s^co^t^tc	-1	0	so me suggest we switched to another one i mean police 
Bed008.B.dialogueact785	2323.45	2325.11	B	Professor	s	+1	0	one i mean police more work to be done on this but things be more instructive 
Bed008.E.dialogueact786	2324.03	2324.69	E	Grad	b	-1	0	more work to be done on this 
Bed008.B.dialogueact787	2325.11	2330.9	B	Professor	s^cs^t	+1	0	but things be more instructive to to think about uh other decisions that we need to make an past land 
Bed008.B.dialogueact788	2331.91	2333.23	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and what they're going to look like 
Bed008.C.dialogueact789	2335.71	2338.27	C	Grad	s^cs:s	-1	0	so you save this one has an open up the old one right in 
Bed008.C.dialogueact790	2338.27	2338.49	C	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	one right in 
Bed008.C.dialogueact791	2338.49	2338.87	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	one right in 
Bed008.C.dialogueact792	2340.69	2342.1	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and everything would be clean they could do it again 
Bed008.C.dialogueact793	2342.46	2343.41	C	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	they could do it again 
Bed008.B.dialogueact794	2344.28	2345.44	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	well i i think we're saving this and i think that i'd 
Bed008.B.dialogueact795	2345.44	2346.83	B	Professor	s	-1	0	this and i think that i'd like to keep this one because 
Bed008.D.dialogueact796	2345.64	2346.24	D	Grad	b	-1	0	this and i think that i'd like to keep this one because 
Bed008.B.dialogueact797	2346.83	2349.17	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	like to keep this one because i want to see if we're going to re use any of this stuff 
Bed008.C.dialogueact798	2349.19	2349.71	C	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bed008.E.dialogueact800	2360.64	2362.89	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so this might jeeze 
Bed008.E.dialogueact801	2365.96	2366.64	E	Grad	qw^t^tc	-1	0	with me 
Bed008.B.dialogueact802	2367.63	2368.32	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	well you tell me so in terms 
Bed008.B.dialogueact803	2368.32	2373.37	B	Professor	qw	+1	0	me so in terms of the uh planner what's what's a good one to do well that's this whether 
Bed008.E.dialogueact804	2371.35	2372.31	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	planner what's what's a good one well that's this 
Bed008.E.dialogueact805	2374.04	2375.54	E	Grad	s^ba:s	+1	0	or not i think it's a good one 
Bed008.B.dialogueact806	2376.31	2376.44	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.E.dialogueact807	2377.19	2378.3	E	Grad	s	-1	0	a very basic one 
Bed008.E.dialogueact808	2381.1	2381.41	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.E.dialogueact809	2383.19	2385.48	E	Grad	qw.%--	-1	0	what makes things more like the 
Bed008.B.dialogueact811	2388.04	2394.85	B	Professor	fg|s	+1	1	the first the first thing is to getting back to thing we left on the other is the actual discourse 
Bed008.E.dialogueact810	2387.91	2388.28	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	well the first the 
Bed008.B.dialogueact812	2395.92	2397.82	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so keep this is going to get into your world cause 
Bed008.B.dialogueact813	2397.82	2406.77	B	Professor	s^df	+1	1	into your world cause uh we're going to want to know you know which constructions indicates various of these properties 
Bed008.A.dialogueact814	2398.51	2398.91	A	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.A.dialogueact816	2407.41	2407.91	A	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bed008.B.dialogueact817	2408.35	2410.11	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and so i 
Bed008.B.dialogueact818	2410.95	2413.33	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	i i don't yet know how to do this i guess 
Bed008.B.dialogueact819	2413.33	2421.01	B	Professor	s	+1	0	this i guess we're going to wined up pulling out uh discourse properties like we have object properties and we don't know what they are yet 
Bed008.B.dialogueact820	2421.01	2422.2	B	Professor	s	+1	2	we don't know what they are yet so that 
Bed008.A.dialogueact821	2422.29	2422.87	A	Grad	b	-1	0	so that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact822	2422.77	2429.28	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so that that to go their decision will have i know from uh discourse i guess what would just 
Bed008.B.dialogueact823	2429.28	2433.83	B	Professor	qw^cs.%-	-1	0	i guess what would just stick a discourse thing up there to be as a place holder for we 
Bed008.E.dialogueact824	2433.98	2436.93	E	Grad	s	-1	0	holder for oh we we are side discourse features of course for the end points 
Bed008.B.dialogueact825	2436.98	2437.65	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	oh of course for the end points 
Bed008.E.dialogueact826	2438.17	2438.96	E	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah identified that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact827	2439.04	2439.26	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and so 
Bed008.E.dialogueact828	2439.59	2442.28	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and so again that's to do correct we have the use of much 
Bed008.E.dialogueact829	2442.28	2444.31	E	Grad	s	-1	0	we have the use of much of the situation motive here we don't tend to discourse 
Bed008.E.dialogueact830	2444.31	2446.17	E	Grad	s	-1	0	here we don't tend to discourse my here yet but just see ways 
Bed008.E.dialogueact831	2446.57	2449.33	E	Grad	s	-1	0	well but just see ways we didn't we don't have scientology here 
Bed008.B.dialogueact832	2450.0	2457.69	B	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	the apology we sort of said we would pool these various kinds of properties from the on like exhibiting selling and so forth so 
Bed008.E.dialogueact833	2450.39	2450.73	E	Grad	b	-1	0	the apology we 
Bed008.B.dialogueact834	2457.94	2459.63	B	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	and so forth so in some sense it's it's there 
Bed008.E.dialogueact835	2459.73	2460.51	E	Grad	b	-1	0	there but the discourse 
Bed008.B.dialogueact836	2460.58	2462.58	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but the discourse we don't have a representative at all yet 
Bed008.E.dialogueact837	2462.98	2463.16	E	Grad	b	-1	0	at all yet 
Bed008.E.dialogueact838	2476.79	2477.96	E	Grad	fg	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.E.dialogueact839	2479.92	2482.13	E	Grad	s^co^rt	-1	0	be specific for second here 
Bed008.E.dialogueact840	2483.2	2483.7	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.E.dialogueact841	2486.36	2492.93	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and and we probably would have uh something like a discourse fork and point 
Bed008.B.dialogueact842	2504.03	2505.92	B	Professor	s	-1	0	if we do we don't have the three values 
Bed008.E.dialogueact843	2506.52	2506.74	E	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	you 
Bed008.B.dialogueact844	2507.1	2508.42	B	Professor	s	-1	0	don't have deviate values if we have 
Bed008.B.dialogueact846	2508.56	2509.23	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	if we have it 
Bed008.E.dialogueact845	2508.48	2508.65	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	if we have 
Bed008.E.dialogueact847	2509.4	2509.53	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	it 
Bed008.E.dialogueact848	2511.2	2513.14	E	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	just for starters and here 
Bed008.E.dialogueact849	2513.47	2516.09	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	for go there probably is and here discourse um 
Bed008.B.dialogueact850	2516.29	2517.95	B	Professor	s^cs:s	+1	0	for go there probably is truant officer 
Bed008.B.dialogueact851	2518.19	2519.01	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	so we talked about um 
Bed008.E.dialogueact852	2519.51	2520.31	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	um well 
Bed008.E.dialogueact853	2520.99	2525.78	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	well i think um mean looking at the the little data that we have 
Bed008.E.dialogueact854	2526.16	2529.38	E	Grad	s:qw	-1	0	some people say how do i that too the castle 
Bed008.E.dialogueact855	2530.03	2531.74	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and this usually means they want to go there 
Bed008.A.dialogueact856	2532.1	2532.98	A	Grad	b	-1	0	so this was sort of 
Bed008.E.dialogueact857	2532.18	2535.33	E	Grad	s	-1	0	right so this was sort of push it in one direction whenever 
Bed008.B.dialogueact858	2534.29	2534.53	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right in one direction 
Bed008.E.dialogueact859	2535.64	2538.09	E	Grad	s:qw	-1	0	whenever people also sometimes say how do i get there in order to find out 
Bed008.E.dialogueact860	2538.09	2540.69	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	in order to find out hard to get there 
Bed008.E.dialogueact861	2541.14	2542.26	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	without wanting to go there 
Bed008.B.dialogueact862	2542.51	2543.2	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	and sometimes 
Bed008.E.dialogueact863	2543.42	2546.07	E	Grad	s:qw	-1	0	and sometimes um people say why is that 
Bed008.A.dialogueact864	2546.94	2547.42	A	Grad	b	-1	0	because they want 
Bed008.E.dialogueact865	2547.71	2548.74	E	Grad	s^e^rt	-1	0	because they want to know where it is 
Bed008.E.dialogueact866	2549.04	2550.18	E	Grad	s^e.%--	-1	0	yeah know that doesn't change but in most cases separate 
Bed008.B.dialogueact867	2550.41	2553.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah know that doesn't change the fact that you're you want these two values 
Bed008.E.dialogueact868	2555.06	2555.32	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah true 
Bed008.E.dialogueact869	2555.66	2555.9	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah true 
Bed008.E.dialogueact870	2557.8	2560.99	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so this is sort of some extra little thing that takes all the discourse stuff and 
Bed008.E.dialogueact871	2560.99	2565.29	E	Grad	s^e:s	-1	0	all the discourse stuff and then either it's either yep yeah they are and they

Bed008.D.dialogueact883	2592.81	2594.39	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	but that no that's kind of 
Bed008.D.dialogueact884	2596.0	2597.78	D	Grad	fh|qh	-1	0	what's the word um 
Bed008.A.dialogueact885	2597.04	2597.6	A	Grad	b	-1	0	what's the word um 
Bed008.D.dialogueact886	2597.78	2602.31	D	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	what's the word um didn't drafted the uh um e. v. thing if there's one view it 
Bed008.D.dialogueact887	2602.31	2605.25	D	Grad	s	-1	0	thing if there's one view it then it's fine to go there it's closed whereas 
Bed008.D.dialogueact888	2605.65	2607.54	D	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	right whereas if they want to um 
Bed008.B.dialogueact889	2607.98	2608.19	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right um 
Bed008.D.dialogueact890	2609.68	2609.98	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	so 
Bed008.B.dialogueact891	2610.94	2614.55	B	Professor	fg|s^ba	-1	0	right so that's that's where it starts getting to be in uh potentially more interesting so what 
Bed008.B.dialogueact892	2614.55	2623.56	B	Professor	s	-1	0	interesting so what uh buster said which is completely right is if you know that they're only going to do it then it doesn't matter whether it's close to not in terms 
Bed008.A.dialogueact893	2622.48	2622.99	A	Grad	b	-1	0	whether it's close

Bed008.C.dialogueact899	2632.9	2635.79	C	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	absolutely it does matter though there's like a striker right or something 
Bed008.B.dialogueact900	2635.75	2637.78	B	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	absolutely there other situational things that do matter or something right 
Bed008.D.dialogueact901	2637.85	2638.15	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	that do matter right 
Bed008.D.dialogueact902	2639.74	2640.17	D	Grad	fg	-1	0	so 
Bed008.D.dialogueact903	2641.91	2642.57	D	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah that's i said just having 
Bed008.D.dialogueact904	2642.57	2645.31	D	Grad	s	-1	0	i said just having one situation and the you know not you know because 
Bed008.D.dialogueact905	2645.31	2649.04	D	Grad	s^df.%-	-1	0	well it it know because this that north by itself wouldn't distinguish 
Bed008.B.dialogueact906	2649.34	2651.6	B	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	well it it can have their various values 
Bed008.B.dialogueact907	2653.07	2654.81	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	we you're you're right it might not be enough 
Bed008.D.dialogueact908	2657.03	2662.74	D	Grad	s:s	+1	0	i mean see i'm i'm thinking that any nor did begin begins go there is either going to be true or false 
Bed008.A.dialogueact909	2658.32	2658.65	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	i'm

Bed008.B.dialogueact925	2676.46	2684.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	time of day so so now the other thing that buffet appoint not is what this is is that uh there should be a link and this 
Bed008.B.dialogueact926	2684.88	2686.6	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	be a link and this is where things are going to get very messy from 
Bed008.B.dialogueact927	2686.86	2693.61	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	messy from me and point uh decision maybe i guess to find 
Bed008.D.dialogueact928	2692.71	2693.33	D	Grad	s^2.%-	-1	0	decision maybe i guess to find 
Bed008.B.dialogueact929	2693.61	2700.54	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	maybe that they're finally and i guess the very bottom end point decision uh to the go there no find 
Bed008.B.dialogueact930	2701.5	2702.96	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	and i don't worry about the layout amenable

Bed008.D.dialogueact936	2706.0	2712.43	D	Grad	s^cs^rt:s	-1	0	could be we could them having to be ignored that just being point and to go their ass nor do sudafed into 
Bed008.B.dialogueact937	2712.76	2713.12	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	could be yeah into right 
Bed008.B.dialogueact938	2713.12	2713.38	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	yeah right

Bed008.B.dialogueact1016	2871.47	2871.74	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	away from right 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1017	2872.82	2875.56	A	Grad	s:s	-1	0	that all that that kind of decision making happens it to go there now and uh 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1018	2875.99	2878.9	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	there now and if indeed uh you yeah you you if you needed to do that 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1019	2877.3	2877.56	A	Grad	b	-1	0	you if 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1020	2878.84	2879.73	A	Grad	s^m^na	-1	0	if indeed do that you needed to do that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1021	2879.8	2879.93	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	do that 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1022	2881.05	2882.46	A	Grad	s	-1	0	uh okay i was just thinking i guess maybe 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1024	2882.69	2888.02	A	Grad	s	-1	0	thinking i guess maybe i'm complaining that user now would with possible possible asking of the user you know 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1023	2882.43	2882.68	B	Professor	b	-1	0	thinking i guess maybe 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1025	2888.74	2889.1	A	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	you know 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1027	2890.42	2893.75	A	Grad	s^e:qy	-1	0	hey there's a strike on god does that affect whether or not you want to go or something good point i don't i don't know how 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1026	2890.41	2890.82	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	hey there's a strike 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1028	2892.85	2895.69	B	Professor	s^no.%--	-1	0	whether or not you want to go or something good point i don't i don't know how we're going to do uh 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1029	2893.75	2893.78	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	go or something i don't i don't know how 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1030	2896.9	2898.42	A	Grad	s	-1	0	yes i'm in i kind of user model but you know directly 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1031	2898.42	2900.94	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	model but you know directly out of interaction 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1032	2900.2	2900.58	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	interaction 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1033	2902.52	2907.22	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh i guess i guess my current you know don't yeah yes 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1034	2907.82	2907.99	E	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.B.dialogueact1035	2909.86	2920.41	B	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	uh my current kermit idea on that would be that each of these decision nodes has questions associated with it 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1036	2920.64	2921.05	A	Grad	b	-1	0	it and the question wouldn't 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1037	2921.15	2924.31	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and the question wouldn't itself be one of these conditional things you know given 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1039	2924.62	2925.14	A	Grad	b	-1	0	you know given the you know there's a strike 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1038	2924.5	2927.19	B	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	yeah you know given the you know there's a strike do still want to go but 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1040	2927.24	2927.52	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah but 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1041	2927.42	2932.0	B	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	yeah but uh if you talk to him a bunch of stuff then you would ask them do you want to go but i think 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1042	2930.31	2930.66	A	Grad	b	-1	0	then you would ask 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1044	2932.47	2932.72	A	Grad	b	-1	0	i think 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1043	2932.0	2937.34	B	Professor	s	-1	0	right right yeah right sure i think trying to formulate the conditional question that sounds too much 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1045	2933.48	2933.89	A	Grad	b	-1	0	right right trying 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1046	2935.14	2935.67	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah question 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1047	2937.53	2938.26	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right sure okay to me 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1048	2938.4	2938.67	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	okay to me 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1049	2938.47	2939.07	E	Grad	b	-1	0	okay to me @reject@ 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1050	2939.73	2941.06	B	Professor	s^co^t	-1	0	@reject@ let's stay with some of the because i want to do a little 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1051	2940.38	2940.52	E	Grad	fg	-1	0	let's stay with some of 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1052	2941.06	2943.39	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	the because i want to do a little bit of organization 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1053	2944.18	2945.58	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	before we get more into details 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1054	2946.1	2949.58	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	serious nation is going to be that uh the flavor 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1055	2949.85	2955.67	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	the flavor of what's going on is going to be that uh as we 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1056	2955.86	2962.49	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh as we started of is this detail in b. c. just going to to worry about the various constructions that people might use 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1057	2962.5	2962.91	A	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.B.dialogueact1058	2963.12	2967.44	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and john ellis committed himself to being the parts are wizards so 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1060	2967.77	2968.27	A	Grad	b	-1	0	wizards so what's going to happen 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1059	2967.44	2973.88	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	wizards so what's going to happen is that eventually 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1061	2974.44	2975.91	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	like by the time he graduates 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1062	2976.18	2976.68	B	Professor	qy^d^f^rt	-1	0	okay 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1063	2977.16	2989.54	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	uh they'll be some sort of system which is able to take the discourse in context and have i'll puts that can feed the rest the belief that i 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1064	2990.07	2991.57	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i i said everybody knows it's want to 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1065	2991.57	2994.94	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	everybody knows it's want to you know get closer that that'll be the game then so 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1066	2992.66	2992.97	A	Grad	b	-1	0	you know get closer 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1067	2994.94	3007.0	B	Professor	s	-1	0	be the game then so the semantics that you'll get out of the discourse will be uh values that go in to the various discourse based decision ups and 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1068	3008.04	3011.97	B	Professor	s	+1	0	now some of those will get fancier like mode of transportation and the stuff that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1069	3011.97	3017.8	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and the stuff that isn't by any means uh necessarily simple thing that you want to 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1070	3018.84	3021.75	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	so if there is an and there is mode of transportation and then 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1071	3021.76	3030.44	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and then there's a sort of a law says that if you if you go and look at it you much each is something that comes from it discourse in terms of what was actually just had what's 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1072	3030.81	3032.42	E	Grad	qr	-1	0	yeah had what's the after unscripted giving us and then what's 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1073	3031.55	3031.77	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah the after unscripted giving 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1074	3032.68	3035.31	E	Grad	qr	-1	0	yeah well we'll have to decide us and then what's the discuss history give us 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1075	3034.81	3041.22	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	yeah well we'll have to decide uh how much of it where that goes and give us that's true things 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1076	3035.92	3036.79	A	Grad	b	-1	0	we'll have to decide that's 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1077	3036.5	3037.65	E	Grad	s	-1	0	uh that's true things 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1079	3041.38	3041.8	A	Grad	b	-1	0	and 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1078	3041.23	3041.89	E	Grad	b	-1	0	and 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1080	3041.84	3042.92	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and it's not clear yet 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1081	3042.92	3044.74	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it's not clear yet but it could be those are two separate things it could 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1082	3044.74	3048.89	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	separate things it could be that the discourse gadget it's self integration is which 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1083	3049.06	3050.12	B	Professor	s	-1	0	would be my guess that you'd have 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1084	3050.53	3059.64	B	Professor	s:s	+1	1	that you'd have to do you got to do reference and stuff like that um you've got to have both the current discourse in the context to say i want to go back there when i was 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1086	3059.88	3060.3	A	Grad	b	-1	0	there when i was i mean and 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1085	3059.69	3060.59	B	Professor	s:qr	-1	0	there when i was i mean and 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1087	3060.59	3063.33	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	i mean and 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1088	3060.94	3061.72	E	Grad	b	-1	0	i mean and 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1089	3062.15	3062.42	A	Grad	s	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.A.dialogueact1090	3064.18	3064.85	A	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.B.dialogueact1091	3066.83	3067.21	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	all right so 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1092	3067.64	3068.87	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1093	3071.42	3077.35	E	Grad	qy	-1	0	but this this this picture that's emerging here just to my wish that you notice ready for some a tree or is it that we 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1094	3077.35	3091.31	E	Grad	qrr	-1	0	i don't know tree or is it that we get for each each decision on the very but and we sort of get these have key sub you and maybe it's stop all florida two hundred g. um make i know it 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1095	3091.52	3091.88	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	i don't know it 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1096	3093.58	3094.42	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	it could be but it might just 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1097	3094.55	3094.94	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	it could be 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1098	3095.14	3095.68	E	Grad	s^bk^m	-1	0	could be so this 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1100	3096.02	3098.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	this is this is getting into the thing i want to talk about next which is 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1099	3095.68	3096.11	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	this is this is getting could be so this 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1101	3098.51	3103.19	B	Professor	qr	-1	0	next which is if that's true uh how do we want to combine that's 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1102	3104.56	3105.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	oh when it's true 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1103	3106.75	3119.65	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	but that's what what would be nice but that know we only have at the most four at the moment um i rose going from each of the uh but some decisions 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1104	3113.61	3113.85	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.D.dialogueact1105	3120.62	3120.76	D	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.E.dialogueact1106	3121.12	3122.4	E	Grad	qy^bu^cs^d^rt	-1	0	no and for you we can handle 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1107	3122.52	3123.03	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	no handle 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1109	3124.21	3124.45	D	Grad	b	-1	0	well yeah too much 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1108	3124.05	3124.63	E	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	well yeah too much 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1110	3124.86	3133.97	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well yeah see it if it's a if it's for things in each of them has four values but there's got to be a big c. p. t. it's yeah too much 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1111	3133.97	3135.91	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	be a big c. p. t. it's not completely impossible i 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1112	3135.91	3138.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	impossible i mean it's it's not beyond what the system coolidge salts 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1113	3139.97	3145.04	B	Professor	s^ba^df	-1	0	but it's probably beyond what we could actually uh write down or learn 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1114	3142.8	3143.58	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	uh write down 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1115	3146.68	3149.55	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh but you know it's for the fourth 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1116	3152.88	3153.33	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	it's pretty big

Bed008.E.dialogueact1125	3164.37	3168.67	E	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	a that's a good but before did we decide to on these it to a false so it's

Bed008.D.dialogueact1154	3207.5	3209.58	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and also i mean there's other places where like for 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1155	3209.73	3214.2	D	Grad	s	-1	0	right places where like for example considering point you it as inputs coming from user budget uses it 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1156	3213.89	3214.03	B	Professor	b	-1	0	right budget uses it 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1157	3215.15	3215.79	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so even 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1158	3216.26	3217.44	B	Professor	s^2	-1	0	those are not necessarily binary sit 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1159	3217.82	3223.77	B	Professor	s	+1	0	binary sit there we're going to have to use some secure in the knowledge engineering to not have this explode 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1160	3224.34	3226.68	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and i think i think it doesn't in the sense that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1161	3227.68	3228.64	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1162	3229.43	3229.88	B	Professor	s^rt.%-	-1	0	we you know 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1163	3229.88	3241.06	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we you know actually with the underlying semantics and stuff i think it isn't like you have twenty and fifty six different uh ways of of thinking about whether this user wants to go to some place 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1164	3242.53	3242.86	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	right 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1165	3243.2	3248.03	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	so we we just have to figure out what the regularity is are and and code 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1166	3249.5	3255.73	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but um when i was going to suggest next is that what we're going to is a little longer but 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1167	3256.01	3260.99	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i do want to also talk about the thing we we started into now of 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1168	3261.75	3262.4	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh well 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1169	3262.6	3265.79	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	well to as all these arrows come and is not the same place what 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1170	3265.92	3268.85	B	Professor	qr	-1	0	the same place what role of combination is used there 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1172	3270.76	3271.04	A	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh right so that yeah six of these things all affected 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1171	3270.34	3272.23	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uhhuh right so that yeah six of these things all affected how they affect 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1173	3271.24	3271.49	A	Grad	b	-1	0	right of these things all affected 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1174	3272.23	3273.17	B	Professor	qr	-1	0	how they affect 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1175	3274.17	3279.52	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and belief that's have their own beliefs about uh what are good ways to do that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1176	3281.89	3283.99	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so it's it's clear clear enough what the issue is right 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1177	3282.65	3282.82	D	Grad	b	-1	0	it's it's clear clear 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1178	3283.99	3284.18	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	enough what the issue is right so 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1179	3284.94	3287.17	B	Professor	qr^t	-1	0	so going to switch that now i want to do some more of this 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1180	3288.41	3290.71	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	basically we just it just sort of 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1181	3291.21	3299.24	E	Grad	s	-1	0	let's get some closure on this figure out how old we got to get this picture is sort of uh completely messy 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1182	3300.52	3304.2	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	well here's here's one of the things that they ice you you i know 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1183	3304.2	3304.48	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	you i know 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1184	3304.8	3307.3	B	Professor	s^bd^df^no	+1	0	you i know i don't know how easy to just do this in interface but 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1185	3307.8	3316.79	B	Professor	s^cs.%--	+1	0	but you it would be great if you who would actually just display at a given time uh all the things that you pick up you click 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1186	3316.79	3318.02	B	Professor	s	+1	0	that you pick up you click on in point okay and 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1187	3318.02	3318.42	B	Professor	s^f	-1	0	okay and 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1189	3318.86	3320.64	B	Professor	s	+1	0	okay and everything else fades and you just 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1188	3318.54	3318.96	E	Grad	b	-1	0	okay and 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1190	3320.64	3325.28	B	Professor	s	+1	0	fades and you just see the links that are are relevant to that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1191	3326.79	3327.15	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	and i do use anybody remember 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1192	3327.15	3329.26	B	Professor	qy	-1	0	do use anybody remember doing on this uh 
Bed008.C.dialogueact1193	3329.87	3335.69	C	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	uh i i would almost have the way to do that would be to open a or make you know and many police that's in an open 
Bed008.C.dialogueact1194	3335.69	3339.11	C	Grad	s	-1	0	police that's in an open them every time you wanted to look at a different one person because i pro pretty

Bed008.E.dialogueact1197	3339.56	3341.93	E	Grad	s	-1	0	person because i pro pretty you do it the truth niche came out 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1199	3342.26	3342.38	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.C.dialogueact1200	3343.96	3344.32	C	Grad	s^bk|%-	-1	0	yeah but 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1201	3344.86	3345.01	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	but it's you know 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1202	3345.61	3346.11	D	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	it's you know 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1203	3347.47	3352.58	E	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah i have to each of these things you just the and believing it's be be a page and then your take on the thing and then 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1204	3352.58	3355.15	E	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah the thing and then they it's a it's respect but 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1206	3353.64	3355.29	B	Professor	s^am|%-	-1	0	yeah they it's a it's respect but 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1205	3353.2	3354.08	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah they it's a it's respect 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1207	3355.15	3355.31	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	but 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1208	3356.48	3362.97	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	anyway so i it's clear that even with this if we put in all the errors that was to be able to read the diagram 
Bed008.C.dialogueact1209	3364.46	3364.68	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	all 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1210	3364.99	3365.24	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	all right so you 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1211	3365.24	3371.73	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	right so you have to figure out some uh basically display or something too just because 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1212	3371.73	3372.21	B	Professor	s^df.%-	-1	0	just because and i 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1213	3372.76	3377.09	B	Professor	fg|s^t^tc	-1	0	and i i think it's suggest that this it's not a first order consideration we have to first order considerations 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1214	3377.09	3378.54	B	Professor	s^t	-1	0	we have to first order considerations which is 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1215	3378.76	3381.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	which is what i or the uh influences 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1216	3382.37	3382.71	B	Professor	s	-1	0	hey and be 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1217	3382.71	3385.38	B	Professor	qr	-1	0	hey and be how they get combine mathematically how we display was 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1218	3385.38	3386.54	B	Professor	s	-1	0	how we display was an issue but 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1219	3386.54	3386.75	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	an issue but 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1220	3388.03	3389.63	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	i don't yeah i 
Bed008.C.dialogueact1221	3389.46	3393.64	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i don't yeah i just don't think it's been designed to support something like that 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1222	3394.05	3394.2	D	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1223	3395.0	3404.19	D	Grad	fg|s	+1	2	right yeah i mean might soon if this is going to be using it seriously like that would be if they might soon be necessary to uh start modifying it for purposes 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1224	3402.7	3402.84	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right it 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1225	3404.76	3411.07	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	yeah and um i difference like perfectly feasible thing to get into but 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1226	3411.07	3415.18	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but um we know what we want first 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1227	3428.64	3433.52	B	Professor	qo^cs^t^tc	-1	0	okay so what do you tell us a little bit about decision nodes and what what the choices might be for days 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1228	3429.04	3429.76	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	do you tell us a little bit about 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1229	3436.56	3437.57	D	Grad	x	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.D.dialogueact1230	3437.71	3438.32	D	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.C.dialogueact1231	3439.12	3440.72	C	Grad	s	-1	0	you can technically where that is or talking 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1232	3440.13	3441.95	D	Grad	s	-1	0	or talking 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1233	3441.97	3442.26	A	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.B.dialogueact1234	3442.96	3443.34	B	Professor	s^cs.%-	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.B.dialogueact1235	3443.34	3443.59	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.D.dialogueact1236	3456.02	3457.65	D	Grad	s^ba^t1	-1	0	it's just board works fine 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1237	3472.55	3483.01	D	Grad	s	+1	1	so um recall the basic problem which is that um yeah believe that and you have like a lot of different nodes alt country into one um 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1238	3484.88	3485.22	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right suzie 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1239	3485.92	3490.5	D	Grad	s	+1	0	suzie discussed specify and this kind of thing is a big pain and 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1240	3490.78	3493.18	D	Grad	s	-1	0	pain and it's um would take a long time right down because 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1241	3493.18	3500.4	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because for example if these guys have to be boston these each and this is the possibility's then you know you have two iron forty two possibilities which is already 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1242	3500.72	3502.94	D	Grad	s	-1	0	which is already a lot of numbers right down 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1243	3504.2	3513.47	D	Grad	s	+1	0	so what um helps us in our situation is that these all um have values and the same set right these are all 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1244	3513.47	3513.63	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	same set right these are all 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1245	3513.63	3515.87	D	Grad	s	+1	1	same set right these are all like seeing t. v. right 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1246	3516.09	3516.31	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right so it's not just to 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1247	3516.31	3518.56	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	right so it's not just to generalize situation like 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1248	3519.32	3522.79	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i mean basically to just take a combination of you 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1249	3522.96	3524.8	D	Grad	s	+1	0	a combination of you want to view each of these experts experts 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1250	3524.8	3529.02	D	Grad	s	+1	0	experts experts can who are each of them is making a decision based in some factors and you want to sort of 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1251	3529.33	3531.59	D	Grad	s	+1	0	and you want to sort of combine their decisions 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1252	3532.03	3538.35	D	Grad	s	+1	0	and create you know um so waited combination rover the rover decision 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1253	3536.75	3536.99	E	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.E.dialogueact1254	3537.42	3539.33	E	Grad	s	-1	0	combination rover the rover decision 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1255	3540.11	3540.73	D	Grad	qw^br^d^rt	-1	0	the what decision 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1256	3541.24	3541.69	E	Grad	s	-1	0	rover 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1257	3543.52	3545.73	E	Grad	s	-1	0	lot of their outputs combined 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1258	3545.74	3546.13	A	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.D.dialogueact1259	3546.22	3546.42	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.D.dialogueact1260	3547.33	3547.43	D	Grad	b	-1	0	so 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1261	3548.01	3555.37	D	Grad	s	+1	1	the problem is to specify of the uh so the condition probably the if this given all those right that's 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1262	3555.6	3555.79	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	those right that's 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1263	3555.89	3558.2	D	Grad	s	-1	0	those right that's three belief nets are defined like each note it 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1264	3558.35	3559.51	D	Grad	s^e	+1	0	like each note it that's right 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1265	3559.51	3559.74	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	that's right 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1266	3560.16	3562.3	D	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	so um that's what we want one for example 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1267	3562.3	3563.77	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	want one for example he if um 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1268	3564.2	3565.15	D	Grad	s	-1	0	let's call this guy why and it's called these 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1269	3565.4	3569.66	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and it's called these x. one x. two accent 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1270	3570.02	3570.26	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right so we want 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1271	3570.6	3575.51	D	Grad	s	-1	0	right so we want probably hawaii close you know for example um be 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1272	3576.41	3578.24	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	given that these guys are 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1273	3579.33	3583.61	D	Grad	s	-1	0	i was a part of this is like ex um hat or something like on 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1274	3583.61	3584.83	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	or something like on like all of them 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1275	3585.38	3590.35	D	Grad	s	-1	0	given that for example they this is you know a v. a. e. or something right 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1276	3590.88	3591.1	D	Grad	qy^bu^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right so 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1277	3591.39	3591.55	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	so 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1278	3591.85	3593.87	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so we would like to do this kind of domination 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1279	3594.46	3595.16	B	Professor	s^bk|%--	-1	0	right so um 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1280	3595.22	3595.96	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1281	3598.14	3600.01	B	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	is that uh i i make 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1282	3600.01	3605.07	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	i think so yeah i i make sure everybody is with us before your son it's it's 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1283	3604.41	3605.03	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	i think so yeah before your son it's it's 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1284	3605.81	3609.23	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	it's it's it is is it clear what he wants to compute 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1286	3610.18	3610.63	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	so 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1285	3609.94	3610.04	D	Grad	b	-1	0	so 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1287	3610.75	3611.36	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	so right so 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1288	3611.7	3621.14	D	Grad	s	-1	0	right so basically um what do you want to do is to for every single combination of unity any and every single that he give a number because that's 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1290	3621.37	3621.69	A	Grad	b	-1	0	because that's 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1289	3621.14	3624.59	D	Grad	s	-1	0	because that's obviously not desirable 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1291	3625.27	3629.28	D	Grad	s	-1	0	what do i do is find some we have um seeing what each of these is 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1292	3630.37	3632.62	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and who wants to be about it probably suspicion so he wanted 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1293	3632.62	3635.61	D	Grad	s	-1	0	suspicion so he wanted to to um i don't to one right 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1294	3635.76	3636.04	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	don't to one right 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1296	3637.18	3637.61	A	Grad	b	-1	0	so the two things that we 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1295	3637.16	3639.01	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so the two things that we uh need 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1297	3640.17	3649.95	D	Grad	s	+1	1	so what uh i guess what just earlier was basically that be you know beauties guises boarding 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1298	3649.95	3656.24	D	Grad	s	+1	1	guises boarding and we just take thee uh we essentially take um averages right so for example 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1299	3656.24	3656.45	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right so for example 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1300	3656.45	3659.83	D	Grad	s	-1	0	right so for example here two people to work for eight one 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1301	3659.83	3660.87	D	Grad	s	-1	0	people to work for eight one has worked for me and 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1302	3660.87	3661.88	D	Grad	s	-1	0	has worked for me and one one's work free so 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1303	3661.88	3669.61	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	one one's work free so we could say that the probably these are you know probably be is one well for because one person for three or four 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1304	3670.55	3672.3	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and some similarity probably if 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1305	3673.5	3674.53	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	this is probably the if you 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1306	3674.53	3679.46	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	the if you and then probably if a given all that is um do what a four 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1307	3680.17	3682.9	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and probably if the is wonderful 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1308	3684.06	3684.37	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.D.dialogueact1309	3685.3	3689.46	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so that's step and that's the um yeah that's that's the basic uh thing 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1310	3690.24	3690.77	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	no 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1311	3692.29	3692.69	E	Grad	fg	-1	0	um i'm 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1312	3692.92	3693.11	E	Grad	b	-1	0	so um i'm 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1313	3694.04	3694.5	D	Grad	qy	-1	0	it and that one outcome 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1314	3694.23	3695.98	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	it and that one outcome that's 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1315	3696.35	3696.64	B	Professor	qw^br	-1	0	what 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1316	3698.01	3701.04	E	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	x. x. one voted for a. x. two 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1317	3701.43	3702.85	E	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	x. two the movie and so 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1318	3702.22	3702.46	A	Grad	b	-1	0	the movie and so 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1319	3702.85	3703.4	E	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	right the movie and so forth that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1320	3703.46	3703.64	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right forth that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1322	3704.33	3704.53	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.D.dialogueact1323	3704.33	3704.49	D	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.E.dialogueact1321	3703.86	3704.0	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right forth that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1325	3705.14	3710.6	B	Professor	s^bu	+1	1	so so this assumes simba tree unequal weights and all that sort of things which may or may not be a good assumption so that that's the outcome 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1324	3705.12	3705.75	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so so this assumes that's the outcome 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1326	3708.38	3709.52	A	Grad	b	-1	0	that sort of things which may or may not be a good 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1328	3710.74	3710.96	A	Grad	b	-1	0	assumption so that 
Bed008.B.dialogueact1327	3710.7	3711.08	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	assumption so that 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1329	3710.76	3711.02	D	Grad	b	-1	0	assumption so that 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1330	3711.86	3711.98	D	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.D.dialogueact1331	3712.65	3713.88	D	Grad	s.%--	+1	0	so step do is um 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1332	3714.21	3714.51	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	right so even 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1333	3714.68	3716.04	D	Grad	s	-1	0	right so even seemed equally it's whereas it might or not 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1334	3716.04	3730.29	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	x. one matters more whereas it might or not that you know some will be that for example what d. um yeah absolutely do you ever look on what the person said like what what might be uh some uh more uh important then he uh 
Bed008.C.dialogueact1335	3730.27	3732.31	C	Grad	s^2.%-	-1	0	x. one matters more in the next two right sure so 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1336	3731.8	3732.01	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	in the next two right sure so 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1337	3732.47	3734.6	D	Grad	s^aa|s	+1	0	sure so we don't want to like give money kuwait's so kind 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1338	3734.6	3736.92	D	Grad	s	-1	0	kuwait's so kind even giving them all away to one fourth 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1339	3737.51	3743.33	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so we could replace this by um doubly one w-two that would be and up before 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1341	3744.46	3744.84	A	Grad	b	-1	0	right and 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1340	3744.41	3744.6	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right and 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1342	3744.95	3751.14	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	right and in order for this to be about probably just vision for each um x. pat we just need that the w. some to one so 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1343	3751.98	3753.97	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so they can be for example you know 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1344	3755.12	3760.03	D	Grad	s	-1	0	you get that point one point the point too and point for say 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1345	3761.45	3761.78	E	Grad	s	-1	0	it's 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1346	3762.39	3763.08	D	Grad	s^m	-1	0	and that'd be one so 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1347	3764.06	3766.36	D	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	that um also seems to work fine 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1348	3767.88	3768.87	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	so and um 
Bed008.C.dialogueact1349	3768.98	3776.55	C	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	so it just just to make sure i understand so in this case um we would still compute the average um 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1350	3777.1	3778.13	D	Grad	s^na	+1	0	your computer aided average so probably 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1351	3778.13	3781.51	D	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	it would be so in this so probably if you would be uh 
Bed008.C.dialogueact1352	3778.72	3779.37	C	Grad	s^bk|%--	-1	0	so probably if 
Bed008.C.dialogueact1353	3780.78	3789.19	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	point three it would be so in this case the probably the why equal day would be that'd be one times or eight or you would be uh 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1354	3788.01	3788.77	A	Grad	s	-1	0	three that'd be one times 
Bed008.C.dialogueact1355	3789.19	3789.93	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	or eight or 
Bed008.C.dialogueact1356	3789.98	3790.26	C	Grad	s	-1	0	or eight or see one full quarter times 
Bed008.C.dialogueact1357	3790.26	3791.8	C	Grad	s	-1	0	see one full quarter times point one 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1358	3792.58	3793.21	D	Grad	s^ar^m	-1	0	not one chorus so these 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1360	3793.45	3793.66	A	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	so these 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1359	3793.21	3796.72	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so these numbers and if there's a point one point two point two one point four 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1361	3797.81	3799.39	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so you can do these is gone 
Bed008.C.dialogueact1362	3799.96	3800.31	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.D.dialogueact1363	3804.48	3805.26	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	probably 
Bed008.C.dialogueact1364	3808.82	3809.03	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.D.dialogueact1365	3809.31	3809.85	D	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.D.dialogueact1366	3811.93	3812.2	D	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.D.dialogueact1367	3813.42	3813.76	D	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.D.dialogueact1368	3814.96	3815.52	D	Grad	fg	-1	0	so all right 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1369	3815.8	3816.19	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	all right so this 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1370	3816.73	3818.18	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so this is uh step too so 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1371	3818.92	3823.97	D	Grad	s	+1	1	so the next possibility is that um we've given just a single we teach expert right 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1372	3823.97	3824.2	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	teach expert right whereas it might be the 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1373	3824.2	3832.32	D	Grad	s	+1	1	whereas it might be the case that um in certain situations one of the experts is more uh reliable in certain situations the other expert is more liable 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1374	3833.63	3838.52	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	so the way this is handled is by what's called a of expert so um 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1375	3838.52	3841.22	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so um what you can have is 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1376	3845.33	3846.71	D	Grad	s	-1	0	you augment his diagrams be so 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1377	3846.71	3847.02	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	be so 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1378	3852.09	3853.84	D	Grad	s	+1	0	have a new thing called h. okay 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1379	3853.94	3854.29	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	called h. okay is a hidden variables 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1380	3854.29	3855.16	D	Grad	s	+1	2	is a hidden variables 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1381	3858.75	3863.54	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and what this is is good guesses input from x. when next to it phoenix for and what it 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1382	3863.54	3867.99	D	Grad	s	+1	1	for and what it does is it decides which of the x. places be trusted in this particular situation 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1383	3868.81	3869.06	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right and then um 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1384	3869.48	3876.85	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and then um these guys all um come here 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1385	3877.53	3877.76	D	Grad	s^bk.%	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.D.dialogueact1386	3878.65	3880.46	D	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	so this is like the uh more complicated so 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1387	3880.94	3886.95	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so what's going on is that um the station or the looks of these before bodies of those guys and 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1388	3886.95	3893.34	D	Grad	qw	-1	0	bodies of those guys and decides and giving these values which of these isn't likely to be more libel where most level 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1389	3894.36	3897.22	D	Grad	s	+1	0	so it's produces some you know it produces a number either one two or three 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1390	3897.22	3899.71	D	Grad	s	+1	0	either one two or three or four in our situation right 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1391	3899.71	3899.95	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	our situation right 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1392	3900.4	3902.92	D	Grad	s	-1	0	now this guy he looks at the value of h. 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1393	3903.28	3903.83	D	Grad	s	-1	0	states too 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1394	3904.21	3907.21	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and then he just selects d. uh 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1395	3911.36	3912.83	D	Grad	s	-1	0	that's all there is to say i guess what 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1397	3919.07	3920.73	D	Grad	s^bk|s.%-	-1	0	so you can have um make sure that 
Bed008.E.dialogueact1396	3918.8	3919.04	E	Grad	b	-1	0	right so you can have um 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1398	3941.59	3941.89	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1399	3955.08	3959.97	A	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	so the function of the thing that comes out of the h. is very different from the function of the other in place 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1400	3961.25	3963.01	A	Grad	s	-1	0	it's driving how the other four interpreted 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1401	3963.53	3963.68	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.D.dialogueact1402	3963.75	3963.91	D	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bed008.C.dialogueact1404	3978.71	3981.64	C	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	o. h. passes of actor on to the next note could 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1405	3981.32	3982.02	D	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	it could could 
Bed008.C.dialogueact1406	3981.86	3982.78	C	Grad	qw^br^rt	-1	0	it could could 
Bed008.C.dialogueact1407	3984.17	3986.42	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	a factor of the weights is yeah i could 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1408	3985.47	3986.0	D	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	is yeah i could 
Bed008.C.dialogueact1409	3986.42	3986.5	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.D.dialogueact1410	3987.79	3988.2	D	Grad	s^fa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.A.dialogueact1411	3991.57	3993.63	A	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	well doctor it three zeros and one one 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1412	3993.93	3994.12	A	Grad	qy^d^g	-1	0	and one one 
Bed008.C.dialogueact1413	4001.96	4005.19	C	Grad	s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	so it's basically tell the bottom know to which one of the situations that thin or which 
Bed008.C.dialogueact1414	4005.53	4007.6	C	Grad	qrr.%-	-1	0	or which one of the waiting's systems 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1415	4008.51	4011.77	D	Grad	s^aa|s.%-	-1	0	wow just if you want to pay attention to more than one you could right so i mean the way you this 
Bed008.C.dialogueact1416	4009.43	4013.98	C	Grad	s	+1	1	wow just if you want to pay attention to more than one you could pass awaiting system though too could i mean the way you this 
Bed008.C.dialogueact1417	4013.98	4014.32	C	Grad	qy^g^rt	-1	0	system though too could near 
Bed008.C.dialogueact1418	4024.07	4024.39	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1419	4026.4	4031.51	A	Grad	qr.%--	-1	0	does you have to have another input to tell it alpha beta or whatever or is uh that's 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1420	4031.86	4034.41	A	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	is uh that's determined by what the experts are saying like the type of such 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1421	4034.41	4035.25	A	Grad	s^e.%-	-1	0	saying like the type of such a okay 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1422	4035.25	4035.63	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	a okay 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1423	4036.12	4036.23	A	Grad	b.%	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed008.A.dialogueact1424	4038.74	4038.99	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bed008.A.dialogueact1426	4047.12	4055.68	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	it it just seems that like without that that outside input do you got a situation where you know like if if uh x. one says no you know low 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1427	4055.68	4057.4	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	no you know low value coming out of x. or if if 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1428	4057.4	4059.95	A	Grad	s	-1	0	or if if x. one says no then ignore x. one you 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1429	4059.95	4060.23	A	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	x. one you know i mean that seems like 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1430	4060.23	4063.28	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	know i mean that seems like be weird right yeah well could be things like an x. two x. t. c.

Bed008.D.dialogueact1469	4322.87	4323.7	D	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	yeah but that's my question like hardly 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1470	4323.7	4329.9	D	Grad	qw	-1	0	that's my question like hardly mean hardly of data but something like um um and point sub e.

Bed008.D.dialogueact1483	4572.0	4573.17	D	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	you bring up the function thing 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1484	4581.39	4584.33	D	Grad	fh|qw.%-	-1	0	uh what is the thing that allows you to this

Bed008.C.dialogueact1486	4586.86	4587.5	C	Grad	qy^g	-1	0	it variables 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1487	4590.95	4591.86	D	Grad	s	-1	0	oh function properties and that

Bed008.D.dialogueact1489	4597.48	4598.37	D	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	i guess not

Bed008.D.dialogueact1494	4617.1	4620.45	D	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	and um it so it either it allows do everything which i think is on 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1495	4620.45	4621.5	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	everything which i think is on like me thing more likely 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1496	4621.5	4623.64	D	Grad	s	-1	0	like me thing more likely less to do a few of these things 
Bed008.D.dialogueact1497	4624.01	4631.81	D	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	and that gives me enough to um just right up the the things that i used to uh create such c. d.'s on your own and java based format

Bed008.A.dialogueact1529	4993.45	4993.92	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1530	4994.56	4996.43	A	Grad	s	-1	0	what the figure i was thinking about this figure that we talk about fifty constructions 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1531	4996.43	4997.5	A	Grad	s	-1	0	talk about fifty constructions or whatever that's uh that's

Bed008.A.dialogueact1534	5007.61	5012.08	A	Grad	s	+1	1	so i mean i know we're going for sort of uh rough-and-ready

Bed008.A.dialogueact1539	5033.68	5038.12	A	Grad	s	-1	0	i mean i i i was i was talking about the you know if you wanted to do it really in detail and we don't really need all 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1540	5038.12	5040.5	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and we don't really need all the detail for we're doing right now but anyway 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1541	5040.78	5043.3	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	right now but anyway in terms of just narrowing that task you know which fifty 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1542	5043.6	5044.59	A	Grad	qh	-1	0	which fifty do i do i want to see 
Bed008.A.dialogueact1543	5044.59	5046.29	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	do i do i want to see what people are using so

Bed008.A.dialogueact1545	5051.54	5052.78	A	Grad	s	-1	0	well it will inspire me
