Bmr005.E.dialogueact0	1.447	1.907	E	Professor	z	-1	0	So .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1	3.006	4.506	E	Professor	z	-1	0	OK . Doesn't look like it crashed .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact2	4.506	4.966	E	Professor	z	-1	0	That 's great .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact3	7.741	12.191	G	Grad	z	-1	0	So I think maybe what 's causing it to crash is I keep starting it and then stopping it to see if it 's working .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact4	12.451	15.741	G	Grad	z	-1	0	And so I think starting it and then stopping it and starting it again causes it to crash .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact5	16.497	17.867	G	Grad	z	-1	0	So , I won't do that anymore .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact6	18.393	24.713	B	Postdoc	z	-1	0	And it looks like you 've found a way of uh mapping the location to the {disfmarker} without having people have to give their names each time ?
Bmr005.A.dialogueact7	22.454	23.944	A	PhD	z	-1	0	Sounds like an initialization thing .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact8	24.713	25.823	B	Postdoc	z	-1	0	I mean it 's like you have the {disfmarker}
Bmr005.B.dialogueact10	26.053	26.883	B	Postdoc	z	-1	0	So you know that {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact9	25.992	26.712	G	Grad	z	-1	0	No .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact11	27.203	29.503	B	Postdoc	z	-1	0	I mean , are you going to write down {pause} that I sat here ?
Bmr005.G.dialogueact12	28.576	30.936	G	Grad	z	-1	0	I 'm gonna collect the digit forms and write it down .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact13	31.381	31.581	B	Postdoc	z	-1	0	OK .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact14	31.875	32.355	C	PhD	z	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact15	32.513	32.763	G	Grad	z	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact16	33.433	34.683	G	Grad	z	-1	0	So they should be right
Bmr005.G.dialogueact17	36.666	37.846	G	Grad	z	-1	0	with what 's on the digit forms .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact18	38.106	39.736	G	Grad	z	-1	0	OK , so I 'll go ahead and start with digits .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact19	44.643	44.703	G	Grad	z	-1	0	u
Bmr005.G.dialogueact20	72.405	76.415	G	Grad	z	-1	0	And I should say that uh , you just pau you just read each line an and then pause briefly .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact21	77.85	79.42	E	Professor	z	-1	0	And start by giving the transcript number .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact23	205.622	206.022	A	PhD	z	-1	0	Tran
Bmr005.D.dialogueact22	205.56	207.25	D	PhD	z	-1	0	Transcript {disfmarker} Uh . OK , OK .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact24	206.532	207.662	A	PhD	z	-1	0	Oh sorry , go ahead .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact25	356.469	360.889	E	Professor	s^j	-1	0	So uh , you see , Don , the unbridled excitement of the work that we have on this project .
Bmr005.H.dialogueact26	360.228	360.568	H	Grad	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact27	360.949	362.299	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	It 's just uh {disfmarker}
Bmr005.H.dialogueact28	363.429	363.509	H	Grad	b	-1	0	Umh .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact29	368.09	373.54	E	Professor	h|s^na	-1	0	Uh , you know , it doesn't seem like a bad idea to have {comment} that information .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact30	371.619	373.919	G	Grad	s	-1	0	And I 'm surprised I sort of {disfmarker} I 'm surprised I forgot that ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact32	374.44	377.22	E	Professor	s^bk|s.%-	-1	0	Yeah , I {disfmarker} I 'd {disfmarker} I think it 's some
Bmr005.G.dialogueact31	374.009	376.229	G	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	but uh I think that would be a good thing to add .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact33	376.739	378.569	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	After I just printed out a zillion of them .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact34	379.457	380.387	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Yeah , well , that 's {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact35	381.027	383.727	E	Professor	s^t	-1	0	Um , so I {disfmarker} I do have a {disfmarker} a an agenda suggestion .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact36	383.937	393.537	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , we {disfmarker} I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points
Bmr005.E.dialogueact37	394.147	401.887	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and um I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we {disfmarker} we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that 's easier to get out of the way
Bmr005.E.dialogueact38	401.887	405.657	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact39	406.197	408.647	E	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	So {vocalsound} uh I 'm suggesting we turn it around
Bmr005.E.dialogueact40	408.647	418.077	E	Professor	s^co	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and uh sort of we have {disfmarker} anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later , uh hold them for a bit , and let 's talk about the {disfmarker} the research - y kind of things .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact41	419.187	438.83	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	2	Um , so um the one th one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a {disfmarker} a couple weeks before um uh about the uh {disfmarker} the stuff you were doing with {disfmarker} with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact42	438.83	441.43	E	Professor	s:s	-1	0	we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by " events "
Bmr005.E.dialogueact43	441.43	447.5	E	Professor	s:s	+1	0	but I think , you know , what we had meant by " events " I guess was uh points of overlap between speakers .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact44	447.87	455.27	E	Professor	s	-1	0	But I th I gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you also mean uh interruptions with something else
Bmr005.D.dialogueact46	455.295	455.465	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact45	455.27	456.42	E	Professor	s^e	-1	0	like some other noise .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact48	456.81	457.54	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Uh - huh . Yeah .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact47	456.76	457.22	E	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Yes ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact49	457.51	458.81	E	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	You mean that as an event also .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact51	459.29	459.53	D	PhD	%--	-1	0	To
Bmr005.E.dialogueact50	458.81	461.89	E	Professor	s	-1	0	So at any rate you were {disfmarker} you 've {disfmarker} you 've done some work on that
Bmr005.D.dialogueact52	459.53	459.86	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact53	462.19	473.546	E	Professor	fh|s^cs^t	+1	0	and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh areas that uh we 're thinking about doing .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact54	473.736	480.157	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um , I think especially since you {disfmarker} you haven't been in {disfmarker} in these meetings for a little bit ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact55	480.157	484.237	E	Professor	s^t	-1	0	maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact56	484.837	492.737	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	uh and one of the things I know that also came up uh is some discussions that {disfmarker} that uh {disfmarker} that uh Jane had with Lokendra
Bmr005.E.dialogueact57	493.277	497.537	E	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	uh about some {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some um uh work about
Bmr005.E.dialogueact58	499.02	501.79	E	Professor	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I d I {disfmarker} I don't want to try to say cuz I {disfmarker} I 'll say it wrong ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact59	501.93	506.56	E	Professor	s	+1	2	but anyway some {disfmarker} some potential collaboration there about {disfmarker} about the {disfmarker} about the {disfmarker} working with these data .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact60	506.776	507.016	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact62	507.116	507.356	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Sure .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact61	506.8	507.04	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact63	508.11	509.08	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	So , uh .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact64	509.128	510.108	G	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	You wanna just go around ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact65	511.125	516.265	E	Professor	h|s^nd	-1	0	Uh . {pause} Well , I don't know if we {disfmarker} if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact66	516.265	520.015	E	Professor	s^df^e	-1	0	I think there 's just just a couple {disfmarker} a couple people primarily
Bmr005.E.dialogueact67	520.275	521.895	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	um but um
Bmr005.E.dialogueact68	523.558	525.168	E	Professor	fh|qh^cs.%--	-1	0	Uh , wh why don't {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact69	525.788	528.358	E	Professor	s	-1	0	Actually I think that {disfmarker} that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly
Bmr005.E.dialogueact70	528.358	530.308	E	Professor	qh^cs	-1	0	so why don't you {disfmarker} you start with that .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact71	530.35	530.64	B	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact72	531.35	532.28	B	Postdoc	qy^rt^t	-1	0	Shall I {disfmarker} shall I just start ?
Bmr005.B.dialogueact74	532.28	532.49	B	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact73	531.86	532.99	E	Professor	s^aa|s^co	-1	0	Yeah , just explain what it was .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact75	532.98	542.069	B	Postdoc	fh|s	+1	2	Um , so , uh , he was interested in the question of {disfmarker} you know , relating to his {disfmarker} to the research he presented recently , um of inference structures ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact76	542.069	552.751	B	Postdoc	fh|s^e	+1	0	and uh , the need to build in , um , this {disfmarker} this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact77	552.751	555.531	B	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And he gave the example in his talk about how {pause} um ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact78	555.531	558.311	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	e a I 'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact79	558.371	565.381	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but it 's something about how um , i " Joe slipped " you know , " John had washed the floor " or something like that .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact80	565.381	566.311	B	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	And I don't have it quite right ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact81	566.311	567.181	B	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	but that kind of thing ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact82	567.181	570.561	B	Postdoc	s^rt:s	-1	0	where you have to draw the inference that , OK , there 's this time sequence ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact83	570.907	578.437	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but also the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the causal aspects of the uh floor and {disfmarker} and how it might have been the cause of the fall
Bmr005.B.dialogueact84	578.437	582.435	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and that um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it
Bmr005.B.dialogueact85	582.435	583.605	B	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	and it {disfmarker} {comment} These sorts of things .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact86	583.665	590.225	B	Postdoc	fh|s	+1	1	So , I looked through the transcript that we have so far , {comment} and um , fou identified a couple different types of things of that type
Bmr005.B.dialogueact87	590.425	603.915	B	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	and um , one of them was something like uh , during the course of the transcript , um um , w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact88	604.523	610.358	B	Postdoc	fh|s:qy	-1	0	and um , the question was raised " Well , should we restart the recording at this point ? "
Bmr005.B.dialogueact89	611.038	618.068	B	Postdoc	fh|s:s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and Dan Ellis said , " Well , we 're just so far ahead of the game right now {pause} we really don't need to " .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact90	618.068	620.808	B	Postdoc	qh	-1	0	Now , how would you interpret that without a lot of inference ?
Bmr005.B.dialogueact91	620.808	624.828	B	Postdoc	fh|s:s	-1	0	So , the inferences that are involved are things like , OK , so , how do you interpret " ahead of the game " ?
Bmr005.B.dialogueact92	625.218	634.578	B	Postdoc	fh|s^co^rt	-1	0	You know . So it 's the {disfmarker} it 's {pause} i What you {disfmarker} what you int what you draw {disfmarker} you know , the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording ,
Bmr005.G.dialogueact93	626.266	627.176	G	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Hmm , metaphorically .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact94	635.245	639.835	B	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	that um , i that {pause} i we have enough space ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact95	640.005	643.875	B	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	and he continues , like " we 're so ahead of the game cuz now we have built - in downsampling " .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact96	644.595	650.685	B	Postdoc	s^co:s	-1	0	So you have to sort of get the idea that um , " ahead of the game " is sp speaking with respect to space limitations ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact97	650.685	655.885	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that um that in fact downsampling is gaining us enough space ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact98	656.225	659.095	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and that therefore we can keep the recording we 've done so far .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact99	660.539	661.989	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But there are a lot of different things like that .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact100	662.285	666.985	G	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	So , do you think his interest is in using this as {pause} a data source ,
Bmr005.G.dialogueact101	666.985	670.745	G	Grad	qrr^rt	-1	0	or {pause} training material ,
Bmr005.G.dialogueact102	670.745	671.265	G	Grad	qrr	-1	0	or what ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact103	671.368	675.328	E	Professor	fg|s^df	-1	0	Well , I {disfmarker} I should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that I had with him ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact104	675.578	680.188	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	2	so um we were trying to think of ways that his interests could interact with ours
Bmr005.G.dialogueact105	679.523	679.943	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact106	680.388	700.788	E	Professor	fh|s^cs.x	+1	1	and um uh I thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data , uh and um such things might be useful for that in or before we invested too much uh effort into that he should uh , with Jane 's help , look into some of the data that we 're {disfmarker} already have
Bmr005.E.dialogueact108	701.388	703.218	E	Professor	s^e:qy	-1	0	and see , is there anything to this at all ?
Bmr005.G.dialogueact107	700.957	701.327	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact109	703.718	708.058	E	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	Is there any point which you think that , you know , you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact110	708.058	713.858	E	Professor	s^df.%--:s	-1	0	Cuz it could be that you 'd look through it and you say " well , this is just the wrong {pause} task for {disfmarker} for him to pursue his {disfmarker} "
Bmr005.G.dialogueact111	711.618	711.888	G	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Wrong ,
Bmr005.G.dialogueact112	712.288	712.518	G	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact113	714.104	724.194	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	And {disfmarker} and uh I got the impression from your mail that in fact there was enough things like this just in the little sample that {disfmarker} that you looked at that {disfmarker} that it 's plausible at least .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact114	723.885	724.555	B	Postdoc	s^am	-1	0	It 's possible .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact115	724.805	729.345	B	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	Uh , he was {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} We met and he was gonna go and uh you know , y look through them more systematically
Bmr005.E.dialogueact116	724.824	725.024	E	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact117	729.615	731.155	B	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	and then uh meet again .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact118	729.889	730.109	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact119	731.155	732.875	B	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	So it 's , you know , not a matter of a {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact120	732.711	732.901	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact121	733.578	736.432	B	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	But , yeah , I think {disfmarker} I think it was optimistic .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact122	735.493	740.463	E	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	So anyway , that 's {disfmarker} that 's e a quite different thing from anything we 've talked about that , you know , might {disfmarker} might {disfmarker} might come out from some of this .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact123	741.327	742.867	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	But he can use text , basically .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact124	744.294	746.724	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , he 's talking about just using text
Bmr005.B.dialogueact125	744.888	745.568	B	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	That 's his major {disfmarker}
Bmr005.B.dialogueact126	747.491	752.001	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mentioned several that w had to do with implications drawn from intonational contours
Bmr005.C.dialogueact127	747.554	748.024	C	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	pretty much ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact128	748.024	748.284	C	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bmr005.B.dialogueact129	752.001	754.691	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and {pause} that wasn't as directly relevant to what he 's doing .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact131	755.051	756.921	B	Postdoc	s^e	+1	2	He 's interested in these {disfmarker} these knowledge structures ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact130	754.809	755.159	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact132	755.292	756.372	D	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Yeah , interesting .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact133	756.921	759.161	B	Postdoc	s^e	+1	2	inferences that you draw {pause} i from {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact134	759.585	760.735	E	Professor	fg|s^cs.x	-1	0	I mean , he certainly could use text ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact135	760.735	767.295	E	Professor	s^df	+1	0	but we were in fact looking to see if there {disfmarker} is there {disfmarker} is there something in common between our interest in meetings and his interest in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in this stuff .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact136	767.765	767.965	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact137	770.062	778.352	G	Grad	s	-1	0	And I imagine that transcripts of speech {disfmarker} I mean text that is speech {disfmarker} probably has more of those than sort of prepared writing .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact138	778.922	781.292	G	Grad	s^no.x	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I don't know whether it would or not , but it seems like it would .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact139	779.635	780.075	E	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I don't know ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact140	780.265	783.605	E	Professor	s	-1	0	probably de probably depends on what the prepared writing was .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact141	784.215	784.365	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	But .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact142	785.291	786.741	B	Postdoc	s^bk|s^nd	-1	0	Yeah , I don't think I would make that leap ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact143	786.741	791.511	B	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because i in narratives , you know {disfmarker} I mean , if you spell out everything in a narrative , it can be really tedious ,
Bmr005.G.dialogueact144	786.965	787.305	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact145	791.641	791.911	B	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	so .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact146	791.925	795.245	G	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , I 'm just thinking , you know , when you 're {disfmarker} when you 're face to face , you have a lot of backchannel
Bmr005.G.dialogueact147	795.245	797.043	G	Grad	%-	-1	0	and {disfmarker} And {disfmarker}
Bmr005.B.dialogueact148	796.36	796.64	B	Postdoc	s^fe	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact149	796.93	797.7	B	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	That aspect .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact150	797.503	797.913	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact151	797.913	803.353	G	Grad	s	-1	0	And so I think it 's just easier to do that sort of broad inference jumping if it 's face to face .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact152	803.353	808.383	G	Grad	s^rt:s	-1	0	I mean , so , if I just read that Dan was saying " we 're ahead of the game " {comment} in that {disfmarker} in that context ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact153	804.051	804.241	B	Postdoc	%	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bmr005.B.dialogueact154	808.454	808.684	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact155	808.933	812.993	G	Grad	s.x	-1	0	I might not realize that he was talking about disk space as opposed to anything else .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact156	813.38	817.1	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} you know , I {disfmarker} I had several that had to do with backchannels and this wasn't one of them .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact157	816.146	816.446	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact158	817.1	820.33	B	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	This {disfmarker} this one really does um m make you leap from {disfmarker}
Bmr005.B.dialogueact159	820.51	823.82	B	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	So he said , you know , " we 're ahead of the game , w we have built - in downsampling " .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact160	823.734	824.044	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact161	824.861	828.271	B	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	And the inference , i if you had it written down , would be {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact162	827.576	828.536	G	Grad	s^2	-1	0	I guess it would be the same .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact163	828.627	828.867	B	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact164	828.987	830.357	B	Postdoc	s^arp	-1	0	But there are others that have backchannelling ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact165	830.357	832.037	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it 's just he was less interested in those .
Bmr005.F.dialogueact166	830.699	830.959	F	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	Can I {disfmarker}
Bmr005.F.dialogueact167	832.743	833.513	F	PhD	s^fa	-1	0	Sorry to interrupt .
Bmr005.F.dialogueact168	833.513	841.118	F	PhD	fh|s.x	-1	0	Um , I f f f I 've {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} d A minute {disfmarker} uh , several minutes ago , I , like , briefly was {disfmarker} was not listening
Bmr005.F.dialogueact169	841.118	843.218	F	PhD	qw^rt.x:s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} So who is " he " in this context ?
Bmr005.C.dialogueact170	843.28	844.8	C	PhD	fg|s^j.%-	-1	0	Yeah , there 's a lot of pronoun {disfmarker}
Bmr005.F.dialogueact171	844.23	844.65	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	OK .
Bmr005.F.dialogueact172	844.99	855.73	F	PhD	s:s	+1	0	So I was just realizing we 've {disfmarker} You guys have been talking about " he " um for at least uh , I don't know , three {disfmarker} three four minutes without ever mentioning the person 's name again .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact173	845.728	846.138	C	PhD	%	-1	0	I believe it .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact174	855.974	860.302	C	PhD	fg|s:s	+1	0	Yeah . Actually to make it worse , {comment} uh , Morgan uses " you " and " you "
Bmr005.F.dialogueact175	856.366	866.614	F	PhD	s^ba	+1	1	So this is {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} gonna be a big , big problem if you want to later do uh , you know , indexing , or speech understanding of any sort .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact176	856.638	857.418	G	Grad	s^ng^rt	-1	0	It 's in my notes .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact177	861.242	863.162	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	with gaze and no identification ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact178	863.162	863.202	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact179	866.269	867.059	C	PhD	s.x	-1	0	I just wrote this down .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact181	867.619	870.179	C	PhD	s^aa|s^df.x:s	-1	0	Yeah , actually . Cuz Morgan will say well , " you had some ideas "
Bmr005.D.dialogueact182	867.637	868.237	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.F.dialogueact180	867.423	867.963	F	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt.x	-1	0	You just wrote this ?
Bmr005.C.dialogueact183	870.179	871.739	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and he never said Li - He looked {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact184	871.862	873.242	G	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Well , I think he 's doing that intentionally ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact185	873.122	873.382	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact187	873.442	873.962	C	PhD	s^ba^rt	-1	0	so it 's great .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact186	873.242	873.622	G	Grad	qy^g^rt	-1	0	aren't you ?
Bmr005.C.dialogueact189	874.052	874.902	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	So this is really great
Bmr005.F.dialogueact188	873.766	874.186	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact191	874.902	879.532	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because the thing is , because he 's looking at the per even for addressees in the conversation ,
Bmr005.D.dialogueact190	874.444	874.704	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.F.dialogueact192	878.627	879.287	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact193	880.102	881.762	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	I bet you could pick that up in the acoustics .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact194	882.262	885.822	C	PhD	s^df^rt	-1	0	Just because your gaze is also correlated with the directionality of your voice .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact195	884.592	884.922	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact196	885.622	885.962	E	Professor	s^am	-1	0	Could be .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact199	886.246	886.706	B	Postdoc	qy.%-	-1	0	Can we
Bmr005.E.dialogueact197	885.962	886.812	E	Professor	s^aa.%-	-1	0	Yeah . That would be tou
Bmr005.G.dialogueact198	886.083	887.173	G	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Oh , that would be interesting .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact201	887.033	889.943	C	PhD	s^aa|s.%-	-1	0	Yeah , so that , I mean , to even know um when {disfmarker}
Bmr005.D.dialogueact200	886.732	887.022	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact202	890.944	898.289	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Yeah , if you have the P Z Ms you should be able to pick up what a person is looking at from their voice .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact203	898.539	902.769	G	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , especially with Morgan , with the way we have the microphones arranged . I 'm sort of right on axis
Bmr005.G.dialogueact204	902.769	904.169	G	Grad	s	-1	0	and it would be very hard to tell .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact205	904.745	905.095	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact206	904.759	905.069	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact207	905.374	906.204	B	Postdoc	s^arp.%-	-1	0	Oh , but you 'd have the {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact208	905.475	906.815	C	PhD	s^co	-1	0	Put Morgan always like this
Bmr005.B.dialogueact210	906.922	907.842	B	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	You 'd have fainter {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact209	906.815	907.085	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr005.B.dialogueact212	907.842	909.422	B	Postdoc	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	Wouldn't you get fainter reception out here ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact211	907.366	908.326	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	Well , these {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact213	910.183	912.333	G	Grad	s^aap^rt.%--	-1	0	Sure , but I think if I 'm talking like this ?
Bmr005.G.dialogueact214	912.423	913.783	G	Grad	s	-1	0	Right now I 'm looking at Jane and talking ,
Bmr005.G.dialogueact215	913.783	915.103	G	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	now I 'm looking at Chuck and talking ,
Bmr005.G.dialogueact216	915.103	917.233	G	Grad	s	-1	0	I don't think the microphones would pick up that difference .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact217	916.427	918.217	C	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	But you don't have this {disfmarker} this problem .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact218	918.885	919.095	B	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact219	919.937	921.547	C	PhD	s^j	-1	0	Morgan is the one who does this most .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact220	921.094	923.494	G	Grad	s	-1	0	So if I 'm talking at you , or I 'm talking at you .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact221	924.085	932.825	E	Professor	s^df.x	-1	0	I probably been affect No , I th I think I 've been affected by too many conversations where we were talking about lawyers and talking about {disfmarker} and concerns about " oh gee is somebody going to say something bad ? " and so on .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact222	927.419	928.039	G	Grad	s^2^rt	-1	0	Lawyers .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact223	933.205	937.005	E	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	And so I {disfmarker} so I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm tending to stay away from people 's names even though uh {disfmarker}
Bmr005.B.dialogueact224	935.845	936.355	B	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	I am too .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact225	936.575	940.705	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Even though you could pick up later on , just from the acoustics who you were t who you were looking at .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact226	939.231	939.781	B	Postdoc	s^r	-1	0	I am too .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact227	940.498	942.228	G	Grad	s:s	-1	0	And we did mention who " he " was .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact228	943.288	943.588	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact230	943.328	943.578	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.F.dialogueact231	943.598	944.528	F	PhD	s^aa|s^df	-1	0	Right , but I missed it .

Bmr005.F.dialogueact232	944.618	945.248	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	But {disfmarker} it was uh {disfmarker}

Bmr005.E.dialogueact238	946.299	947.359	E	Professor	s^ar|%-	-1	0	Yeah . No no , there 's {disfmarker}
Bmr005.F.dialogueact237	945.888	946.268	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact236	945.662	947.342	G	Grad	qrr	-1	0	or {disfmarker} or is that just too sensitive ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact239	947.639	949.079	E	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	No no , it isn't sensitive at all .

Bmr005.B.dialogueact242	952.138	954.378	B	Postdoc	s^nd	+1	1	And in fact , it is {disfmarker} it is {disfmarker} it is sensitive .

Bmr005.C.dialogueact245	952.646	953.796	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	it 's interesting .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact243	952.189	952.639	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	It 's OK to {disfmarker}
Bmr005.B.dialogueact246	954.378	958.508	B	Postdoc	s^t	+1	0	I {disfmarker} I came up with something from the Human Subjects people that I wanted to mention .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact247	958.508	960.208	B	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	I mean , it fits into the m area of the mundane ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact248	960.208	960.998	B	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	but they did say {disfmarker}
Bmr005.B.dialogueact249	961.218	968.358	B	Postdoc	s:s	+1	1	You know , I asked her very specifically about this clause of how , um , you know , it says " no individuals will be identified
Bmr005.B.dialogueact250	969.778	971.408	B	Postdoc	fh|s^e:s	-1	0	uh , " in any publication using the data . "
Bmr005.B.dialogueact251	971.408	973.408	B	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	OK , well , individuals being identified ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact252	973.408	980.728	B	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	let 's say you have a {disfmarker} a snippet that says , " Joe s uh thinks such - and - such about {disfmarker} about this field , but I think he 's wrongheaded . "
Bmr005.B.dialogueact253	980.828	983.588	B	Postdoc	s^cc:s	-1	0	Now I mean , we 're {disfmarker} we 're gonna be careful not to have the " wrongheaded " part in there ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact254	983.588	990.988	B	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but you know , let 's say we say , you know , " Joe used to think so - and - so about this area , in his publication he says that but I think he 's changed his mind . " or whatever .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact256	991.438	1001.36	B	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	Then the issue of {disfmarker} of being able to trace Joe , because we know he 's well - known in this field , and all this and {disfmarker} and tie it to the speaker , whose name was just mentioned a moment ago , can be sensitive .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact255	991.048	991.548	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	b But I {disfmarker}
Bmr005.B.dialogueact257	1001.36	1006.25	B	Postdoc	s^bs^cs	-1	0	So I think it 's really {disfmarker} really kind of adaptive and wise to not mention names any more than we have to
Bmr005.B.dialogueact258	1006.25	1011.11	B	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because if there 's a slanderous aspect to it , then how much to we wanna be able to have to remove ?

Bmr005.D.dialogueact392	1358.47	1358.7	D	PhD	qy^bh^rt	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bmr005.G.dialogueact393	1360.57	1361.53	G	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Is there an event right here ?
Bmr005.D.dialogueact394	1362.22	1363.2	D	PhD	h|s^ar	-1	0	Eh no . No no .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact395	1363.52	1364.87	D	PhD	s	-1	0	For me is the overlapping zone ,
Bmr005.D.dialogueact396	1365.31	1373.22	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because {disfmarker} because you {disfmarker} you have s you have more one {disfmarker} eh , more one voice eh , eh produced in a {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in a moment .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact398	1365.88	1366.38	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact397	1365.44	1367.9	G	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	So i if two or more people are talking .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact399	1372.18	1372.42	E	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact400	1373.43	1376.06	E	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah . So I think {disfmarker} Yeah . We just wanted to understand how you 're defining it .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact401	1374.95	1375.26	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact403	1376.13	1376.55	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	If
Bmr005.E.dialogueact402	1376.06	1383.93	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	So then , in the region between {disfmarker} since there {disfmarker} there is some continuous region , in between regions where there is only one person speaking .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact404	1383.56	1384.2	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact405	1383.93	1386.75	E	Professor	s^bu	+1	0	And one contiguous region like that you 're calling an event .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact407	1387.0	1387.33	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact406	1386.75	1390.36	E	Professor	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	Is it {disfmarker} Are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event ,
Bmr005.D.dialogueact408	1387.58	1387.78	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact409	1390.42	1393.2	E	Professor	qrr	-1	0	or are you calling the entire length of it the event ?
Bmr005.D.dialogueact410	1393.37	1397.51	D	PhD	s	+1	0	I consider the {disfmarker} the , nnn {disfmarker} the nnn , nnn {disfmarker} eh , the entirety
Bmr005.D.dialogueact411	1397.51	1401.86	D	PhD	s^df	+1	0	eh , eh , all {disfmarker} all the time there were {disfmarker} the voice has overlapped .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact412	1402.22	1402.49	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact413	1403.14	1403.73	D	PhD	s	-1	0	This is the idea .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact414	1403.99	1408.63	D	PhD	s	+1	0	But eh I {disfmarker} I don't distinguish between the {disfmarker} the numbers of eh speaker .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact415	1408.87	1418.11	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Uh , I 'm not considering {vocalsound} eh the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} ehm {vocalsound} eh , the fact of eh , eh , for example , what did you say ?
Bmr005.D.dialogueact416	1418.11	1422.72	D	PhD	fh|s^rt	-1	0	Eh at first eh , eh two talkers are uh , eh speaking ,

Bmr005.D.dialogueact418	1427.71	1436.31	D	PhD	s	-1	0	For me , it 's eh {disfmarker} it 's eh , all overlap zone , with eh several numbers of speakers is eh , eh the same acoustic event .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact419	1437.54	1444.69	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	Wi - but {disfmarker} uh , without any mark between the zone {disfmarker} of the overlapping zone with two speakers eh speaking together ,

Bmr005.D.dialogueact426	1453.83	1460.51	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Because eh {vocalsound} for me , is the {disfmarker} is the zone with eh some kind of eh distortion the spectral .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact425	1453.5	1453.79	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Got it .

Bmr005.D.dialogueact479	1527.7	1535.06	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and give you eh with the report eh from eh the {disfmarker} the study from the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the session {disfmarker} one session .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact480	1529.57	1529.75	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr005.D.dialogueact482	1535.47	1537.46	D	PhD	s	-1	0	And I {disfmarker} I found that eh another thing .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact483	1538.4	1545.18	D	PhD	s	-1	0	When eh {vocalsound} eh I w I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I was eh look at eh nnn , the difference speech file ,
Bmr005.D.dialogueact484	1546.03	1572.84	D	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um , for example , eh if eh we use the ehm {disfmarker} the mixed file , to {disfmarker} to transcribe , the {disfmarker} the events and the words , I {disfmarker} I saw that eh the eh speech signal , collected by the eh this kind of mike {disfmarker} eh of this kind of mike , eh are different from the eh mixed signal eh , we eh {disfmarker} collected by headphone .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact485	1566.51	1566.75	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact487	1573.31	1574.59	D	PhD	s^m	-1	0	And {disfmarker} It 's right .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact488	1573.34	1573.61	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact486	1573.04	1573.32	G	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact489	1574.66	1576.48	D	PhD	s	-1	0	But the problem is {vocalsound} the following .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact490	1577.16	1577.42	D	PhD	%--	-1	0	The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}
Bmr005.D.dialogueact491	1578.42	1583.1	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I knew that eh the signal eh , eh would be different ,
Bmr005.D.dialogueact492	1583.1	1597.29	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but eh the {disfmarker} the problem is eh , eh we eh detected eh difference events in the speech file eh collected by {disfmarker} by that mike uh qui compared with the mixed file .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact493	1597.92	1608.92	D	PhD	s	-1	0	And so if {disfmarker} when you transcribe eh only eh using the nnn {disfmarker} the mixed file , it 's possible {disfmarker} eh if you use the transcription to evaluate a different system ,
Bmr005.D.dialogueact494	1609.11	1612.35	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	it 's possible you eh {disfmarker} in the eh
Bmr005.D.dialogueact495	1612.35	1623.03	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	i and you use the eh speech file collected by the eh fet mike , to eh {disfmarker} to nnn {disfmarker} to do the experiments {pause} with the {disfmarker} the system ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact496	1621.43	1621.74	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact497	1622.5	1622.73	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact498	1623.36	1640.08	D	PhD	s	-1	0	its possible to evaluate eh , eh {disfmarker} or to consider eh acoustic events that {disfmarker} which you marked eh in the mixed file , but eh they don't appear in the eh speech signal eh collected by the {disfmarker} by the mike .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact499	1638.9	1639.04	G	Grad	fg	-1	0	Right .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact500	1639.35	1647.15	G	Grad	s^df	+1	0	The {disfmarker} the reason that I generated the mixed file was for IBM to do word level transcription , not speech event transcription .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact501	1643.67	1643.98	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact502	1645.0	1646.57	D	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Yeah . Oh , it 's a good idea .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact503	1646.57	1647.71	D	PhD	s^ba^r	-1	0	It 's a good idea I think .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact504	1647.93	1652.98	G	Grad	s	+1	0	So I agree that if someone wants to do speech event transcription , that the mixed signals here {disfmarker}
Bmr005.D.dialogueact505	1651.47	1651.84	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact506	1652.98	1658.84	G	Grad	s	+1	1	I mean , if I 'm tapping on the table , you it 's not gonna show up on any of the mikes , but it 's gonna show up rather loudly in the PZM .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact507	1656.84	1657.08	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact508	1657.97	1658.28	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact509	1658.49	1658.9	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact510	1659.71	1676.69	D	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	So and I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I say eh that eh , eh , or this eh only because eh I c I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in my opinion , it 's necessary to eh {disfmarker} to eh {disfmarker} to put the transcription on the speech file , collected by the objective signal .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact511	1659.9	1660.26	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact512	1676.98	1692.56	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the signal collected by the {disfmarker} eh , the real mike in the future , in the prototype to {disfmarker} to eh correct the initial eh segmentation eh with the eh real speech
Bmr005.E.dialogueact513	1677.02	1677.45	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact514	1682.38	1683.9	E	Professor	s^2	+1	1	The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the far - field ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact515	1684.03	1684.25	E	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact516	1692.56	1693.8	D	PhD	s^co	-1	0	you have to {disfmarker} to analyze {disfmarker}
Bmr005.D.dialogueact517	1693.93	1695.32	D	PhD	s^co	-1	0	you have to {disfmarker} to process .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact518	1697.23	1699.27	D	PhD	s^df	+1	1	Because I {disfmarker} I found a difference .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact519	1699.73	1709.4	E	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah , well , just {disfmarker} I mean , just in that {disfmarker} that one s ten second , or whatever it was , example that Adam had that {disfmarker} that we {disfmarker} we passed on to others a few months ago ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact520	1709.82	1714.1	E	Professor	s	-1	0	there was that business where I g I guess it was Adam and Jane were talking at the same time
Bmr005.E.dialogueact521	1714.1	1721.25	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and uh , in the close - talking mikes you couldn't hear the overlap , and in the distant mike you could .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact522	1721.25	1728.74	E	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	So yeah , it 's clear that if you wanna study {disfmarker} if you wanna find all the places where there were overlap , it 's probably better to use a distant mike .
Bmr005.F.dialogueact523	1722.69	1723.12	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That 's good .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact524	1728.74	1734.97	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	On the other hand , there 's other phenomena that are going on at the same time for which it might be useful to look at the close - talking mikes ,
Bmr005.D.dialogueact525	1734.93	1735.12	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact527	1735.44	1740.28	C	PhD	qw	-1	0	But why can't you use the combination of the close - talking mikes , time aligned ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact526	1734.97	1735.57	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	so it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact528	1739.63	1743.22	G	Grad	s^df	-1	0	If you use the combination of the close - talking mikes , you would hear Jane interrupting me ,
Bmr005.G.dialogueact529	1743.22	1744.68	G	Grad	s^df	-1	0	but you wouldn't hear the paper rustling .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact530	1745.3	1746.89	G	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	And so if you 're interested in {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact531	1746.44	1754.73	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I mean if you 're interested in speakers overlapping other speakers and not the other kinds of nonspeech , that 's not a problem ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact532	1746.58	1748.34	E	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	Some {comment} of it 's masking {disfmarker} masked .

Bmr005.G.dialogueact538	1755.65	1758.95	G	Grad	s^aap.%--	-1	0	Although the other issue is that the {pause} mixed close - talking mikes {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact540	1758.95	1761.61	G	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , I 'm doing weird normalizations and things like that .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact541	1761.96	1762.65	C	PhD	s^arp	-1	0	But it 's known .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact542	1762.19	1762.59	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact544	1763.02	1766.26	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	I mean , the normalization you do is over the whole conversation

Bmr005.C.dialogueact546	1766.25	1766.5	C	PhD	qy^g^rt	-1	0	isn't it ,

Bmr005.D.dialogueact568	1834.58	1837.01	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because eh it 's confused with {disfmarker} with noise .

Bmr005.D.dialogueact572	1840.4	1842.33	D	PhD	s^bd^cc	-1	0	But I have to study with more detail .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact573	1842.88	1847.66	D	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	But eh my idea is to {disfmarker} to process only {pause} nnn , this eh {disfmarker} nnn , this kind of s of eh speech .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact574	1848.04	1849.33	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Because I think it 's more realistic .

Bmr005.G.dialogueact576	1852.17	1854.28	G	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Well , it 's more realistic but it 'll {disfmarker} it 'll be a lot harder .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact579	1854.97	1855.25	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact578	1854.87	1866.18	E	Professor	s.x	+1	0	Well , it 'd be hard , but on the other hand as you point out , if your {disfmarker} if i if {disfmarker} if your concern is to get uh the overlapping people {disfmarker} people 's speech , you will {disfmarker} you will get that somewhat better .

Bmr005.D.dialogueact594	1896.79	1919.72	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	0	But eh the transcription {disfmarker} eh for example , I {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm not interested in the {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} in the words , transcription words , eh transcribed eh eh in {disfmarker} eh follow in the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in the {disfmarker} in the speech file , but eh eh Jane eh for example eh put a mark eh at the beginning eh of each eh talker ,

Bmr005.D.dialogueact625	1987.97	1995.06	D	PhD	s^ng	+1	1	I {disfmarker} I consider all the {disfmarker} all the session because eh I {disfmarker} I count the nnn {disfmarker} the nnn {disfmarker} the overlappings marked by {disfmarker} by Jane ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact626	1990.48	1991.17	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact628	1995.4	1996.83	B	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , I see .

Bmr005.E.dialogueact630	1999.94	2001.72	E	Professor	s^bu	+1	1	So it 's three hundred in forty - five minutes ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact631	2001.72	2011.09	E	Professor	s	+1	2	but you have {disfmarker} you have time uh , uh marked {disfmarker} twelve minute {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the um overlaps in twelve minutes of it .

Bmr005.F.dialogueact635	2012.41	2021.03	F	PhD	fg|qy.%--	-1	0	So , can I ask {disfmarker} {vocalsound} can I ask whether you found {disfmarker} uh , you know , how accurate uh Jane 's uh uh labels were as far as {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact634	2012.38	2014.05	G	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	Well , not just the overlaps , everything .
Bmr005.F.dialogueact636	2021.22	2023.72	F	PhD	qr.%-	-1	0	you know , did she miss some overlaps ? or did she n ?
Bmr005.D.dialogueact637	2022.67	2030.3	D	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	But , by {disfmarker} by the moment , I {disfmarker} I don't compare , my {disfmarker} my temporal mark with eh Jane , but eh I {disfmarker} I want to do it .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact638	2030.81	2036.57	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Because eh eh i per perhaps I have eh errors in the {disfmarker} in the marks ,
Bmr005.D.dialogueact639	2036.99	2049.97	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} and if I {disfmarker} I compare with eh Jane , it 's probably I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I can correct and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} to get eh eh a more accurately eh eh transcription in the file .

Bmr005.B.dialogueact659	2068.32	2072.57	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So my {disfmarker} my goal is to get words with reference to a time bin , {pause} beginning and end point .

Bmr005.B.dialogueact666	2077.5	2085.29	B	Postdoc	s	+1	0	but , yeah , w it just wasn't important for our purposes to have it that {disfmarker} i disrupt that unit in order to have , you know , a the words in the order in which they were spoken ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact668	2085.29	2087.47	B	Postdoc	s	+1	0	it would have {disfmarker} it would have been hard with the interface that we have .

Bmr005.E.dialogueact685	2106.02	2107.88	E	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	Well , I but I have a suggestion about that .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact686	2107.97	2111.49	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um , obviously this is very , very time - consuming , and you 're finding lots of things
Bmr005.E.dialogueact687	2111.49	2113.94	E	Professor	s^ba^df	-1	0	which I 'm sure are gonna be very interesting ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact688	2114.56	2118.87	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but in the interests of making progress , uh might I s
Bmr005.E.dialogueact689	2118.87	2123.71	E	Professor	qw^cs	-1	0	how {disfmarker} how would it affect your time if you only marked speaker overlaps ?
Bmr005.D.dialogueact690	2124.23	2124.52	D	PhD	s^bu^r	-1	0	Only .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact691	2124.86	2125.15	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .

Bmr005.E.dialogueact692	2125.32	2127.17	E	Professor	s^co	-1	0	Do not mark any other events ,
Bmr005.D.dialogueact695	2127.37	2127.76	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact694	2127.17	2128.19	E	Professor	s^co^rt	-1	0	but only mark speaker {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact696	2128.25	2130.02	E	Professor	qy	-1	0	Do you think that would speed it up quite a bit ?
Bmr005.D.dialogueact697	2129.76	2130.1	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact698	2130.61	2138.03	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	OK . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I w I {disfmarker} I wanted to {disfmarker}

Bmr005.E.dialogueact700	2132.33	2134.31	E	Professor	h|qy^d^rt	-1	0	Uh , speed up your {disfmarker} your {disfmarker} your marking ?
Bmr005.D.dialogueact701	2138.22	2139.73	D	PhD	s^bu.%--	-1	0	nnn , I don't understand very .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact702	2140.41	2143.56	E	Professor	s	+1	0	It took you a long time {pause} to mark twelve minutes .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact703	2141.94	2142.13	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact704	2143.3	2144.21	D	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	Oh , yeah , yeah .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact705	2143.98	2146.81	E	Professor	s^cs.%-	+1	0	Now , my suggestion was for the other thirty - three {disfmarker}
Bmr005.D.dialogueact706	2146.01	2148.34	D	PhD	s.%-	+1	2	On - only to mark {disfmarker} only to mark overlapping zone , but {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact707	2148.44	2155.51	E	Professor	fg|qy	+1	0	Yeah , and my question is , if you did that , if you followed my suggestion , would it take much less time ?
Bmr005.D.dialogueact708	2156.48	2156.67	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh ,
Bmr005.D.dialogueact709	2156.99	2157.29	D	PhD	s^aa	+1	0	yeah .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact711	2158.78	2159.02	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Sure .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact710	2158.29	2158.88	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah OK .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact712	2159.02	2159.32	D	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	Yeah sure .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact713	2159.53	2160.85	E	Professor	s^ba	+1	1	Then I think it 's a good idea .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact715	2162.38	2162.84	D	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	Sure sure .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact714	2162.13	2163.64	E	Professor	s^ba^r.%-	-1	0	Then I think it 's a good idea , because it
Bmr005.D.dialogueact716	2163.06	2163.15	D	PhD	s^r	-1	0	Sure ,
Bmr005.D.dialogueact717	2163.4	2167.31	D	PhD	s	-1	0	because I {disfmarker} I need a lot of time to {disfmarker} to put the label or to do that .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact718	2167.54	2167.68	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact719	2167.58	2170.0	E	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah , I mean , we we know that there 's noise .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact720	2167.89	2168.07	G	Grad	%-	-1	0	And
Bmr005.D.dialogueact721	2170.34	2170.7	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact722	2170.73	2175.07	E	Professor	s	-1	0	There 's {disfmarker} there 's uh continual noise uh from fans and so forth ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact723	2175.07	2180.05	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and there is uh more impulsive noise from uh taps and so forth
Bmr005.D.dialogueact724	2179.71	2179.89	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact725	2180.05	2182.64	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and something in between with paper rustling .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact726	2183.05	2184.27	E	Professor	s	-1	0	We know that all that 's there
Bmr005.E.dialogueact727	2184.27	2186.02	E	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	and it 's a g worthwhile thing to study ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact728	2186.32	2189.63	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but obviously it takes a lot of time to mark all of these things .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact729	2188.05	2188.23	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact730	2190.06	2197.44	E	Professor	s	-1	0	Whereas th i I would think that uh you {disfmarker} we can study more or less as a distinct phenomenon the overlapping of people talking .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact731	2197.56	2197.97	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact732	2198.3	2198.65	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact734	2199.02	2199.4	D	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact733	2198.92	2200.65	E	Professor	h|s.%-	-1	0	So . Then you can get the {disfmarker} Cuz you need {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact735	2201.12	2208.88	E	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	If it 's three hundred uh {disfmarker} i i it sounds like you probably only have fifty or sixty or seventy events right now that are really {disfmarker}
Bmr005.D.dialogueact736	2208.4	2208.71	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact737	2209.23	2217.26	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and you need to have a lot more than that to have any kind of uh even visual sense of {disfmarker} of what 's going on , much less any kind of reasonable statistics .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact738	2216.29	2216.5	G	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Right .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact739	2217.85	2223.32	C	PhD	qw.%-	+1	0	Now , why do you need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy in the {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact740	2221.91	2222.22	G	Grad	%-	-1	0	Well , that 's {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact741	2222.95	2223.96	G	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's what I was gonna bring up .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact742	2223.5	2226.15	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , you shouldn't need to do this p completely by hand ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact743	2225.65	2229.61	E	Professor	h|s^co	-1	0	Um , OK , yeah . So let 's back up because you weren't here for an earlier conversation .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact744	2226.15	2226.35	C	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr005.C.dialogueact745	2229.08	2229.45	C	PhD	s^fa	-1	0	I 'm sorry .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact746	2230.03	2236.27	E	Professor	s^bs	+1	1	So the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures
Bmr005.E.dialogueact747	2236.62	2242.12	E	Professor	s^e.%--	+1	1	such as the increase in energy , such as the energy in the LPC residuals , such as {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact748	2242.2	2246.8	E	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean there 's a bunch of things {disfmarker} I mean , increased energy is - is sort of an obvious one .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact749	2243.3	2243.64	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact750	2245.36	2246.37	C	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	In the far - field mike .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact751	2247.08	2247.37	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact752	2247.58	2248.05	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact753	2248.0	2252.08	E	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Um , and uh , it 's not obvious ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact754	2252.08	2256.32	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	I mean , you could {disfmarker} you could do the dumbest thing and get {disfmarker} get it ninety percent of the time .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact755	2256.32	2264.02	E	Professor	s	-1	0	But when you start going past that and trying to do better , it 's not obvious what combination of features is gonna give you the {disfmarker} you know , the right detector .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact756	2264.02	2266.0	E	Professor	s	+1	0	So the idea is to have some ground truth first .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact757	2266.56	2271.61	E	Professor	s	+1	1	And so the i the idea of the manual marking was to say " OK this , i you know , it 's {disfmarker} it 's really here " .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact758	2271.58	2274.24	A	PhD	s^bu:qw^cs	-1	0	But I think Liz is saying why not get it out of the transcripts ?
Bmr005.C.dialogueact759	2272.45	2275.18	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	What I mean is {pause} get it from the close - talking mikes .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact760	2276.16	2277.05	E	Professor	h|s^no^rt	-1	0	Uh , yeah .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact761	2276.77	2279.62	C	PhD	s^cs^rt	-1	0	A or ge get a first pass from those ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact762	2277.05	2279.87	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	We t we t w we t we talked about that .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact763	2279.91	2281.26	C	PhD	s^e.%--	-1	0	and then go through sort of {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact764	2281.26	2283.14	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	It 'd be a lot faster probably to {disfmarker}
Bmr005.F.dialogueact765	2281.99	2282.68	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	And you can {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact766	2282.43	2283.21	G	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	Yeah , that 's his , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact767	2282.93	2284.47	E	Professor	s^aa^r	-1	0	We {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we talked about that .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact768	2284.53	2286.55	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	s But so it 's a bootstrapping thing and the thing is ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact769	2286.43	2287.3	C	PhD	s^bk|%-	-1	0	Yeah , I just {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact770	2286.93	2290.81	E	Professor	s^bs^rt	+1	0	the idea was , i we i i we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact771	2291.65	2294.4	E	Professor	s	+1	0	and {disfmarker} and then whatever he could mark would be helpful ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact772	2294.65	2294.95	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact773	2294.8	2295.65	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and we could {disfmarker} Uh
Bmr005.E.dialogueact774	2295.65	2297.28	E	Professor	s	-1	0	it 's a question of what you bootstrap from .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact775	2297.28	2301.65	E	Professor	qy	-1	0	You know , do you bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you g do better ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact776	2302.07	2308.69	E	Professor	qrr	-1	0	or do you bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then {disfmarker} then do your simple measurements , uh from the close - talking mike .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact777	2308.69	2311.33	E	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , even with the close - talking mike you 're not gonna get it right all the time .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact778	2311.56	2313.51	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Well , that 's what I wonder , because um {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact779	2313.51	2314.5	C	PhD	s	-1	0	or how bad it is ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact780	2313.6	2313.85	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	Well
Bmr005.C.dialogueact782	2314.98	2318.0	C	PhD	fg|s^ba	-1	0	be um , because that would be interesting
Bmr005.G.dialogueact781	2314.87	2316.9	G	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	I 'm working on a program to do that , and {disfmarker}

Bmr005.C.dialogueact784	2321.38	2321.71	C	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr005.C.dialogueact785	2321.71	2324.66	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , we 've got a lot more data than we have transcriptions for .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact786	2324.66	2325.62	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	We have the audio data ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact788	2325.83	2327.03	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	we have the close - talking mike ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact787	2325.39	2325.58	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact789	2327.4	2330.7	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so I mean it seems like one kind of project
Bmr005.C.dialogueact790	2330.7	2332.18	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	that 's not perfect , but {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact791	2333.24	2337.91	C	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	um , that you can get the training data for pretty quickly is , you know ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact792	2337.95	2342.2	C	PhD	s	-1	0	if you infer form the close - talking mikes where the on - off points are of speech ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact793	2342.26	2343.53	E	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	Right , we discussed that .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact794	2342.88	2346.1	C	PhD	fh|qw	-1	0	you know , how can we detect that from a far - field ?
Bmr005.G.dialogueact795	2343.58	2343.89	G	Grad	fg	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bmr005.B.dialogueact796	2346.01	2346.28	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact797	2346.08	2347.68	G	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	I 've {disfmarker} I 've written a program to do that ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact798	2347.77	2348.08	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact800	2348.08	2349.25	C	PhD	s^fa.%-	-1	0	I 'm sorry I missed the {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact799	2347.84	2348.98	G	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	and it , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact801	2349.0	2349.43	E	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	It 's OK .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact802	2349.87	2352.52	G	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} but it 's {disfmarker} it 's doing something very , very simple .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact803	2352.53	2355.88	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	It just takes a threshold , based on {disfmarker} on the volume ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact804	2354.01	2354.36	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr005.F.dialogueact805	2354.67	2359.04	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Or you can set the threshold low and then weed out the false alarms by hand .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact806	2358.31	2358.63	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact807	2358.63	2359.67	C	PhD	s^aa^m	-1	0	by hand . Yeah .
Bmr005.F.dialogueact808	2359.24	2359.55	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact809	2359.48	2363.12	G	Grad	fg|s^e	-1	0	um , and then it does a median filter , and then it looks for runs .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact810	2364.09	2365.38	G	Grad	s	-1	0	And , it seems to work ,
Bmr005.G.dialogueact811	2365.38	2370.21	G	Grad	s	-1	0	I 've {disfmarker} I 'm sort of fiddling with the parameters , to get it to actually generate something ,
Bmr005.G.dialogueact812	2370.62	2371.42	G	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and I haven't {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact813	2371.6	2378.32	G	Grad	s	-1	0	I don't {disfmarker} what I 'm working on {disfmarker} was working on {disfmarker} was getting it to a form where we can import it into the user interface that we have , {pause} into Transcriber .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact814	2378.7	2380.9	G	Grad	fh|s^cc	-1	0	And so {disfmarker} I told {disfmarker} I said it would take about a day .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact815	2380.9	2382.49	G	Grad	s	-1	0	I 've worked on it for about half a day ,
Bmr005.H.dialogueact816	2382.11	2382.53	H	Grad	s	-1	0	I have to go .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact817	2382.73	2385.78	G	Grad	fh|s^cc	-1	0	so give me another half day and I we 'll have something we can play with .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact818	2383.5	2383.91	C	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact819	2385.97	2388.88	E	Professor	s^co	-1	0	See , this is where we really need the Meeting Recorder query stuff to be working ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact820	2388.88	2393.66	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because we 've had these meetings and we 've had this discussion about this , and I 'm sort of remembering a little bit about what we decided ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact821	2392.11	2392.35	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact822	2392.35	2392.84	C	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	I 'm sorry .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact823	2392.84	2393.24	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	I just {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact824	2394.06	2395.3	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but I couldn't remember all of it .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact825	2395.12	2395.44	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	It
Bmr005.E.dialogueact826	2395.36	2407.54	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	So , I think it was partly that , you know , give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like , partly that we have e some ground truth to compare against , you know , when {disfmarker} when he {disfmarker} he gets his thing going ,
Bmr005.G.dialogueact827	2395.78	2396.14	G	Grad	fg	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact828	2408.13	2409.06	E	Professor	fh|%-	-1	0	uh , and {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact829	2408.65	2410.5	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Well , it 's definitely good to have somebody look at it .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact830	2410.5	2414.71	C	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	I was just thinking as a way to speed up you know , the amount of {disfmarker}
Bmr005.B.dialogueact832	2413.74	2414.17	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact831	2413.68	2416.66	E	Professor	s	-1	0	That was {disfmarker} that was exactly the notion that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that we discussed .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact833	2415.9	2416.19	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact834	2416.0	2416.23	G	Grad	s^ft^t3.%	-1	0	Thanks .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact835	2416.67	2418.55	B	Postdoc	s^t.%-	-1	0	Another thing we discussed was um that {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact837	2416.97	2417.44	C	PhD	s^ba^t3	-1	0	It looks good .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact836	2416.92	2417.05	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact838	2418.69	2419.26	C	PhD	s^cc^t3	-1	0	I 'll be in touch .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact839	2419.26	2419.6	C	PhD	s^ft^t3	-1	0	Thanks .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact840	2419.3	2419.79	E	Professor	s^t3	-1	0	S See ya .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact841	2420.38	2420.56	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact842	2424.36	2431.64	B	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	Was that um there m {pause} there was this already a script I believe uh that Dan had written , {comment} that uh handle bleedthrough ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact843	2431.64	2437.08	B	Postdoc	fh|s^df	-1	0	I mean cuz you have this {disfmarker} this close {disfmarker} you have contamination from other people who speak loudly .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact844	2438.27	2438.39	G	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr005.G.dialogueact845	2438.39	2439.55	G	Grad	s	-1	0	and I haven't tried using that .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact846	2439.55	2443.44	G	Grad	s	-1	0	It would probably help the program that I 'm doing to first feed it through that .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact847	2444.06	2445.41	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	It 's a cross - correlation filter .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact848	2448.09	2452.64	G	Grad	s	-1	0	So I {disfmarker} I haven't tried that , but that {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it might be something {disfmarker} it might be a good way of cleaning it up a little .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact849	2449.3	2450.78	B	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	So , some thought of maybe having {disfmarker}
Bmr005.B.dialogueact850	2452.95	2455.42	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Yeah , having that be a preprocessor and then run it through yours .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact851	2454.24	2455.48	G	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly . Yep .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact852	2455.22	2456.7	E	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but that 's a refinement
Bmr005.B.dialogueact853	2456.26	2457.0	B	Postdoc	s^t	-1	0	That 's what we were discussing .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact854	2456.7	2458.73	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and I think we wanna see {disfmarker} try the simple thing first ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact855	2458.73	2464.61	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	cuz you add this complex thing up uh afterwards that does something good y y yo you sort of wanna see what the simple thing does first .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact856	2461.67	2461.89	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact857	2465.37	2471.63	E	Professor	s	-1	0	But uh , having {disfmarker} having somebody have some experience , again , with {disfmarker} with uh {disfmarker} with marking it from a human standpoint ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact858	2471.63	2477.22	E	Professor	s	-1	0	we 're {disfmarker} I mean , I don't expect Jose to {disfmarker} to do it for uh f fifty hours of {disfmarker} {comment} of speech ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact859	2477.22	2486.23	E	Professor	s^cs	+1	2	but I mean we {disfmarker} {comment} if uh {disfmarker} if he could speed up what he was doing by just getting the speaker overlaps so that we had it , say , for forty - five minutes , then at least we 'd have three hundred examples of it .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact860	2483.42	2483.8	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah . Sure .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact861	2484.19	2484.69	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Sure .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact862	2486.23	2490.84	E	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	And when {disfmarker} when uh Adam was doing his automatic thing he could then compare to that and see what it was different .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact863	2489.55	2490.37	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Oh yeah , definitely .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact864	2490.66	2496.51	A	PhD	s	-1	0	You know , I did {disfmarker} I did uh something almost identical to this at one of my previous jobs , and it works pretty well .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact865	2496.77	2501.94	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , i almost exactly what you described , an energy detector with a median filter , you look for runs .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact866	2502.57	2503.19	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	And uh ,
Bmr005.A.dialogueact867	2503.7	2504.43	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	you know , you can {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact868	2504.02	2505.57	G	Grad	s	-1	0	It seemed like the right thing to do .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact869	2505.1	2508.33	A	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah . I mean , you {disfmarker} you can get y I mean , you get them pretty close .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact870	2507.55	2509.18	G	Grad	s	-1	0	That was with zero literature search .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact871	2509.04	2516.7	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	And so I think doing that to generate these possibilities and then going through and saying yes or no on them would be a quick way to {disfmarker} to do it .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact872	2515.89	2516.82	G	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	That 's good validation .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact873	2517.08	2517.39	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact874	2517.88	2518.77	B	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	Is this proprietary ?

Bmr005.E.dialogueact878	2525.77	2526.96	E	Professor	s^bk|s	-1	0	Oh , then everybody owns it .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact879	2527.2	2527.96	E	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's the people .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact880	2527.75	2529.66	B	Postdoc	qy	-1	0	Well , I mean , is this something that we could just co - opt ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact881	2529.66	2530.04	B	Postdoc	qrr.%--	-1	0	or is it {disfmarker} ?

Bmr005.A.dialogueact886	2533.04	2534.92	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , he 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it doesn't take a long time .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact887	2533.33	2533.49	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact888	2533.77	2538.29	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I just thought if it was tried and true , then {disfmarker} {comment} and he 's gone through additional levels of {disfmarker} of development .

Bmr005.G.dialogueact921	2617.25	2622.38	G	Grad	s	-1	0	I b I bet they 're more , because the beginning of the meeting had a lot more overlaps than {disfmarker} than sort of the middle .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact922	2623.01	2623.5	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact923	2623.06	2623.68	G	Grad	s^bsc	-1	0	Middle or end .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact926	2624.36	2625.34	B	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	I 'm not sure .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact924	2624.24	2624.69	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact925	2624.28	2627.19	G	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	Because i we 're {disfmarker} we 're dealing with the {disfmarker} Uh , in the early meetings ,
Bmr005.G.dialogueact927	2627.5	2631.12	G	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	we 're recording while we 're saying who 's talking on what microphone , {comment} and things like that ,
Bmr005.D.dialogueact928	2630.82	2631.15	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact929	2631.42	2633.05	G	Grad	s	-1	0	and that seems to be a lot of overlap .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact931	2634.3	2635.86	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I think it 's an empirical question .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact930	2634.2	2634.61	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact932	2635.86	2636.74	B	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	I think we could find that out .
Bmr005.D.dialogueact933	2635.94	2636.39	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact934	2635.99	2636.28	G	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact935	2636.74	2638.67	B	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm not sure that the beginning had more .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact936	2640.7	2646.09	E	Professor	s^t	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so I was gonna ask , I guess about any {disfmarker} any other things that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that either of you wanted to talk about ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact937	2646.13	2648.9	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	especially since Andreas is leaving in five minutes ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact938	2648.9	2650.42	E	Professor	s	-1	0	that {disfmarker} that you wanna go with .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact939	2649.49	2651.02	C	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Can I just ask about the data ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact940	2651.02	2656.89	C	PhD	qw^rt	+1	1	like very straightforward question is where we are on the amount of data and the amount of transcribed data ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact941	2656.89	2657.49	C	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	just cuz I 'm {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact942	2658.82	2660.19	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I wanted to get a feel for that
Bmr005.C.dialogueact943	2660.91	2663.9	C	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	to sort of be able to know what {disfmarker} what can be done first
Bmr005.C.dialogueact944	2663.9	2667.26	C	PhD	qw	-1	0	and like how many meetings are we recording
Bmr005.E.dialogueact945	2664.14	2670.03	E	Professor	fg|s	+1	1	Right so there 's this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} There 's this forty - five minute piece that Jane transcribed .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact946	2667.26	2667.54	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact947	2670.99	2676.58	E	Professor	s	-1	0	That piece was then uh sent to IBM so they could transcribe so we have some comparison point .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact948	2677.14	2684.48	E	Professor	s.x	-1	0	Then there 's s a larger piece that 's been recorded and uh put on CD - ROM and sent uh to IBM .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact949	2685.39	2685.65	E	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact950	2685.86	2688.28	E	Professor	s^no	-1	0	And then we don't know .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact951	2687.87	2688.98	C	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	How many meetings is that ?
Bmr005.C.dialogueact953	2689.26	2690.32	C	PhD	qw^r.%-	-1	0	Like {disfmarker} how many {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact952	2689.21	2689.65	G	Grad	qw^bu^rt	-1	0	What 's that ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact954	2689.77	2691.44	E	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	That was about ten hours , and there was about {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact955	2690.32	2693.0	C	PhD	qo^bu^d^rt	-1	0	t ten {disfmarker} It 's like ten meetings or something ?
Bmr005.C.dialogueact957	2693.0	2693.26	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact956	2692.6	2693.4	G	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , something like that .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact958	2693.55	2694.51	G	Grad	%-	-1	0	And then {disfmarker} then we
Bmr005.A.dialogueact959	2694.12	2695.82	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Ten meetings that have been sent to IBM ?
Bmr005.C.dialogueact960	2695.81	2695.99	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact962	2695.94	2696.23	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact961	2695.93	2699.84	G	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	Well , I haven't sent them yet because I was having this problem with the {pause} missing files .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact963	2697.44	2697.98	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact964	2700.09	2702.28	E	Professor	s^bk|s	-1	0	Oh , that 's right , that had {disfmarker} those have not been sent .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact965	2702.76	2705.34	A	PhD	qw^rt	+1	0	H how many total have we recorded now , altogether ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact966	2705.55	2707.68	E	Professor	s	+1	1	We 're saying about {pause} twelve hours .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact967	2706.04	2708.32	G	Grad	s	+1	1	About twelve {pause} by now . Twelve or thirteen .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact968	2708.3	2711.0	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Uh - huh . And we 're recording only this meeting , like continuously
Bmr005.C.dialogueact969	2711.0	2712.99	C	PhD	qr^bu^d.%-	-1	0	we 're only recording this one now ? or {disfmarker} ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact970	2711.77	2712.03	E	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact972	2712.63	2716.65	E	Professor	s^ar|s^rt	-1	0	No , so the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} that 's the {disfmarker} that 's the biggest one {disfmarker} uh , chunk so far ,
Bmr005.G.dialogueact971	2712.29	2712.49	G	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	Nope .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact974	2713.54	2714.24	A	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	It was the morning one .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact973	2713.05	2713.35	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact975	2717.19	2722.73	E	Professor	s^rt	+1	2	but there 's at least one meeting recorded of uh the uh uh natural language guys .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact976	2721.16	2721.44	G	Grad	s	-1	0	Jerry .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact977	2723.14	2724.21	C	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Do they meet every week ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact978	2723.21	2724.02	E	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	And then there {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact980	2724.76	2725.5	C	PhD	qrr.%-	-1	0	or every {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact979	2724.31	2725.75	E	Professor	h|s^aa^rt	-1	0	Uh , they do .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact981	2725.75	2727.92	E	Professor	s	-1	0	w w And we talked to them about recording some more
Bmr005.E.dialogueact982	2727.92	2728.7	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and we 're going to ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact983	2729.43	2736.5	E	Professor	fh|s^rt	+1	2	uh , we 've started having a morning meeting , today uh i starting a w a week or two ago , on the uh front - end issues ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact984	2736.85	2738.11	E	Professor	s	+1	2	and we 're recording those ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact985	2738.75	2744.29	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	2	uh there 's a network services and applications group here who 's agreed to have their meetings recorded ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact986	2743.94	2744.33	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Great .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact987	2744.68	2745.9	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and we 're gonna start recording them .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact988	2745.9	2748.75	E	Professor	s	-1	0	They 're {disfmarker} They meet on Tuesdays . We 're gonna start recording them next week .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact989	2749.01	2752.01	E	Professor	s	-1	0	So actually , we 're gonna h start having a {disfmarker} a pretty significant chunk
Bmr005.E.dialogueact990	2752.01	2752.23	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	and
Bmr005.E.dialogueact991	2752.75	2760.33	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	so , you know , {vocalsound} Adam 's sort of struggling with trying to get things to be less buggy , and come up quicker when they do crash and stuff {disfmarker} things like that ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact992	2760.44	2762.46	E	Professor	s	-1	0	now that uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the things are starting to happen .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact993	2762.74	2767.03	E	Professor	s	-1	0	So right now , yeah , I th I 'd say the data is predominantly meeting meetings ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact994	2767.59	2771.32	E	Professor	s^e	-1	0	but there are scattered other meetings in it and that {disfmarker} that amount is gonna grow
Bmr005.E.dialogueact995	2771.59	2774.38	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh so that the meeting meetings will probably ultimately {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact996	2774.95	2779.47	E	Professor	s	+1	0	i if we 're {disfmarker} if we collect fifty or sixty hours , the meeting meetings it will probably be , you know , twenty or thirty percent of it ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact997	2779.47	2781.22	E	Professor	s^e	-1	0	not {disfmarker} not {disfmarker} not eighty or ninety .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact998	2781.43	2781.61	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	But .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact999	2782.07	2784.5	C	PhD	s^bs	+1	0	So there 's probably {disfmarker} there 's three to four a week ,
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1000	2785.39	2786.34	G	Grad	s^na	-1	0	That 's what we 're aiming for .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1001	2786.01	2786.98	C	PhD	s^bk^m	-1	0	that we 're aiming for .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1002	2786.96	2787.26	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1003	2787.78	2789.8	C	PhD	s^bu	+1	0	And they 're each about an hour or something .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1004	2789.36	2789.97	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1005	2789.67	2790.02	G	Grad	%--	-1	0	Although {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1006	2790.24	2790.47	G	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1007	2791.1	2793.3	G	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	We 'll find out tomorrow whether we can really do this or not .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1008	2792.84	2793.05	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1010	2793.41	2793.94	C	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1009	2793.27	2795.3	E	Professor	s^no.%--	-1	0	Yeah and th the {disfmarker} the other thing is I 'm not pos
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1011	2795.3	2799.39	E	Professor	s^no.%--	-1	0	I 'm sort of thinking as we 've been through this a few times , that I really don't know {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1012	2799.5	2801.48	E	Professor	s^cs^rt	-1	0	maybe you wanna do it once for the novelty ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1013	2801.82	2807.5	E	Professor	s^no	-1	0	but I don't know if in general we wanna have meetings that we record from outside this group do the digits .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1014	2807.6	2807.9	G	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1015	2808.31	2810.74	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Because it 's just an added bunch of weird stuff .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1016	2809.9	2810.15	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1017	2811.02	2813.15	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	And , you know , we {disfmarker} we h we 're highly motivated .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1018	2813.78	2815.39	E	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh in fact , the morning group is really motivated
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1019	2815.39	2816.91	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	cuz they 're working on connected digits ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1020	2816.91	2817.61	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	so it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1021	2817.77	2819.24	G	Grad	s	-1	0	Actually that 's something I wanted to ask ,
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1022	2819.24	2822.61	G	Grad	s	-1	0	is I have a bunch of scripts to help with the transcription of the digits .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1023	2822.91	2823.41	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1024	2823.09	2826.77	G	Grad	s	-1	0	We don't have to hand - transcribe the digits because we 're reading them and I have those .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1027	2827.32	2827.52	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1025	2826.95	2827.19	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1026	2827.19	2832.16	G	Grad	s	+1	0	And so I have some scripts that let you very quickly extract the sections of each utterance .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1028	2832.6	2834.53	G	Grad	s	-1	0	But I haven't been ru I haven't been doing that .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1029	2835.34	2838.48	G	Grad	fh|qy^rt	+1	0	Um , if I did that , is someone gonna be working on it ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1030	2839.04	2840.11	E	Professor	h|s^aa	-1	0	Uh , yeah , I {disfmarker} I think
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1032	2840.7	2842.48	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	definitely s so Absolutely .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1031	2840.52	2841.81	G	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	I mean , is it something of interest ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1033	2842.48	2848.38	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	Yeah , whoever we have working on the acoustics for the Meeting Recorder are gonna start with that .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1034	2842.6	2842.81	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1035	2845.1	2848.02	G	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , I I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm interested in it ,
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1036	2848.02	2849.45	G	Grad	s	-1	0	I just don't have time to do it now .
Bmr005.F.dialogueact1037	2850.03	2858.57	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I was {disfmarker} these meetings {disfmarker} I 'm sure someone thought of this , but these {disfmarker} this uh reading of the numbers would be extremely helpful to do um adaptation .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1038	2850.45	2850.71	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	So
Bmr005.F.dialogueact1040	2859.36	2860.1	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1039	2858.91	2860.2	G	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep . Yep .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1041	2860.91	2861.56	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Actually I have o
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1042	2861.23	2863.61	G	Grad	s	+1	0	I {disfmarker} I would really like someone to do adaptation .
Bmr005.F.dialogueact1043	2862.77	2863.31	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1044	2863.91	2867.58	G	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	So if we got someone interested in that , I think it would be great for Meeting Recorder .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1045	2866.01	2866.19	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1046	2867.74	2877.22	E	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	I mean , one of the things I wanted to do , uh , that I I talked to {disfmarker} to Don about , is one of the possible things he could do or m also , we could have someone else do it , is to do block echo cancellation ,
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1047	2868.92	2870.28	G	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Since it 's the same people over and over .
Bmr005.F.dialogueact1048	2871.99	2872.56	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1049	2877.76	2881.78	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	to try to get rid of some of the effects of the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the far - field effects .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1051	2882.31	2889.12	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um , I mean we have {disfmarker} the party line has been that echo cancellation is not the right way to handle the situation
Bmr005.F.dialogueact1050	2881.95	2882.62	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1052	2889.12	2890.55	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because people move around ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1053	2891.37	2902.16	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and uh , if {disfmarker} if it 's {disfmarker} if it 's uh not a simple echo , like a cross - talk kind of echo , but it 's actually room acoustics , it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} you can't really do inversion ,
Bmr005.F.dialogueact1054	2897.41	2898.36	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1055	2902.16	2909.4	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and even echo cancellation is going to uh be something {disfmarker} It may {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} Someone may be moving enough that you are not able to adapt quickly
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1056	2909.39	2919.38	E	Professor	s	+1	0	and so the tack that we 've taken is more " lets come up with feature approaches and multi - stream approaches and so forth , that will be robust to it for the recognizer and not try to create a clean signal " .
Bmr005.F.dialogueact1057	2909.71	2910.34	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1058	2920.11	2921.18	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	Uh , that 's the party line .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1059	2921.37	2925.88	E	Professor	s	-1	0	But it occurred to me a few months ago that uh party lines are always , you know , sort of dangerous .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1060	2925.88	2928.42	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	It 's good {disfmarker} {vocalsound} good to sort of test them , actually .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1061	2928.42	2934.88	E	Professor	s	-1	0	And so we haven't had anybody try to do a good serious job on echo cancellation and we should know how well that can do .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1062	2934.95	2945.09	E	Professor	fh|s^cs	+1	1	So that 's something I 'd like somebody to do at some point , just take these digits , take the far - field mike signal , and the close uh mike signal , and apply really good echo cancellation .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1063	2945.18	2950.44	E	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Um , there was a {disfmarker} have been some nice talks recently by {disfmarker} by Lucent on {disfmarker} on their b
Bmr005.F.dialogueact1064	2945.97	2946.82	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1065	2951.1	2953.31	E	Professor	s	-1	0	the block echo cancellation particularly appealed to me ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1066	2953.42	2960.25	E	Professor	fh|s.%-	-1	0	uh you know , trying and change it sample by sample , but you have some reasonable sized blocks . {comment} And um , you know , th
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1067	2959.58	2963.73	A	PhD	qw^rt.x	-1	0	W what is the um {disfmarker} the artifact you try to {disfmarker} you 're trying to get rid of when you do that ?
Bmr005.F.dialogueact1068	2962.66	2962.74	F	PhD	s.%	-1	0	Ciao .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1069	2964.16	2967.38	E	Professor	h|s.%--	-1	0	Uh so it 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} you have a {disfmarker} a direct uh {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1070	2969.16	2974.01	E	Professor	qw.%--	-1	0	Uh , what 's the difference in {disfmarker} If you were trying to construct a linear filter , that would
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1071	2974.07	2974.54	E	Professor	fh.x	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bmr005.F.dialogueact1072	2974.88	2975.39	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I 'm signing off .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1073	2975.71	2975.95	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1074	2976.73	2985.53	E	Professor	s^e	+1	0	that would subtract off {comment} the um uh parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close - talk and the distant .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1075	2986.25	2990.44	E	Professor	fh|s^e	-1	0	You know , so {disfmarker} so uh um I guess in most echo cancellation {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1076	2991.54	2994.53	E	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah , so you {disfmarker} Given that um {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1077	2999.3	3006.4	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	Yeah , so you 're trying to {disfmarker} So you 'd {disfmarker} There 's a {disfmarker} a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there 's a time delay there ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1078	3006.78	3009.57	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and after the time delay , there 's these various reflections .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1079	3010.13	3011.57	E	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	And if you figure out well what 's the {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1080	3011.9	3021.34	E	Professor	s	-1	0	there 's a {disfmarker} a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself {disfmarker} adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract {disfmarker} essentially to subtract off uh different uh {disfmarker} different reflections .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1081	3022.22	3027.85	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Right ? So let 's take the simple case where you just had {disfmarker} you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1082	3027.85	3029.65	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and then there 's a {disfmarker} there 's an echo .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1083	3030.06	3035.99	E	Professor	s	-1	0	It comes back . And you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1084	3036.13	3039.79	A	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	So that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1085	3040.88	3042.1	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , just the raw data ,
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1086	3042.1	3043.8	A	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	you would {disfmarker} you might hear kind of an echo ?
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1087	3044.49	3047.28	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and then this {disfmarker} noise cancellation would get
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1088	3045.95	3051.16	E	Professor	s^ng.%--	-1	0	Well , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm saying {disfmarker} That 's a simplified version of what 's really happening . {comment} What 's really happening is {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1089	3051.16	3055.03	E	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , when I 'm talking to you right now , you 're getting the direct sound from my speech ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1090	3055.03	3059.77	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but you 're also getting , uh , the indirect sound that 's bounced around the room a number of times .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1091	3060.28	3060.64	E	Professor	qy^d^f^rt	-1	0	OK ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1092	3060.96	3068.86	E	Professor	s	-1	0	So now , if you um try to r you {disfmarker} To completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1093	3068.86	3069.62	E	Professor	%--	-1	0	but I {disfmarker} but {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1094	3070.31	3073.63	E	Professor	s	+1	0	not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the {disfmarker} the room response ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1095	3073.63	3077.89	E	Professor	s	+1	0	but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the {disfmarker} the effect of some of the echos .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1096	3078.66	3080.17	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um , a number of people have done this
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1097	3080.17	3086.47	E	Professor	s	-1	0	so that , say , if you 're talking to a speakerphone , uh it makes it more like it would be , if you were talking right up to it .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1098	3086.47	3089.2	E	Professor	s	-1	0	So this is sort of the st the straight - forward approach .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1099	3089.65	3096.82	E	Professor	s	-1	0	You say I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I want to use this uh {disfmarker} this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1100	3096.82	3107.5	E	Professor	s	-1	0	So you construct a filter , and you have this {disfmarker} this filtered version uh of the speech um gets uh uh {disfmarker} gets subtracted off from the original speech .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1101	3107.95	3111.11	E	Professor	s	-1	0	Then you try to {disfmarker} you try to minimize the energy in some sense .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1102	3111.78	3115.38	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	And so um {disfmarker} uh with some constraints .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1103	3114.47	3115.82	A	PhD	s^bu.%--	-1	0	Kind of a clean up thing , that {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1104	3115.69	3116.93	E	Professor	s^aa^m	-1	0	It 's a clean up thing . Right .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1105	3116.66	3116.92	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1106	3116.93	3120.88	E	Professor	fg|s	+1	0	So , echo cancelling is {disfmarker} is , you know , commonly done in telephony ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1107	3121.16	3129.38	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and it 's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you {disfmarker} if , you know , you 're gonna be talking some distance from a mike .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1108	3130.62	3139.79	A	PhD	s	-1	0	When uh , I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge when I was at BBN over the phone , they had a um {disfmarker} some kind of a special speaker phone
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1109	3139.79	3143.83	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and when they would first connect me , it would come on and we 'd hear all this noise .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1111	3144.54	3147.52	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And then it was uh {disfmarker} And then it would come on and it was very clear ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1110	3144.15	3144.34	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1112	3147.82	3148.28	A	PhD	qy^d^f	-1	0	you know .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1113	3147.88	3151.3	E	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	Right . So it 's taking samples , it 's doing adaptation , it 's adjusting weights ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1114	3151.3	3152.38	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and then it 's getting the sum .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1115	3153.4	3158.86	E	Professor	fh|s.x	-1	0	So um , uh anyway that 's {disfmarker} that 's kind of a reasonable thing that I 'd like to have somebody try {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1116	3158.86	3162.93	E	Professor	s	+1	1	somebody look {disfmarker} And {disfmarker} and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1117	3162.93	3165.23	E	Professor	s	-1	0	I think that 'd be enough data {disfmarker} plenty of data to do that with ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1118	3165.23	3171.13	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and i for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was uh large vocabulary speech or anything .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1119	3171.55	3177.06	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh . {vocalsound} Um
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1120	3172.54	3174.8	B	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	Is Brian Kingsbury 's work related to that ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1121	3174.8	3176.06	B	Postdoc	qrr	-1	0	or is it a different type of reverberation ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1122	3177.68	3183.12	E	Professor	s	-1	0	Brian 's {comment} Kingsbury 's work is an example of what we did f f from the opposite dogma .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1123	3183.23	3183.49	E	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1124	3183.67	3188.88	E	Professor	s:s	-1	0	Which is what I was calling the " party line " , which is that uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1125	3189.02	3194.27	E	Professor	s	-1	0	We want something more flexible , uh i i where people might change their position ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1126	3194.27	3195.4	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and there might be , you know {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1127	3196.1	3197.23	E	Professor	%--	-1	0	There 's also um
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1128	3197.76	3198.02	E	Professor	s^fe	-1	0	oh yeah ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1129	3198.07	3198.56	E	Professor	s	-1	0	noise .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1130	3198.65	3202.55	E	Professor	s	-1	0	So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1131	3203.27	3206.16	E	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1132	3206.55	3212.8	E	Professor	s	-1	0	Then we 'll figure out the right {disfmarker} the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those {disfmarker} those echos .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1133	3213.92	3218.95	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	But um if there 's noise , then the very signal that it 's looking at is corrupted
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1134	3218.95	3226.31	E	Professor	s	-1	0	so that it 's decision about what the right {disfmarker} you know , right {disfmarker} right uh {disfmarker} delays are {disfmarker} is , uh {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} right delayed signal is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} uh is incorrect .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1135	3226.87	3238.09	E	Professor	s	-1	0	And so , in a noisy situation , um , also in a {disfmarker} in a situation that 's very reverberant {disfmarker} {comment} with long reverberation times {comment} and really long delays , it 's {disfmarker} it 's sort of typically impractical .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1136	3238.45	3240.01	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So for those kind of reasons ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1137	3240.53	3242.37	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and also a {disfmarker} a c a complete inversion ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1138	3242.55	3246.53	E	Professor	s	-1	0	if you actually {disfmarker} I mentioned that it 's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1139	3247.19	3264.71	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um , that 's difficult because um often times the {disfmarker} the um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1140	3265.76	3275.18	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and so , if you {disfmarker} you do your estimate of what the system is , and then you try to invert it , you get a filter that actually uh , you know , rings , and {disfmarker} and uh goes to infinity .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1141	3275.18	3280.25	E	Professor	s	-1	0	So it 's {disfmarker} so there 's {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's that sort of technical reason , and the fact that things move , and there 's air currents {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1142	3280.31	3283.77	E	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean there 's all sorts of {disfmarker} all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1143	3283.77	3289.22	E	Professor	s	-1	0	So for all those kinds of reasons , uh we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we sort of um , concluded we didn't want to in do inversion ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1144	3289.22	3293.08	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation , which isn't really inversion ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1145	3293.79	3308.07	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and um we decided to do this approach of taking {disfmarker} uh , just picking uh features , which were {disfmarker} uh will give you more {disfmarker} something that was more stable , in the presence of , or absence of , room reverberation ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1146	3308.07	3309.36	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and that 's what Brian was trying to do .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1147	3311.57	3317.35	E	Professor	fh|s^tc	-1	0	So , um , let me just say a couple things that I was {disfmarker} I was gonna bring up .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1148	3317.35	3324.54	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	Uh . Let 's see . I guess you {disfmarker} you actually already said this thing about the uh {disfmarker} about the consent forms ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1149	3324.77	3326.44	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	which was that we now don't have to {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1150	3326.85	3329.74	E	Professor	qy^d.%--	-1	0	So this was the human subjects folks who said this , {comment} or that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} ?
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1151	3329.52	3333.55	B	Postdoc	s	+1	1	The a apparently {disfmarker} I mean , we 're gonna do a revised form , of course .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1152	3333.98	3334.34	B	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	Um
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1153	3334.97	3340.98	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but once a person has signed it once , then that 's valid for a certain number of meetings .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1154	3340.98	3344.2	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	She wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1155	3344.77	3346.79	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I told her that would be a little bit difficult to say .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1156	3346.79	3351.3	B	Postdoc	s	+1	1	So I think from a s practical standpoint , maybe we could have them do it once every ten meetings , or something .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1157	3351.3	3353.79	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It won't be that many people who do it {pause} that often ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1158	3353.79	3358.79	B	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	but um just , you know , so long as they don't forget that they 've done it , I guess .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1159	3359.69	3359.99	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1160	3361.75	3363.43	E	Professor	fg|s^t	-1	0	Um , back on the data thing ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1161	3363.66	3367.54	E	Professor	s	-1	0	so there 's this sort of one hour , ten hour , a hundred hour sort of thing that {disfmarker} that we have .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1162	3368.01	3371.98	E	Professor	s	+1	1	We have {disfmarker} we have an hour uh that {disfmarker} that is transcribed ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1163	3371.98	3375.69	E	Professor	s	+1	1	we have {disfmarker} we have twelve hours that 's recorded but not transcribed ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1164	3376.21	3382.73	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and at the rate we 're going , uh by the end of the semester we 'll have , I don't know , forty or fifty or something , if we {disfmarker} if this really
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1165	3383.59	3384.3	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1166	3385.19	3385.85	E	Professor	qy	-1	0	Well , do we have that much ?
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1167	3385.78	3386.3	C	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	Not really .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1170	3386.3	3388.19	C	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's three to four per week .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1168	3385.85	3386.07	E	Professor	s^t1	-1	0	Let 's see ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1169	3386.07	3386.31	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	we have {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1171	3389.23	3390.93	C	PhD	fh|s.%-	-1	0	So that 's what {disfmarker} You know , that {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1172	3391.34	3394.69	E	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	uh eight weeks , uh is {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1173	3393.29	3394.99	C	PhD	s	-1	0	So that 's not a lot of hours .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1174	3395.52	3400.14	E	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	Eight weeks times three hours is twenty - four , so that 's {disfmarker} Yeah , so like thirty {disfmarker} thirty hours ?
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1175	3396.41	3397.71	A	PhD	s^m	-1	0	Three {disfmarker} Three hours .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1176	3398.97	3399.32	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1177	3400.03	3400.79	C	PhD	qy^rt.%--	-1	0	I mean , is there {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1178	3400.79	3404.18	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I know this sounds {pause} tough but we 've got the room set up .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1179	3404.43	3409.36	C	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Um I was starting to think of some projects where you would use
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1180	3410.4	3414.88	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	well , similar to what we talked about with uh energy detection on the close - talking mikes .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1181	3415.22	3422.28	C	PhD	s	-1	0	There are a number of interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting , that don't require any transcription .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1182	3422.54	3425.51	C	PhD	qw	-1	0	So what are the patterns , the energy patterns over the meeting ?
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1183	3426.27	3431.66	C	PhD	s	-1	0	And I 'm really interested in this {vocalsound} but we don't have a whole lot of data .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1184	3431.76	3434.4	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	So I was thinking , you know , we 've got the room set up
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1185	3435.59	3445.74	C	PhD	fh|s^cs	-1	0	and you can always think of , also for political reasons , if ICSI collected you know , two hundred hours , that looks different than forty hours , even if we don't transcribe it ourselves ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1186	3445.61	3448.08	E	Professor	s^arp	-1	0	But I don't think we 're gonna stop at the end of this semester .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1187	3446.95	3447.34	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1188	3448.28	3448.55	E	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1189	3448.55	3454.91	E	Professor	s	+1	1	So , I th I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months , we are gonna have more like a hundred hours .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1190	3459.23	3463.44	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , is there {disfmarker} Are there any other meetings here that we can record , especially meetings that have some kind of conflict in them {comment} or some kind of deci
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1191	3463.64	3464.92	C	PhD	s^bsc.%--	-1	0	I mean , that are less
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1192	3465.19	3465.96	C	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	well {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1193	3466.68	3470.36	C	PhD	fh|qy^rt	-1	0	uh , that have some more emotional aspects to them ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1194	3470.36	3471.55	C	PhD	qrr.%-	-1	0	or strong {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1195	3471.12	3472.36	G	Grad	s	-1	0	We had some good ones earlier .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1196	3472.89	3473.86	C	PhD	s	-1	0	There 's laughter ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1197	3473.86	3477.16	C	PhD	s	-1	0	um I 'm talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1198	3477.61	3479.45	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	maybe with manager types , or {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1199	3480.17	3481.36	G	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	I think it 's hard to record those .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1200	3482.2	3483.56	C	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	To be allowed to record them ?
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1203	3483.64	3486.0	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It 's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1202	3483.56	3484.2	C	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1201	3483.2	3484.43	E	Professor	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah , people will get {disfmarker}
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1204	3486.1	3488.09	B	Postdoc	s^t	-1	0	But I {disfmarker} but I wanted to raise the KPFA idea .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1205	3486.54	3487.15	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1206	3487.15	3488.41	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , if there is , anyway .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1207	3488.62	3489.58	E	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah , I was gonna mention that .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1208	3489.11	3489.89	G	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Oh , that 's a good idea .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1209	3490.02	3491.29	G	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker} That would be a good match .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1210	3491.9	3509.47	E	Professor	s	+1	1	Yeah . So {disfmarker} Yeah . So I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} uh , I {disfmarker} I 'd mentioned to Adam , and {disfmarker} that was another thing I was gonna talk {disfmarker} uh , mention to them before {disfmarker} {comment} that uh there 's uh {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1211	3510.71	3518.54	E	Professor	s	-1	0	Because , you know , we had talked before about the problem about using found data , {comment} that {disfmarker} that uh it 's just set up however they have it set up
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1212	3518.54	3520.22	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and we don't have any say about it
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1213	3520.22	3521.88	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and it 's typically one microphone ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1214	3522.47	3527.77	E	Professor	s	-1	0	in a , uh , uh {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and so it doesn't really give us the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the uh characteristics we want .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1215	3528.79	3532.42	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um and so I do think we 're gonna continue recording here and record what we can .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1216	3532.98	3544.21	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	But um , it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say " hey you have this panel show , {pause} or this {disfmarker} you know , this discussion show , and um can you record multi - channel ? "
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1217	3545.41	3550.29	E	Professor	fh|s.%-	-1	0	And uh they may be willing to record it uh with {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1218	3550.07	3551.91	C	PhD	qy^2^d^rt	-1	0	With lapel mikes or something ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1219	3551.87	3553.34	E	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	Well , they probably already use lapel ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1220	3553.34	3557.64	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but they might be able to have it {disfmarker} it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1221	3557.02	3557.27	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1222	3557.64	3560.81	E	Professor	s	-1	0	It wouldn't be exactly this setup , but it would be that sort of thing ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1223	3561.08	3566.88	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and what we were gonna get from UW , you know , assuming they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they start recording , isn't {disfmarker} als also is not going to be this exact setup .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1224	3566.79	3567.87	C	PhD	s^ba^rt	-1	0	Right . No , I think that 'd be great ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1226	3568.29	3569.2	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	if we can get more data .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1225	3568.26	3571.34	E	Professor	s	-1	0	So , {comment} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I was thinking of looking into that .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1227	3571.79	3584.21	E	Professor	s	+1	1	the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion , in fact , is that it 's even possible , since of course , many radio shows are not live , {comment} uh that we could invite them to have like some of their {disfmarker} {comment} record some of their shows here .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1228	3585.33	3585.93	B	Postdoc	s^ba^fe	-1	0	Wow !
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1229	3586.41	3590.44	C	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	Well {disfmarker} Or {disfmarker} The thing is , they 're not as averse to wearing one of these head - mount
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1231	3590.44	3591.27	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , they 're on the radio ,
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1230	3590.05	3590.96	G	Grad	s	-1	0	Right , as we are .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1232	3591.27	3591.41	C	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1233	3591.48	3593.88	C	PhD	fh|s^ba	-1	0	So . {comment} Um , I think that 'd be fantastic
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1234	3591.88	3592.16	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1235	3593.88	3597.03	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	cuz those kinds of panels and {disfmarker} Those have interesting
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1236	3597.42	3597.71	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1237	3598.52	3601.47	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Th - that 's an {disfmarker} a side of style {disfmarker} a style that we 're not collecting here ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1238	3601.47	3601.78	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	so
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1240	3601.91	3602.75	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	it 'd be great .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1239	3601.88	3608.87	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} I mean , the other side to it was the {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} which is where we were coming from {disfmarker} I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll talk to you more about it later {comment} is that {disfmarker} is that there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1241	3609.66	3621.1	E	Professor	s	-1	0	the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out presumably , uh related to , you know , legal issues and {disfmarker} and permissions and all that .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1242	3621.1	3624.09	E	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , they already do what they do {disfmarker} do whatever they do .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1243	3624.3	3627.77	E	Professor	s	-1	0	So it 's {disfmarker} uh , it 's {disfmarker} So it 's {disfmarker} so it 's another source .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1244	3627.77	3630.39	E	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	So I think it 's something we should look into ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1245	3630.39	3631.82	E	Professor	s	-1	0	you know , we 'll collect what we collect here
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1246	3631.82	3634.3	E	Professor	s	-1	0	hopefully they will collect more at UW also
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1247	3635.19	3637.82	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and um {disfmarker} and maybe we have this other source .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1248	3637.82	3644.11	E	Professor	s	+1	1	But yeah I think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1249	3644.11	3645.39	E	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , that was sort of our goal .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1250	3646.05	3652.5	E	Professor	s	-1	0	The thing was , I was hoping that we could {disfmarker} @ @ in the {disfmarker} under this controlled situation we could at least collect , you know , thirty to fifty hours .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1251	3653.05	3656.99	E	Professor	s	-1	0	And at the rate we 're going we 'll get pretty close to that I think this semester .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1252	3657.47	3661.57	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And if we continue to collect some next semester , I think we should , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1253	3661.9	3662.1	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	Right .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1254	3662.1	3669.42	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Yeah I was mostly trying to think , " OK , if you start a project , within say a month , you know , how much data do you have to work with .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1255	3669.42	3674.42	C	PhD	s	-1	0	And you {disfmarker} you wanna s you wanna sort of fr freeze your {disfmarker} your data for awhile
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1256	3675.06	3677.26	C	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	so um right now {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1257	3677.43	3679.78	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and we don't have the transcripts back yet from IBM
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1258	3679.78	3680.01	C	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1260	3680.33	3682.19	C	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	Do {disfmarker} Oh , do we now ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1259	3680.06	3682.84	E	Professor	s^nd.%-	-1	0	Well , we don't even have it for this f you know , forty - five minutes , that was {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1261	3682.19	3689.12	C	PhD	fh|s^df^t	+1	0	So um , not complaining , I was just trying to think , you know , what kinds of projects can you do now versus uh six months from now
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1262	3685.25	3685.54	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1263	3689.12	3690.53	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and they 're pretty different , because
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1265	3690.3	3698.27	E	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah . So I was thinking right now it 's sort of this exploratory stuff where you {disfmarker} you look at the data , you use some primitive measures and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like ,
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1264	3690.24	3690.42	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1266	3691.44	3691.7	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1267	3693.84	3694.22	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	Right .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1269	3698.59	3699.16	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Right , right .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1268	3698.27	3706.13	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and uh {disfmarker} and meanwhile we collect , and it 's more like yeah , three months from now , or six months from now you can {disfmarker} you can do a lot of other things .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1270	3705.35	3708.3	C	PhD	s^no.%--	-1	0	Cuz I 'm not actually sure , just logistically that I can spend {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1271	3708.63	3714.77	C	PhD	s	+1	0	you know , I don't wanna charge the time that I have on the project too early , before there 's enough data to make good use of the time .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1272	3714.77	3716.24	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And that 's {disfmarker} and especially with the student
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1273	3714.85	3715.22	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1274	3716.85	3718.2	C	PhD	s	-1	0	uh for instance this guy who seems {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1275	3717.33	3717.72	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1276	3719.08	3719.18	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1277	3719.32	3720.36	C	PhD	s	-1	0	anyway , I shouldn't say too much ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1278	3720.36	3730.95	C	PhD	fh|qy	-1	0	but um if someone came that was great and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring , how much data will I have to work with , with that person .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1279	3730.95	3731.83	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	And so it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1280	3731.87	3736.13	E	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	i Yeah , so I would think , exploratory things now . Uh , three months from now {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1281	3736.42	3741.2	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um , I mean the transcriptions I think are a bit of an unknown cuz we haven't gotten those back yet as far as the timing ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1282	3741.55	3757.31	E	Professor	s	+1	0	but I think as far as the collection , it doesn't seem to me l like , uh , unreasonable to say that uh in January , you know , ro roughly uh {disfmarker} which is roughly three months from now , we should have at least something like , you know , twenty - five , thirty hours .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1283	3758.07	3761.21	C	PhD	s	-1	0	And we just don't know about the transcription part of that ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1284	3758.16	3759.22	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	So that 's {disfmarker}
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1285	3760.6	3765.44	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Yeah , we need to {disfmarker} I think that there 's a possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1286	3761.21	3761.27	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	so .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1287	3761.27	3762.04	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	I mean , it {disfmarker}
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1288	3765.44	3771.8	B	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	and uh es especially since these people won't be uh used to dealing with multi - channel uh transcriptions .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1289	3766.19	3766.51	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1290	3766.32	3766.68	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1291	3771.8	3773.81	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So I think that we 'll need to adjust some {disfmarker}

Bmr005.B.dialogueact1293	3783.19	3786.09	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I wanted to ask another a a aspect of the data collection .

Bmr005.E.dialogueact1298	3797.59	3800.64	E	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , what we 're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1299	3800.64	3801.75	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but I think if it 's a real {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1300	3802.39	3802.66	E	Professor	qh^aa	-1	0	Why not ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1301	3802.73	3802.98	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1302	3803.4	3804.6	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , I 'm thinking , politically {disfmarker}

Bmr005.B.dialogueact1304	3805.69	3806.26	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	You could do this ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1305	3805.72	3806.76	C	PhD	h|s^aa	-1	0	Well yeah ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1306	3806.26	3807.26	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know . You could .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1307	3806.76	3822.99	C	PhD	s	-1	0	or just if you 're {disfmarker} if you ha If there are meetings here that happen that we can record even if we don't {pause} um have them do the digits , {comment} or maybe have them do a shorter {pause} digit thing {comment} like if it was , you know , uh , one string of digits , or something , they 'd probably be willing to do .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1308	3818.88	3820.79	G	Grad	s	-1	0	We don't have to do the digits at all if we don't want to .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1309	3823.87	3826.09	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Then , having the data is very valuable ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1310	3826.09	3834.8	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	cuz I think it 's um politically better for us to say we have this many hours of audio data , especially with the ITR , if we put in a proposal on it .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1311	3835.15	3838.49	C	PhD	s	-1	0	It 'll just look like ICSI 's collected a lot more audio data .

Bmr005.C.dialogueact1313	3842.56	3849.15	C	PhD	s	+1	0	but there 's {disfmarker} there are research questions you can answer without the transcriptions , or at least that you can start to answer .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1315	3849.04	3850.56	B	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	It seems like you could hold some meetings .

Bmr005.A.dialogueact1321	3859.73	3869.55	A	PhD	s	-1	0	One is uh um without doing the digits {disfmarker} Or , I guess the full - blown one is where you do the digits , and everything , and then talk about doing it without digits ,
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1322	3869.55	3876.52	A	PhD	qw	-1	0	what if we had another level , just to collect data , which is without the headsets and we just did the table - mounted stuff .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1323	3876.17	3877.56	C	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	Need the close - talking mikes .

Bmr005.C.dialogueact1327	3879.72	3881.23	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	yeah . I 'm really scared {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1328	3880.28	3884.08	G	Grad	s	-1	0	It seems like it 's a big part of this corpus is to have the close - talking mikes .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1330	3883.25	3883.82	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	I see , OK .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1329	3882.89	3886.82	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	Um or at least , like , me personally ? I would {disfmarker} {comment} I {disfmarker} couldn't use that data .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1331	3883.85	3884.15	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1332	3887.54	3887.76	B	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	I agree .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1334	3887.76	3888.47	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And Mari also ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1333	3887.69	3888.04	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	Um .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1335	3888.47	3890.12	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	we had {disfmarker} This came up when she she was here .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1336	3890.12	3890.71	B	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	That 's important .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1338	3890.91	3892.07	C	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	So it 's a great idea ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1337	3890.69	3891.16	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1339	3891.16	3908.03	E	Professor	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} b By the {disfmarker} by the way , I don't think the transcriptions are actually , in the long run , such a big bottleneck .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1340	3892.07	3893.82	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and if it were true than I would just do that ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1341	3893.82	3894.95	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	but it 's not that bad {disfmarker}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1342	3895.04	3897.28	C	PhD	s	-1	0	like the room is not the bottleneck ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1343	3897.28	3898.95	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and we have enough time in the room ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1344	3898.95	3902.96	C	PhD	s	-1	0	it 's getting the people to come in and put on the {disfmarker} and get the setup going .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1345	3908.03	3911.6	E	Professor	s	-1	0	I think the issue is just that we 're {disfmarker} we 're blazing that path .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1346	3911.73	3912.06	E	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1347	3912.21	3919.81	E	Professor	fh|qy^rt	+1	0	And {disfmarker} and um {disfmarker} d Do you have any idea when {disfmarker} when uh the {disfmarker} you 'll be able to send uh the ten hours to them ?
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1348	3918.93	3924.02	G	Grad	h|s	-1	0	Well , I 've been burning two C Ds a day , which is about all I can do with the time I have .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1349	3921.32	3921.59	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1350	3924.1	3924.36	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1351	3924.32	3925.58	G	Grad	s^cc	+1	0	So it 'll be early next week .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1352	3925.84	3926.35	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , OK .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1353	3926.58	3927.99	E	Professor	s	-1	0	So early next week we send it to them ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1354	3927.99	3930.31	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and then {disfmarker} then we check with them to see if they 've got it
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1355	3930.31	3934.19	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and we {disfmarker} we start , you know asking about the timing for it .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1356	3931.09	3931.29	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1357	3934.19	3941.93	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	So I think once they get it sorted out about how they 're gonna do it , which I think they 're pretty well along on , cuz they were able to read the files and so on .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1358	3940.74	3940.93	G	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Yep .

Bmr005.C.dialogueact1366	3947.43	3947.9	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	What if {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1367	3949.85	3950.81	G	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , you {disfmarker} we can't complain .

Bmr005.E.dialogueact1369	3951.26	3960.56	E	Professor	s	-1	0	But they {disfmarker} But at any rate , they 'll {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think once they get that sorted out , they 're {disfmarker} they 're making cassettes there , then they 're handing it to someone who they {disfmarker} who 's {disfmarker} who is doing it ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1370	3960.56	3968.44	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	and uh I think it 's not going to be {disfmarker} I don't think it 's going to be that much more of a deal for them to do thirty hours then to do one hour ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1371	3968.44	3969.8	E	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	I think . It 's not going to be thirty
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1372	3968.63	3970.28	G	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yep . I think that 's probably true .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1373	3969.53	3969.69	C	PhD	qy^bh	-1	0	Really ?
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1374	3970.26	3971.06	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So it 's the amount of {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1375	3971.33	3972.44	E	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} it 's just getting it going .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1376	3972.45	3973.99	G	Grad	s	+1	0	It 's pipeline , pipeline issues .

Bmr005.C.dialogueact1380	3975.93	3986.84	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	I mean , I don't know , if there 's any way without too much more overhead , even if we don't ship it right away to IBM even if we just collect it here for awhile , {comment} to record you know , two or three more meeting a week ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1381	3986.84	3992.6	C	PhD	s^df^rt	-1	0	just to have the data , even if they 're um not doing the digits , but they do wear the headphones ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1382	3992.05	3995.1	E	Professor	s^ng.%-	-1	0	But the lunch meetings are pretty much one person getting up and {disfmarker}

Bmr005.C.dialogueact1398	4019.19	4021.45	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Alright , {comment} so I 'll just throw it out there ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1400	4021.45	4029.3	C	PhD	s	+1	2	if anyone knows of one more m or two more wee meetings per week that happen at ICSI , um that we could record , I think it would be worth it .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1399	4021.05	4021.87	G	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	That was hilarious .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1401	4029.23	4039.09	E	Professor	fg|s^co	+1	0	Yeah . Well , we should also check with Mari again , because they {disfmarker} because they were really intending , you know , maybe just didn't happen , but they were really intending to be duplicating this in some level .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1402	4039.09	4040.98	E	Professor	s	-1	0	So then that would double {pause} what we had .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1403	4043.28	4046.45	E	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh . And there 's a lot of different meetings at UW
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1404	4046.45	4050.49	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh {disfmarker} I mean really m a lot more {comment} than we have here right cuz we 're not right on campus ,

Bmr005.E.dialogueact1406	4050.49	4050.74	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	so .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1407	4051.21	4055.12	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Is the uh , notion of recording any of Chuck 's meetings dead in the water ,
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1408	4055.12	4056.66	A	PhD	qrr^rt	-1	0	or is that still a possibility ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1409	4055.98	4058.94	E	Professor	h|s	-1	0	Uh , {vocalsound} they seem to have some problems with it . We can {disfmarker} we can talk about that later .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1410	4059.39	4061.9	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um , but , again , Jerry is {disfmarker} Jerry 's open {disfmarker}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1411	4061.9	4066.74	E	Professor	s	-1	0	So I mean , we have two speech meetings , one uh network meeting ,
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1412	4067.36	4069.72	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh Jerry was open to it but I {disfmarker} I s
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1413	4070.4	4078.65	E	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	One of the things that I think is a little {disfmarker} a little bit of a limitation , there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work , we probably can't do it every week .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1414	4079.71	4086.17	E	Professor	s	+1	0	You know ? I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think that {disfmarker} that people are gonna feel uh {disfmarker} are gonna feel a little bit constrained .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1415	4086.61	4089.52	E	Professor	s	-1	0	Now , it might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1417	4089.67	4093.7	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And the {disfmarker} then {disfmarker} so then they can just really sort of try to {disfmarker} put the mikes on and then just charge in and {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1416	4089.4	4089.63	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1418	4094.43	4099.44	C	PhD	qw	-1	0	What if we give people {disfmarker} you know , we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something ?

Bmr005.B.dialogueact1422	4103.42	4110.56	B	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	But I had another question , which is um , you know , in principle , w um , I know that you don't want artificial topics ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1421	4102.93	4103.79	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Alright , alright , alright .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1423	4110.56	4120.52	B	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	but um it does seem to me that we might be able to get subjects from campus to come down and do something that wouldn't be too artificial .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1424	4120.52	4124.65	B	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	I mean , we could {disfmarker} political discussions , or {disfmarker} or something or other ,
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1425	4122.36	4123.43	C	PhD	s^na	-1	0	No , definitely .

Bmr005.B.dialogueact1428	4127.13	4129.21	B	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	Because , you know , there 's also this constraint . We d
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1429	4129.21	4133.71	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it 's like , you know , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} uh goldibears {disfmarker} goldi goldilocks ,
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1430	4133.71	4137.14	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it 's like you don't want meetings that are too large , but you don't want meetings that are too small .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1431	4137.45	4144.24	B	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	And um {disfmarker} a and it just seems like maybe we could exploit the subj human subject p p pool , in the positive sense of the word .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1432	4144.35	4149.19	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Well , even {disfmarker} I mean , coming down from campus is sort of a big thing , but what about
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1433	4149.44	4150.26	B	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	We could pay subjects .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1434	4150.6	4152.3	A	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	or what about people in the {disfmarker} in the building ?

Bmr005.A.dialogueact1436	4153.62	4157.17	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , there 's the State of California downstairs , and {disfmarker}

Bmr005.C.dialogueact1438	4156.98	4157.22	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	I mean {disfmarker}
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1439	4157.34	4162.98	G	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	I just really doubt that uh any of the State of California meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public .
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1440	4161.33	4161.66	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1441	4162.64	4163.0	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .

Bmr005.G.dialogueact1446	4172.44	4177.08	G	Grad	s:s	-1	0	but then I got email from them that said " no , we decided we 're not really interested and we don't wanna come down and hold meetings . "
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1447	4177.47	4180.3	G	Grad	s	+1	1	So , I think it 's gonna be a problem to get people regularly .

Bmr005.E.dialogueact1450	4185.94	4189.77	E	Professor	s	-1	0	And I {disfmarker} I d I do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the {disfmarker} with the radio .

Bmr005.C.dialogueact1463	4205.93	4207.13	C	PhD	qw	-1	0	Why {disfmarker} why not ?
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1462	4205.83	4209.33	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because {disfmarker} because {disfmarker} because we would be asking them to do something different .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1464	4210.84	4212.26	C	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Well , we can find out .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1465	4212.45	4216.27	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I know for instance Mark Liberman was interested uh in {disfmarker} in LDC
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1466	4216.27	4217.54	C	PhD	s	-1	0	getting {pause} data ,

Bmr005.E.dialogueact1469	4219.24	4228.63	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	But what I 'm saying is uh if I talk to people that I know who do these th who produce these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel , let 's say , of a distant mike .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1471	4227.92	4228.25	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1472	4229.29	4232.04	E	Professor	s	-1	0	And u I think routinely they would not do this .
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1473	4233.02	4237.27	E	Professor	s	-1	0	So , since I 'm interested in the distant mike stuff , I wanna make sure that there is at least that somewhere

Bmr005.E.dialogueact1479	4238.84	4244.89	E	Professor	s	-1	0	But if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they uh might be e e willing to {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} I might be able to talk them into it .
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1480	4244.78	4245.15	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1481	4246.32	4248.01	G	Grad	s^t	-1	0	Um . We 're getting towards the end of our disk space ,
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1482	4248.01	4250.04	G	Grad	fh|s^co	-1	0	so we should think about trying to wrap up here .
