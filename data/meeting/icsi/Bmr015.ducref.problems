During digits readings , subjects tend to chunk numbers together rather than reading each number separately.
When working from the mixed channel , transcribers may select only one start and end time for overlapping speech , resulting in points of overlap that are less tightly tuned.
Transcribers are likely to overlook backchannels in densely populated sections of speaker overlap.
Speaker mn014 reported that this is also problematic for the automatic detection of speech and non-speech , as backchannels that are very short and not loud enough will inevitably be overlooked.
Speaker mn005 reported problems distinguishing between possible harmonics and other frequency peaks , and creating an algorithm for obtaining the instantaneous frequency.
The encoding of all audible breaths is too time-consuming.
