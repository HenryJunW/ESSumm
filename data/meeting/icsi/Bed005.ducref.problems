Although the parser has been modified to work with english , the details of its internal workings ( calling functions , setting discourse variables , generating actions ) are not yet clear.
Understanding the parsed data is helped by the database of objects , people and events accompanying the system , but the mapping of referring expressions to database objects can still be a hurdle.
On a different level , the Bayes-net used to generate the different action modes can easily become unmanageable as the number of features to be taken into account increases.
This can be tackled with the use of the Noisy-OR technique.
The deterministic functions this requires cannot be introduced directly into JavaBayes , although some runaround ways can be implemented.
A final , high-level issue , that has not been dealt with yet , is the definition of the constructions and the construction grammar framework analysis behind the whole enterprise.
