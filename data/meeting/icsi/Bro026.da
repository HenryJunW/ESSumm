Bro026.A.dialogueact71	136.49	139.5	A	PhD	s	-1	0	But it 's {disfmarker} So , right now it 's the mechanism with SSH .
Bro026.D.dialogueact70	136.05	136.31	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Oh .
Bro026.E.dialogueact69	136.039	136.259	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Great !
Bro026.A.dialogueact72	139.5	144.86	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I don't {pause} s I didn't set up {disfmarker} You can also set up a CVS server {pause} on a new port .
Bro026.A.dialogueact73	144.95	148.916	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	It 's like well {pause} uh , a main server , or d You can do a CVS server .

Bro026.E.dialogueact76	148.839	151.469	E	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	Then that 's using the CVS password mechanism and all that ,
Bro026.A.dialogueact77	149.569	149.719	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	But .
Bro026.A.dialogueact79	151.48	152.13	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , right .

Bro026.A.dialogueact80	152.23	155.96	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	But I didn't do that because I was not sure about {pause} security problems .
Bro026.A.dialogueact81	155.96	156.97	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I would have to {disfmarker}
Bro026.E.dialogueact82	155.98	165.166	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	So w when you came in from Belgian {disfmarker} {comment} Belgium , using SSH , uh , was it asking you for your own {pause} password into ICSI ?
Bro026.E.dialogueact83	165.166	167.306	E	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	So if yo you can only do that if you have an account at ICSI ?
Bro026.A.dialogueact84	165.74	166.19	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro026.A.dialogueact85	167.113	167.303	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .

Bro026.A.dialogueact87	168.316	168.466	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.E.dialogueact88	169.014	171.224	E	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	Cuz there is an {disfmarker} a way to set up anonymous CVS
Bro026.E.dialogueact89	171.224	171.464	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro026.A.dialogueact91	171.74	177.98	A	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah , you ha in this way you ca you have to set up a CVS server but then , yeah , you can access it .
Bro026.E.dialogueact90	171.464	171.804	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	So that {disfmarker}
Bro026.E.dialogueact92	178.623	179.053	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bro026.A.dialogueact94	179.2	181.16	A	PhD	s	-1	0	you {disfmarker} you can set up priorities .
Bro026.E.dialogueact93	179.053	180.323	E	PhD	s^bu.%-	-1	0	So the anonymous mechanism {disfmarker}
Bro026.A.dialogueact95	181.23	185.93	A	PhD	s	-1	0	You can access them and mostly if you {disfmarker} if y the set the server is set up like this .
Bro026.E.dialogueact96	183.741	184.241	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro026.E.dialogueact97	185.063	188.203	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Because a lot of the open source stuff works with anonymous CVS
Bro026.E.dialogueact98	188.203	192.38	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and I 'm just wondering {disfmarker} Uh , I mean , for our transcripts we may want to do that .
Bro026.A.dialogueact99	189.12	189.69	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .

Bro026.B.dialogueact104	196.162	197.902	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	I mean , we 're still so much in development .
Bro026.E.dialogueact103	196.158	196.688	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.E.dialogueact105	197.11	197.49	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact107	197.902	199.472	B	Professor	s	-1	0	We want to have just the insiders .
Bro026.E.dialogueact106	197.69	198.05	E	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	yeah , yeah .
Bro026.E.dialogueact108	198.79	199.85	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Oh , I wasn't suggesting for this .
Bro026.E.dialogueact109	199.85	201.83	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	I 'm {pause} thinking of the Meeting Recorder {comment} stuff
Bro026.B.dialogueact111	202.284	202.624	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.E.dialogueact110	201.83	201.96	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	but .
Bro026.E.dialogueact112	202.869	203.129	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .

Bro026.B.dialogueact116	207.875	209.175	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	So , uh {disfmarker}
Bro026.E.dialogueact117	212.788	213.268	E	PhD	qw^t	-1	0	What 's new ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact118	214.49	222.36	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , I mean , I think maybe the thing to me might be {disfmarker} I me I 'm sure you 've just been working on {disfmarker} on , uh , details of that since the meeting ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact119	222.36	222.7	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact120	222.7	223.44	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	And so {disfmarker}
Bro026.A.dialogueact121	223.926	225.486	A	PhD	h|s^m.%--	-1	0	Mmm , since the meeting ,
Bro026.A.dialogueact123	226.1	230.67	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	well , I {disfmarker} I 've been {disfmarker} I 've been train training a new VAD and a new {pause} feature net .
Bro026.B.dialogueact122	226.09	227.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	That was {disfmarker} that was Tuesday .
Bro026.B.dialogueact124	231.974	232.264	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro026.A.dialogueact125	232.53	233.86	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	So they should be ready .
Bro026.A.dialogueact126	234.888	235.898	A	PhD	h	-1	0	Um .
Bro026.B.dialogueact127	236.354	247.993	B	Professor	s^co^t	+1	1	But I guess maybe the thing {disfmarker} since you weren't {disfmarker} yo you guys weren't at that {disfmarker} that meeting , might be just {disfmarker} just to , um , sort of recap , uh , the {disfmarker} the conclusions of the meeting .
Bro026.A.dialogueact129	247.775	248.025	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.E.dialogueact128	247.471	247.871	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , great .
Bro026.B.dialogueact131	248.63	248.92	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro026.E.dialogueact130	248.35	249.48	E	PhD	qy^bu^d	+1	1	You 're talking about the meeting with Hynek ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact132	249.896	250.116	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact133	250.116	256.106	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Cuz that was sort of , uh {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we 'd sort of been working up to that , that {disfmarker} that , uh , he would come here this week and {disfmarker} and we would sort of {disfmarker}
Bro026.E.dialogueact134	253.24	253.5	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro026.B.dialogueact135	256.699	270.173	B	Professor	s:qw^t	+1	1	Since he 's going out of town like now , and I 'm going out town in a couple weeks , uh , and time is marching , sort of , given all the mu many wonderful things we could be working on , what {disfmarker} what will we actually focus on ?
Bro026.E.dialogueact136	268.595	268.835	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact137	270.413	272.533	B	Professor	fh|s:qw	+1	1	And , uh {disfmarker} and what do we freeze ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact138	272.533	273.513	B	Professor	s.%--:qw.%--	+1	1	And , you know , what do we {disfmarker} ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact139	273.593	274.783	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So , um .
Bro026.B.dialogueact140	275.202	279.362	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , this {pause} software that these guys created was certainly a {disfmarker} a key part .
Bro026.B.dialogueact141	279.502	280.802	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So then there 's something central
Bro026.B.dialogueact142	280.802	286.732	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and there aren't at least a bunch of different versions going off in {disfmarker} in ways that {pause} differ {pause} trivially .
Bro026.B.dialogueact144	287.112	289.202	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh , um , and , um ,
Bro026.E.dialogueact143	287.03	287.42	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.E.dialogueact145	289.05	289.85	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker} that 's nice .
Bro026.B.dialogueact146	290.602	305.544	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	and then within that , I guess the idea was to freeze a certain set of options for now , to run it , uh , a particular way , and decide on what things are gonna be experimented with , as opposed to just experimenting with everything .
Bro026.B.dialogueact147	305.724	307.314	B	Professor	s	+1	1	So keep a certain set of things constant .
Bro026.B.dialogueact148	308.91	309.85	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So , um .
Bro026.B.dialogueact149	311.89	317.835	B	Professor	fh|s^co^t	+1	1	Uh , maybe describe roughly what {disfmarker} what we are keeping constant for now ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact150	317.965	318.095	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bro026.A.dialogueact151	318.9	319.22	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.A.dialogueact152	319.32	327.968	A	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	Well . So we 've been working like six weeks on {disfmarker} on the noise compensation and we end up with something that seems reasonable .
Bro026.A.dialogueact153	329.23	330.01	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro026.E.dialogueact154	330.112	333.132	E	PhD	qy^rt	+1	1	Are you gonna use {disfmarker} which of the two techniques ?
Bro026.A.dialogueact155	334.12	338.96	A	PhD	s	+1	1	So finally it 's {disfmarker} it 's , um , Wiener filtering on FFT bins .
Bro026.A.dialogueact156	339.643	344.543	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	And it uses , uh , two steps , smoothing of the transfer function ,
Bro026.A.dialogueact157	344.543	348.477	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	the first step , that 's along time , which use recursion .
Bro026.A.dialogueact158	349.783	358.6	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	And {vocalsound} after this step there is a further smoothing along frequency , which use a sliding window of twenty FFT bins .
Bro026.A.dialogueact159	360.11	361.13	A	PhD	h	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro026.A.dialogueact160	362.34	363.44	A	PhD	h	-1	0	And , uh {disfmarker}
Bro026.E.dialogueact161	362.82	368.409	E	PhD	qy^bu^d	-1	0	So this is on the {disfmarker} uh , before any mel scaling has been done ?
Bro026.A.dialogueact162	368.04	368.19	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro026.A.dialogueact164	368.58	368.77	A	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	yeah .
Bro026.E.dialogueact163	368.409	368.779	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	This is {disfmarker}
Bro026.A.dialogueact166	369.252	369.772	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	It was {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact165	369.236	378.336	B	Professor	qr^bu^d	-1	0	This {disfmarker} this smoothing is done on the estimate , um , of what you 're going to subtract ? Or on the thing that has already had something subtracted ?
Bro026.A.dialogueact167	369.772	369.982	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.A.dialogueact168	379.55	382.832	A	PhD	h|s	-1	0	Uh , {vocalsound} it 's on the transfer function .
Bro026.A.dialogueact169	382.952	383.212	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact170	383.6	385.39	B	Professor	s^bu^m	-1	0	Oh , it 's on the transfer function for the Wiener filter .
Bro026.A.dialogueact171	385.479	385.619	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact172	385.75	386.19	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , OK .
Bro026.A.dialogueact173	390.37	396.3	A	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , so basically we tried {vocalsound} different configuration within this idea .
Bro026.A.dialogueact174	398.84	405.44	A	PhD	s	-1	0	We tried u u applying this on mel bands , having spectral subtraction instead of wiener filtering .
Bro026.A.dialogueact175	406.06	406.61	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro026.A.dialogueact176	408.22	414.41	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	Well , finally we end up with {pause} this configuration that works , uh , quite well .
Bro026.A.dialogueact177	415.81	421.08	A	PhD	s^cc	+1	1	So we are going to fix this for the moment and work on the other aspects of {vocalsound} the whole system .
Bro026.E.dialogueact178	418.034	418.474	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.A.dialogueact179	421.08	421.24	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact180	422.99	426.45	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	Actually , let me int eh , Dave isn't here to talk about it , but let me just interject .
Bro026.B.dialogueact181	426.81	433.9	B	Professor	s	-1	0	This module , in principle , i I mean , you would know whether it 's {vocalsound} true in fact , is somewhat independent from the rest of it .
Bro026.B.dialogueact182	433.9	435.82	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , because you {disfmarker} you re - synthesize speech ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact183	435.82	436.09	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro026.A.dialogueact184	436.409	436.879	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact185	436.877	438.672	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So , um .
Bro026.B.dialogueact186	440.29	442.94	B	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	Uh , well you don't {disfmarker} I guess you don't re - synthesize speech , but you could {disfmarker}
Bro026.A.dialogueact187	442.41	443.47	A	PhD	s^aa.%-	-1	0	We {disfmarker} we do not fo
Bro026.B.dialogueact188	443.63	444.53	B	Professor	h|s^cs^r	-1	0	Uh , but you could .
Bro026.A.dialogueact189	445.32	448.03	A	PhD	s^arp	-1	0	Well {disfmarker} well , we do , but we don't {disfmarker} don't re - synthesize .
Bro026.A.dialogueact190	448.03	451.48	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	In {disfmarker} in the program we don't re - synthesize and then re - analyze once again .
Bro026.A.dialogueact191	451.57	453.93	A	PhD	s	-1	0	We just use the clean FFT bins .
Bro026.B.dialogueact192	454.14	456.97	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	But you have a re - synthesized thing that you {disfmarker} that 's an {disfmarker} an option here .
Bro026.A.dialogueact193	455.27	457.04	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	This is an option that {disfmarker} then you can {disfmarker}
Bro026.A.dialogueact194	457.19	457.28	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact195	457.688	472.547	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , I gu I guess my point is that , um , i in some of the work he 's doing in reverberation , one of the things that we 're finding is that , uh , it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} for the {disfmarker} for an artificial situation , we can just deal with the reverberation and his techniques work really well .
Bro026.B.dialogueact196	472.917	479.302	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But for the real situation uh , problem is , is that you don't just have reverberation , you have reverberation in noise .
Bro026.B.dialogueact197	479.302	481.552	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And if you don't include that in the model , it doesn't work very well .
Bro026.B.dialogueact198	482.062	496.35	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	So in fact it might be a very nice thing to do , to just take the noise removal part of it and put that in front of what he 's looking at . And , uh , generate new files or whatever , and {disfmarker} and , uh , uh {disfmarker} and then do the reverberation part .
Bro026.A.dialogueact199	488.904	489.314	A	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact200	497.92	498.46	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	So it 's {disfmarker}
Bro026.D.dialogueact201	500.343	500.553	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact202	500.956	501.246	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Anyway .
Bro026.E.dialogueact203	501.76	503.09	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	So Dave hasn't {pause} tried that yet ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact204	503.744	505.384	B	Professor	s^ar|%-	-1	0	No , no . He 's {disfmarker} I mean , e
Bro026.E.dialogueact205	506.45	507.5	E	PhD	s^2.%-	-1	0	I guess he 's busy with {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact206	508.012	509.192	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah , prelims , right .
Bro026.C.dialogueact207	508.018	508.928	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Pre - prelim hell .
Bro026.B.dialogueact209	509.192	509.382	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.E.dialogueact208	508.874	509.344	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact210	509.382	509.612	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro026.E.dialogueact211	509.514	509.794	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact212	511.274	512.794	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Uh , but {disfmarker} but , you know , that 'll {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact213	513.124	520.824	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh , it 's clear that we , uh {disfmarker} we are not {disfmarker} with the real case that we 're looking at , we can't just look at reverberation in isolation
Bro026.B.dialogueact214	520.824	524.094	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because the interaction between that and noise is {disfmarker} is considerable .
Bro026.B.dialogueact215	524.637	537.939	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And that 's I mean , in the past we 've looked at , uh , and this is hard enough , the interaction between channel effects and {disfmarker} and , uh {disfmarker} and additive noise , uh , so convolutional effects and {disfmarker} and additive effects .
Bro026.B.dialogueact216	538.584	539.504	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And that 's hard enough .
Bro026.B.dialogueact217	539.504	540.644	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , I don't think we really {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact218	540.644	541.854	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , we 're trying to deal with that .
Bro026.B.dialogueact219	542.044	544.644	B	Professor	s	-1	0	In a sense that 's what we 're trying to deal with in this Aurora task .
Bro026.B.dialogueact220	545.051	552.411	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And we have , uh , the , uh , uh , LDA stuff that in principle is doing something about convolutional effects .
Bro026.B.dialogueact221	552.951	556.82	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And we have the noise suppression that 's doing something about noise .
Bro026.B.dialogueact222	557.456	558.826	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , even that 's hard enough .
Bro026.B.dialogueact223	558.826	561.966	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and the on - line normalization as well , in that s category .
Bro026.B.dialogueact224	563.214	569.264	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i i There 's all these interactions between these two and that 's part of why these guys had to work so hard on {disfmarker} on juggling everything around .
Bro026.B.dialogueact225	569.394	571.594	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But now when you throw in the reverberation , it 's even worse ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact226	571.594	575.674	B	Professor	s	-1	0	because not only do you have these effects , but you also have some long time effects .
Bro026.B.dialogueact227	576.75	583.934	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	And , um , so Dave has something which , uh , is doing some nice things under some conditions with {disfmarker} with long time effects
Bro026.B.dialogueact228	583.934	587.254	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but when it 's {disfmarker} when there 's noise there too , it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's pretty hard .
Bro026.B.dialogueact229	587.254	588.004	B	Professor	s^co.%--	-1	0	So we have to start {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact230	589.091	597.241	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Since any {disfmarker} almost any real situation is gonna have {disfmarker} uh , where you have the microphone distant , is going to have both things ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact231	597.711	599.871	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	we {disfmarker} we actually have to think about both at the same time .
Bro026.E.dialogueact232	602.164	602.344	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact233	607.56	607.84	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact234	608.22	611.824	B	Professor	fh|s^t	-1	0	um {disfmarker} So there 's this noise suppression thing , which is sort of worked out
Bro026.B.dialogueact235	611.824	617.15	B	Professor	s^co^t	-1	0	and then , uh , maybe you should just continue telling what {disfmarker} what else is in the {disfmarker} the form we have .
Bro026.A.dialogueact236	616.28	628.0	A	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , well , {vocalsound} the , um , the other parts of the system are the {disfmarker} the blocks that were already present before and that we did not modify a lot .
Bro026.B.dialogueact237	632.08	638.27	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So that 's {disfmarker} again , that {disfmarker} that 's the Wiener filtering , followed by , uh {disfmarker} uh , that 's done at the FFT level .
Bro026.B.dialogueact238	639.325	639.715	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	Then {disfmarker}
Bro026.A.dialogueact239	639.846	642.496	A	PhD	s^aa|s^rt	-1	0	Yeah , th then the mel filter bank ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact240	642.575	643.055	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.A.dialogueact241	643.446	644.846	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	then the log operation ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact242	645.367	645.817	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.A.dialogueact243	646.151	647.201	A	PhD	h	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact244	647.68	652.081	B	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the filtering is done in the frequency domain ?
Bro026.A.dialogueact245	653.734	653.924	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact246	654.146	654.356	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact247	654.656	654.886	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro026.B.dialogueact248	656.361	659.151	B	Professor	s^rt.%-	-1	0	And then the mel and then the log , and then the
Bro026.A.dialogueact249	658.677	659.747	A	PhD	s^2	-1	0	Then the LDA filter ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact250	659.64	660.65	B	Professor	s^m	-1	0	LDA filter .
Bro026.A.dialogueact251	661.876	665.915	A	PhD	h|s^2	-1	0	mmm , then the downsampling ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact252	663.19	665.548	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	And then uh
Bro026.B.dialogueact253	666.31	667.46	B	Professor	s^m	-1	0	downsample ,
Bro026.A.dialogueact254	668.84	669.56	A	PhD	s	-1	0	DCT ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact255	669.723	670.963	B	Professor	s^m	-1	0	DCT ,
Bro026.A.dialogueact256	672.432	674.952	A	PhD	s	-1	0	then , um , on - line normalization ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact257	676.142	677.922	B	Professor	s^m	-1	0	on - line norm ,
Bro026.A.dialogueact258	680.12	682.76	A	PhD	s	-1	0	followed by {pause} upsampling .
Bro026.A.dialogueact259	683.22	689.81	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Then finally , we compute delta and we put the neural network also .
Bro026.B.dialogueact260	691.53	697.57	B	Professor	s^bk|s^bu	-1	0	Right , and then in parallel with {disfmarker} an {disfmarker} a neural net . And then following neural net , some {disfmarker} probably some orthogonalization .
Bro026.A.dialogueact262	697.857	698.047	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact261	697.84	698.15	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact263	700.092	700.552	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro026.A.dialogueact264	701.157	711.27	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And finally frame dropping , which um , {vocalsound} would be a neural network also , used for estimated silence probabilities .
Bro026.A.dialogueact265	711.27	723.89	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And the input of this neural network would be somewhere between log {pause} mel bands or one of the earlier stages of the processing .
Bro026.B.dialogueact266	720.804	721.064	B	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact267	722.893	726.773	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So that 's sort of {disfmarker} most of this stuff is {disfmarker} yeah , is operating parallel with this other stuff .
Bro026.A.dialogueact268	726.056	726.306	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact269	728.35	728.58	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact270	732.17	736.025	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So the things that we , um , uh ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact271	737.433	738.183	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I guess we sort of {disfmarker} uh ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact272	738.183	741.803	B	Professor	s	-1	0	There 's {disfmarker} there 's some , uh , neat ideas for {vocalsound} V A
Bro026.B.dialogueact273	741.943	742.793	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	So , I mean , in {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact274	743.466	747.567	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I think there 's sort of like {disfmarker} There 's a bunch of tuning things to improve stuff .
Bro026.B.dialogueact275	747.567	755.627	B	Professor	s	-1	0	There 's questions about {pause} various places where there 's an exponent , if it 's the right exponent , or {pause} ways that we 're estimating noise , that we can improve estimating noise .
Bro026.B.dialogueact276	755.627	756.897	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And there 's gonna be a host of those .
Bro026.B.dialogueact277	756.897	783.99	B	Professor	s	+1	2	But structurally it seemed like the things {disfmarker} the main things that {disfmarker} that we brought up that , uh , are {disfmarker} are gonna need to get worked on seriously are , uh , uh , a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a significantly better VAD , uh , putting the neural net on , um , which , you know , we haven't been doing anything with , the , uh , neural net at the end there , and , uh , the , uh , {vocalsound} opening up the second front .
Bro026.B.dialogueact278	785.846	786.226	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bro026.E.dialogueact279	786.84	787.68	E	PhD	qy^d^rt	+1	1	The other half of the channel ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact281	788.551	795.611	B	Professor	s^aa|s	+1	1	Yeah , yeah , I mean , cuz we {disfmarker} we have {disfmarker} we have , uh , uh , half the {disfmarker} the , uh , data rate that they allow .
Bro026.E.dialogueact280	788.21	788.55	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	That what you mean ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact282	796.67	809.202	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	And , uh , so the initial thing which came from , uh , the meeting that we had down south was , uh , that , um , we 'll initially just put in a mel spectrum as the second one .
Bro026.B.dialogueact283	809.957	811.927	B	Professor	s	+1	1	It 's , you know , {pause} cheap , easy .
Bro026.B.dialogueact284	812.902	813.322	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bro026.B.dialogueact285	814.593	816.303	B	Professor	s	+1	1	There 's a question about exactly how we do it .
Bro026.B.dialogueact286	816.363	818.353	B	Professor	s	+1	1	We probably will go to something better later ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact288	819.001	823.0	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but the initial thing is that cepstra and spectra behave differently ,
Bro026.E.dialogueact287	818.66	818.94	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact289	823.0	823.26	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so .
Bro026.B.dialogueact290	829.258	836.914	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um , {comment} I think Tony Robinson used to do {disfmarker} I was saying this before . I think he used to do mel , uh , spectra and mel cepstra .
Bro026.B.dialogueact291	836.914	838.614	B	Professor	s	-1	0	He used them as alternate features .
Bro026.B.dialogueact293	839.057	839.767	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Put them together .
Bro026.E.dialogueact292	838.77	839.06	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact294	840.864	841.194	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bro026.E.dialogueact295	841.07	847.57	E	PhD	qw	+1	1	So if you took the system the way it is now , the way it 's fro you 're gonna freeze it , and it ran it on the last evaluation , where it would it be ?
Bro026.A.dialogueact296	844.415	844.985	A	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.A.dialogueact297	849.114	849.644	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	It , uh ,
Bro026.E.dialogueact298	849.19	850.17	E	PhD	s^e	+1	1	In terms of ranking ?
Bro026.A.dialogueact300	850.77	851.84	A	PhD	s	+1	1	Ri - right now it 's second .
Bro026.D.dialogueact299	850.656	851.126	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Second .
Bro026.D.dialogueact301	851.056	851.146	D	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	
Bro026.A.dialogueact302	852.223	852.663	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro026.E.dialogueact303	852.424	852.714	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact304	854.907	858.067	B	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	Although you {disfmarker} you know , you haven't tested it actually on the German and Danish ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact305	858.067	858.377	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	have you ?
Bro026.A.dialogueact306	858.86	859.53	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	No , we didn't .
Bro026.A.dialogueact307	859.65	859.72	A	PhD	s^aa.%	-1	0	No ,
Bro026.A.dialogueact308	859.72	859.98	A	PhD	fh.%	-1	0	um .
Bro026.B.dialogueact309	859.76	860.0	B	Professor	s^bk^rt	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.E.dialogueact310	861.22	863.41	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	So on the ones that you did test it on it would have been second ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact311	863.9	864.15	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact312	864.887	866.783	B	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	Would it {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} But {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact313	867.751	874.251	B	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	When you 're saying second , you 're comparing to the numbers that the , uh {disfmarker} that the best system before got on , uh {disfmarker} also without German and Danish ?
Bro026.A.dialogueact314	874.009	874.339	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact315	875.66	876.4	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , OK .
Bro026.D.dialogueact316	876.7	880.2	D	PhD	s	-1	0	And th the ranking actually didn't change after the German and Danish .
Bro026.D.dialogueact317	880.948	881.608	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	So , yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact318	881.5	890.87	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Well ranking didn't before , but I 'm just asking where this is to where theirs was without the German and Danish ,
Bro026.A.dialogueact319	886.091	886.151	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.D.dialogueact320	887.812	888.162	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.A.dialogueact322	889.818	890.158	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro026.D.dialogueact321	889.43	889.67	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact324	890.87	891.2	B	Professor	qy^d^f^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro026.D.dialogueact323	890.589	891.179	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact325	891.38	891.86	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro026.E.dialogueact326	891.54	894.18	E	PhD	qw	-1	0	Where {disfmarker} where {disfmarker} where were we actually on the last test ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact327	894.29	900.57	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Oh , we were also esp essentially second , although there were {disfmarker} there were {disfmarker} I mean , we had a couple systems and they had a couple systems .
Bro026.B.dialogueact328	900.57	902.69	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And so , I guess by that {pause} we were third ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact329	902.69	907.149	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	but I mean , there were two systems that were pretty close , that came from the same place .
Bro026.E.dialogueact330	903.815	904.155	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro026.E.dialogueact331	905.64	906.0	E	PhD	s^bk^rt	-1	0	I see .
Bro026.E.dialogueact332	907.376	907.716	E	PhD	s^bk^rt	-1	0	OK .
Bro026.B.dialogueact333	908.28	913.14	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , so institutionally we were {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we were second , with , uh , the third {disfmarker} third system .
Bro026.E.dialogueact334	912.24	915.49	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	We 're {disfmarker} so this second that you 're saying now is system - wide second ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact335	914.55	914.72	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	See {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact336	915.28	917.65	B	Professor	h|s^nd	-1	0	Uh , no I think it 's also institutional ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact338	917.65	918.0	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	isn't it ?
Bro026.E.dialogueact337	917.34	918.78	E	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	Still institutionally second ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact339	918.0	918.25	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact340	918.25	920.07	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , I think both of their systems probably {disfmarker}
Bro026.A.dialogueact341	919.68	921.46	A	PhD	fg|s^nd	-1	0	Uh , we are between their two systems .
Bro026.A.dialogueact343	921.61	921.9	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So
Bro026.B.dialogueact342	921.41	921.77	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Oh , are we ?
Bro026.A.dialogueact344	922.517	924.088	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} It is a triumph .
Bro026.D.dialogueact345	922.92	923.1	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact347	923.82	924.23	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Is it ?
Bro026.D.dialogueact346	923.8	926.35	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Their {disfmarker} their first system is fifty - four point something .
Bro026.D.dialogueact348	926.35	928.14	D	PhD	s	-1	0	And , uh , we are fifty - three point something .
Bro026.A.dialogueact350	928.28	932.267	A	PhD	s	-1	0	But everything is {pause} within the range of one {disfmarker} one percent .
Bro026.D.dialogueact349	928.21	930.55	D	PhD	s	-1	0	And their second system is also fifty - three point something .
Bro026.D.dialogueact351	930.83	931.79	D	PhD	s^aa^m	-1	0	Yeah , one percent .
Bro026.B.dialogueact353	932.13	934.33	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah , so {disfmarker} so basically they 're all {disfmarker} they 're all pretty close .
Bro026.E.dialogueact352	931.932	932.392	E	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	Oh , wow !
Bro026.A.dialogueact355	933.005	933.235	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro026.E.dialogueact354	932.712	933.692	E	PhD	s	-1	0	That 's very close .
Bro026.D.dialogueact356	933.61	933.83	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.E.dialogueact357	933.752	933.982	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact358	934.33	938.87	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	And {disfmarker} and , {vocalsound} um , you know , in some sense we 're all doing fairly similar things .
Bro026.B.dialogueact359	939.498	943.038	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , I mean , one could argue about the LDA and so forth
Bro026.B.dialogueact360	943.038	946.33	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but I {disfmarker} I think , you know , in a lot of ways we 're doing very similar things .
Bro026.B.dialogueact361	946.33	946.93	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	But what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker}
Bro026.E.dialogueact362	946.83	949.81	E	PhD	qw	+1	1	So how did they fill up this {disfmarker} all these {disfmarker} these bits ?
Bro026.E.dialogueact363	949.81	950.64	E	PhD	s^e.%--	-1	0	I mean , if we 're u
Bro026.B.dialogueact364	952.359	953.579	B	Professor	fg|qy^bu^rt	+1	1	Um , why are we using half ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact366	954.316	955.456	B	Professor	fg|%-	-1	0	Well , so you could {disfmarker} you c
Bro026.E.dialogueact365	953.92	954.14	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.E.dialogueact367	954.73	956.96	E	PhD	s.%-:qw.%-	-1	0	Or how are they using more than half , I guess maybe is what I {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact368	957.11	971.148	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah , so I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} uh , you guys are closer to it than me , so correct me if I 'm wrong , but I {disfmarker} I think that what 's going on is that in {disfmarker} in both cases , some kind of normalization is done to deal with convola convolutional effects .
Bro026.B.dialogueact369	971.504	973.794	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh , they have some cepstral {pause} modification ,
Bro026.A.dialogueact371	974.16	974.51	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact370	973.794	974.074	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact372	974.66	976.36	B	Professor	s	-1	0	In our case we have a couple things .
Bro026.B.dialogueact373	976.36	978.96	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	We have the on - line normalization and then we have the LDA RASTA .
Bro026.B.dialogueact374	979.913	985.673	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And {pause} they seem to comple complement each other enough and be different enough that they both seem to help {disfmarker} help us .
Bro026.B.dialogueact375	986.22	988.34	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But in any event , they 're both doing the same sort of thing .
Bro026.B.dialogueact376	988.34	989.3	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But there 's one difference .
Bro026.B.dialogueact377	989.77	994.99	B	Professor	s	+1	1	The LDA RASTA , uh , throws away high modulation frequencies .
Bro026.B.dialogueact378	996.227	997.347	B	Professor	s	+1	1	And they 're not doing that .
Bro026.E.dialogueact379	998.303	999.333	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	So th So {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact380	999.065	1002.65	B	Professor	s	+1	1	So that if you throw away high modulation frequencies , then you can downsample .
Bro026.C.dialogueact381	1001.53	1001.94	C	Grad	s^2.%	-1	0	Get down .
Bro026.E.dialogueact382	1003.62	1004.18	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bro026.E.dialogueact383	1004.47	1004.84	E	PhD	s^bk^r	-1	0	I see .
Bro026.B.dialogueact384	1006.2	1006.87	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bro026.E.dialogueact385	1006.73	1009.3	E	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	So what if you didn't {disfmarker} So do you explicitly downsample then ?
Bro026.E.dialogueact386	1009.55	1010.85	E	PhD	qy^bsc^rt	-1	0	Do we explicitly downsample ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact387	1010.57	1010.75	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.A.dialogueact388	1011.26	1011.47	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.E.dialogueact389	1011.63	1012.73	E	PhD	qw	-1	0	And what if we didn't do that ?
Bro026.E.dialogueact390	1013.92	1015.05	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Would we get worse performance ?
Bro026.A.dialogueact392	1016.36	1019.29	A	PhD	h|s	-1	0	Um {pause} Yeah , not better , not worse .
Bro026.B.dialogueact391	1016.01	1017.25	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	I think it doesn't affect it ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact393	1017.25	1017.59	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	does it ?
Bro026.E.dialogueact394	1018.59	1018.93	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bro026.E.dialogueact395	1019.02	1019.33	E	PhD	s^bk^rt	-1	0	OK .
Bro026.B.dialogueact396	1019.54	1019.78	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact397	1020.45	1025.72	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	So I think the thing is , since we 're not evidently throwing away useful information , let 's try to put in some useful information .
Bro026.E.dialogueact398	1025.56	1025.88	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.E.dialogueact399	1025.99	1026.27	E	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact400	1026.54	1034.47	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	And , uh , so I {disfmarker} you know , we {disfmarker} we 've found in a lot of ways for quite a while that having a second stream uh , helps a lot .
Bro026.B.dialogueact401	1034.47	1040.63	B	Professor	s	+1	1	So that 's {disfmarker} that 's put in , and you know , it may even end up with mel spectrum even though I 'm saying I think we could do much better , just because it 's simple .
Bro026.E.dialogueact402	1040.86	1041.22	E	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact403	1042.07	1042.6	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro026.B.dialogueact404	1044.23	1049.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And you know , in the long run having something everybody will look at and say , " oh , yeah , I understand " , is {disfmarker} is very helpful .
Bro026.E.dialogueact405	1050.16	1057.15	E	PhD	qr^bu	-1	0	So you would {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} You 're thinking to put the , uh , mel spectrum in before any of the noise removal stuff ? or after ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact406	1057.08	1058.01	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , that 's a question .
Bro026.B.dialogueact407	1058.05	1059.28	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , we were talking about that .
Bro026.B.dialogueact408	1059.28	1064.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It looks like it 'd be straightforward to {disfmarker} to , uh , remove the noise ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact409	1065.4	1067.89	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um , and , uh ,
Bro026.E.dialogueact410	1067.98	1070.01	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Cuz that happens before the mel conversion ,
Bro026.E.dialogueact411	1070.01	1070.27	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact412	1070.66	1070.9	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact413	1071.83	1077.88	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	So , I mean , to do it after the mel conversion {disfmarker} uh , after the noise removal , after the mel conversion .
Bro026.B.dialogueact414	1078.51	1082.05	B	Professor	s	-1	0	There 's even a question in my mind anyhow of whether th you should take the log or not .
Bro026.B.dialogueact415	1083.86	1084.4	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bro026.B.dialogueact416	1085.79	1086.74	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I sort of think you should ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact417	1087.02	1091.12	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	but I don't know .
Bro026.A.dialogueact418	1093.3	1095.05	A	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	What about norm normalizing also ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact419	1097.22	1097.54	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Right .
Bro026.B.dialogueact420	1099.01	1099.58	B	Professor	h	-1	0	Uh .
Bro026.B.dialogueact421	1104.69	1107.6	B	Professor	h|qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Well , but normalizing spectra instead of cepstra ?
Bro026.A.dialogueact422	1108.31	1108.52	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact423	1109.34	1110.19	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , probably .
Bro026.B.dialogueact424	1110.73	1111.91	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Some kind would be good .
Bro026.B.dialogueact425	1112.02	1112.42	B	Professor	qh^rt	-1	0	You know ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact426	1112.42	1113.02	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I would think .
Bro026.D.dialogueact427	1113.6	1121.27	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} so it actually makes it dependent on the overall energy of the {disfmarker} uh , the frame .
Bro026.B.dialogueact428	1121.79	1123.39	B	Professor	qr^bu^d	-1	0	If you do or don't normalize ?
Bro026.D.dialogueact429	1124.2	1127.3	D	PhD	s	-1	0	If yo if you don't normalize and {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if you don't normalize .
Bro026.B.dialogueact430	1127.83	1128.14	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro026.B.dialogueact431	1128.23	1131.02	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Yes , so I mean , one would think that you would want to normalize .
Bro026.B.dialogueact432	1131.49	1132.92	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	But I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} w w
Bro026.B.dialogueact433	1133.35	1138.27	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	My thought is , uh , particularly if you take the log , try it .
Bro026.B.dialogueact434	1139.68	1149.4	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And then if {disfmarker} if normalization helps , then y you have something to compare against , and say , " OK , this much effect " {disfmarker} I mean , you don't want to change six things and then see what happens .
Bro026.B.dialogueact435	1149.4	1150.65	B	Professor	s	-1	0	You want to change them one at a time .
Bro026.D.dialogueact436	1149.7	1150.68	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact437	1150.65	1154.28	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So adding this other stream in , that 's simple in some way .
Bro026.B.dialogueact438	1154.94	1162.92	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	And then {pause} saying , oh {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} particularly because we 've found in the past there 's all these {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} these different results you get with slight modifications of how you do normalization .
Bro026.B.dialogueact439	1162.92	1166.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Normalization 's a very tricky , sensitive thing and {pause} you learn a lot .
Bro026.B.dialogueact440	1166.29	1173.95	B	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	So , I would think you would wanna {pause} have some baseline that says , " OK , we don't normalize , this is what we get " , when we do this normalization , when we do that normalization .
Bro026.B.dialogueact441	1175.02	1176.49	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but the other question is {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact442	1176.49	1178.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So I think ultimately we 'll wind up doing some normalization .
Bro026.B.dialogueact443	1178.62	1179.05	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I agree .
Bro026.E.dialogueact444	1179.4	1183.9	E	PhD	qy^rt	+1	1	So this second stream , will it add latency to the system
Bro026.B.dialogueact446	1184.12	1185.18	B	Professor	s^nd	+1	1	No , it 's in parallel .
Bro026.E.dialogueact445	1183.9	1184.49	E	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bro026.C.dialogueact447	1184.64	1185.08	C	Grad	%	-1	0	Para
Bro026.B.dialogueact449	1185.86	1187.52	B	Professor	s	+1	1	We 're not talking about computation time here .
Bro026.E.dialogueact448	1185.67	1186.38	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	S
Bro026.B.dialogueact450	1187.52	1188.76	B	Professor	s	-1	0	We 're ta I think we 're pretty far out .
Bro026.E.dialogueact451	1188.01	1188.24	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact452	1188.76	1191.75	B	Professor	s	+1	1	So it 's just in terms of what data it 's depending on .
Bro026.B.dialogueact453	1191.74	1193.42	B	Professor	s	+1	1	It 's depending on the same data as the other .
Bro026.E.dialogueact454	1192.89	1193.31	E	PhD	s^m	-1	0	Same data .
Bro026.B.dialogueact456	1193.42	1194.34	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So it 's in parallel .
Bro026.E.dialogueact455	1193.31	1193.64	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro026.B.dialogueact457	1196.22	1196.52	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro026.C.dialogueact458	1198.39	1203.92	C	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	So with this , uh , new stream would you train up a VAD on both {disfmarker} both features , somehow ?
Bro026.D.dialogueact459	1206.79	1209.27	D	PhD	s^ar|s^df	-1	0	No , I guess the VAD has its own set of features .
Bro026.C.dialogueact460	1209.43	1209.8	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro026.C.dialogueact462	1210.68	1211.1	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	that 's {disfmarker}
Bro026.D.dialogueact461	1210.31	1215.18	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , which could be this {disfmarker} one of these streams , or it can be something derived from {pause} these streams .
Bro026.B.dialogueact463	1214.72	1215.0	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.C.dialogueact464	1215.55	1215.88	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro026.A.dialogueact465	1216.68	1219.59	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And there is also the idea of using TRAPS , maybe , for the VAD ,
Bro026.A.dialogueact466	1220.82	1221.94	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	which , um {disfmarker}
Bro026.D.dialogueact467	1222.22	1223.09	D	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah , that 's also {disfmarker}
Bro026.A.dialogueact468	1225.24	1231.59	A	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Well , Pratibha apparently showed , when , she was at IBM , that it 's a good idea .
Bro026.A.dialogueact469	1233.08	1233.4	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro026.C.dialogueact470	1235.4	1237.05	C	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Would {disfmarker} would that fit on the handset ,
Bro026.C.dialogueact471	1237.05	1237.46	C	Grad	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bro026.C.dialogueact472	1238.39	1238.58	C	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	Oh !
Bro026.A.dialogueact473	1240.34	1240.81	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I have no idea .
Bro026.C.dialogueact474	1241.13	1241.44	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro026.D.dialogueact475	1242.7	1245.08	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Well , it has t I mean the {disfmarker} th
Bro026.A.dialogueact476	1244.94	1245.66	A	PhD	s^aap	-1	0	It would have to fit
Bro026.A.dialogueact477	1245.73	1245.86	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bro026.A.dialogueact479	1246.11	1246.32	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.D.dialogueact478	1245.89	1248.59	D	PhD	s^aa|s^e	-1	0	Yeah , if it has to fit the delays and all this stuff .
Bro026.B.dialogueact480	1250.45	1251.87	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , there 's the delays and the storage ,
Bro026.C.dialogueact481	1250.51	1250.91	C	Grad	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro026.B.dialogueact482	1251.87	1252.06	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact484	1252.56	1254.33	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But I don't think the storage is so big for that .
Bro026.C.dialogueact485	1252.74	1252.93	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro026.D.dialogueact483	1252.3	1252.51	D	PhD	s^aa^rt	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact486	1254.96	1257.6	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I think th the biggest we 've run into for storage is the neural net .
Bro026.B.dialogueact488	1258.53	1258.74	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bro026.D.dialogueact487	1258.33	1258.49	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact489	1258.95	1259.09	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact490	1260.96	1261.31	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro026.B.dialogueact491	1262.55	1267.91	B	Professor	fh|s:qy	-1	0	And so I guess the issue there is , are we {disfmarker} are we using neural - net - based TRAPS ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact492	1268.37	1269.77	B	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and how big are they ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact494	1270.56	1272.66	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So that 'll {disfmarker} that 'll be , you know , an issue .
Bro026.C.dialogueact493	1270.53	1270.98	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , right .
Bro026.B.dialogueact496	1273.94	1274.94	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Maybe they can be little ones .
Bro026.C.dialogueact495	1273.76	1274.38	C	Grad	fg|%-	-1	0	Yeah . Cuz sh
Bro026.C.dialogueact497	1275.45	1275.68	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bro026.B.dialogueact499	1277.11	1277.76	B	Professor	s^2	-1	0	Mini - TRAPS .
Bro026.C.dialogueact498	1276.79	1286.02	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	Cuz she also does the , uh {disfmarker} the correlation - based , uh , TRAPS , with without the neural net , just looking at the correlation between {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact500	1283.62	1283.85	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Right .
Bro026.B.dialogueact501	1285.24	1287.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And maybe for VAD they would be OK .
Bro026.B.dialogueact502	1287.11	1287.35	B	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact504	1288.95	1289.22	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.C.dialogueact503	1288.53	1289.01	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact506	1289.51	1289.94	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	That 's true .
Bro026.D.dialogueact505	1289.44	1289.66	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact507	1291.08	1291.94	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	Or a simple neural net ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact508	1292.12	1292.43	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact509	1292.43	1303.52	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , the thing is , if you 're doing correlation , you 're just doing a simple {disfmarker} uh , uh {disfmarker} uh , dot product , you know , with some weights which you happened to learn from this {disfmarker} learn from the data .
Bro026.C.dialogueact510	1302.96	1303.25	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact511	1303.52	1304.09	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	And so ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact512	1304.91	1308.77	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh , putting a nonlinearity on it is , {pause} you know , not that big a deal .
Bro026.B.dialogueact514	1309.35	1310.72	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It certainly doesn't take much space .
Bro026.C.dialogueact513	1308.94	1309.23	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.C.dialogueact515	1311.31	1311.58	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro026.B.dialogueact516	1311.84	1314.93	B	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	So , uh , the question is , how complex a function do you need ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact517	1314.93	1317.67	B	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	Do you need to have an added layer or something ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact518	1317.89	1324.8	B	Professor	s	-1	0	In which case , uh , potentially , you know , it could be big .
Bro026.B.dialogueact519	1325.18	1325.38	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro026.C.dialogueact520	1326.15	1326.86	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact521	1331.35	1332.24	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So , uh ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact522	1334.59	1336.51	B	Professor	fh|qw^rt^t^tc	-1	0	uh {disfmarker} So what 's next ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact523	1336.62	1338.54	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Maybe s s remind us .
Bro026.E.dialogueact524	1338.85	1345.74	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	So the meeting with Hynek that you guys just had was to decide exactly what you were gonna freeze in this system ?
Bro026.E.dialogueact525	1345.74	1346.01	E	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	Is that {disfmarker} ?
Bro026.E.dialogueact526	1346.63	1347.27	E	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	Or was there {disfmarker} ?
Bro026.E.dialogueact527	1347.93	1349.91	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Were you talking about what t new stuff ,
Bro026.E.dialogueact528	1349.91	1350.12	E	PhD	qrr.%-	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact529	1350.59	1352.97	B	Professor	s	-1	0	What to freeze and then what to do after we froze .
Bro026.E.dialogueact530	1352.9	1353.22	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact531	1353.77	1353.97	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact532	1359.82	1376.13	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And like I was saying , I think the {disfmarker} you know , the basic directions are , uh , uh {disfmarker} I mean , there 's lots of little things , such as improve the noise estimator but the bigger things are adding on the neural net and , uh , the second stream . And then , uh , improving the VAD .
Bro026.B.dialogueact533	1378.08	1378.43	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bro026.B.dialogueact535	1381.15	1381.49	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro026.D.dialogueact534	1381.14	1388.92	D	PhD	s^cc	+1	1	So , I 'll , um {disfmarker} I 'll actually {disfmarker} after the meeting I 'll add the second stream to the VAD and maybe I 'll start with the feature net in that case .
Bro026.D.dialogueact536	1389.68	1391.06	D	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's like , you 're looking at the VAD ,
Bro026.D.dialogueact537	1391.06	1391.22	D	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro026.A.dialogueact538	1392.29	1392.71	A	PhD	h|s^aa	-1	0	Uh , yeah .
Bro026.A.dialogueact540	1393.57	1395.53	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I I 've a new feature net ready also .
Bro026.D.dialogueact539	1393.21	1393.32	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	I 'll {disfmarker}
Bro026.D.dialogueact541	1395.91	1396.47	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	For the VAD ?
Bro026.A.dialogueact542	1397.37	1401.26	A	PhD	s^ar|s	-1	0	No , uh . Well p two network , one VAD and one {pause} feature net .
Bro026.D.dialogueact543	1400.59	1401.31	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Oh , you already have it ?
Bro026.A.dialogueact544	1401.71	1401.8	A	PhD	s^aa.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.D.dialogueact545	1401.76	1405.25	D	PhD	s^bk|s^bu	+1	1	OK , so just figure how to take the features from the final {disfmarker}
Bro026.A.dialogueact546	1405.5	1405.66	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.D.dialogueact547	1405.85	1406.03	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .

Bro026.E.dialogueact565	1441.32	1441.59	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.E.dialogueact566	1441.98	1444.64	E	PhD	qw	-1	0	So what {disfmarker} how is the , uh , interaction supposed to happen ?
Bro026.E.dialogueact567	1444.82	1456.14	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Uh , I remember the last time we talked about this , it was sort of up in the air whether they were going to be taking , uh , people 's features and then running them or they were gonna give the system out or {disfmarker}
Bro026.D.dialogueact568	1454.6	1454.78	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.D.dialogueact569	1456.05	1456.27	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.E.dialogueact570	1456.85	1458.9	E	PhD	qy^bu^d	+1	2	Oh , so they 're gonna just deliver a system basically .
Bro026.D.dialogueact571	1458.64	1459.22	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact572	1459.16	1459.8	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Do we already have it ?
Bro026.D.dialogueact573	1460.21	1461.82	D	PhD	s^na	+1	2	Yeah , th I {disfmarker} I guess it 's almost ready .
Bro026.E.dialogueact574	1462.14	1462.48	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro026.D.dialogueact575	1462.95	1463.26	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bro026.D.dialogueact576	1464.24	1464.67	D	PhD	%--	-1	0	That 's what {disfmarker}
Bro026.D.dialogueact577	1464.87	1468.99	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	2	So they have released their , uh , document , describing the system .
Bro026.B.dialogueact579	1470.11	1474.31	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	Maybe you could , uh , point it {pause} at Chuck ,
Bro026.E.dialogueact578	1469.7	1470.19	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bro026.B.dialogueact581	1474.31	1475.44	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	because , I mean {disfmarker}
Bro026.D.dialogueact580	1474.01	1474.29	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Sure .
Bro026.E.dialogueact582	1475.08	1477.05	E	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	So we 'll have to grab this over CVS or something ?
Bro026.D.dialogueact583	1477.34	1481.24	D	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	It - no , it 's just downloadable from their {disfmarker} from their web site .
Bro026.E.dialogueact584	1477.45	1478.23	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Is that how they do it ?
Bro026.E.dialogueact585	1479.98	1480.37	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro026.B.dialogueact587	1481.81	1499.8	B	Professor	s^cs.%--	+1	2	Cuz one of the things that might be helpful , if you 've {disfmarker} if you 've got time in all of this is , is if {disfmarker} if these guys are really focusing on improving , uh , all the digit stuff , uh , maybe {disfmarker} and you got the front - end from them , maybe you could do the runs for the {disfmarker}
Bro026.E.dialogueact586	1481.68	1482.02	E	PhD	s^bk^r	-1	0	OK .
Bro026.E.dialogueact588	1493.1	1493.56	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact590	1500.82	1506.77	B	Professor	s^cs^e	+1	2	and {disfmarker} and , you know , iron out hassles that {disfmarker} that you have to , uh , tweak Joe about or whatever ,
Bro026.E.dialogueact589	1500.44	1500.69	E	PhD	s^bk	+1	2	Sure .
Bro026.B.dialogueact591	1506.87	1509.56	B	Professor	s	+1	2	because you 're more experienced with running the large vocabulary stuff .
Bro026.E.dialogueact592	1510.12	1510.43	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro026.B.dialogueact594	1516.84	1517.0	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	S
Bro026.D.dialogueact593	1516.72	1520.94	D	PhD	s^cc	+1	2	So I 'll point you to the web site and the mails corresponding .
Bro026.D.dialogueact595	1522.71	1523.11	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	So I
Bro026.E.dialogueact596	1523.0	1524.82	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	And it {disfmarker} but it 's not ready yet , the system ?
Bro026.D.dialogueact597	1525.28	1530.06	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Uh , I {disfmarker} I think they are still , uh , tuning something on that .
Bro026.D.dialogueact598	1531.04	1536.86	D	PhD	s	-1	0	So they 're like , d they 're varying different parameters like the insertion penalty and other stuff , and then seeing what 's the performance .
Bro026.E.dialogueact599	1537.22	1540.43	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Are those going to be parameters that are frozen , nobody can change ?
Bro026.E.dialogueact600	1540.43	1540.77	E	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	Or {disfmarker} ?
Bro026.D.dialogueact601	1541.55	1546.53	D	PhD	h|s	-1	0	Uh , w I guess there is , uh , time during which people are gonna make suggestions .
Bro026.E.dialogueact602	1547.65	1549.54	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Oh , but everybody 's gonna have to use the same values .
Bro026.D.dialogueact603	1549.38	1549.84	D	PhD	s^bc	-1	0	After that .
Bro026.E.dialogueact604	1550.51	1550.76	E	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	Oh !
Bro026.E.dialogueact605	1550.98	1551.44	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Interesting .
Bro026.D.dialogueact607	1551.84	1552.37	D	PhD	s^am	-1	0	Yeah , I guess .
Bro026.E.dialogueact606	1551.6	1551.84	E	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro026.D.dialogueact608	1552.56	1560.06	D	PhD	fg|s.%--	+1	2	So these sugges these {disfmarker} this , uh , period during which people are gonna make suggestions is to know whether it is actually biased towards any set of features or {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact609	1561.39	1573.93	B	Professor	s	+1	2	Yeah , so I th th certainly the thing that I would want to know about is whether we get really hurt , uh , on in insertion penalty , language model , scaling , sorts of things .
Bro026.E.dialogueact610	1572.88	1573.91	E	PhD	s^2	+1	2	Using our features .
Bro026.B.dialogueact611	1573.93	1574.35	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact613	1574.64	1574.95	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah .
Bro026.E.dialogueact612	1574.25	1574.58	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact614	1575.76	1584.48	B	Professor	fh|s^co	+1	2	Uh , in which case , um , H Hari or Hynek will need to , you know , push the case {pause} more about {disfmarker} about this .
Bro026.E.dialogueact615	1581.77	1582.29	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact616	1586.32	1586.8	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro026.E.dialogueact617	1586.96	1595.93	E	PhD	s.%-	+1	2	And we may be able to revisit this idea about , you know , somehow modifying our features to work with {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact618	1594.93	1595.94	B	Professor	fg|s.%-	-1	0	Yes . In this case ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact619	1596.11	1596.7	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	that 's right .
Bro026.E.dialogueact620	1596.87	1597.26	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact621	1597.96	1598.42	B	Professor	s^aa^r	-1	0	That 's right .
Bro026.B.dialogueact622	1599.56	1605.59	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Um , some of that may be , uh , a last minute rush thing because if the {disfmarker} if our features are changing {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact624	1606.34	1606.62	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bro026.E.dialogueact623	1606.09	1606.2	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact625	1607.77	1609.75	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh . But , um .
Bro026.B.dialogueact626	1612.02	1620.83	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah , the other thing is that even though it 's months away , uh , it 's starting to seem to me now like November fifteenth is right around the corner .
Bro026.B.dialogueact627	1621.52	1640.19	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	And , um , if they haven't decided things like this , like what the parameters are gonna be for this , uh , when " deciding " is not just somebody deciding . I mean , in fact there should be some understanding behind the , uh , {vocalsound} deciding , which means some experiments and {disfmarker} and so forth . It {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it seems pretty tight to me .
Bro026.E.dialogueact628	1640.35	1642.69	E	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	So wha what 's the significance of November fifteenth ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact629	1642.7	1643.82	B	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's when the evaluation is .
Bro026.E.dialogueact630	1644.29	1644.58	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro026.B.dialogueact631	1645.02	1645.27	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact632	1646.45	1647.04	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	So , yeah , so
Bro026.B.dialogueact633	1647.6	1650.12	B	Professor	s	-1	0	after {disfmarker} But , you know , they may even decide in the end to push it off .
Bro026.B.dialogueact634	1651.7	1653.72	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It wouldn't , you know , entirely surprise me .
Bro026.B.dialogueact635	1653.72	1662.34	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	But , uh , due to other reasons , like some people are going away , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm hoping it 's not pushed off for {vocalsound} a l a long while .
Bro026.B.dialogueact636	1662.34	1664.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	That would be , uh {disfmarker} put us in an awkward position .
Bro026.B.dialogueact637	1665.02	1665.27	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact638	1666.78	1667.12	B	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	Anyway .
Bro026.E.dialogueact639	1667.68	1667.97	E	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro026.B.dialogueact640	1671.16	1671.47	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Great .
Bro026.B.dialogueact641	1673.67	1674.92	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah , I think that 'll be helpful .
Bro026.B.dialogueact642	1674.92	1680.18	B	Professor	s	-1	0	There 's {disfmarker} there 's not anybody OGI currently who 's {disfmarker} who 's , uh , working with this
Bro026.B.dialogueact643	1680.18	1680.65	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and
Bro026.E.dialogueact644	1681.23	1685.24	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Is {disfmarker} is this part of the evaluation just a small part ,
Bro026.E.dialogueact645	1685.24	1687.72	E	PhD	qrr	-1	0	or ho how important is this to the overall {disfmarker} ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact646	1687.89	1691.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's , um {disfmarker} it depends how badly {vocalsound} you do .
Bro026.B.dialogueact647	1691.44	1694.5	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , I think that it {disfmarker} it is {disfmarker} Uh .
Bro026.D.dialogueact648	1693.99	1694.21	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	b
Bro026.E.dialogueact649	1694.13	1695.95	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^j^rt	-1	0	This is one of those things that will be debated afterwards ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact650	1696.16	1696.55	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact651	1696.55	1706.83	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , I mean , it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} Conceptually , it {disfmarker} my impression , again , you guys correct me if I 'm wrong , but {pause} my impression is that , um , they want it as a double check .
Bro026.B.dialogueact652	1707.54	1716.85	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	That you haven't come across {disfmarker} you haven't invented features which are actually gonna do badly for a {disfmarker} a significantly different task , particularly one with larger vocabulary .
Bro026.B.dialogueact654	1717.85	1721.46	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	And , um , but it 's not the main emphasis .
Bro026.E.dialogueact653	1717.43	1717.83	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact655	1721.46	1725.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , the truth is , most of the applications they 're looking at are pretty small vocabulary .
Bro026.E.dialogueact656	1725.41	1725.97	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact657	1726.06	1727.35	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So it 's {disfmarker} it 's a double check .
Bro026.B.dialogueact658	1727.35	1729.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So they 'll probably assign it some sort of low weight .
Bro026.E.dialogueact659	1730.41	1733.55	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Seems to me that if it 's a double check , they should give you a one or a zero .
Bro026.E.dialogueact660	1734.24	1736.49	E	PhD	s^e	-1	0	Y you passed the threshold or you didn't pass the threshold ,
Bro026.E.dialogueact661	1736.49	1739.41	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and they shouldn't even care about what the score is .
Bro026.B.dialogueact662	1737.78	1738.12	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact663	1739.46	1741.86	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But , I mean , we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll see what they come up with .
Bro026.B.dialogueact665	1741.91	1755.7	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , but in {disfmarker} in the current thing , for instance , where you have this well - matched , moderately - matched , and {disfmarker} and mis highly - mismatched , uh , the emphasis is somewhat on the {disfmarker} on the well - matched , but it 's only a {disfmarker} a marginal ,
Bro026.E.dialogueact664	1741.8	1742.11	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact666	1755.7	1755.92	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact667	1755.92	1759.35	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's like forty , thirty - five , twenty - five , or something like that .
Bro026.B.dialogueact669	1759.45	1765.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So you still {disfmarker} if you were way , way off on the highly - mismatched , it would have a big effect .
Bro026.D.dialogueact668	1759.36	1759.51	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.E.dialogueact670	1765.44	1766.08	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact671	1766.14	1770.98	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	And , um , it wouldn't surprise me if they did something like that with this .
Bro026.B.dialogueact672	1770.98	1783.08	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So again , if you 're {disfmarker} if you get {disfmarker} If it doesn't help you much , uh , for noisy versions of this {disfmarker} of large vocabulary data , then , uh , you know , it may not hurt you that much .
Bro026.E.dialogueact673	1772.57	1772.97	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bro026.B.dialogueact674	1783.08	1794.13	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	But if it {disfmarker} if you don't {disfmarker} if it doesn't help you much at all , um , or to put it another way , if it helps some people a lot more than it helps other people , uh , if their strategies do , then {disfmarker}
Bro026.E.dialogueact675	1791.95	1792.44	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.E.dialogueact676	1793.9	1795.52	E	PhD	fg|qy.%-	-1	0	So is this , uh {disfmarker} ?
Bro026.E.dialogueact677	1796.04	1800.27	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Uh , Guenter was putting a bunch of Wall Street Journal data on our disks .
Bro026.B.dialogueact678	1799.28	1799.67	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	That 's it .
Bro026.E.dialogueact679	1800.52	1802.26	E	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	So that 's the data that we 'll be running on ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact680	1802.47	1802.67	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.E.dialogueact681	1802.87	1803.28	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bro026.E.dialogueact682	1803.43	1803.62	E	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro026.B.dialogueact683	1804.14	1804.34	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact684	1806.9	1809.78	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	So {pause} we have the data , just not the recognizer .
Bro026.B.dialogueact685	1819.86	1820.2	B	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	OK .
Bro026.E.dialogueact686	1820.93	1827.81	E	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	So this test may take quite a while to run , then . May - judging by the amount of data that he was putting on .
Bro026.B.dialogueact687	1826.85	1828.93	B	Professor	h|s	-1	0	Uh , well there 's training and test ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact688	1828.93	1829.21	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro026.E.dialogueact689	1831.02	1832.02	E	PhD	s^am	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I guess , I 'm not sure .
Bro026.B.dialogueact691	1832.29	1837.32	B	Professor	s	-1	0	No , I mean , if it 's like the other things , there 's {disfmarker} there 's data for training the H M Ms and {disfmarker} and data for testing it .
Bro026.E.dialogueact690	1832.02	1832.49	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	I just {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact692	1837.32	1838.91	B	Professor	fh|%--	-1	0	So I wouldn't {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact693	1839.33	1840.26	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	So it {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker}
Bro026.E.dialogueact694	1840.63	1841.12	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro026.E.dialogueact695	1841.59	1842.91	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	So there 's {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact696	1842.78	1844.24	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So , training the recognizer ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact697	1844.34	1845.26	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but , um
Bro026.B.dialogueact698	1847.34	1847.81	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .

Bro026.C.dialogueact843	2218.59	2224.34	C	Grad	fh|s	+1	2	And , uh , I was looking at some of the work that , uh , Sangita was doing on these TRAPS things .
Bro026.C.dialogueact844	2224.34	2234.07	C	Grad	s	+1	2	So she has , um {disfmarker} she has temporal patterns for , um , a certain set of phonemes , from {disfmarker} from TIMIT ,
Bro026.C.dialogueact845	2234.5	2234.65	C	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro026.C.dialogueact846	2234.65	2235.88	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	the most common phonemes .
Bro026.C.dialogueact847	2235.88	2242.9	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And each one of them has {disfmarker} has a {disfmarker} a nice pattern over time , a one {disfmarker} one second window .
Bro026.C.dialogueact848	2243.27	2244.97	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And it has {disfmarker} has these patterns .
Bro026.C.dialogueact849	2245.22	2256.18	C	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	Um , so she has , um a TRAP for each one of the phonemes , um , times fifteen , for each of the fifteen critical bands .
Bro026.C.dialogueact850	2256.79	2277.42	C	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	And , um , {vocalsound} she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which {disfmarker} which basically , um , is a clustering algorithm that , uh , starts with many , many , many different points {disfmarker} many different clusters {disfmarker} uh , corresponding to the number of data , uh , patterns that you have in the data .
Bro026.C.dialogueact851	2277.82	2284.79	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And then you have this distance mej metric which , uh , measures how {disfmarker} how closely related they are .
Bro026.C.dialogueact852	2285.11	2292.7	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And you start , um {vocalsound} by merging the patterns that are most closely related .
Bro026.E.dialogueact853	2293.3	2294.22	E	PhD	s^2	-1	0	And you create a tree .
Bro026.C.dialogueact854	2294.4	2294.49	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	And
Bro026.C.dialogueact855	2294.58	2295.09	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	y yeah , yeah ,
Bro026.C.dialogueact856	2295.18	2296.67	C	Grad	s^m	-1	0	a dendrogram tree .
Bro026.E.dialogueact857	2296.19	2296.35	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.C.dialogueact858	2297.11	2297.5	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro026.E.dialogueact859	2297.22	2303.7	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	And then you can pick , uh , values anywhere along that tree to fix your set of clusters .
Bro026.C.dialogueact860	2303.89	2312.25	C	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	Right , usually it 's when , um {disfmarker} when the sol similarity measures , um , don't go down as much .
Bro026.E.dialogueact861	2312.27	2312.52	E	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.C.dialogueact862	2312.89	2315.98	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And so , uh {disfmarker} so you stop at that point .
Bro026.C.dialogueact863	2316.18	2333.24	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And what she found was , sh um , was there were five broad , um {disfmarker} broad categories , uh , corresponding to , uh , things like , uh , fricatives and , uh , vocalic , um , and , uh , stops .
Bro026.B.dialogueact864	2323.41	2323.82	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.C.dialogueact865	2333.97	2338.38	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And , uh , one for silence and {disfmarker} and another one for schwa {disfmarker} schwa sounds .
Bro026.C.dialogueact866	2338.83	2344.65	C	Grad	fh|s	+1	2	Um , and , um , I was thinking about ways to {disfmarker} to generalize this
Bro026.C.dialogueact867	2344.65	2350.81	C	Grad	s^df^rt	+1	2	because w you 're {disfmarker} it 's sort of like a {disfmarker} it 's not a completely automatic way of clustering ,
Bro026.C.dialogueact868	2351.16	2359.64	C	Grad	s^df^e	-1	0	because yo beforehand you have these {disfmarker} these TRAPS and you 're saying that {disfmarker} that these frames correspond to this particular phoneme .
Bro026.C.dialogueact869	2360.24	2366.8	C	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	Um , and that 's {disfmarker} that 's constraining your {disfmarker} your clustering to {disfmarker} to the set of phonemes that you already have .
Bro026.C.dialogueact870	2367.3	2380.47	C	Grad	fh|s^cs	-1	0	Um , whereas maybe we want to just take {disfmarker} take a look at , um , arbitrary windows in time , um , of varying length , um , and cluster those .
Bro026.E.dialogueact871	2374.83	2375.4	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.C.dialogueact873	2380.8	2396.85	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And I 'm thinking if we {disfmarker} if we do that , then we would probably , um , at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we 've clustered things like , OK , thi this is a transition , um , this is a relatively stable {disfmarker} stable point .
Bro026.E.dialogueact872	2380.52	2381.12	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.C.dialogueact874	2397.17	2410.96	C	Grad	fh|s^cs	-1	0	Um , and I 'm hoping to find other things of {disfmarker} of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate , um {disfmarker} intermediate categories that , uh , um , I 'll later classify .
Bro026.E.dialogueact876	2411.32	2411.8	E	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact875	2411.32	2413.01	B	Professor	qy	+1	1	Are you looking at these in narrow bands ?
Bro026.C.dialogueact877	2413.78	2415.49	C	Grad	h|s^bk	-1	0	Um , right .
Bro026.C.dialogueact878	2415.88	2416.92	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	F um , I 'm {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact879	2416.74	2418.06	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Cuz that 's what you 're gonna be using ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact880	2418.06	2418.22	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro026.C.dialogueact881	2418.26	2418.82	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro026.C.dialogueact882	2419.0	2419.23	C	Grad	s^aa^r	-1	0	yeah .
Bro026.C.dialogueact883	2419.23	2424.32	C	Grad	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I haven't exactly figured out , um , the exact details for that
Bro026.C.dialogueact884	2424.32	2436.6	C	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	but , uh , the {disfmarker} the representation of the data that I was thinking of , was using , um , critical band , um , energies , {vocalsound} um , over different lengths of time .
Bro026.C.dialogueact885	2437.02	2437.36	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bro026.C.dialogueact886	2439.19	2439.53	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact887	2439.87	2443.47	B	Professor	s	+1	1	Yeah , I mean , it seems somehow that needs th uh , there 's a couple things that I wonder about with this .
Bro026.B.dialogueact889	2443.47	2448.81	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , so one is {disfmarker} is , {pause} again , looking at the same representation ,
Bro026.C.dialogueact888	2443.29	2443.57	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro026.B.dialogueact890	2448.81	2462.47	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	I mean , if you 're going for this sort of thing where you have {pause} uh , little detectors that are looking at narrow bands , then what you 're going to be looking for should be some category that you can find with the narrow bands .
Bro026.C.dialogueact891	2462.7	2463.31	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact892	2463.76	2465.82	B	Professor	s	-1	0	That {disfmarker} that seems to be kind of fundamental to it .
Bro026.B.dialogueact894	2466.61	2475.77	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um , and then the other thing , uh , is {disfmarker} that I wonder about with it , and {disfmarker} and don't take this in the wrong way , like I {disfmarker} I know what I 'm doing or anything ,
Bro026.C.dialogueact893	2466.4	2466.62	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro026.B.dialogueact895	2475.89	2479.09	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	but , I mean . {vocalsound} Um , just wondering really .
Bro026.C.dialogueact896	2479.41	2479.87	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact897	2480.2	2506.92	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	Um , the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you 're trying to find {pause} the right system in some sense , whether you 're trying by categories or {disfmarker} or parameters {pause} um , and your goal is discrimination , then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to , um , unsupervised nearness of things , um , is actually better .
Bro026.C.dialogueact898	2503.61	2505.38	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact899	2507.73	2516.34	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	Um , and I don't know if that {disfmarker} I mean , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness , you know , maybe {disfmarker} maybe this isn't right , but it 'd be something I 'd be concerned about .
Bro026.B.dialogueact900	2516.46	2532.61	B	Professor	qy^d^df^f^rt	+1	1	Because , for instance , you can imagine , uh , uh , i i if you remember from {disfmarker} from , uh {disfmarker} from your {disfmarker} your quals , John Ohala saying that , uh , " buh " {comment} and " puh " {comment} differed , uh , not really cuz of voicing but because of aspiration .
Bro026.B.dialogueact902	2533.52	2535.93	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , in as far as wha what 's really there in the acoustics .
Bro026.C.dialogueact901	2533.05	2533.81	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact903	2536.51	2544.12	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	So , um , if you looked {disfmarker} if you were doing some coarse clustering , you probably would put those two sounds together .
Bro026.B.dialogueact904	2545.07	2556.06	B	Professor	s	+1	1	And yet , I would gue I would guess that many of your recognition errors were coming from , uh , um , pfft , {comment} screwing up on this distinction .
Bro026.C.dialogueact905	2556.85	2557.27	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact906	2557.41	2561.73	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	So , in fact , it 's a little hard because recognizers , to first order , sort of work .
Bro026.B.dialogueact907	2562.3	2565.71	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And the reasons we 're doing the things we 're doing is because they don't work as well as we 'd like .
Bro026.B.dialogueact908	2566.24	2571.12	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And since they sort of work , uh , it means that they are already doing {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact909	2571.12	2580.81	B	Professor	s:qw	+1	1	if you go and take any recognizer that 's already out there and you say , " how well is it distinguishing between {pause} schwas and stops ? "
Bro026.C.dialogueact910	2581.17	2581.8	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact911	2581.99	2584.94	B	Professor	s	+1	1	Boy , I bet they 're all doing nearly perfectly on this ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact913	2585.22	2585.5	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro026.C.dialogueact912	2584.84	2585.33	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact914	2585.93	2592.11	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So these {disfmarker} these big categories that differ in huge obvious ways , we already know how to do .
Bro026.B.dialogueact915	2593.12	2594.73	B	Professor	qh	-1	0	So , what are we bringing to the party ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact916	2594.73	2608.09	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , in fact what we wanna do is have something that , particularly in the presence of noise , uh , is better at distinguishing between , uh , categories that are actually close to one another , and hence , would probably be clustered together .
Bro026.C.dialogueact917	2609.22	2609.91	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact918	2609.76	2611.08	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So that 's th that 's the hard thing .
Bro026.B.dialogueact919	2611.08	2620.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , I understand that there 's this other constraint that you 're considering , is that you wanna have categories that , uh {disfmarker} that would be straightforward for , say , a human being to mark if you had manual annotation .
Bro026.B.dialogueact920	2621.61	2623.48	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And it 's something that you really think you can pick up .
Bro026.B.dialogueact921	2623.48	2639.07	B	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	But I think it 's also essential that you wanna look at what are the {vocalsound} confusions that you 're making and how can you come up with , uh , categories that , uh , can clarify these confusions .
Bro026.C.dialogueact922	2629.63	2630.14	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.C.dialogueact923	2642.0	2642.94	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact924	2642.79	2649.13	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So , I mean , the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at , but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it .
Bro026.B.dialogueact925	2649.74	2650.1	B	Professor	%	-1	0	
Bro026.B.dialogueact926	2649.78	2652.99	B	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	Y y this is more like , you know , how does LDA differ from PCA ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact927	2653.82	2654.86	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , they 're the same sort of thing .
Bro026.B.dialogueact929	2654.86	2656.06	B	Professor	s	-1	0	They 're both orthogonalizing .
Bro026.C.dialogueact928	2654.41	2654.76	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro026.B.dialogueact930	2656.06	2656.92	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	But , you know {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact931	2657.63	2665.9	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and , um , this is a little harder because you 're not just trying to find parameters . You 're actually trying to find the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the categories themselves .
Bro026.B.dialogueact932	2666.73	2669.47	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , so a little more like brain surgery , I think
Bro026.B.dialogueact933	2670.73	2671.17	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	on yourself .
Bro026.B.dialogueact934	2674.63	2674.97	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bro026.B.dialogueact936	2675.83	2676.74	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So , uh
Bro026.C.dialogueact935	2675.42	2675.71	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact937	2677.92	2678.01	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact938	2678.37	2681.25	B	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	anyway . That 's my {pause} thought .
Bro026.C.dialogueact939	2681.63	2682.0	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro026.B.dialogueact940	2685.35	2687.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	You 've been thinking about this problem for a long time actually .
Bro026.B.dialogueact941	2687.62	2691.73	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , well {disfmarker} W actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it {vocalsound} a lot .
Bro026.E.dialogueact942	2688.01	2688.42	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact943	2691.73	2693.05	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And you 've been thinking about it more now ,
Bro026.D.dialogueact944	2693.09	2693.35	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact946	2693.89	2694.71	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	these categories .
Bro026.E.dialogueact945	2693.73	2694.13	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact948	2695.1	2695.19	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.E.dialogueact947	2694.93	2695.39	E	PhD	fg	-1	0	I guess {disfmarker}
Bro026.E.dialogueact949	2698.14	2706.05	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I don't {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} um , it 's not clear to me how to reconcile , you know , what you 're saying , which I think is right , with {pause} the way I 've been looking at it .
Bro026.E.dialogueact950	2706.05	2708.36	E	PhD	s^no	-1	0	That it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's all not very clear to me .
Bro026.E.dialogueact951	2708.91	2718.47	E	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	But it seems to me that the desire {disfmarker} the desirable feature to have is something that , um , is bottom - up .
Bro026.E.dialogueact952	2718.84	2720.08	E	PhD	s	-1	0	You know , however we do that .
Bro026.B.dialogueact953	2719.35	2719.72	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.E.dialogueact954	2720.69	2728.04	E	PhD	s^no	-1	0	And and so I guess what I don't understand is how to do that and still be discriminative ,
Bro026.E.dialogueact955	2728.04	2741.62	E	PhD	s	-1	0	because to be discriminative you have to have categories and the only categories that we know of to use are sort of these human {disfmarker} human sig significant {disfmarker} categories that are significant to humans , like phonemes , things like that .
Bro026.B.dialogueact956	2728.86	2729.21	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro026.E.dialogueact957	2741.62	2743.21	E	PhD	s	-1	0	But that 's sort of what you want to avoid .
Bro026.E.dialogueact958	2743.21	2746.35	E	PhD	s^no	-1	0	And so that feels {disfmarker} I don't know how to get out of this .
Bro026.B.dialogueact959	2744.1	2764.99	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , here 's a {disfmarker} here 's a , uh , uh Here 's a generic and possibly useless thought , which is , {vocalsound} um , what do you really {disfmarker} I mean , in a sense the only s s systems that make sense , uh , are ones that {disfmarker} that have something from top - down in th in them .
Bro026.B.dialogueact960	2766.14	2766.36	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact961	2766.36	2776.33	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Because if e even the smallest organism that 's trying to learn to do anything , if it doesn't have any kind of reward for doing {disfmarker} or penal penalty for doing anything , then it 's just going to behave randomly .
Bro026.E.dialogueact962	2776.52	2777.19	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact963	2777.36	2786.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So whether you 're talking about something being learned through evolution or being learned through experience , it 's gotta have something come down to it that gives its reward or , you know , at least some reinforcement learning ,
Bro026.E.dialogueact964	2784.66	2784.98	E	PhD	fg	-1	0	Right .
Bro026.B.dialogueact966	2786.55	2786.81	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro026.E.dialogueact965	2786.06	2787.58	E	PhD	s:qw	-1	0	So the question is , how far down ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact967	2788.34	2788.6	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	And
Bro026.E.dialogueact968	2788.38	2790.28	E	PhD	s	-1	0	We could stop at words , but we don't ,
Bro026.E.dialogueact969	2790.36	2790.56	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro026.E.dialogueact970	2790.56	2791.98	E	PhD	s	-1	0	We go all the way down to phonemes .
Bro026.B.dialogueact971	2792.27	2798.25	B	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	Right , but I me I {disfmarker} I think that maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is {disfmarker} is trying to deal with the {disfmarker} with these phonemes .
Bro026.B.dialogueact973	2799.33	2809.59	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	You know , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and i it 's almost like you want categories if {disfmarker} if our {disfmarker} if our , uh , um , {vocalsound} metric of {disfmarker} of goodness , uh , i if our {disfmarker}
Bro026.E.dialogueact972	2799.06	2799.36	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact974	2809.93	2817.81	B	Professor	s^bsc^cs	-1	0	correction {disfmarker} if our metric of badness {vocalsound} is word error rate then , um , maybe we should be looking at words .
Bro026.E.dialogueact975	2818.06	2818.73	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact976	2818.68	2824.42	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for very nice , uh , reasons we 've looked for a while at syllables , and they have a lot of good properties ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact977	2824.42	2831.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but i i i if you go all the way to words , I mean , that 's really {disfmarker} I mean , d w In many applications you wanna go further .
Bro026.B.dialogueact978	2831.44	2835.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	You wanna go to concepts or something , or have {disfmarker} have {disfmarker} have concepts , actions , this sort of thing .
Bro026.E.dialogueact979	2832.88	2833.13	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.E.dialogueact980	2835.0	2836.13	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	But words would be a nice {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact981	2835.59	2835.78	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	But ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact982	2836.29	2837.16	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	words aren't bad , yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact983	2837.32	2837.79	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and
Bro026.E.dialogueact984	2837.9	2841.65	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Yeah , so the common {disfmarker} right , the common wisdom is you can't do words because there 's too many of them ,
Bro026.E.dialogueact985	2841.65	2841.89	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro026.E.dialogueact986	2841.89	2846.05	E	PhD	s	-1	0	So you have to have some smaller set that you can use ,
Bro026.E.dialogueact987	2846.89	2851.69	E	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	uh , and {disfmarker} and so everybody goes to phonemes .
Bro026.E.dialogueact988	2852.04	2859.49	E	PhD	s	-1	0	But the problem is that we {disfmarker} we build models of words in terms of phonemes and these models are {disfmarker} are really cartoon - ish ,
Bro026.E.dialogueact989	2859.49	2859.73	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro026.E.dialogueact990	2859.73	2866.13	E	PhD	s	-1	0	So when you look at conversational speech , for example , you don't see the phonemes that you {disfmarker} that you have in your word models .
Bro026.B.dialogueact991	2860.29	2860.65	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact992	2864.9	2868.44	B	Professor	fg|s^nd	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but we 're not trying for models of words here .
Bro026.B.dialogueact993	2868.86	2870.45	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	See , so her here 's maybe where {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact994	2870.88	2886.66	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	If the issue is that we 're trying to come up with , um , some sort of intermediate categories which will then be useful for later stuff , uh , then {pause} maybe it doesn't matter that we can't have enough {disfmarker}
Bro026.E.dialogueact995	2879.72	2880.11	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.E.dialogueact996	2881.03	2881.51	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact997	2886.84	2893.33	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	I mean , what you wanna do is {disfmarker} is build up these categories that are {disfmarker} that are best for word recognition .
Bro026.E.dialogueact998	2893.32	2893.57	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro026.E.dialogueact999	2894.47	2894.74	E	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	Right .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1000	2895.17	2898.63	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and somehow if that 's built into the loop of what the categories {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact1001	2898.63	2904.09	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , we do this every day in this very gross way of {disfmarker} of running o a thousand experiments
Bro026.E.dialogueact1002	2898.81	2899.3	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	
Bro026.E.dialogueact1003	2901.3	2901.83	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1004	2904.09	2907.6	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because we have fast computers and picking the thing that has the best word error rate .
Bro026.E.dialogueact1005	2907.46	2907.81	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1006	2908.04	2909.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	In some way {disfmarker} I mean , we derive that all the time .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1007	2909.94	2912.24	B	Professor	s	-1	0	In some ways it 's really not {comment} a bad {disfmarker} bad thing to do
Bro026.B.dialogueact1008	2913.01	2919.42	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because it tells you in fact how your adjustments at the very low level affect the {disfmarker} the final goal .
Bro026.E.dialogueact1009	2917.82	2918.33	E	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.E.dialogueact1010	2919.71	2920.29	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1011	2920.59	2924.85	B	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	Um , so maybe there 's a way to even put that in in a much more automatic way ,
Bro026.E.dialogueact1012	2923.48	2923.98	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1013	2925.41	2931.73	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	where you take , you know , something about the error at the level of the word or some other {disfmarker} it could be syllable {disfmarker} but in some large unit ,
Bro026.E.dialogueact1014	2932.04	2932.32	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1015	2933.06	2939.35	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh , and uh {disfmarker} yeah , you may not have word models , you have phone models , whatever ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact1016	2939.35	2943.87	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but you sort of {pause} don't worry about that , and just somehow feed it back through .
Bro026.E.dialogueact1017	2941.4	2941.77	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1018	2944.13	2948.27	B	Professor	s	-1	0	You know , so that 's , uh , wh what I called a useless comments because I 'm not really telling you how to do it .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1019	2948.27	2951.63	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	But I mean , it 's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker} it 's , you know {disfmarker} it
Bro026.E.dialogueact1020	2951.3	2958.79	E	PhD	s^bs	-1	0	No , but I think the important part in there is that , you know , if you want to be discriminative , you have to have uh , you know , categories .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1021	2959.02	2959.32	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro026.E.dialogueact1022	2959.39	2966.15	E	PhD	s	-1	0	And I think this {disfmarker} the important categories are the words , and {pause} not the phones .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1023	2963.05	2963.34	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1024	2966.65	2966.92	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.E.dialogueact1025	2966.75	2967.11	E	PhD	s^am	-1	0	Maybe .
Bro026.E.dialogueact1026	2967.42	2967.97	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	And so {disfmarker}
Bro026.E.dialogueact1027	2969.26	2969.43	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	Right .
Bro026.E.dialogueact1028	2969.43	2978.14	E	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	If you can put the words in to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact1029	2979.86	2985.03	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Now , that being said , I think that {disfmarker} that if you have something that is , um {disfmarker} i
Bro026.B.dialogueact1030	2985.1	2988.57	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Once you start dealing with spontaneous speech , all the things you 're saying are {disfmarker} are really true .
Bro026.E.dialogueact1031	2988.76	2989.32	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1032	2989.31	3000.13	B	Professor	s	-1	0	If you {pause} have read speech that 's been manually annotated , like TIMIT , then , you know , i i you the phones are gonna be right , actually , {vocalsound} for the most part .
Bro026.E.dialogueact1033	2993.59	2993.9	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.E.dialogueact1034	2999.08	2999.25	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact1036	3000.2	3006.76	B	Professor	fh|s^rt	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so , uh , it doesn't really hurt them to {disfmarker} to do that , to put in discrimination at that level .
Bro026.E.dialogueact1035	2999.78	3000.05	E	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1037	3007.74	3011.09	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um , if you go to spontaneous speech then it 's {disfmarker} it 's trickier
Bro026.B.dialogueact1038	3011.28	3013.77	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , uh , the phones are {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact1039	3014.95	3019.96	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	uh , you know , it 's gonna be based on bad pronunciation models that you have of {disfmarker}
Bro026.E.dialogueact1040	3020.4	3021.0	E	PhD	b	-1	0	
Bro026.B.dialogueact1042	3021.01	3024.51	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and , um {disfmarker} And it won't allow for the overlapping phenomenon
Bro026.E.dialogueact1041	3020.53	3020.96	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro026.E.dialogueact1043	3024.31	3034.11	E	PhD	s	-1	0	So it 's almost like there 's this mechanism that we have that , you know , when {disfmarker} when we 're hearing read speech and all the phonemes are there you know , we {disfmarker} we deal with that ,
Bro026.E.dialogueact1044	3034.11	3043.56	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but when we go to conversational , and then all of a sudden not all the phonemes are there , it doesn't really matter that much to us as humans
Bro026.E.dialogueact1045	3043.56	3052.67	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because we have some kind of mechanism that allows for these word models , whatever those models are , to be {pause} munged , you know ,
Bro026.E.dialogueact1046	3052.67	3054.37	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and it doesn't really hurt ,
Bro026.E.dialogueact1047	3054.37	3054.54	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	and
Bro026.E.dialogueact1048	3060.36	3063.17	E	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I 'm not sure how {disfmarker} {vocalsound} how to build that in .
Bro026.E.dialogueact1049	3064.03	3064.41	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1050	3068.68	3069.11	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact1051	3069.4	3072.92	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , I guess the other thing i is {disfmarker} is to think of a little bit {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact1052	3073.44	3079.96	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , we when y when you start looking at these kind of results I think it usually is {disfmarker} is pretty intuitive ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact1053	3079.96	3095.61	B	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	but start looking at um , what are the kinds of confusions that you do make , uh , you know , between words if you want or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or , uh , even phones in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in read speech , say , uh , when there is noise .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1054	3097.02	3100.46	B	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	You know , so is it more across place or more across manner ?
Bro026.B.dialogueact1056	3100.46	3101.83	B	Professor	s.%--:qy.%--	-1	0	Or is it cor you know , is it {disfmarker} ?
Bro026.C.dialogueact1055	3100.45	3101.3	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1057	3101.93	3111.89	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , I know one thing that happens is that you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you , uh , you lose the , um , uh , low energy phones .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1058	3112.78	3116.86	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , if there 's added noise then low energy phones {vocalsound} sometimes don't get heard .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1059	3117.45	3126.36	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And if that {disfmarker} if that is {disfmarker} if it {disfmarker} uh , if that turns it into another word or {disfmarker} or different {disfmarker} you know , or another pair of words or something , then it 's more likely to happen .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1060	3126.93	3131.77	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	But , um , I don't know , I w I would {disfmarker} I would guess that you 'd {disfmarker}
Bro026.C.dialogueact1061	3126.94	3127.54	C	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1062	3133.34	3133.94	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	W I don't know .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1063	3134.64	3135.3	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	Anyway , that 's {disfmarker}
Bro026.E.dialogueact1064	3135.48	3142.58	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I think part of the difficulty is that a l a lot of the robustness that we have is probably coming from a much higher level .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1066	3143.1	3143.48	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro026.E.dialogueact1065	3142.97	3148.23	E	PhD	s	-1	0	You know , we understand the context of the situation when we 're having a conversation .
Bro026.E.dialogueact1067	3148.23	3154.14	E	PhD	s	-1	0	And so if there 's noise in there , you know , our brain fills in and imagines what {disfmarker} what should be there .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1068	3152.24	3152.6	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	Well that {disfmarker}
Bro026.C.dialogueact1069	3152.25	3155.76	C	Grad	fg|s.%-	-1	0	Yeah . We 're {disfmarker} we 're doing some sort of prediction of what {disfmarker}
Bro026.E.dialogueact1070	3154.93	3155.83	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , exactly .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1071	3155.78	3157.29	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Oh , sure , that 's really big .
Bro026.C.dialogueact1072	3156.34	3156.62	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1073	3157.57	3176.0	B	Professor	fh|s^rt	-1	0	Uh , but I mean , even if you do um , uh , diagnostic rhyme test kind of things , you know , where there really isn't an any information like that , uh , people are still better in noise than they {disfmarker} than they are in {disfmarker} in , uh {disfmarker} uh , than the machines are .
Bro026.E.dialogueact1074	3176.27	3176.79	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1075	3177.3	3178.74	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	So , I mean , that 's {disfmarker} i
Bro026.B.dialogueact1076	3179.55	3183.01	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Right . We can't {disfmarker} we can't get it at all without any language models .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1077	3183.01	3184.48	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Language models are there and important
Bro026.B.dialogueact1078	3184.6	3185.9	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but , uh {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact1079	3187.59	3187.99	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1080	3189.13	3193.38	B	Professor	s	-1	0	If we 're not working on that then {vocalsound} we should work on something else and improve it ,
Bro026.B.dialogueact1081	3193.58	3195.97	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	but {disfmarker} especially if it looks like the potential is there .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1082	3196.14	3196.35	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bro026.B.dialogueact1083	3202.4	3203.26	B	Professor	qy^rt^t^tc	-1	0	Should we do some digits ?
Bro026.E.dialogueact1084	3203.57	3203.85	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro026.B.dialogueact1085	3205.31	3205.93	B	Professor	s^df^rt	-1	0	Since we 're here ?
