A typical progress report meeting for the ICSI Meeting Recorder Group at Berkeley.
Each of the group reported their most recent progress , and any results they have achieved.
This then prompted discussion about the reasons behind such findings , which were for the most part not as expected.
Topics the group touched upon included spectral subtraction , phase normalization , Voice activity detection , along with comparisons between systems.
