Bmr013.C.dialogueact0	98.198	99.398	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	so uh um so i wanted to discuss 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact2	98.787	102.127	F	Grad	fg|s^t.x	-1	0	so uh okay right okay gender items um so i wanted to discuss digits briefly but that one too 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact3	100.188	100.508	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	okay digits briefly 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact4	101.238	101.458	C	Professor	b.x	-1	0	right but that one too 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact5	102.34	103.67	C	Professor	s^bk^rt^t	-1	0	okay gender items 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact6	104.79	105.87	C	Professor	fh|s^rt.x	-1	0	uh my digits 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact7	106.4	106.94	C	Professor	qw^t	-1	0	what we got 
Bmr013.A.dialogueact8	107.74	109.41	A	PhD	s^cs^rt.x	+1	1	were enough to presuming fishing new 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact9	109.86	112.19	C	Professor	s^bk^m^rt	+1	1	new version uh presentation 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact10	113.425	119.063	B	Postdoc	fg|qy^t	-1	0	we want to say something about an update of see uh transcript okay yeah what you summarize the 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact11	115.35	116.85	G	PhD	s^aa|qy^cs.%-	-1	0	say something about an update yeah what you summarize the 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact12	119.79	121.3	C	Professor	s^bk^m	+1	0	okay i'm transcripts and 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact13	121.871	127.435	G	PhD	s^e	+1	0	and i guess that includes some the filtering for that to s. r. s. 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact14	128.318	128.618	B	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr013.C.dialogueact15	129.17	129.91	C	Professor	qw^br^rt	-1	0	filtering for what 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact16	130.353	136.496	G	PhD	s	-1	0	it basically basically for their references that we need to go from the the fancy transcript to the sort of brain dead 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact17	135.721	139.651	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it basically basically be recap of a meeting that we had time like this morning sort of brain dead it's done 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact18	137.83	138.05	C	Professor	b	-1	0	be recap of a meeting that we had time 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact19	139.513	140.593	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	like this morning it's done so 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact20	140.489	140.809	B	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	so 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact21	141.163	141.423	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr013.C.dialogueact22	143.911	145.451	C	Professor	qy^d^rt^t.x	-1	0	you know it's more pressing enough things 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact23	145.451	147.491	C	Professor	fh|qh^cs^t	-1	0	things finally just do those yours 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact24	147.491	148.791	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	those yours is pretty so 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact25	147.82	148.06	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	those yours is pretty so 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact26	149.582	153.332	F	Grad	fg|s^tc	+1	2	okay well that well uh as you can see from the numbers on the digits were almost on the digits 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact27	153.462	155.972	F	Grad	s^rt	+1	0	on the digits goes up to about four thousand 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact28	156.74	166.4	F	Grad	fh|s	+1	0	um and so uh we probably will be done with the t. i. digits and um another couple of weeks um depending on how many we read each time so 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact29	166.95	168.28	F	Grad	s	-1	0	time so they were a bunch that we skipped you know someone fills 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact30	168.41	171.74	F	Grad	s^e^rt	-1	0	you know someone fills out the form and then they're not at the meeting and so it's blank 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact31	172.25	174.21	F	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um but those are almost all filled in as well and so 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact32	174.803	179.343	F	Grad	s^cs	+1	2	so we'll have and so what's it's done it would be very nice trapper recognize earn actually start working with this data and so 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact33	179.649	182.779	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	+1	0	so we'll have a corpus that's the size of jet digits data and so one 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact34	179.804	180.244	F	Grad	%-	-1	0	so we'll have a corpus that's data and so 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact35	182.978	184.868	F	Grad	s^e^na	+1	0	jet digits test one particular test that of t. i. digits 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact36	185.07	185.78	D	PhD	s^m|s^bk	-1	0	that okay so i i 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact37	185.22	191.52	F	Grad	s	-1	0	that okay so i i extracted there there was a file sitting around which people have used here as a test that it had 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact38	191.884	193.384	F	Grad	s	-1	0	uh that it had been randomized and so on and that's just what 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact39	193.364	194.134	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	uh great so on and that's just what i used to generate 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact40	193.384	197.119	F	Grad	s	-1	0	uh great so on and that's just what i used to generate the order of these particular ones 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact41	194.564	194.914	D	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	great i used to generate 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact42	196.021	196.361	D	PhD	s^ba^r	-1	0	these particular ones 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact44	198.192	209.832	C	Professor	s	+1	0	some incredible we could do is take the standard training set for t. i. digits train up output whatever you know great teachers we think we have uh for instance and then test on uh this test that and 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact43	197.73	198.06	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	some incredible we could 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact45	209.962	213.572	C	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	this test that and presumably uh she do reasonably well on that and then 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact46	213.572	217.842	C	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	on that and then presumably we should go to that just and like and stupidly right 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact47	214.855	215.175	D	PhD	b	-1	0	presumably we should go to that just and 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact49	218.4	222.06	C	Professor	s^j	-1	0	and then as you get really smart or the next year or two and you get better yeah and then can preset by one or two percent 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact48	217.95	218.27	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	stupidly and then as you right 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact50	221.292	223.392	F	Grad	s^j	-1	0	you get better yeah and then can preset by one or two percent 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact51	222.41	225.157	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah by one or two percent um but 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact52	225.357	229.314	F	Grad	fg|s	+1	0	um but in order to do that we need to extract out the actual digits um 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact53	229.776	229.976	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	um 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact54	230.001	237.311	F	Grad	fh|s	+1	0	so that the reason it's not just a transcript is that they're false starts and miss reads in this keys and things like that so i this 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact55	237.651	241.471	F	Grad	s	+1	0	so i this a description x. waves where did you select the portion is our um 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact56	242.002	245.282	F	Grad	fh|s	+1	0	it tells you what the next one should be and you just look for that you know so it it'll 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact57	245.372	249.537	F	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	that you know so it it'll put on the screen the next that is six nine nine two two 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact58	250.099	254.129	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so this and you find that and hit the key in record in a file in a particular format and so the 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact59	254.47	254.96	C	Professor	qy.%-	-1	0	so this and so the 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact60	254.563	258.263	F	Grad	qr	+1	1	so this is and so the the question is should we have the transcribers do that or should we just do it with some 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact61	258.826	259.446	F	Grad	s^bsc	-1	0	it with some of us i've been do i've 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact62	259.446	263.326	F	Grad	s	-1	0	of us i've been do i've done eight meeting something like that just by hand 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact63	264.389	265.359	F	Grad	s^bsc	-1	0	just myself rather 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact64	267.497	268.597	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so it will not take long um 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact65	268.847	269.237	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	take long um 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact66	270.63	271.69	C	Professor	fg|qw	-1	0	my feeling uh what what do you think 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact67	271.468	272.228	B	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	my feeling is that we discuss this what do you think 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact68	272.228	273.878	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	is that we discuss this right for coffee and i 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact69	273.878	280.028	B	Postdoc	s^ba^na	+1	1	right for coffee and i think it's a it's a fine idea partly because um it's not an unrelated to their present skill set but it 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact70	280.553	284.133	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but it allowed for them an extra dimension might be an interesting break for them and also it is 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact71	284.183	288.473	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and also it is contributing to be uh cut composition of the transcript because we can incorporate 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact72	288.473	291.983	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	because we can incorporate december strictly and it'll be a more complete transcript so 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact73	291.983	293.793	B	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	complete transcript so i'm i think it's fine so there's there's 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact74	293.476	294.246	F	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	so you think it's fun to have to transcribe there's there's 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact75	293.99	295.84	C	Professor	qy^bu^d	-1	0	so you think it's fun to have to transcribe mister there's there's 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact76	295.825	296.245	B	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	mister yeah okay there's one 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact77	296.21	296.81	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah okay there's one 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact78	296.562	305.788	F	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah okay there's one other small bit which is just entering the information which it's which is at the top of this form onto the computer to go along with the where the digits are recorded automatically 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact79	297.399	297.519	D	PhD	b	-1	0	other small bit which 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact80	303.734	304.204	C	Professor	b	-1	0	along with the where the digits are recorded 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact81	306.156	309.756	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and so it's just you know typing in name times time date and so on 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact82	310.412	317.211	F	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um which again either they can do but it is you know firing up an editor or i can i can do or someone 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact83	317.842	318.732	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and that do or someone else can do 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact84	318.691	326.79	B	Postdoc	s^ng	-1	0	and that you know i'm not that that one i'm not so sure fits into the things that wanted to use the hours for because else can do 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact85	326.79	330.73	B	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	use the hours for because they get the time that they be setting doing that they wouldn't be able to be putting more words on 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact86	331.061	331.541	C	Professor	b	-1	0	but that's really 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact87	331.641	332.941	B	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	but that's really a choice so are these 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact88	332.661	334.891	D	PhD	fg|qy^rt	-1	0	a choice so are these two separate past that can happen 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact89	335.041	336.711	D	PhD	qrr.%-	-1	0	or do they have to happen same time before no they don't have this 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact90	336.402	342.28	F	Grad	s^ar|s	-1	0	time before no they don't have this you have to enter the data before you do the second task but they don't have to happen at the same time 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact92	343.78	344.06	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so it's it's just i have a file 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact91	343.709	352.329	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	so it's it's just i have a file with which has this information on it and then when you start using my scripts for extracting the times it has the times at the bottom of the file 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact93	353.908	359.068	F	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	okay and so um i mean it's easy to create the files and leave them blank so actually we could do it in either order 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact94	359.089	359.539	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact95	359.971	366.313	F	Grad	fh|s^cs	-1	0	okay it's it's sort of nice to have the same person do it just as a double check to make sure you're entering for the right person but 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact96	366.593	368.708	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	but either way 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact97	369.367	369.617	C	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr013.C.dialogueact98	370.66	380.01	C	Professor	fg|s	+1	1	yeah it's my way of uh uh a um order of magnitude um um we've been working with this or or uh uh data set and the 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact99	380.57	393.31	C	Professor	s	+1	1	and the the best score on me nicest part of the data that is where you've got training in tests that that are basically the same kinds of noise and so forth uh is about um 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact100	393.6	394.13	C	Professor	h	-1	0	um i think the best 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact101	394.45	399.559	C	Professor	s	+1	2	i think the best score was something like five percent um air per digits 
Bmr013.A.dialogueact104	400.758	401.528	A	PhD	s^m.%	-1	0	so that you right so heard you 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact102	400.38	401.03	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	so that you right so heard you 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact103	400.573	401.423	F	Grad	s^bu^m	-1	0	so that you right so heard you 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact105	401.57	401.84	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	you right so you 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact106	401.84	408.64	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you right so if you were doing ten digits uh recognition really be in trouble you 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact108	409.22	416.2	C	Professor	s	+1	0	so so that they the point there and this is uh car noise uh uh things but but real real situations well real 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact107	408.793	409.143	D	PhD	b	-1	0	trouble so so that 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact109	416.29	416.93	C	Professor	s^t1.%--	-1	0	well real 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact110	417.49	424.24	C	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	um the uh there's one microphone as close that they have is is is this sort of thing because versus distant uh 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact111	424.861	426.091	C	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	uh but in a car instead of instead 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact112	426.351	429.461	C	Professor	s	+1	0	instead of instead of having a projector it's it's it's current hours uh 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact113	429.949	434.119	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	hours uh but it was an artificially add it to get some some uh artificial sweeteners racially was just people driving 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact114	434.119	435.619	C	Professor	s	-1	0	was just people driving around the car 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact115	436.29	438.18	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so that's that's an indication uh that was with 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact116	438.33	443.031	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh that was with many sites competing in this is the very best score and so forth so more although the 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact117	443.031	445.225	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	so more typical my first like although the model's weren't 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact118	443.56	446.465	D	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	so more typical my first like although the model's weren't that good right i mean 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact119	446.465	446.785	D	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	that good right i mean 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact120	446.865	448.535	D	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	you're that good right i mean the models are pretty crappy 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact121	448.93	449.3	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	you're right i think that we could crappy 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact122	449.3	451.53	C	Professor	s	+1	0	right i think that we could have done better on the models but the thing 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact123	451.53	461.34	C	Professor	s^df	+1	0	the models but the thing is that got this this is it's kind of typical number for all of the uh uh things in this task all of the um languages and so 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact124	461.676	465.106	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and so i i think it probably be the models be better in some than others um 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact126	465.276	471.967	C	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	um so uh anyway just in case once you get into this kind of realm even if you're looking at connected digits it can be pretty hard 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact125	465.077	465.327	D	PhD	b	-1	0	um 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact127	474.274	474.474	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr013.B.dialogueact128	475.359	477.832	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	can be fun to see how we compare to 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact131	478.318	478.898	B	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	how do we do on the t. well the pros 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact129	478.099	478.419	C	Professor	b	-1	0	how do we do on the t. well the pros 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact130	478.264	479.694	D	PhD	qw^tc	-1	0	how do we do on the t. i. digits well the pros on x. are so much difference 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact132	478.67	480.32	F	Grad	s	-1	0	how do we do on the t. i. digits well the pros on x. are so much difference it's going to be

Bmr013.F.dialogueact193	575.174	580.297	F	Grad	fg|s^cc^tc	+1	0	okay so um well do then is all go ahead and enter this data 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact194	581.101	586.322	F	Grad	s^cc	+1	1	yeah and then hand off jane and the transcribers to do the actual extraction of the digits 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact195	584.745	584.985	C	Professor	b	-1	0	to do the actual 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact196	586.775	586.995	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact197	587.57	599.432	C	Professor	s	+1	2	one question i have the i mean we would know the answer to now but like do some guessing but i was talking before about doing some art modeling work uh uh marking of articulate tori teachers we overlap and so on and 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact198	590.48	590.63	F	Grad	b	-1	0	now but like 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact199	599.702	601.406	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so on and and um 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact200	602.138	602.978	C	Professor	s	-1	0	on some subset 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact201	603.51	608.01	C	Professor	s	+1	2	one thought might be to do this uh on on the digits or someplace the digits it'd be easier 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact202	608.01	610.48	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it'd be easier uh and so forth the only thing is 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact203	610.48	614.577	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and so forth the only thing is i'm a little concerned that maybe the kind of phenomena and the reason 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact204	614.827	632.341	C	Professor	s	+1	0	the reason for doing it just because the the argument is that certainly conversational speech the stuff that we've looked at here before um just doing the simple mapping from um the phone to the corresponding features that you could look up in a book uh in right is 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact205	632.826	633.576	C	Professor	s^r	-1	0	right is actually right in fact there's 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact206	633.576	640.448	C	Professor	s^e	+1	0	actually right in fact there's these overlapping process person forcing comes up and then some you know some nationalities comes in here and so forth and you do this gross 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact207	640.448	643.308	C	Professor	s	-1	0	forth and you do this gross things saying well i guess if this phone starting there so 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact208	644.028	645.99	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh that's a reasoning but 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact209	645.99	653.191	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that's a reasoning but it could be that when we're reading digits because it's it's for such a limited set that maybe maybe that time in this incur as much i don't know 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact210	653.191	653.601	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	i don't know 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact211	654.1	657.21	C	Professor	qo^rt	-1	0	it strikes me did if they give me been opinion about that 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact212	662.107	663.977	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and that people might articulate more 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact213	664.067	666.397	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and he might end up with more closer correspondence yeah 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact214	664.552	664.862	C	Professor	b	-1	0	and he might end up with more 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact215	666.699	666.949	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact216	666.751	668.081	F	Grad	s^na	-1	0	sort of less predictability yeah that's i i agree that it's just 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact218	668.39	669.59	D	PhD	s	-1	0	sort of less predictability that it's just 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact217	668.161	669.051	F	Grad	%-	-1	0	sort of less predictability that it's just 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact220	669.728	669.988	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr013.C.dialogueact221	669.848	670.108	C	Professor	b	-1	0	well it's definitely 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact219	669.59	720.519	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	and You hafta
Bmr013.F.dialogueact223	670.998	696.684	F	Grad	fg|qy	-1	0	It's a Well Would this corpus really be the right one to even try that on
Bmr013.G.dialogueact222	670.5	679.451	G	PhD	s	-1	0	well it's definitely true that when people are reading even if they're rereading what they had said spontaneously that they have very different patterns submit show that 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact224	679.451	682.732	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	submit show that and some dissertations have shown that 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact225	680.514	680.704	C	Professor	b	-1	0	and some 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact226	683.501	690.311	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so the fact that they're reading first of all whether they're reading and i'm a room of people or read you know just the fact that they're reading will make a difference 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact227	690.648	690.928	C	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr013.G.dialogueact228	691.153	692.973	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and it depends what you're interested in 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact229	697.795	698.375	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	see i don't know so they maybe the single 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact230	698.375	707.517	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	know so they maybe the single beach do take some very small subset and i have a big program or take a small set uh subset of the conversation speech in a small subset of the digits 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact231	708.141	710.495	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and look and and just get a feeling for it um 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact232	710.993	712.802	C	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	for it um just take a look really 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact233	713.59	726.347	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	an interesting design too because then you have to cut the comparison of the uh predictable speech versus the less people speech and maybe you'd find because i don't think anybody is i at least i don't know well i don't know that's you have to 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact234	713.663	717.37	C	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	because i don't think anybody is i at least i don't know 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact235	718.382	720.721	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	an interesting design well i don't know that's you have to 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact236	721.552	721.872	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	too because then you have 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact237	725.821	726.021	C	Professor	b	-1	0	the less people speech and maybe you'd find 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact238	726.347	729.917	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	speech and maybe you'd find it worked in and see case with if you can unpredictable have to think about 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact239	728.518	728.698	C	Professor	b	-1	0	case with if 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact240	729.348	739.643	D	PhD	s	-1	0	you can unpredictable have to think about the particular acoustic features to mark too because i mean some things they wouldn't be able to mark like you know uh ten slacks something 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact241	733.642	733.932	C	Professor	b	-1	0	i mean

Bmr013.G.dialogueact286	815.367	823.611	G	PhD	fg|s^tc	-1	0	well it's also there's really a difference between the pronunciation malls in the dictionary and the presentations that people produce and so 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact287	823.731	828.652	G	PhD	s	-1	0	produce and so you get some of that information from steve's work on the on the labeling and it really

Bmr013.G.dialogueact291	830.609	832.689	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	i actually think that there should be used for that maybe 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact292	832.689	840.13	G	PhD	s	-1	0	for that maybe although i think the meeting context it's great that he has transcription is they give you the actual phone sequence and 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact293	840.921	850.692	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and you can go from not from that to the particular ray features but that would be a better starting point for marking the jest real features then data where you don't have that because 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact294	850.692	867.45	G	PhD	s	-1	0	well you might be have that because we you want to know both about the way that they're producing a certain sound and what kinds of and what kinds of i mean anemic differences you get between these transcribed sequences and the dictionary ones 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact295	867.607	871.367	C	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	well you might be right some of it might be the way at getting it what i was talking about that that particular ones 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact296	871.367	881.834	C	Professor	s^arp	-1	0	about that that particular reason why i was interested in doing that was because i remember when that happened and so i was over here and he was looking at the specter grams of the more difficult ones 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact297	882.859	888.335	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh he didn't know what to say about what is the sequence of phones there they came up with some 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact298	888.425	889.665	C	Professor	s	-1	0	there they came up with some compromise 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact299	890.272	891.992	C	Professor	s	-1	0	because that really wasn't what it looks like it right 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact301	891.992	893.572	C	Professor	s	-1	0	what it looks like it didn't look like a sequence of phones look like right 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact302	892.14	892.37	F	Grad	b	-1	0	didn't look like a sequence 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact300	891.75	892.2	G	PhD	b	-1	0	what it looks like it didn't look like a sequence right 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact303	893.572	896.162	C	Professor	s	-1	0	of phones look like this blending thing happening here there there's yeah so you have this feature here 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact305	895.722	898.552	F	Grad	s^na	-1	0	here there yeah yeah there's no name for that yeah so you have this feature here and overlap yeah right but it still is 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact304	895.622	896.002	G	PhD	b	-1	0	here there there's yeah so you have this feature here 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact307	897.119	897.429	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah no name for that and overlap right 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact306	896.929	898.009	D	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah yeah there's no name for that so you have this feature here and overlap yeah right but it still is 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact308	897.252	898.243	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	yeah yeah no name for that and overlap yeah right but it still is 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact309	898.17	898.32	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah yeah but it still is 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact310	898.293	900.795	G	PhD	s^nd^tc	-1	0	yeah yeah but it still is there's that there two steps one 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact311	900.795	908.068	G	PhD	s	-1	0	two steps one you know one is going from a dictionary pronunciation of something like going to see you tomorrow it could be going too or 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact312	901.365	911.249	F	Grad	s.%	-1	0	going to you know one is going from a dictionary pronunciation of something like going to see you tomorrow it could be going too or a going to gun just yeah and yeah 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact313	904.302	904.612	C	Professor	b	-1	0	like 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact314	906.934	907.154	C	Professor	b	-1	0	going to see you tomorrow 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact315	908.068	910.478	G	PhD	s	-1	0	going it could be going too or a going to gun just yeah and 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact316	910.078	910.298	C	Professor	b	-1	0	going yeah and 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact317	910.92	911.94	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	going to yeah and yeah 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact318	912.424	914.384	G	PhD	s	-1	0	deceived tomorrow deceived and 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact319	914.774	923.381	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	and that it would be nice to these intermediate are these some of these reduced pronunciations that those transcribers markwardt have people mark those as well 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact320	920.955	921.335	C	Professor	b	-1	0	that those transcribers markwardt have 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact321	924.132	938.332	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	you mean well i don't think morgan suggesting that because it's not um that easy to go from the dictionary word pronunciation the dictionary phone pronunciation to the gesture of one without this intermediate serviceable level kind of representation 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact322	937.645	939.845	F	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	you mean well i don't think morgan suggesting that we do that though representation 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact323	938.451	938.801	C	Professor	qy^bu.%-	-1	0	you mean morgan suggesting that 
Bmr013.A.dialogueact324	940.794	941.024	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	yeah i mean i i'm just 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact325	940.801	948.104	C	Professor	s	+1	0	yeah i mean i i'm just the about of course we're just talking about what to provide is tool for people to do research have different ideas about how to do it so for instance 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact326	948.104	956.595	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so for instance you might have someone who just has a word has words with states and has uh uh comes from articulate or gestures to that and someone 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact327	956.595	960.381	C	Professor	s	-1	0	to that and someone else might actually want some fanatic you know intermediate thing so 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact328	960.909	963.599	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	thing so i think it would be be best to have all that if we could 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact329	964.307	965.097	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	what i'm imagining 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact330	964.954	970.272	F	Grad	s	+1	0	what i'm imagining as a score like notation where each line is a particular feature right so you 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact331	965.673	965.853	C	Professor	b	-1	0	what i'm imagining 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact332	970.693	970.923	F	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right so you 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact334	971.211	971.421	C	Professor	b	-1	0	would say you know it's a voice 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact333	970.923	975.653	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	right so you would say you know it's a voice through here and see of label here you know and nasal here and 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact335	975.653	980.982	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	here and they they could be overlapping and all sorts of bizarre ways that don't correspond to the timing on phones 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact336	981.604	982.674	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i mean this is a kind of reason i remember 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact337	982.674	990.674	C	Professor	s	-1	0	a kind of reason i remember when it's one of the switchboard workshops that uh when we we talked about doing the transcription project they've talked and so it can't be done right 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact338	991.003	991.273	F	Grad	b	-1	0	he 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact339	991.882	996.24	C	Professor	s	-1	0	he was he was what we meant was that this isn't you know sequence of phones and we actually look 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact340	996.24	1005.11	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	and we actually look at switchboard this out you see and yeah and it yeah i mean was and and in fact the internet's here green it was not that good right on the harder ones it depends how 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact341	998.999	1002.19	F	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	out you see and yeah and and and in fact the internet's here green it was not that good right on 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact342	1002.19	1002.53	F	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right on 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact343	1003.0	1003.95	F	Grad	qy^e^rt	-1	0	the harder ones 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact344	1005.22	1006.06	C	Professor	s^aa|s.%-	-1	0	yeah i mean was it depends how you look at 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact345	1005.3	1007.33	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah i mean was it depends how you look at it and i i understand 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact346	1007.41	1011.11	G	PhD	s	-1	0	it and i i understand what you're saying about this kind of transcription exactly because i've seen 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact347	1009.7	1009.91	C	Professor	b	-1	0	this kind 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact348	1011.11	1013.99	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because i've seen you know where does the voice bar start and so forth 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact349	1012.29	1012.5	C	Professor	b	-1	0	you know where does the voice bar 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact350	1014.43	1022.51	G	PhD	s	-1	0	all i'm saying is that it is useful to have that the transcription of what was really sad in which syllables were reduced 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact351	1023.09	1024.76	G	PhD	fh|s^e	-1	0	uh if you're going to add the features it's also 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact352	1024.76	1034.7	G	PhD	s	-1	0	to add the features it's also useful to have some level of representation which is is the reduced it it's of pronunciation variant that currently the pictures don't give you because if 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact353	1033.58	1033.89	C	Professor	b	-1	0	currently the pictures 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact354	1034.7	1038.6	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	don't give you because if you add them to the dictionary you run recognition you you had confusion the people 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact355	1037.53	1037.76	C	Professor	b	-1	0	you you had confusion 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact357	1038.94	1039.14	C	Professor	b	-1	0	the people purposely don't add 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact356	1038.83	1040.41	G	PhD	s	-1	0	the people purposely don't add them 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact358	1041.64	1046.21	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so it would be it would be great if we had so it's useful to know which marian was was produced at least at the phone level 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact359	1045.29	1057.45	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	yeah so it would be it would be great if we had either these kind of labelling on the same portion switchboard steve mark or steve type markings on this uh with these the phone level right that's um exactly exactly 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact360	1055.13	1055.58	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	markings on right that's 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact361	1055.78	1056.27	G	PhD	s	-1	0	markings on this uh with right that's um exactly 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact362	1056.57	1057.17	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah this uh with these um exactly exactly 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact363	1057.15	1057.35	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah these exactly 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact364	1057.7	1058.24	G	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	yeah yeah no i i don't disagree these exactly and steve's 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact365	1058.26	1059.72	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	yeah no i i don't disagree with that and steve's type is fairly 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact366	1058.86	1061.59	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	yeah no i i don't disagree with that and steve's type is fairly it's not that's low uh 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact367	1061.77	1062.67	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	low uh uh i don't know 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact368	1062.67	1065.33	G	PhD	s^no.%--	-1	0	yeah i i don't disagree with it and uh i don't know exactly what the timing was 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact369	1064.47	1065.81	C	Professor	fg|s^aap	-1	0	yeah i i don't disagree with it and timing was 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact370	1065.81	1069.73	C	Professor	s^arp.%--	-1	0	don't disagree with it and you know anything is that what you actually within and end up with is something it's 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact371	1069.73	1071.09	C	Professor	s	-1	0	is something it's all compromise right so the 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact372	1071.09	1071.28	C	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right so the 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact373	1071.28	1076.34	C	Professor	s	-1	0	right so the the string that you end up with isn't actually what happened but it's 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact374	1076.54	1081.35	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but it's the best compromise is a group people scratching or has to come up with to describe what happened and it's more 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact376	1081.74	1084.21	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	but and it's more accurate than the than the dictionary and it's more accurate than phone labels and the word

Bmr013.G.dialogueact396	1104.03	1107.34	G	PhD	s	-1	0	you know what phone it wasn't that's about all you can i can say and then there are other cases 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact397	1106.82	1107.04	D	PhD	b	-1	0	i can say and then there are other cases 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact398	1107.34	1110.24	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	it's basically just having multiple levels of say and then there are other cases where made e. boise right 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact399	1108.62	1113.58	D	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah it's basically just having multiple levels of of information and marking well the other differences where made e. boise right right right 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact400	1110.9	1111.22	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	levels of of information right 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact401	1112.18	1112.49	G	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah and marking right 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact402	1112.78	1112.98	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah and marking right 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact404	1113.18	1117.19	F	Grad	s	+1	0	well the other differences that the the teachers are not synchronized right they overlap right 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact403	1113.15	1113.27	G	PhD	b.x	-1	0	well the other differences right 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact405	1117.19	1117.42	F	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right they overlap 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact406	1117.42	1119.51	F	Grad	s	+1	0	right they overlap each other in weird ways so 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact407	1118.68	1119.04	D	PhD	b	-1	0	each other in weird ways so 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact408	1119.63	1119.95	D	PhD	b	-1	0	ways so 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact409	1120.04	1121.96	F	Grad	s	+1	0	it's not strictly one dimensional signal 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact410	1122.46	1122.69	C	Professor	b	-1	0	so 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact411	1122.98	1125.01	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so i think that's sort of qualitatively different right you can add those features and uh 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact412	1123.65	1123.91	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	i think that's sort of qualitatively right you 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact413	1123.91	1127.51	G	PhD	s^aa|s^arp	+1	0	i think that's sort of qualitatively different right you can add those features and uh but it'll be under specified building be no 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact414	1126.62	1126.83	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	but it'll be under specified 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact415	1127.51	1130.98	G	PhD	s	-1	0	building be no way for you to actually mark what was said completely by features 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact416	1132.12	1138.37	F	Grad	s^aa|s^arp	+1	0	well not with our current system but you could imagine designing a system that the states were features rather than phones and if you're 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact417	1132.21	1132.92	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	well not with our current and if you're 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact418	1140.19	1145.35	G	PhD	s^arp^tc	-1	0	like it's not that that was over that was not yeah well we we probably have a separate um discussion about it whether you can do that 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact419	1140.69	1147.12	B	Postdoc	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	like it's not that that was over that was not comes direction i time yeah so i mean yeah well we we probably have a separate um discussion about it whether you can do that 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact420	1142.94	1143.16	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	like it's yeah separate um discussion about 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact421	1147.12	1147.42	B	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	i time yeah so i mean 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact422	1147.56	1155.73	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	i time yeah so i mean what what where this is i mean i wonder would like to have something it's useful to people other than those who are doing specific kind of research i have a nine so should 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact423	1155.73	1156.88	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	i have a nine so should be something broader but 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact424	1156.88	1185.31	C	Professor	s	-1	0	be something broader but that but uh where i'm coming from is uh were coming off the stuff that they're assaulted with with um uh john talon regime entertainment which uh they uh have um in a multi band system that is uh trained in combination ingredient learning and and the m. too um estimate uh the uh value from one for for particular feature okay 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact425	1185.5	1185.82	C	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	okay 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact426	1186.29	1199.23	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and this is part of a larger image to chinatown has but how the human brain doesn't which is sort of imagining that individual frequency channels are coming up with their own estimate of of these these kinds of something like this might not be you know expect 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact427	1199.23	1201.99	C	Professor	s	-1	0	might not be you know expect teachers tickets and saddam or something 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact428	1201.99	1203.49	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and saddam or something but i mean you know some something like that some kind of low 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact429	1203.49	1207.35	C	Professor	s	-1	0	like that some kind of low level features which are not fully you know phone classification and 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact430	1207.97	1222.4	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and the that this particular image how the how it's done is that then given all of these estimates at that level there's a level above it with and which is is making some kind of sound unit classifications which is you know and and you 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact431	1222.4	1226.66	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and and you know you could argue what goes on there should be and so forth but that's that's 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact432	1226.66	1228.53	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so forth but that's that's sort of what i was imagining doing 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact433	1229.11	1235.38	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um and but still open within that whether you would have an intermediate level in which was actually phones or not he would necessarily 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact434	1235.38	1236.43	C	Professor	s	-1	0	not he would necessarily have to 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact435	1237.43	1247.81	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um but again i wouldn't want to what what what we we produce to be so local and perspective that it was matched what we were thinking of doing one week and 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact436	1247.81	1250.42	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	one week and and and you know what you're saying is right that that if 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact437	1250.42	1257.14	C	Professor	s^bs^cs	-1	0	right that that if we can't we should put in uh another level of of description there for going to get into some of this low level stuff well you know i'm 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact438	1257.38	1264.3	D	PhD	fg|s.%--	+1	1	well you know i'm i mean if we're talking about having the and it caters annotate these kinds of features it seems like 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact439	1265.49	1265.91	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	you know you 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact440	1266.36	1269.52	D	PhD	qy^rt	+1	0	the the question is do they do that on meeting data or do they 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact441	1269.68	1271.77	D	PhD	qrr	-1	0	data or do they do that on switchboard that's what i 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact442	1271.7	1272.45	F	Grad	s^na	-1	0	switchboard that's what i was saying maybe meeting 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact444	1272.54	1276.24	B	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	well it seems like you could do both i mean i was thinking that was saying maybe meeting isn't the right corpus 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact443	1272.45	1274.43	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	was saying maybe meeting isn't the right corpus 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact445	1276.24	1281.72	B	Postdoc	s^cs.%--	-1	0	i mean i was thinking that you would be interesting to do with respect to parts switchboard anyway in terms of uh 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact446	1277.81	1278.37	C	Professor	b	-1	0	you would be interesting to do 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact447	1281.83	1290.63	B	Postdoc	fh|s^df	-1	0	in terms of uh partly to see if you could generate first guesses at what the air ticket or a future would be based on the phone representation that lower level that might 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact448	1283.36	1283.79	C	Professor	b	-1	0	if 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact449	1290.76	1291.92	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	lower level that might be a time game 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact450	1292.28	1294.6	B	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	but also in terms of comparability of uh 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact451	1292.51	1292.89	C	Professor	b	-1	0	but also in terms 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact452	1295.48	1301.19	D	PhD	s^df^na	-1	0	well because the yeah and then also if you did it on switchboard you would have the full continuum of transcription she'd have it from 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact453	1298.94	1299.44	B	Postdoc	s^t1	-1	0	you would have the full continuum 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact454	1301.16	1301.35	B	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	she'd have it from 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact455	1301.19	1307.26	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and you could tell she'd have it from the lowest level that the because the teachers and you have you know the phonetic level that steve did in yeah yeah that's that's all i was thinking that it is telephone 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact456	1305.38	1305.58	B	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	you know the phonetic yeah 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact457	1305.92	1307.53	G	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	and you could tell you know the phonetic level that steve did in yeah yeah that's that's all i was thinking that it is telephone 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact461	1307.65	1308.37	B	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	and you could tell that in yeah it'd be a complete thinking that it is telephone band so 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact458	1307.26	1307.43	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	and you could tell in yeah thinking that it is telephone 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact460	1307.6	1307.89	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and you could tell in yeah thinking that it is telephone 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact459	1307.53	1311.09	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and you could tell that and you get the relative gain it's so it's a little in yeah it'd be a complete set thinking that it is telephone band so the bandwidth might be 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact462	1308.48	1310.39	D	PhD	s	-1	0	that and you get the relative gain it'd be a complete set band so the bandwidth might be 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact463	1309.64	1311.65	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and you get the relative gain it's so it's a little set the bandwidth might be 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact464	1311.33	1312.5	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it's so it's a little different so i yeah 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact466	1312.83	1318.91	C	Professor	fg|s	+1	1	different so i mean know we'll see what how much we can uh get people to do and how much people have and all that sort of thing but but it might be yeah 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact465	1312.77	1313.31	G	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	different so i mean know we'll see yeah 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact467	1315.14	1315.48	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	uh get 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact468	1317.31	1317.5	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	how much people have 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact469	1318.29	1328.91	D	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	and all that sort of thing but my they do both but it might be good to do what jane was thing and you know seated with guesses about what we think the features are based on you know the phone or steve's transcription or something to make it quicker parts to based on the phone 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact470	1318.91	1319.07	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	and all that sort of thing but my they do both but it might be good to do what jane was 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact471	1319.49	1320.15	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	my they do both good to do what jane was thing and you know seated 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact472	1328.15	1333.22	F	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	make it quicker just think yeah exactly parts to based on the phone transcripts they would all be synchronized but then you could imagine nudging them here and there 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact473	1331.89	1332.45	D	PhD	s^2	-1	0	just think yeah could imagine nudging them here and there 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact474	1332.71	1333.62	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	think yeah exactly nudging them here and there 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact476	1335.14	1335.35	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	to voicing over little 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact475	1334.99	1336.51	D	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	well to voicing over little because right 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact477	1336.29	1336.6	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	well because right 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact478	1336.87	1343.42	C	Professor	s	-1	0	well i think with i mean i'm i'm a little behind in what they're doing now and uh the stuff they're doing into at work now but i think that because right 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact479	1343.42	1349.74	C	Professor	s	-1	0	at work now but i think that steven gang or doing something with an automatic system first and then doing some adjustment that's 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact480	1350.02	1351.08	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	ever recall so i mean that's 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact481	1351.54	1361.97	C	Professor	s^cs^rt	+1	1	so i mean that's probably the right way to go anyway is to is to start off with the automatic system with a pretty rich enunciation dictionary that that um you know tries to label at all 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact482	1362.23	1364.35	C	Professor	s^e	+1	0	and then people go through and fix it 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact483	1365.54	1369.9	B	Postdoc	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	so in in our case you'd think about it started with maybe the regular dictionary entry 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact484	1370.21	1370.7	B	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and then or well 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact486	1370.82	1371.74	B	Postdoc	qrr	-1	0	and then or would be well regular addiction 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact485	1370.81	1373.65	C	Professor	fg|s^nd	-1	0	and then or would be well regular addiction i mean is a pretty rich dictionary it's got 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact487	1373.65	1375.81	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	dictionary it's got a different interpretation or you could start 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact489	1375.86	1376.03	B	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	or you could start from the if we were 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact488	1375.47	1383.61	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	or you could start from the if we were going to do the same set of sentences that steve had done we could start with those transcription that's 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact490	1383.25	1383.5	B	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	that's 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact493	1384.3	1384.79	B	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	i think actually what i was 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact491	1383.86	1384.12	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	i think that's actually what i was 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact492	1383.9	1385.78	G	PhD	s^na.%-	-1	0	i think that's actually what i was thinking that the problem 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact495	1385.72	1386.01	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	thinking that the problem is when you run 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact494	1385.3	1385.52	F	Grad	b	-1	0	thinking that the problem 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact496	1385.92	1397.76	G	PhD	s	-1	0	thinking that the problem is when you run if you run a regular dictionary um even if you have variance in there most people don't you'd always get out the actual pronunciation so that's 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact497	1394.11	1394.36	D	PhD	b	-1	0	most people don't 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact498	1397.76	1401.49	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	actually maybe they're using phone pronunciation so that's why the human transcribers giving you the that sensation is they 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact499	1399.25	1399.39	B	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	giving you the 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact501	1401.34	1401.46	B	Postdoc	s^bk.%	-1	0	maybe they're using phone is they 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact500	1401.02	1403.06	C	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	maybe they're using phone recognize or south of doing is they they they i thought that 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact502	1401.49	1401.9	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	maybe they're using phone is they 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact503	1402.99	1404.53	G	PhD	s^na	-1	0	recognize or south of doing okay they they i thought that they were we should

Bmr013.C.dialogueact507	1404.7	1405.1	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay they were we should catch up on what's 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact506	1404.69	1406.41	G	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	okay they were we should catch up on what's is uh 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact509	1406.94	1407.14	C	Professor	b	-1	0	is uh i think that would be a good 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact508	1406.77	1409.19	G	PhD	h|s	-1	0	yes i think that if we also is uh i think that would be a good a good yeah 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact510	1408.62	1411.06	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yes i think that if we also don't have i mean you've got a good start on a good yeah 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact511	1411.16	1412.2	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you've got a good start on it but we don't have a 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact512	1412.2	1417.88	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it but we don't have a really good meeting recorder recognize or transcribe or anything yet so 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact513	1417.88	1418.1	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	or anything yet so so i 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact515	1418.61	1424.8	C	Professor	s^cs	+1	3	so i mean other way look at this is too is to uh do some stuff and switchboard which has all this other stuff to it and 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact514	1418.26	1418.62	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	so i 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact516	1424.93	1432.77	C	Professor	fh|s^cs	+1	1	stuff to it and then um as we get further down the road you can do more things ahead of time we can do some of the same things to me today 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact517	1428.4	1428.74	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	down the road you can 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact518	1430.88	1430.97	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	ahead of time we can 
Bmr013.D.dialogueact519	1432.95	1433.24	D	PhD	b	-1	0	to me today 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact520	1434.13	1439.47	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and and these people might they they are most of them are trained with i. p. they'd be able to

Bmr013.A.dialogueact607	1655.49	1656.13	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	great though i didn't in the service of even think i 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact608	1656.95	1661.81	B	Postdoc	s	+1	0	okay of even think i have thirty minutes that i it's more tightly transcribe with reference to individual channels 
Bmr013.A.dialogueact609	1660.87	1661.24	A	PhD	b	-1	0	okay with reference to individual channels 
Bmr013.A.dialogueact610	1662.03	1662.75	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	that's great that's 
Bmr013.A.dialogueact611	1662.95	1663.27	A	PhD	s^ba^r^rt	-1	0	that's great that's great for me so my goodness 
Bmr013.A.dialogueact613	1663.5	1664.1	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	great for me so my goodness hopefully that's not the 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact612	1663.26	1663.84	B	Postdoc	s^cs.%-	-1	0	great for me so my goodness 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact615	1664.46	1664.73	B	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	hopefully that's not the 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact614	1664.33	1665.96	F	Grad	s	-1	0	hopefully that's not the same meeting that we did 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact616	1666.23	1667.38	B	Postdoc	s^ar|s^nd	-1	0	no actually stiffer meeting so i'm 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact617	1667.15	1667.38	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	meeting so i'm 
Bmr013.A.dialogueact619	1668.01	1668.24	A	PhD	b	-1	0	e. so the you 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact618	1667.66	1674.87	B	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	meeting so i'm e. so the you know we have the they transcribe as if it's one channel with these with the flashes to separate the overlapping parts and 
Bmr013.A.dialogueact621	1674.89	1675.1	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	parts and then we run it through 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact620	1674.87	1680.74	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	parts and then we run it through that that i'm going to edited and then but i read it to channel i switched takes and stay still parts form format and then you 
Bmr013.A.dialogueact622	1679.98	1680.12	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	and stay still parts form format and then you 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact623	1680.74	1683.38	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	form format and then you have all these things but across according to channel and then that means 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact624	1683.38	1692.49	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and then that means that if a person contribute more than once in a given overlap during that time been that that two parts of the others end up together is the same channel and 
Bmr013.A.dialogueact626	1693.05	1693.31	A	PhD	b	-1	0	then i took his 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact625	1692.89	1702.15	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	okay yeah channel and then i took his tool in last night for the first thirty minutes of one of these transcripts i tightened up see um boundaries on individual speakers channels because his 
Bmr013.A.dialogueact627	1700.88	1701.27	A	PhD	b	-1	0	okay boundaries on individual speakers channels 
Bmr013.A.dialogueact629	1702.48	1702.63	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah because his 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact628	1702.15	1707.02	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yeah because his his interface allows me to have total flexibility time tags across channels and 
Bmr013.A.dialogueact630	1706.26	1706.4	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	across channels 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact631	1707.59	1709.84	B	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	so yeah yeah that and um so current 
Bmr013.A.dialogueact633	1709.37	1718.7	A	PhD	s^arp|s^cs	+1	0	So , current This week .
Bmr013.B.dialogueact634	1712.15	1712.48	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	to have some yes when he

Bmr013.F.dialogueact636	1718.17	1722.19	F	Grad	s^cs	+1	0	was a system oh okay yes if we could get a couple meetings done with that level precision i think that would be a good idea 
Bmr013.A.dialogueact637	1720.29	1720.61	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	that level precision 
Bmr013.A.dialogueact639	1722.64	1722.79	A	PhD	b	-1	0	oh okay

Bmr013.A.dialogueact643	1732.69	1737.23	A	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	it seems to me that would be good so have a few minutes from from different meetings so 
Bmr013.A.dialogueact644	1737.67	1738.15	A	PhD	h	-1	0	so but

Bmr013.B.dialogueact835	2109.2	2112.58	B	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	that'll be very useful to getting overlaps to be more precise only through 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact836	2113.49	2116.37	C	Professor	s	+1	0	yes it does this but nicely into the update on transcripts 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact837	2116.34	2116.83	B	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yes it does 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact839	2117.34	2124.52	B	Postdoc	s^t^tc	-1	0	so um i'm um listened and on the nine that this morning and the barker room that that home okay yeah please and this afternoon 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact838	2117.03	2117.25	C	Professor	b.%	-1	0	so um i'm okay 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact840	2119.29	2119.76	G	PhD	s^t3	-1	0	listened yeah please 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact841	2119.97	2120.3	G	PhD	s^co	-1	0	listened and on the nine that yeah please 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact842	2123.67	2124.75	G	PhD	s^2	-1	0	that that home and this afternoon 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact843	2125.31	2126.02	B	Postdoc	s^m	-1	0	interested into the afternoon 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact844	2126.02	2138.54	B	Postdoc	s	+1	1	interested into the afternoon uh concerning this issue uh um the well it's basically the shitty interplay between the transcript format and be processing it they need to do for the answer i recognize her 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact845	2139.22	2144.57	B	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	and um well so i mention the process that i'm going through with the data so you 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact846	2144.57	2149.86	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	with the data so you know i get the data back from the transcript well i'm in fort lee get the day back and transcriber and then 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact847	2149.86	2153.5	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and transcriber and then i check for simple things like spelling errors and things like that and 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact848	2153.82	2158.98	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	like that and um i'm going to be doing a more thorough editing with respect to consistency of the conventions 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact849	2159.55	2161.29	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but they they're generally very good and 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact850	2161.97	2168.62	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	good and then i run it um the channel ice program to get into the multi channel format okay and 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact851	2169.08	2182.1	B	Postdoc	s	+1	0	they but we discussed this morning i would summarize the saying that um these units that results and it a particular channel on a particular time band at at that level um vary in length and 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact852	2182.66	2187.14	B	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and um they recognize your would prefer that the then it's not be overly long but it's really an empirical 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact853	2187.42	2194.52	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but it's really an empirical question whether the units we get at this point true just that process i described might be sufficient for them so 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact854	2194.52	2205.4	B	Postdoc	s^cc	+1	1	for them so as a first pass through the first chance without having to do a lot of hand editing what we're going to do is all run through channel eyes give in those days after it on the other team cross i'm sure it's clean i can do that 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact855	2205.44	2210.5	B	Postdoc	s	+1	0	it's clean i can do that pretty quickly with just that minimal editing without having to have a break things and then 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact856	2207.29	2207.7	C	Professor	b.%	-1	0	with just that 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact857	2210.82	2215.89	B	Postdoc	s	+1	1	things and then we'll see if he others that were getting uh with that at that level are sufficient 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact858	2216.04	2218.24	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and they don't need to be further broken down and if they do 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact859	2218.66	2222.6	B	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and if they do need to be further broken down and maybe just be peace twice maybe it won't be a whole thing 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact860	2223.28	2227.78	B	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	so that's that's what we were discussing sportsperson among it right 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact861	2226.64	2226.99	G	PhD	b	-1	0	sportsperson right 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact862	2228.05	2229.87	B	Postdoc	s	+1	2	also we discuss meditation and things so then lots of right 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact863	2228.56	2229.17	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	also we discuss meditation and things so then lots of right 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact865	2229.87	2230.24	B	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	and things so it's like god of right 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact864	2229.72	2230.06	G	PhD	b	-1	0	and things so it's like god of right 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact866	2230.73	2236.58	B	Postdoc	fh|s	+1	2	it's like god you know i hadn't uh incorporated a convention explicitly to handle acronym for example but if someone 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact867	2236.62	2243.69	B	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	example but if someone says p. um m. it would be nice to have that be directly interpret herbal from the transcript what they said or pick 
Bmr013.C.dialogueact868	2242.48	2242.9	C	Professor	b	-1	0	the transcript 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact869	2243.69	2245.23	B	Postdoc	s^bsc	-1	0	what they said or pick articulate p. c. l. i mean so you 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact870	2245.23	2245.45	B	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	i mean so you 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact871	2245.63	2251.4	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i mean so you it's and so um i i've incorporated also convention with that but that's easy to handle 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact872	2251.39	2253.42	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that but that's easy to handle at the post editing face i'll mention it to 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact873	2253.41	2255.72	B	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	face i'll mention it to transcribers for the next day so that's okay 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact874	2255.72	2256.18	B	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	for the next day so that's okay and then a 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact875	2256.18	2259.18	B	Postdoc	s	+1	2	and then a similar con uh convention for number so they say one eight 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact876	2259.18	2261.4	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so they say one eight reverses one eight three 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact877	2262.26	2270.64	B	Postdoc	fh|s	+1	0	um and also all be um and coding as i do my post editing the things that are in curly brackets what you're clarification material and 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact878	2270.96	2274.42	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	material and it to incorporate that keyword at the beginning so its going 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact879	2274.42	2279.93	B	Postdoc	s	+1	0	so its going to be either gloucester is going to be a vocal sound like a laugh or a cough or so forth 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact880	2280.28	2288.99	B	Postdoc	s	+1	0	or uh non vocal sound like a doors doors slamming that can be easily done with uh you know just a little like additional thing and the general forum 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact881	2289.75	2297.71	G	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	yeah we we just needed away to strips you know all the comments all the things that the linguist wants but they recognize or can't do anything with 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact882	2298.55	2305.13	G	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um but to keep things that we map to like reject models or you know uh mouth noise or cost and 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact883	2305.98	2308.11	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and then there's this interesting issue chain brought up which i hadn't thought about 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact884	2308.11	2309.42	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which i hadn't thought about before but i was realizing 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact885	2309.42	2313.18	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	before but i was realizing as i went through the transcripts that there's some noises like 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact886	2314.25	2314.68	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	um well the 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact887	2314.73	2322.26	G	PhD	s	-1	0	um well the good example was an in breath where a transcriber working from the mixed signal doesn't know who's press it is and they've been assigning 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact888	2322.26	2322.56	F	Grad	b	-1	0	and they've been assigning 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact889	2322.26	2325.3	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and they've been assigning it to someone that may or may not be correct and 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact890	2325.83	2333.99	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and what we do is if it's a brass on you know sound from the speaker we map it too annoys model like a mouse noise model and the recognize or and 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact891	2333.99	2337.19	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and the recognize or and probably doesn't hurt that much once in a while they have these but if 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact892	2337.19	2340.63	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	but if they're in the wrong channel that's not a good idea 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact893	2341.04	2344.9	G	PhD	s	+1	0	and then there's also things like door slams that's really no one channel they're 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact894	2344.9	2346.23	G	PhD	s	-1	0	no one channel they're like it's in the room 
Bmr013.A.dialogueact896	2346.75	2347.02	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	and uh 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact895	2346.68	2346.92	F	Grad	b.%	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr013.G.dialogueact897	2347.2	2354.16	G	PhD	s.%-	+1	0	yeah i've been i've been adding an extra channels and uh jane had this nice uh idea of having like an extra uh a couple two years yeah 
Bmr013.F.dialogueact898	2353.0	2353.78	F	Grad	s^2	-1	0	extra channels uh a couple two years 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact899	2354.13	2354.3	B	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	yeah i've been i've been adding yeah 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact901	2354.3	2356.39	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yeah i've been i've been adding that to the ones i've been editing yeah and we were thinking that 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact900	2354.16	2354.59	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah i've been i've been adding yeah 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact902	2355.35	2359.09	G	PhD	s	+1	0	that to the ones i've been editing and we were thinking that is useful also when there's uncertainties if they hear a breath and 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact903	2359.09	2363.98	G	PhD	s	+1	2	if they hear a breath and they don't know who's brett that is it's better to put in that channel then to put it in the speakers channel because 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact904	2363.98	2365.68	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	the speakers channel because maybe it was someone else's breath and 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact905	2365.68	2366.83	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	breath and uh so 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact906	2366.9	2370.05	G	PhD	s	-1	0	uh so i think that's a good you could always clean that up post processing so a lot of 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact907	2370.55	2370.7	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	so a lot of 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact908	2370.6	2371.92	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so a lot of little details but 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact909	2371.92	2376.91	G	PhD	s	-1	0	little details but i think we're coming to some kind of closure and that's a 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact910	2376.91	2387.13	G	PhD	s	+1	0	and that's a the ideas than uh don can take uh james post process generalize version and with some scripts you know convert that to to a reference for the recognize or and we can 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact911	2387.13	2388.87	G	PhD	s	-1	0	or and we can can run these 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact912	2389.14	2398.54	G	PhD	s	+1	1	sub when that's ready you know as soon as that's ready and as soon as the recognizes here we can get twelve hours of force aligned and recognize data 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact913	2399.44	2401.96	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and you know start working on it 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact914	2401.51	2401.73	B	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	working on it 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact915	2401.96	2405.15	G	PhD	s	-1	0	working on it or i don't know a couple a week or two away i i would say from 
Bmr013.G.dialogueact916	2406.14	2410.63	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	uh if if that process is automatic once we get your post process transcript 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact917	2412.08	2412.2	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	and that doesn't the 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact918	2412.31	2415.13	B	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	and that doesn't the amount of bitching that it would require sucker much i'm just hoping that the units 
Bmr013.B.dialogueact919	2415.13	2418.75	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i'm just hoping that the units that are provided in that way will be sufficient because it
