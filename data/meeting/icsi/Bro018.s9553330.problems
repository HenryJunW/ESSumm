6	Bro018.s.4	In trying to understand France Telecom's code , there does not appear to be a reason for a particular constant value.
Bro018.D.dialogueact323	746.137	755.443	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	3	and also mmm I {disfmarker} H Hynek last week say that if I have time I can to begin to {disfmarker} to study
Bro018.D.dialogueact324	756.247	759.567	D	PhD	s^rt.%--	+1	3	well seriously the France Telecom proposal
Bro018.D.dialogueact326	760.067	761.137	D	PhD	s^rt.%--	+1	3	to look at the code
Bro018.D.dialogueact333	778.156	780.606	D	PhD	s^rt^tc	+1	3	I begin to {disfmarker} to work also in that .
Bro018.D.dialogueact334	781.43	792.62	D	PhD	s.%--	+1	3	But the first thing that I don't understand is that they are using R - the uh log energy that this quite {disfmarker}
Bro018.D.dialogueact335	793.49	800.04	D	PhD	s^no	+1	3	I don't know why they have some constant in the expression of the lower energy .
