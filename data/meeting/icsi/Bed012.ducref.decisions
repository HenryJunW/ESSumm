The suggestion that the most appropriate decision node of the belief-net in each situation could be chosen as a function of what construction was used , was deemed unsuitable at this stage.
There are many interdependencies between the output nodes that this approach could not take into account.
The rest of the values for the Bayes-net nodes will be built in within the week.
The finished prototype will be presented during the next meeting.
