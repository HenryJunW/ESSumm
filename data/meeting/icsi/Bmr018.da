Bmr018.D.dialogueact12	9.54	10.84	D	PhD	z	-1	0	What is {disfmarker} what is that ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact13	10.029	12.829	E	Grad	z	-1	0	it depends on if the temp files are there or not ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact14	12.829	14.849	E	Grad	z	-1	0	that {disfmarker} at least that 's my current working hypothesis ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact15	14.03	14.76	D	PhD	z	-1	0	Ah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact16	15.371	19.521	E	Grad	z	-1	0	that I think what happens is it tries to clear the temp files and if they 're too big , it crashes .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact17	19.53	20.0	D	PhD	z	-1	0	Ah .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact18	20.2	23.75	B	PhD	z	-1	0	When the power went out the other day and I restarted it , it crashed the first time .

Bmr018.E.dialogueact31	33.238	35.448	E	Grad	z	-1	0	but they 're not actually in the temp directory they 're in the scratch ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact32	35.758	35.968	E	Grad	z	-1	0	so .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact33	36.596	39.976	E	Grad	z	-1	0	They 're not backed up , but they 're not erased either on power failure .

Bmr018.E.dialogueact155	227.91	228.13	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Great .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact156	229.14	229.34	E	Grad	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact157	230.29	232.31	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	So , uh , oh , though Thi - Thilo isn't here ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact158	232.31	233.26	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	um , but , uh ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact159	234.68	236.83	E	Grad	s.x	+1	1	I {disfmarker} I have the program to insert the beeps .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact160	236.83	243.36	E	Grad	s	+1	0	What I don't have is something to parse the output of the channelized transcripts to find out where to put the beeps ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact161	243.36	244.64	E	Grad	s	+1	0	but that should be really easy to do .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact162	245.58	247.48	E	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	So do we have a meeting that that 's been done with ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact164	248.86	249.39	A	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	He 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact163	248.69	252.54	E	Grad	s^e^rt	-1	0	that we 've tightened it up to the point where we can actually give it to IBM and have them try it out ?
Bmr018.A.dialogueact165	252.77	257.55	A	Postdoc	s^na	+1	2	He generated , um , a channel - wise presegmented version of a meeting ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact166	257.82	263.7	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but it was Robustness rather than EDU so I guess depends on whether we 're willing to use Robustness ?
Bmr018.B.dialogueact168	262.77	265.86	B	PhD	s	-1	0	Well for this experiment I think we can use pre pretty much anything .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact167	262.61	263.02	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact169	266.118	266.428	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact170	266.6	267.71	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	This experiment of just {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact171	266.869	270.982	E	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	Well we had {disfmarker} we had talked about doing maybe EDU as a good choice , though .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact172	271.042	272.195	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , {vocalsound} whatever we have .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact173	271.57	274.48	B	PhD	s	-1	0	Well we 've talked about that as being the next ones we wanted to transcribe .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact174	274.765	275.085	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact176	275.4	275.64	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact175	275.126	278.356	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	But for the purpose of sending him a sample one to {disfmarker} f
Bmr018.E.dialogueact177	277.466	278.456	E	Grad	s^am	-1	0	Yeah , maybe it doesn't matter .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact178	278.34	278.67	A	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	Great .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact179	278.416	279.266	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I don't think it matte
Bmr018.A.dialogueact180	278.94	281.92	A	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll , um , get {disfmarker} make that available .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact181	281.999	283.589	E	Grad	s^bk|qy^rt	-1	0	OK , and has it been corrected ?
Bmr018.A.dialogueact182	284.35	285.19	A	Postdoc	h|s^co	-1	0	Oh , well , wait .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact183	285.19	285.56	A	Postdoc	h	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact184	285.233	285.683	E	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Hand - checked ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact185	285.683	289.27	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Cuz that was one of the {vocalsound} processes we were talking about as well .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact186	288.51	291.07	B	PhD	fh|s^co	+1	0	Right , so we need to run Thilo 's thing on it ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact187	289.72	290.38	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	That 's right .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact188	291.07	292.83	B	PhD	s	+1	2	and then we go in and adjust the boundaries .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact189	292.385	293.075	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah that 's right .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact190	293.255	294.105	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Yeah , we haven't done that .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact192	294.315	296.425	A	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I could set someone on that tomorrow .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact193	294.318	294.588	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact191	294.29	295.78	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	And time how long it takes .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact194	296.827	297.037	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact196	297.372	297.782	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	I think they 're coming {disfmarker}
Bmr018.B.dialogueact195	297.037	302.407	B	PhD	s	-1	0	And we probably don't have to do necessarily a whole meeting for that if we just wanna send them a sample to try .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact197	300.615	300.885	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact198	302.67	304.5	A	Postdoc	qw	-1	0	What would be a good number of minutes ?
Bmr018.B.dialogueact199	306.37	306.58	B	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I don't know ,
Bmr018.B.dialogueact200	306.58	310.2	B	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	maybe we can figure out how long it 'll take @ @ to {disfmarker} to do .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact201	308.97	309.49	E	Grad	fg	-1	0	Um ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact202	310.59	310.82	E	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I don't know ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact203	310.82	313.878	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	it seems to me w we probably should go ahead and do a whole meeting
Bmr018.E.dialogueact204	313.878	316.678	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because we 'll have to transcribe the whole meeting anyway sometime .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact205	320.13	320.63	C	Professor	s^arp	-1	0	Yes
Bmr018.C.dialogueact206	320.63	330.079	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	except that if they had {disfmarker} if there was a choice between having fifteen minutes that was fully the way you wanted it , and having a whole meeting that didn't get at what you wanted for them {disfmarker}
Bmr018.C.dialogueact207	331.06	332.09	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	It 's just dependent of how much {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact208	331.088	333.198	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Like I {disfmarker} I mean I guess if we have to do it again anyway ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact209	333.368	333.868	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	but , uh
Bmr018.C.dialogueact210	334.75	335.0	C	Professor	s^am	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact211	335.61	338.28	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I guess , the only thing I 'm not sure about is , um ,
Bmr018.B.dialogueact212	338.93	342.58	B	PhD	qw	+1	1	how quickly can the transcribers scan over and fix the boundaries ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact213	341.951	342.291	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact214	343.2	343.61	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr018.B.dialogueact215	345.24	346.71	B	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	I mean , is it pretty easy ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact216	346.23	348.08	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	I think it 's gonna be one or two times real time at {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact217	348.518	350.808	E	Grad	s^fe|s^bsc	+1	0	Wow , excuse me , two or more times real time ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact218	350.808	350.938	E	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact219	350.938	352.378	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Cuz they have to at least listen to it .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact220	353.35	361.35	C	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Can we pipeline it so that say there 's , uh , the transcriber gets done with a quarter of the meeting and then we {disfmarker} you run it through this other {disfmarker} other stuff ?
Bmr018.C.dialogueact222	362.016	362.546	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact221	361.971	363.271	E	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	Well the other stuff is I B
Bmr018.E.dialogueact223	364.311	373.632	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I 'm just thinking that from a data {disfmarker} keeping - track - of - the - data point of view , it may be best to send them whole meetings at a time and not try to send them bits and pieces .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact224	365.82	366.56	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	OK , so .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact225	373.76	374.2	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Oh , that 's right .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact226	374.2	375.81	C	Professor	s^bu	+1	1	So the first thing is the automatic thing ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact228	376.225	379.305	C	Professor	s^e	+1	2	and then it 's {disfmarker} then it 's {disfmarker} then it 's the transcribers tightening stuff up ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact227	375.76	376.05	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact230	379.439	379.759	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact229	379.305	380.525	C	Professor	s^e	+1	1	and then it 's IBM .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact231	380.721	381.161	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm , mm - hmm .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact232	380.822	381.072	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact233	381.435	384.325	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	OK , so you might as well ha run the automatic thing over the entire meeting ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact234	385.09	390.96	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and then {disfmarker} and then , uh , you would give IBM whatever was fixed .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact235	391.576	393.486	A	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	And have them fix it over the entire meeting too ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact236	391.699	391.959	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact237	394.59	396.18	C	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	Well , yeah , but start from the beginning and go to the end ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact238	396.18	396.4	C	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr018.C.dialogueact239	396.4	399.49	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So if they were only half way through then that 's what you 'd give IBM .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact240	399.798	400.048	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact241	400.414	400.644	C	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr018.B.dialogueact242	401.08	402.0	B	PhD	qw^bu^rt	-1	0	As of what point ?
Bmr018.B.dialogueact243	405.029	405.429	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	I mean .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact244	405.93	411.87	B	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	The {disfmarker} I guess the question on my mind is do we wait for the transcribers to adjust the marks for the whole meeting before we give anything to IBM ,
Bmr018.B.dialogueact245	411.87	413.45	B	PhD	qrr	-1	0	or do we go ahead and send them a sample ?
Bmr018.B.dialogueact247	414.088	414.658	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	Let their {disfmarker}
Bmr018.C.dialogueact246	413.8	414.59	C	Professor	qw.%-	-1	0	Why wouldn't we s @ @ w
Bmr018.C.dialogueact248	414.71	419.42	C	Professor	qw.%--	-1	0	i if they were going sequentially through it , why wouldn't we give them {disfmarker}
Bmr018.C.dialogueact249	419.53	422.31	C	Professor	qy	-1	0	I mean i are we trying to get something done by the time Brian comes ?
Bmr018.B.dialogueact250	422.57	423.89	B	PhD	s^no	-1	0	Well I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean , I don't know .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact251	423.514	424.774	E	Grad	s	-1	0	That was the question . Though .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact252	425.12	432.26	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So if we {disfmarker} if we were , then it seems like giving them something , whatever they had gotten up to , would be better than nothing .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact253	427.32	427.48	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact254	429.479	430.549	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Uh . That {disfmarker} I agree .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact255	430.919	431.299	B	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	I agree .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact256	431.594	432.344	E	Grad	fg|s^no.%-	-1	0	Well , I don't think {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact257	432.57	435.6	E	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	I mean , h they {disfmarker} they typically work for what , four hours , something like that ?
Bmr018.A.dialogueact258	436.0	436.87	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Hmm , I gue hmm .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact259	437.163	439.843	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I think the they should be able to get through a whole meeting in one sitting .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact260	441.061	441.611	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I would think ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact261	441.611	443.291	E	Grad	s	-1	0	unless it 's a lot harder than we think it is ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact262	443.291	444.811	E	Grad	s	-1	0	which it could be , certainly .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact263	445.617	451.144	A	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	If it 's got like for speakers then I guess {disfmarker} I mean if {disfmarker}
Bmr018.B.dialogueact265	450.96	452.66	B	PhD	s^bu	+1	0	We 're just doing the individual channels ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact264	450.57	452.35	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	Or seven or eight .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact266	452.66	452.91	B	PhD	qy^bu^d^g^rt	+1	0	right ?
Bmr018.A.dialogueact267	453.599	454.869	A	Postdoc	s^m^rt	-1	0	Individual channels .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact268	454.869	455.349	A	Postdoc	s^aa^rt	+1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact269	455.82	458.68	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So it 's gonna be , depending on the number of people in the meeting ,
Bmr018.B.dialogueact270	459.47	459.84	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact271	460.09	467.39	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	I guess there is this issue of , you know , if {disfmarker} if the segmenter thought there was no speech on {disfmarker} on a particular stretch , on a particular channel ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact272	460.64	460.85	E	Grad	fg	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bmr018.A.dialogueact273	467.39	474.873	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and there really was , then , if it didn't show up in a mixed signal to verify , then it might be overlooked ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact274	475.36	481.205	A	Postdoc	fh|qr	+1	1	so , I mean , the question is " should {disfmarker} should a transcriber listen to the entire thing or can it g can it be based on the mixed signal ? "
Bmr018.A.dialogueact275	481.325	484.755	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And I th eh so far as I 'm concerned it 's fine to base it on the mixed signal at this point ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact276	484.825	485.205	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact277	484.88	490.39	E	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's what it seems to me too , in that if they need to , just like in the other cases , they can listen to the individual , if they need to .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact278	486.33	487.4	A	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	And that cuts down the time .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact279	490.54	490.85	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact280	491.168	492.568	E	Grad	s	-1	0	But they don't have to for most of it .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact281	493.13	493.59	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Yeah , that 's good .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact282	493.76	494.18	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	So . Yeah .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact284	494.31	494.85	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Good , good , good .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact283	493.99	495.44	B	PhD	s	-1	0	I don't see how that will work , though .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact285	496.13	496.98	A	Postdoc	qw^rt	-1	0	What {disfmarker} what aspect ?
Bmr018.C.dialogueact286	496.53	498.67	C	Professor	s^bu	+1	1	So you 're talking about tightening up time boundaries ?
Bmr018.B.dialogueact287	498.44	498.7	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact289	499.18	499.65	C	Professor	qw.%-	-1	0	So how do you {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact288	499.11	504.81	E	Grad	s	+1	0	So , they have the normal channeltrans interface where they have each individual speaker has their own line ,
Bmr018.B.dialogueact290	505.185	505.445	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact291	505.512	508.122	E	Grad	s	+1	0	but you 're listening to the mixed signal and you 're tightening the boundaries ,

Bmr018.E.dialogueact330	567.68	572.086	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Because they 'd have to at least listen to each channel all the way through .

Bmr018.B.dialogueact335	574.03	576.78	B	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , you scan {disfmarker} I mean , if you have a display of the waveform .

Bmr018.E.dialogueact336	577.16	578.2	E	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	Oh , you 're talking about visually .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact339	578.23	580.65	A	Postdoc	fg|s^arp	-1	0	w Well , the other problem is the breaths

Bmr018.A.dialogueact340	580.65	582.35	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	cuz you also see the breaths on the waveform .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact341	582.35	585.7	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I 've {disfmarker} I 've looked at the int uh , s I 've tried to do that with a single channel ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact342	585.919	589.769	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and you do see all sorts of other stuff besides just the voice .

Bmr018.E.dialogueact344	590.287	594.057	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , and I {disfmarker} I think that they 're going much more on acoustics than they are on visuals .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact345	595.06	596.15	A	Postdoc	s^am	-1	0	Well that {disfmarker} that I 'm not sure .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact346	595.48	595.74	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact347	596.15	599.15	A	Postdoc	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	What you {disfmarker} the digital {disfmarker} what the digital task that you had your interface ?
Bmr018.A.dialogueact348	599.612	606.562	A	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	Um , I know for a fact that one of those {disfmarker} sh she could really well {disfmarker} she could judge what th what the number was based on the {disfmarker} on the waveform .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact349	603.502	604.482	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , that 's actually true .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact350	604.842	605.552	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , you 're right .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact351	605.672	606.512	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	You 're absolutely right .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact352	606.622	612.33	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , I found the same thing that when I was scanning through the wave form {vocalsound} I could see when someone started to read digits just by the shapes .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact353	612.35	613.92	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Yeah , she could tell which one was seven .

Bmr018.C.dialogueact359	618.16	622.05	C	Professor	fh|qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	So , they 're {disfmarker} they 're looking at a mixed signal ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact360	622.05	622.99	C	Professor	qrr^rt.%--	-1	0	or they 're looking {disfmarker}
Bmr018.C.dialogueact361	623.13	624.54	C	Professor	qw	-1	0	what {disfmarker} what are they looking at visually ?
Bmr018.A.dialogueact362	624.86	625.96	A	Postdoc	fg|s	-1	0	Well , they have a choice .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact363	625.96	627.43	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	They could choose any signal to look at .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact364	627.689	629.859	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	I 've tried lookin but usually they look at the mixed .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact365	630.154	635.895	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	But I 've {disfmarker} I 've tried looking at the single signal and {disfmarker} and in order to judge when it {disfmarker} when it was speech and when it wasn't ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact366	634.425	634.565	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact367	635.895	639.495	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but the problem is then you have breaths which {disfmarker} which show up on the signal .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact368	639.884	646.814	C	Professor	s^bu	+1	0	But the procedure that you 're imagining , I mean , people vary from this , is that they have the mixed signal wave form in front of them ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact369	641.755	642.225	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact370	643.974	644.264	F	PhD	%	-1	0

Bmr018.C.dialogueact374	655.49	658.78	C	Professor	fh|s^bu	+1	0	So {disfmarker} but there 's markers of some sort that have been happening automatically ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact376	657.48	657.93	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact375	657.06	657.38	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact377	658.78	660.68	C	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	+1	0	and those show up on the mixed signal ?
Bmr018.A.dialogueact380	661.26	661.55	A	Postdoc	s^fe	-1	0	Oh ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact378	660.79	662.38	C	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	There 's a @ @ clicks ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact379	661.037	661.807	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	N the t
Bmr018.A.dialogueact381	661.65	663.09	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	they show up on the separate ribbons .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact383	663.24	665.13	A	Postdoc	s^rt	-1	0	So you have a separate ribbon for each channel ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact384	663.372	664.332	C	Professor	s^bk^m	-1	0	There 're separate ribbons .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact382	663.2	663.45	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact385	665.619	671.949	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and {disfmarker} and i i it 'll be {disfmarker} because it 's being segmented as channel at a time with his {disfmarker} with Thilo 's new procedure ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact386	671.949	677.173	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	then you don't have the correspondence of the times across the bins {disfmarker} uh across the ribbons
Bmr018.A.dialogueact387	677.173	677.803	A	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	uh you could have {disfmarker}
Bmr018.C.dialogueact388	677.49	680.62	C	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	And is there a line moving across the waveform as it goes ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact389	679.89	680.2	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact390	680.41	680.71	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact391	681.08	683.714	C	Professor	s^bk|s^bu	+1	0	OK , so The way you 're imaging is they kind of play it ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact392	683.714	688.294	C	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	and they see oh this happened , then this happened , then {disfmarker} and if it 's about right , they just sort of let it slide ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact394	685.97	686.12	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact393	685.899	686.179	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact395	688.28	688.59	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact396	688.796	693.536	C	Professor	s^bu	+1	0	and if it {disfmarker} if it {disfmarker} there 's a question on something , they stop and maybe look at the individual wave form .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact398	694.0	695.57	A	Postdoc	s^bk|s^nd	-1	0	Oh , well not {disfmarker} not " look " .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact397	693.793	694.043	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact399	694.591	696.901	E	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	Well , they wouldn't look at it {pause} at this point .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact400	696.951	697.911	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	They would just listen .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact401	698.305	699.945	C	Professor	s	-1	0	They {disfmarker} they might look at it ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact403	700.175	700.355	C	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact402	699.819	704.629	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , the problem is that the {disfmarker} the interface doesn't really allow you to switch visuals .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact404	704.85	705.67	A	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	Not very quickly .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact405	705.034	711.121	E	Grad	s	+1	1	The problem is that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} the Tcl - TK interface with the visuals , it 's very slow to load waveforms .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact406	705.67	706.81	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	You can but it takes time .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact407	710.89	711.23	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	That 's it .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact408	711.36	712.16	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact409	712.34	715.45	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	And so when I tried {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that was the first thing I tried when I first started it ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact410	713.65	713.92	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , oh .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact411	714.56	715.09	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Visually .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact413	715.62	717.62	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	You can {disfmarker} you can switch quickly between the audio ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact412	715.45	715.75	E	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr018.A.dialogueact414	717.62	720.38	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	but you just can't get the visual display to show quickly .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact415	720.706	721.236	A	Postdoc	s^co.%--	-1	0	So you have to {disfmarker}
Bmr018.A.dialogueact416	721.236	723.416	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	It takes , I don't know , three , four minutes to {disfmarker}
Bmr018.A.dialogueact417	723.516	725.486	A	Postdoc	fh|s.%-	-1	0	Well , I mean , it takes {disfmarker} it takes long enough {disfmarker}
Bmr018.D.dialogueact418	724.72	726.98	D	PhD	fg|s^bs	-1	0	Yeah , it 's very slow to do that .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact419	726.14	727.65	A	Postdoc	s^r.%--	-1	0	It takes long enough cuz it has to reload the
Bmr018.A.dialogueact420	727.65	729.63	A	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I don't know exactly what it 's doing frankly
Bmr018.A.dialogueact421	729.63	732.88	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	cuz {disfmarker} but it t it takes long enough that it 's just not a practical alternative .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact422	731.256	731.486	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	That w
Bmr018.E.dialogueact423	733.089	737.524	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Well it {disfmarker} it does some sort of shape pre - computation so that it can then scroll it quickly ,
Bmr018.G.dialogueact424	735.64	736.76	G	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	But you can cancel that .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact426	737.71	738.15	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact425	737.524	737.774	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact427	737.834	740.254	E	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	But then you can't change the resolution or scroll quickly .
Bmr018.G.dialogueact428	739.91	740.47	G	Grad	qy^bh^d	-1	0	Oh , really ?
Bmr018.A.dialogueact431	741.6	748.4	A	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	Now you could set up multiple windows , each one with a different signal showing , and then look between the windows .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact429	741.189	741.479	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr018.G.dialogueact430	741.287	741.547	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Huh !
Bmr018.A.dialogueact432	748.4	749.66	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Maybe that 's the solution .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact433	748.971	750.901	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	I mean , we {disfmarker} we could do different interfaces ,
Bmr018.G.dialogueact434	749.451	750.671	G	Grad	qw^cs	-1	0	What if you preload them all ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact435	750.901	751.211	E	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact436	751.211	754.481	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	I mean , so {disfmarker} so we could use like X Waves instead of Transcriber ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact437	755.35	755.63	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact438	755.39	757.1	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and it loads faster , certainly .
Bmr018.G.dialogueact439	757.15	759.47	G	Grad	qr^cs	-1	0	What if you were to preload all the channels or {disfmarker} or initially {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact441	760.37	761.6	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Well that 's what I tried originally .
Bmr018.G.dialogueact440	759.96	760.53	G	Grad	%-	-1	0	like doesn't {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact442	761.6	768.6	E	Grad	s	-1	0	So I {disfmarker} I actually before , uh , Dave Gelbart did this , I did an interface which showed each waveform and ea a ribbon for each waveform ,
Bmr018.G.dialogueact443	767.81	768.44	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact444	769.099	774.079	E	Grad	s	-1	0	but the problem with it is even with just three waveforms it was just painfully slow to scroll .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact446	774.742	778.002	E	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	So you just scroll a screen and it would , you know go " kur - chunk ! "
Bmr018.G.dialogueact445	774.27	774.59	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact447	778.853	779.253	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact448	778.897	781.887	E	Grad	s	-1	0	And so it just was not doable with the current interface .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact449	782.216	784.806	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	You know , I am thinking if we have a meeting with only four speakers
Bmr018.A.dialogueact450	784.856	792.34	A	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	and , you know , you could fire up a Transcriber interface for , y you know , in different windows , multiple ones , one for each channel .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact451	792.34	796.18	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	And it 's sort of a {disfmarker} a hack but I mean it would be one way of seeing the visual form .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact452	795.969	802.812	E	Grad	s^cs	+1	1	I think that if we decide that we need {disfmarker} that they need to see the visuals , we need to change the interface so that they can do that .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact453	802.424	802.614	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact454	803.264	803.484	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact457	804.23	804.49	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr018.D.dialogueact455	804.163	810.41	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	That 's actually what I thought of , loading the chopped up waveforms , I mean , you know , that {disfmarker} that would make it faster {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact456	804.175	804.665	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	An
Bmr018.E.dialogueact459	809.001	809.441	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	But isn't {disfmarker}
Bmr018.G.dialogueact458	808.724	809.034	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact460	810.828	811.668	E	Grad	s^m^t1	-1	0	The chopped up waveforms .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact461	811.573	815.033	B	PhD	s	-1	0	The problem is if {disfmarker} if anything 's cut off , you can't expand it from the chopped up {disfmarker}
Bmr018.D.dialogueact462	811.69	812.09	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact463	811.728	812.008	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	Isn't that {disfmarker}
Bmr018.G.dialogueact464	814.27	814.58	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact465	815.94	816.99	D	PhD	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	Right , but if you
Bmr018.D.dialogueact467	817.98	818.8	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	a at some point {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact466	817.695	820.285	E	Grad	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	And wouldn't that be the same {comment} as the mixed signal ?
Bmr018.D.dialogueact468	821.39	823.93	D	PhD	s^ar|s.%-	-1	0	No , I mean the individual channels that were chopped up that {disfmarker}
Bmr018.D.dialogueact469	823.93	827.556	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	it 'd be nice to be able to go back and forth between those short segments .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact470	826.958	827.348	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact471	827.556	831.436	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Cuz you don't really nee like nine tenths of the time you 're throwing most of them out ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact472	831.436	835.096	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but what you need are tho that particular channel , or that particular location ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact473	834.512	834.752	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact474	835.096	835.216	D	PhD	%--	-1	0	and ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact476	836.193	836.463	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact475	836.11	842.127	D	PhD	fh|s^cs	-1	0	um , might be nice , cuz we save those out already , {comment} um , to be able to do that .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact477	842.177	844.727	D	PhD	s	-1	0	But it won't work for IBM of course ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact478	844.727	848.99	D	PhD	s^e^rt	-1	0	it only works here cuz they 're not saving out the individual channels .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact479	850.329	853.379	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	Well , I {disfmarker} I do think that this {disfmarker} this will be a doable procedure ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact480	851.76	852.1	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact481	853.379	854.849	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and have them starting with mixed
Bmr018.C.dialogueact482	853.65	854.09	C	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact483	854.849	862.991	A	Postdoc	fh|s	+1	0	and , um , then when they get into overlaps , just have them systematically check all the channels to be sure that there isn't something hidden from {disfmarker} from audio view .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact484	865.57	865.88	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact485	866.81	867.56	E	Grad	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah , hopefully , I mean {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact486	869.09	873.56	E	Grad	s	+1	0	The mixed signal , the overlaps are pretty audible because it is volume equalized .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact487	873.56	875.23	E	Grad	s	+1	0	So I think they should be able to hear .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact488	875.91	879.73	E	Grad	s	+1	0	The only problem is {disfmarker} is , you know , counting how many and if they 're really correct or not .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact489	880.388	881.248	E	Grad	fh|s^no	-1	0	So , I don't know .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact490	881.98	884.87	D	PhD	s	+1	1	I don't know that you can locate them very well from the mixed signal ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact491	885.327	890.556	E	Grad	s^bk|s^arp^df	-1	0	Right but {disfmarker} but once {disfmarker} once you know that they happen , you can at least listen to the close talking ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact492	886.04	888.91	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	but you would know that they were there , and then you would switch .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact493	889.38	889.53	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact494	889.53	891.09	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And then you would switch into the other {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact495	890.556	890.976	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	so .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact496	891.366	895.826	C	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	But right now , to do this limitation , the switching is going to be switching of the audio ? Is what she 's saying .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact498	895.11	895.25	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact497	895.03	895.28	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact499	896.89	897.19	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact500	896.95	897.1	E	Grad	s^aa^r	-1	0	Right ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact501	897.1	897.65	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	so {disfmarker} so
Bmr018.C.dialogueact503	897.97	900.07	C	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	so they 're using their ears to do these markings anyway .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact502	897.88	906.26	E	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	did Dave {disfmarker} Did Dave do that change where you can actually just click rather than having to go up to the menu to listen to the individual channels ?
Bmr018.A.dialogueact504	899.24	899.51	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact506	900.01	900.39	A	Postdoc	s^aa^r	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact505	899.985	900.405	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact507	904.714	904.894	A	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	Click {disfmarker}
Bmr018.A.dialogueact508	906.47	906.83	A	Postdoc	h	-1	0	Um ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact509	907.09	908.14	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I had suggested it before .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact510	908.14	909.43	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I just don't know whether he did it or not .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact511	909.67	911.63	A	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	I 'm not sure what {disfmarker} click what {disfmarker} click on the ribbon ?
Bmr018.A.dialogueact512	911.63	912.48	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , you can get that {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact513	911.686	911.906	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact514	912.48	913.01	A	Postdoc	s^fe	-1	0	oh , oh ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact515	913.09	915.61	A	Postdoc	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	get {disfmarker} you can get the , uh {disfmarker} you can get it to switch audio ?
Bmr018.A.dialogueact517	916.117	917.327	A	Postdoc	h|s^nd	-1	0	Uh , not last I tried ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact516	915.741	915.941	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact518	917.327	919.157	A	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	but , um , maybe he 's changed it again .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact519	918.153	919.183	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	We should get him to do that
Bmr018.E.dialogueact520	919.183	922.443	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because , uh , I think that would be much , much faster than going to the menu .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact521	921.148	921.778	A	Postdoc	s^ar	-1	0	I disagree .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact522	922.59	928.13	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	There 's a reason I disagree , and that is that , uh , you {disfmarker} it 's very good to have a dissociation between the visual and the audio .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact523	928.13	930.668	A	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	There 're times when I wanna hear the mixed signal ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact524	930.668	933.298	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	bu but I want to transcribe on the single channel .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact525	933.678	934.538	A	Postdoc	fh|s.%-	-1	0	So right now {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact526	933.747	937.28	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	Then maybe just buttons down at the bottom next to it .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact527	936.45	938.6	A	Postdoc	s^am|s^no.%-	-1	0	Maybe , I just don't {disfmarker} I don't see that it 's a {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact528	937.28	940.66	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Just something so that it 's not in the menu option so that you can do it much faster .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact529	941.374	945.504	A	Postdoc	h|s	-1	0	Well , I mean , that 's the i I {disfmarker} I think that might be a personal style thing .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact530	945.504	948.294	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I find it really convenient the way {disfmarker} the way it 's set up right now .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact531	948.76	954.888	E	Grad	fg|s:qy	-1	0	Well it just seems to me that if you wanna quickly {disfmarker} " well was that Jane , no , was that Chuck , no , was that Morgan " , right now , you have to go up to the menu ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact532	955.174	958.704	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and each time , go up to the menu , select it , listen to that channel then click below ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact533	958.874	961.294	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and then go back to the menu , select the next one , and then click below .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact534	959.631	959.921	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	That 's fine .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact535	961.58	962.08	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , it 's true .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact536	961.762	964.372	E	Grad	s	-1	0	So you can definitely streamline that with the i with the interface .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact537	963.4	964.28	A	Postdoc	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah , it could be faster ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact538	964.28	966.3	A	Postdoc	s^j.%--	-1	0	but , you know , I mean , th in the ideal world {disfmarker}
Bmr018.A.dialogueact540	968.288	968.478	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact539	967.906	968.026	E	Grad	qw	-1	0	What ?
Bmr018.A.dialogueact541	969.268	970.608	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	No I {disfmarker} I agree that 'd be nice .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact543	970.728	970.858	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact544	971.068	971.248	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact542	970.579	970.919	E	Grad	b	-1	0	OK .

Bmr018.E.dialogueact549	984.225	986.255	E	Grad	s^na	+1	0	I would like to try to do something on digits
Bmr018.E.dialogueact550	986.255	987.605	E	Grad	s	+1	0	but I just don't know if we have time .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact551	987.655	988.845	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , it 's due next Friday
Bmr018.E.dialogueact552	988.845	991.185	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so we have to do the experiments and write the paper .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact553	992.725	993.635	E	Grad	fh|s^cc	-1	0	So , I 'm gonna try ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact554	993.695	994.265	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	but , uh ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact555	996.314	996.934	E	Grad	s	-1	0	we 'll just have to see .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact556	996.934	1004.59	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	So actually I wanna get together with both Andreas and , uh , uh , Stephane with their respective systems .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact557	1005.97	1006.19	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact558	1007.16	1007.74	C	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah there was that {disfmarker} we
Bmr018.C.dialogueact559	1007.74	1007.99	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	that 's right ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact560	1007.99	1015.56	C	Professor	s	+1	0	we had that one conversation about , uh , what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what did it mean for , uh , one of those speakers to be pathological ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact562	1015.75	1016.2	C	Professor	qy.%-	-1	0	was it a {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact561	1015.7	1016.0	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact563	1016.09	1018.07	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and I haven't had s chance to sit down and listen .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact564	1017.48	1019.39	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Oh , I haven't {disfmarker} I haven't listened to them either ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact565	1018.07	1019.32	E	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	I was going to do that this afternoon .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact566	1019.81	1021.01	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but there must be something wrong ,
Bmr018.F.dialogueact567	1021.01	1021.42	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	I mean ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact569	1021.71	1023.85	E	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Well , Morgan and I were {disfmarker} were having a debate {comment} about that .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact568	1021.68	1022.26	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	unless our {disfmarker}

Bmr018.E.dialogueact571	1026.37	1029.01	E	Grad	s	+1	0	and actually Stephane 's results , I think confirm that .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact572	1029.01	1031.87	E	Grad	s	+1	0	He s he did the Aurora system
Bmr018.E.dialogueact573	1032.2	1037.29	E	Grad	s^rt	+1	0	also got very lousy average error , like fifteen or {disfmarker} or , uh , fifteen to twenty percent average ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact574	1037.82	1042.59	E	Grad	s^rt	+1	0	But then he ran it just on the lapel , and got about five or six percent word error ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact575	1043.31	1047.72	E	Grad	s	+1	0	So that {disfmarker} that means to me that somewhere in the other recordings there are some pathological cases .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact576	1047.72	1050.21	E	Grad	fh|s^am	-1	0	But , you know , we {disfmarker} th that may not be true .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact577	1050.21	1052.84	E	Grad	s^am	+1	0	It may be just some of the segments they 're just doing a lousy job on .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact578	1053.85	1057.89	E	Grad	s^cc	+1	0	So I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll listen to it and find out since you 'd actually split it up by segment .

Bmr018.E.dialogueact580	1058.47	1059.54	E	Grad	s	-1	0	So I can actually listen to it .

Bmr018.E.dialogueact585	1064.29	1065.2	E	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	did you just sent that to me ?

Bmr018.E.dialogueact624	1108.37	1109.25	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	so that it 's like {disfmarker}
Bmr018.G.dialogueact625	1108.38	1108.9	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact627	1109.0	1117.25	F	PhD	s	+1	0	And there was this one meeting , I forget which one it was , where like , uh , six out of the eight channels were all , like {disfmarker} had a hundred percent error .
Bmr018.G.dialogueact626	1108.9	1109.14	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact628	1116.79	1121.98	E	Grad	s	+1	0	Which probably means like there was a {disfmarker} th the recording interface crashed ,
Bmr018.G.dialogueact629	1119.88	1120.3	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact630	1121.98	1125.53	E	Grad	s	+1	0	or there was a short {disfmarker} you know , someone was jiggling with a cord
Bmr018.F.dialogueact631	1124.4	1124.56	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact632	1125.53	1128.41	E	Grad	s	+1	0	or , uh , I extracted it incorrectly ,

Bmr018.E.dialogueact634	1128.4	1129.16	E	Grad	s	-1	0	it was labeled {disfmarker}
Bmr018.G.dialogueact635	1128.47	1128.8	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact636	1129.15	1130.45	E	Grad	s	+1	0	it was transcribed incorrectly ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact637	1130.46	1132.2	E	Grad	s	-1	0	something really bad happened ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact639	1132.2	1134.26	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and I just haven't listened to it yet to find out what it was .
Bmr018.G.dialogueact638	1132.15	1132.49	G	Grad	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact640	1133.53	1146.88	F	PhD	fg|s	+1	3	So , if I excluded the pathological ones , {vocalsound} by definition , those that had like over ninety - five percent error rate , {vocalsound} and the non - natives , then the average error rate was like one point four or something ,

Bmr018.F.dialogueact644	1147.39	1153.37	F	PhD	s	+1	0	which {disfmarker} which seemed reasonable given that , you know , the models weren't tuned for {disfmarker} {vocalsound} for it .
Bmr018.G.dialogueact643	1147.08	1147.42	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm !
Bmr018.C.dialogueact646	1152.44	1152.69	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact647	1153.37	1154.68	F	PhD	s	+1	0	And the grammar wasn't tuned either .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact649	1155.08	1157.95	B	PhD	qrr^bu^d.%--	-1	0	And it didn't matter whether it was the lapel or whether it was the {disfmarker}
Bmr018.F.dialogueact648	1154.68	1155.46	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	It was just a @ @ .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact650	1158.79	1160.6	F	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	I haven't split it up that way ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact652	1160.89	1164.02	D	PhD	s	+1	0	But there 's no overlap during the digit readings , so it shouldn't really matter .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact651	1160.85	1161.49	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	but it would be {disfmarker}
Bmr018.B.dialogueact655	1163.29	1163.52	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact654	1162.84	1163.28	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.G.dialogueact653	1162.54	1162.93	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact657	1163.56	1165.2	C	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	No , but there 's a little difference ,
Bmr018.F.dialogueact656	1163.51	1164.23	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So it should {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact658	1164.55	1164.94	E	Grad	s	-1	0	There 's a lot .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact659	1165.2	1166.42	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and we haven't looked at it for digits ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact660	1165.3	1165.53	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact661	1166.42	1166.71	C	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr018.B.dialogueact663	1167.13	1168.29	B	PhD	s	-1	0	Yeah , so I was curious about that .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact662	1166.71	1167.29	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	And so ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact664	1167.81	1176.82	C	Professor	s	-1	0	cuz {disfmarker} because what he was {disfmarker} what I was saying when I looked at those things is it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} I was almost gonna call it quadrimodal because {vocalsound} {disfmarker} because there was a whole lot of cases where it was zero percent .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact665	1173.36	1173.66	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact666	1177.44	1178.87	C	Professor	s	-1	0	They just plain got it all right .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact668	1179.66	1183.18	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And then there {disfmarker} and then there was another bunch that were couple percent or something .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact667	1179.38	1179.58	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact669	1181.82	1188.05	F	PhD	s	+1	0	But if you p if you actually histogrammed it , and {disfmarker} it was a nice {disfmarker} uh , you know , it {disfmarker} it was {disfmarker} zero was the most of them ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact670	1183.93	1184.21	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact671	1185.86	1186.29	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	A normal .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact672	1186.59	1186.87	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact673	1188.05	1191.32	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but then there were {disfmarker} the others were sort of decaying from there .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact674	1191.02	1191.2	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact675	1191.71	1191.96	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact676	1191.9	1194.9	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And then there was the bump for the non - natives and then the pathological ones ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact677	1194.28	1194.58	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact679	1195.29	1195.67	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact678	1194.9	1195.15	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	so .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact680	1196.93	1199.23	E	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , cuz some of our non - natives are pretty non - native .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact681	1199.74	1199.92	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact683	1203.64	1208.94	A	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	You {disfmarker} did you have , uh , something in the report about , uh , {disfmarker} about , uh , for f uh , forced alignment ?
Bmr018.C.dialogueact682	1203.4	1203.71	C	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact684	1208.94	1211.04	A	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	Have you {disfmarker} have you started on that ?
Bmr018.F.dialogueact685	1210.39	1213.15	F	PhD	h|s	+1	1	Oh , well , yeah , so I 've been struggling with the forced alignments .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact686	1213.15	1226.03	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	Um . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So the scheme that I drew on the board last time where we tried to , um {vocalsound} allow reject models for the s speech from other speakers ,
Bmr018.F.dialogueact687	1226.68	1229.77	F	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} most of the time it doesn't work very well .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact688	1229.97	1242.8	F	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	So , {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} and the {disfmarker} I haven't done {disfmarker} I mean , the only way to check this right now was for me to actually {vocalsound} load these into X Waves and , you know , plus the alignments , and s play them and see where the {disfmarker}
Bmr018.C.dialogueact689	1232.0	1232.37	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact690	1243.43	1249.16	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And it looks {disfmarker} And so I looked at all of the utterances from you , Chuck , in that one conversation ,
Bmr018.F.dialogueact691	1249.59	1255.84	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I don't know which {disfmarker} You probably know which one I mean , it 's where you were on the lapel {vocalsound} and Morgan was sitting next to you
Bmr018.F.dialogueact692	1255.84	1257.51	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and we can hear everything Morgan says .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact693	1258.41	1259.01	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact694	1259.13	1263.85	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	But {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and some of what you {disfmarker} I mean , you also appear quite a bit in that cross - talk .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact695	1264.54	1267.9	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	So , {vocalsound} I actually went through all of those ,
Bmr018.F.dialogueact696	1268.0	1275.31	F	PhD	s	-1	0	there were I think fifty - five segments , {vocalsound} um , in {disfmarker} in X Waves , and {disfmarker} and sort of did a crude check ,
Bmr018.F.dialogueact697	1275.31	1278.86	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	and {vocalsound} more often than not , it {disfmarker} it gets it wrong .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact698	1279.02	1286.81	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So there 's either the beginning , mostly the beginning word , {vocalsound} where th you , um , you know , Chuck talks somewhere into the segment ,
Bmr018.F.dialogueact699	1287.73	1292.58	F	PhD	s:s	-1	0	but the first , um , word of what he says , often " I "
Bmr018.F.dialogueact700	1292.81	1294.1	F	PhD	s:s	-1	0	but it 's very reduced " I , "
Bmr018.F.dialogueact701	1294.47	1299.79	F	PhD	s	-1	0	that 's just aligned {vocalsound} to the beginning of someone else 's speech , uh in that segment ,
Bmr018.F.dialogueact702	1299.79	1300.71	F	PhD	s:s	-1	0	which is cross - talk .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact703	1300.71	1304.88	F	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	So , {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} I 'm still tinkering with it ,
Bmr018.F.dialogueact704	1304.88	1311.19	F	PhD	s	+1	1	but it might well be that we can't get clean alignments out of this {disfmarker} out of those , uh , {vocalsound} channels ,
Bmr018.F.dialogueact705	1311.19	1311.6	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	so .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact706	1311.86	1316.17	C	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	+1	1	Unless maybe we do this , uh , um , cancellation business .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact707	1315.07	1316.91	D	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	Right , but that 's {disfmarker} I mean , that was our plan ,
Bmr018.F.dialogueact708	1315.58	1316.44	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , right .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact709	1316.91	1321.05	D	PhD	s	+1	1	but it 's clear from Dan that this is not something you can do in a short amount of time .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact710	1321.68	1323.41	C	Professor	s|s^bk	-1	0	Oh , the short amount of time thing , right .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact711	1321.71	1322.09	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr018.D.dialogueact712	1322.53	1326.66	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so we {disfmarker} you know , we had spent a lot of time , um , writing up the HLT paper
Bmr018.D.dialogueact713	1326.66	1329.37	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and we wanted to use that , uh , kind of analysis ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact714	1328.29	1328.63	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact715	1329.37	1334.15	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but the HLT paper has , you know , it 's a very crude measure of overlap .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact716	1334.15	1337.58	D	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's not really something you could scientifically say is overlap ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact717	1337.58	1345.02	D	PhD	s	-1	0	it 's just whether or not the , um , the segments that were all synchronized , whether there was some overlap somewhere .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact718	1340.05	1341.39	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	c High correlation .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact719	1345.94	1348.01	D	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	And , you know , that pointed out some differences ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact720	1348.01	1355.04	D	PhD	s	+1	1	so he thought well if we can do something quick and dirty because Dan said the cross - cancellation , it 's not straight - forward .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact721	1355.04	1356.85	D	PhD	s	-1	0	If it were straight - forward then we would try it ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact722	1356.99	1357.24	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bmr018.D.dialogueact723	1357.59	1369.59	D	PhD	s	+1	1	so , it 's sort of good to hear that it was not straight - forward , thinking if we can get decent forced alignments , then at least we can do sort of a overall report of what happens with actual overlap in time ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact724	1369.59	1371.1	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	but , um {disfmarker}
Bmr018.B.dialogueact725	1371.19	1373.74	B	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	I didn't think that his message said it wasn't straight - forward .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact726	1371.9	1372.44	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	Well if we 'd just {disfmarker}
Bmr018.C.dialogueact727	1374.76	1375.23	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	Well
Bmr018.B.dialogueact729	1375.67	1378.09	B	PhD	s^bu	+1	0	I thought he 's just saying you have to look over a longer time window when you do it .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact728	1375.6	1375.81	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Um - hmm .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact730	1377.86	1382.25	D	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	and the {disfmarker} but there are some issues of this timing , um , in the recordings
Bmr018.C.dialogueact731	1381.12	1381.57	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact733	1382.45	1382.67	B	PhD	fg	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact732	1382.31	1382.79	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr018.B.dialogueact734	1383.03	1385.81	B	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	So you just have to look over longer time when you 're trying to align the things ,
Bmr018.B.dialogueact735	1385.81	1387.54	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	you can't {disfmarker} you can't just look {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact736	1387.61	1392.39	E	Grad	fg|qy^rt.x	-1	0	Well . are you talking about the fact that the recording software doesn't do time - synchronous ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact737	1392.39	1393.67	E	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Is that what you 're referring to ?
Bmr018.C.dialogueact738	1394.19	1394.45	C	Professor	b	-1	0	
Bmr018.E.dialogueact739	1394.29	1397.56	E	Grad	s	-1	0	That seems to me you can do that over the entire file and get a very accurate {disfmarker}
Bmr018.F.dialogueact740	1396.52	1398.76	F	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	I don't thi I d I don't think that was the issue .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact741	1398.54	1398.67	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	I {disfmarker}
Bmr018.D.dialogueact742	1398.67	1400.75	D	PhD	fg|s^rt	-1	0	yeah , that was sort of a side issue .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact744	1399.15	1400.0	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	I didn't think so either .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact743	1398.76	1404.35	F	PhD	s	+1	0	The issue was that you have {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} you have have {disfmarker} you first have to have a pretty good speech detection on the individual channels .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact745	1405.22	1411.89	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And it 's dynamic , so I guess it was more dynamic than some simple models would be able t to {disfmarker}
Bmr018.D.dialogueact746	1412.0	1413.87	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so {disfmarker} so there are some things available ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact747	1413.87	1415.36	D	PhD	s^no	-1	0	and I don't know too much about this area
Bmr018.D.dialogueact748	1415.36	1418.82	D	PhD	s	-1	0	where if people aren't moving around much than you could apply them ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact749	1418.82	1423.29	D	PhD	s	+1	0	and it should work pretty well if you took care of this recording time difference .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact750	1423.21	1424.9	E	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	Right , which should be pretty straight forward .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact751	1424.45	1427.04	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Which a at least is well defined ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact752	1427.04	1427.2	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	and
Bmr018.E.dialogueact753	1427.12	1427.26	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact754	1427.99	1433.8	D	PhD	fh|s.%--	+1	1	um , but then if you add the dynamic aspect of adapting distances , then it wasn't {disfmarker}
Bmr018.D.dialogueact755	1434.66	1440.94	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I guess it just wasn't something that he could do quickly {pause} and not {disfmarker} in time for us to be able to do something by two weeks from now ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact756	1440.94	1441.07	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	so .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact757	1441.07	1442.58	D	PhD	s^bsc	-1	0	Well less than a week .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact758	1443.09	1450.07	D	PhD	fh|s^no	+1	0	So {disfmarker} um , so I don't know what we can do if anything , that 's sort of worth , you know , a Eurospeech paper at this point .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact759	1450.49	1453.76	B	PhD	qy^rt	+1	0	Well , Andreas , how well did it work on the non - lapel stuff ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact760	1453.86	1454.87	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah . That 's what I was gonna say .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact761	1454.31	1455.29	F	PhD	s^no	+1	0	I haven't checked those yet .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact762	1454.87	1455.02	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	C
Bmr018.F.dialogueact763	1455.29	1456.75	F	PhD	s^df	+1	1	It 's very tedious to check these .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact764	1457.15	1457.4	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact765	1457.46	1466.79	F	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	Um , we would really need , ideally , a transcriber {vocalsound} to time mark the {disfmarker} you know , the be at least the beginning and s ends {comment} of contiguous speech .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact766	1467.53	1475.26	F	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	Um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} and , you know , then with the time marks , you can do an automatic comparison of your {disfmarker} of your forced alignments .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact767	1474.46	1485.91	B	PhD	s	+1	0	Because {disfmarker} really the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} at least in terms of how we were gonna use this in our system was to get an ideal {disfmarker} an idea , uh , for each channel about the start and end boundaries .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact768	1474.67	1475.6	E	Grad	s.%	-1	0	Oh , MNCM .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact769	1474.7	1475.59	E	Grad	s	-1	0	
Bmr018.F.dialogueact770	1478.55	1479.06	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact771	1485.91	1488.4	B	PhD	s	+1	0	We don't really care about like intermediate word boundaries ,
Bmr018.B.dialogueact773	1488.4	1488.6	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Bmr018.F.dialogueact772	1488.37	1489.75	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	No , that 's how I 've been looking at it .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact776	1489.93	1490.21	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact775	1489.84	1490.1	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact774	1489.75	1492.18	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	I mean , I don't care that the individual words are aligned correctly ,
Bmr018.B.dialogueact777	1491.87	1492.2	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact778	1492.18	1497.24	F	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	but {vocalsound} you don't wanna , uh , infer from the alignment that someone spoke who didn't .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact779	1497.47	1498.13	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right , exactly .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact781	1498.13	1499.17	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So that 's why I was wondering if it {disfmarker}
Bmr018.F.dialogueact780	1498.02	1498.63	F	PhD	fh.%	-1	0	so , so {disfmarker}
Bmr018.B.dialogueact782	1499.9	1503.14	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	I mean , maybe if it doesn't work for lapel stuff , we can just not use that
Bmr018.F.dialogueact783	1502.35	1502.53	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact785	1503.14	1503.32	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr018.F.dialogueact784	1503.07	1510.3	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I haven't {disfmarker} I ha just haven't had the time to , um , do the same procedure on one of the {disfmarker}
Bmr018.F.dialogueact786	1510.8	1522.03	F	PhD	s	+1	0	so I would need a k I would need a channel that has {vocalsound} a speaker whose {disfmarker} who has a lot of overlap but s you know , is a non - lapel mike .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact787	1522.75	1528.63	F	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	And , um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} where preferably , also there 's someone sitting next to them who talks a lot .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact788	1528.87	1529.17	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm !
Bmr018.F.dialogueact789	1529.45	1531.43	F	PhD	fh|%-	-1	0	So , I {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact790	1531.17	1532.24	E	Grad	s^bs	-1	0	So a meeting with me in it .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact791	1531.56	1535.98	F	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	maybe someone can help me find a good candidate and then I would be willing to
Bmr018.B.dialogueact792	1536.28	1536.79	B	PhD	qh	-1	0	We c you know what ?
Bmr018.B.dialogueact793	1536.87	1539.33	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Maybe the best way to find that would be to look through these .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact794	1537.09	1537.61	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	you know , hand
Bmr018.B.dialogueact795	1540.39	1541.88	B	PhD	s^df^rt	-1	0	Cuz you can see the seat numbers ,
Bmr018.B.dialogueact796	1542.29	1544.19	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and then you can see what type of mike they were using .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact797	1544.93	1549.46	B	PhD	s	-1	0	And so we just look for , you know , somebody sitting next to Adam at one of the meetings {disfmarker}
Bmr018.D.dialogueact798	1548.78	1551.7	D	PhD	s	+1	0	Actually y we can tell from the data that we have ,
Bmr018.F.dialogueact799	1550.71	1552.01	F	PhD	qy^2^d^rt	-1	0	From the insertions , maybe ?
Bmr018.D.dialogueact801	1552.29	1553.99	D	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um , yeah , there 's a way to tell .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact800	1552.01	1553.89	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	fr fr from the {disfmarker}
Bmr018.D.dialogueact802	1553.99	1559.17	D	PhD	s	-1	0	It might not be a single person who 's always overlapping that person but any number of people ,
Bmr018.F.dialogueact803	1558.58	1558.83	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact804	1559.75	1568.41	D	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	and , um , if you align the two hypothesis files across the channels , you know , just word alignment , you 'd be able to find that .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact805	1569.4	1571.83	D	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so I guess that 's sort of a last {disfmarker}
Bmr018.D.dialogueact806	1573.7	1575.36	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	ther there 're sort of a few things we could do .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact807	1575.36	1578.91	D	PhD	s	-1	0	One is just do like non - lapels if we can get good enough alignments .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact808	1579.34	1580.65	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Another one was to try to get {disfmarker}
Bmr018.D.dialogueact809	1581.43	1585.63	D	PhD	s	-1	0	somehow align Thilo 's energy segmentations with what we have .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact810	1585.91	1592.16	D	PhD	s	-1	0	But then you have the problem of not knowing where the words are because these meetings were done before that segmentation .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact811	1592.16	1594.61	D	PhD	s	-1	0	But maybe there 's something that could be done .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact812	1593.6	1599.82	B	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	What {disfmarker} what is {disfmarker} why do you need the , um , the forced alignment for the HLT {disfmarker} I mean for the Eurospeech paper ?
Bmr018.D.dialogueact813	1600.51	1608.19	D	PhD	h|s	-1	0	Well , I guess I {disfmarker} I wanted to just do something not on recognition experiments
Bmr018.D.dialogueact814	1608.19	1613.15	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because that 's ju way too early , but to be able to report , you know , actual numbers .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact815	1613.15	1619.56	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Like if we {disfmarker} if we had hand - transcribed pe good alignments or hand - checked alignments , then we could do this paper .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact816	1619.56	1621.33	D	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's not that we need it to be automatic .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact817	1622.18	1626.1	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	But without knowing where the real words are , in time {disfmarker}
Bmr018.B.dialogueact818	1625.33	1629.44	B	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	So it was to get {disfmarker} it was to get more data and better {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to squeeze the boundaries in .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact819	1628.22	1636.2	D	PhD	s	-1	0	To {disfmarker} to know what an overlap really {disfmarker} if it 's really an overlap , or if it 's just a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a segment correlated with an overlap ,
Bmr018.B.dialogueact820	1630.34	1631.05	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Ah , OK .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact821	1631.49	1631.81	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact822	1636.2	1641.37	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and I guess that 's the difference to me between like a real paper and a sort of , promissory paper .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact823	1642.01	1644.64	D	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	So , um , if we d
Bmr018.D.dialogueact824	1645.58	1647.81	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	it might be possible to take Thilo 's output
Bmr018.D.dialogueact825	1648.35	1654.15	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and like if you have , um , like right now these meetings are all ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact826	1651.74	1651.8	E	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	Ugh !
Bmr018.E.dialogueact827	1654.16	1655.66	E	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	I forgot the digital camera again .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact828	1655.42	1656.23	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact829	1655.87	1656.5	E	Grad	s^e^t1	-1	0	Every meeting !
Bmr018.D.dialogueact830	1657.15	1658.31	D	PhD	s	-1	0	you know , they 're time - aligned ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact831	1658.31	1664.73	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so if these are two different channels and somebody 's talking here and somebody else is talking here , just that word ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact833	1665.28	1670.18	D	PhD	s	+1	0	if Thilo can tell us that there 're boundaries here , we should be able to figure that out
Bmr018.E.dialogueact832	1664.87	1665.38	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact834	1670.18	1673.16	D	PhD	s^df	+1	0	because the only thing transcribed in this channel is this word .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact835	1674.21	1677.05	D	PhD	fh|s.%--	+1	0	But , um , you know , if there are things {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact836	1677.3	1677.81	E	Grad	s^2	+1	0	Two words .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact837	1678.08	1681.48	D	PhD	s^aa|s	+1	0	Yeah , if you have two and they 're at the edges , it 's like here and here ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact838	1681.74	1684.04	D	PhD	s	+1	0	and there 's speech here , then it doesn't really help you ,

Bmr018.A.dialogueact844	1698.45	1699.42	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Well it 's a merging problem .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact847	1699.42	1701.82	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	If you had a {disfmarker} if you had a s if you had a script which would {disfmarker}
Bmr018.D.dialogueact846	1699.37	1700.12	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	yeah it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr018.A.dialogueact848	1701.82	1702.7	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I 've thought about this ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact850	1703.2	1705.54	A	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	um , and I 've discussed {disfmarker} I 've discussed it with Thilo ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact849	1703.07	1704.18	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , if you have any ideas .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact851	1705.15	1705.34	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	I would {disfmarker}
Bmr018.A.dialogueact852	1706.24	1713.48	A	Postdoc	fh|s^cs	-1	0	um , the , I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} in principle I could imagine writing a script which would approximate it to some degree ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact853	1713.48	1715.66	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but there is this problem of slippage ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact854	1714.07	1718.02	E	Grad	fg|s^am^rt	-1	0	Well maybe {disfmarker} Maybe that will get enough of the cases to be useful .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact855	1715.71	1715.92	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact856	1717.3	1717.74	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact857	1718.06	1719.74	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , that {disfmarker} that would be really helpful .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact858	1719.74	1721.88	D	PhD	s	-1	0	That was sort of another possibility .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact859	1720.22	1725.28	E	Grad	s	-1	0	You know s cuz it seemed like most of the cases are in fact the single word sorts ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact860	1725.28	1726.8	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	or at least a single phrase
Bmr018.A.dialogueact862	1727.31	1728.51	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Well they {disfmarker} they can be stretched .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact863	1727.67	1728.79	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	in most of the bins .
Bmr018.F.dialogueact861	1727.27	1728.23	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact864	1728.51	1729.86	A	Postdoc	s^ng	-1	0	I wouldn't make that generalization
Bmr018.A.dialogueact866	1729.86	1733.44	A	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	cuz sometimes people will say , " And then I " and there 's a long pause
Bmr018.D.dialogueact865	1729.5	1730.03	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact867	1733.87	1734.96	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and finish the sentence
Bmr018.A.dialogueact868	1734.96	1737.97	A	Postdoc	s.%--	+1	0	and {disfmarker} and sometimes it looks coherent and {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker}
Bmr018.A.dialogueact869	1737.97	1739.51	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's not a simple problem .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact870	1740.38	1741.29	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	But it 's really {disfmarker}
Bmr018.A.dialogueact871	1741.37	1747.93	A	Postdoc	s^rt	+1	0	And then it 's coupled with the problem that sometimes , you know , with {disfmarker} with a fricative you might get the beginning of the word cut off
Bmr018.A.dialogueact872	1747.93	1750.99	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and so it 's coupled with the problem that Thilo 's isn't perfect either .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact873	1750.99	1756.84	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , we 've i th it 's like you have a merging problem plus {disfmarker} so merging plus this problem of , uh , not {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact874	1751.14	1751.49	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact875	1754.83	1755.07	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm !
Bmr018.A.dialogueact876	1757.26	1762.32	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	y i i if the speech - nonspeech were perfect to begin with , the detector , that would already be an improvement ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact877	1762.32	1764.6	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but that 's impossible , you know , i that 's too much to ask .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact878	1762.76	1763.1	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact879	1763.34	1763.72	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact880	1764.98	1767.4	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And so i and may you know , I mean , it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr018.A.dialogueact881	1768.14	1770.3	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I think that there always {disfmarker} th there would have to be some hand - tweaking ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact882	1770.3	1773.85	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	but it 's possible that a script could be written to merge those two types of things .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact883	1773.85	1775.65	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	I 've {disfmarker} I 've discussed it with Thilo and I mean {disfmarker}
Bmr018.A.dialogueact884	1776.42	1777.59	A	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	in terms of not him doing it ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact885	1777.59	1779.55	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but we {disfmarker} we discussed some of the parameters of that
Bmr018.A.dialogueact886	1779.55	1782.83	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and how hard it would be to {disfmarker} in principle {disfmarker} to write something that would do that .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact887	1785.77	1791.76	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , I guess in the future it won't be as much as an issue if transcribers are using the tightened boundaries to start with ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact888	1791.75	1795.62	D	PhD	s	-1	0	then we have a good idea of where the forced alignment is constrained to .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact889	1795.52	1803.24	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Well , it 's just , you know , a matter of we had the revolution {disfmarker} we had the revolution of improved , uh , interface , um , one month too late ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact891	1796.31	1798.04	D	PhD	s^no.%-	-1	0	So I 'm no I don't know if this
Bmr018.E.dialogueact890	1795.89	1795.92	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact892	1800.47	1800.94	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Tools .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact893	1803.52	1805.78	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but it 's like , you know , it 's wonderful to have the revolution ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact894	1803.96	1804.93	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	Oh it 's {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker}
Bmr018.A.dialogueact895	1805.84	1811.06	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	so it 's just a matter of {disfmarker} of , you know , from now on we 'll be able to have things channelized to begin with .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact896	1805.87	1806.46	D	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact897	1811.1	1811.29	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact898	1811.29	1813.01	E	Grad	s	+1	0	And we 'll just have to see how hard that is .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact899	1813.8	1814.05	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact900	1814.15	1814.55	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	that 's right .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact901	1814.38	1817.02	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so whether the corrections take too much time .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact902	1815.07	1815.5	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	That 's right .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact903	1817.02	1823.63	E	Grad	s	+1	0	I was just thinking about the fact that if Thilo 's missed these short segments , that might be quite time - consuming for them to insert them .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact904	1818.05	1818.33	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact905	1823.8	1824.2	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Good point .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact906	1824.35	1831.15	D	PhD	s	-1	0	But he {disfmarker} he also can adjust this minimum time duration constraint and then what you get is noises mostly ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact907	1824.85	1825.03	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact908	1829.41	1830.1	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Spurious .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact909	1831.15	1832.49	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	but that might be OK ,

Bmr018.E.dialogueact910	1832.72	1836.66	E	Grad	s	-1	0	It might be easier to delete something that 's wrong than to insert something that 's missing .

Bmr018.C.dialogueact921	1841.9	1843.06	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that you 're not gonna miss something ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact919	1841.43	1841.49	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact920	1841.49	1845.11	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Cuz then {disfmarker} then you just delete it , and you don't have to pick a time .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact922	1843.31	1843.44	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact923	1843.38	1844.03	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I think it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr018.A.dialogueact924	1845.18	1848.84	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	Well the problem is I {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a really good question ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact925	1848.84	1851.0	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and I really find it a pain in the neck to delete things
Bmr018.A.dialogueact926	1851.0	1854.18	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because you have to get the mouse up there on the t on the text line
Bmr018.A.dialogueact927	1854.18	1856.78	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and i and otherwise you just use an arrow to get down {disfmarker}
Bmr018.A.dialogueact928	1856.93	1858.4	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , i it depends on how lar
Bmr018.A.dialogueact929	1858.58	1864.57	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	th there 's so many extra things that would make it one of them harder than the other , or {disfmarker} or vice versa .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact930	1864.57	1866.02	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It 's not a simple question .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact931	1866.02	1870.86	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But , you know , I mean , in principle , like , you know , if one of them is easier then to bias it towards whichever one 's easier .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact932	1870.59	1873.6	E	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , I guess the semantics aren't clear when you delete a segment ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact933	1873.76	1874.02	E	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact934	1874.02	1877.03	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Because you would say {disfmarker} You would have to determine what the surroundings were .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact935	1877.0	1880.68	D	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	You could just say it 's a noise , though , and write , you know , a post - processor will just {disfmarker}
Bmr018.D.dialogueact936	1881.47	1882.34	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	all you have to do is just {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact937	1881.8	1882.77	E	Grad	s	-1	0	If it 's really a noise .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact938	1882.94	1886.31	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	or just say it 's {disfmarker} just put " X , " you know , like " not speech " or something ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact940	1887.03	1889.56	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I think it 's easier to add than delete , frankly ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact939	1886.91	1888.07	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and then you can get {disfmarker}
Bmr018.D.dialogueact941	1888.96	1889.63	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah , or
Bmr018.A.dialogueact942	1889.87	1893.77	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because you have to , uh , maneuver around on the {disfmarker} on both windows then .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact943	1895.02	1895.97	E	Grad	qr^d	-1	0	To add or to delete ?
Bmr018.A.dialogueact944	1896.12	1896.48	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	To delete .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact946	1898.98	1900.45	D	PhD	fg|%-	-1	0	Anyways , so I {disfmarker} I guess {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact945	1898.52	1898.86	E	Grad	s^bk^rt	-1	0	OK .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact947	1900.39	1904.16	E	Grad	s^am	-1	0	That {disfmarker} Maybe that 's an interface issue that might be addressable .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact949	1904.18	1904.61	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It 's possible .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact948	1904.16	1907.23	E	Grad	s	-1	0	But I think it 's the semantics that are {disfmarker} that are questionable to me ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact950	1907.23	1908.66	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	that you delete something {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact951	1908.97	1912.94	E	Grad	s	-1	0	So let 's say someone is talking to here , and then you have a little segment here .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact952	1913.49	1914.68	E	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Well , is that part of the speech ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact953	1914.68	1916.44	E	Grad	qy	-1	0	Is it part of the nonspeech ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact954	1917.45	1918.71	E	Grad	qw	-1	0	I mean , w what do you embed it in ?
Bmr018.D.dialogueact955	1920.35	1931.02	D	PhD	s	-1	0	There 's something nice , though , about keeping , and this is probably another discussion , keeping the stuff that Thilo 's detector detected as possible speech and just marking it as not speech than deleting it .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact956	1931.42	1936.36	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Because then when you align it , then the alignment can {disfmarker} you can put a reject model or whatever ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact957	1931.49	1931.88	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , I see .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact958	1931.88	1933.18	E	Grad	s^cs.%-	-1	0	So then they could just like put {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact959	1933.18	1935.01	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Oh that 's what you meant by just put an " X " there .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact960	1936.36	1939.32	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	and you 're consistent with th the automatic system ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact961	1936.89	1937.97	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Uh , that 's an interesting idea .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact962	1939.32	1940.41	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	whereas if you delete it {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact963	1939.45	1942.62	E	Grad	s^bs	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so all they {disfmarker} So that all they would have to do is put like an " X " there .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact964	1942.34	1946.34	D	PhD	s^aa|s.%-	-1	0	Yeah , or some , you know , dummy reject mod
Bmr018.E.dialogueact965	1943.77	1946.42	E	Grad	s	-1	0	So blank for {disfmarker} blank for silence , " S "

Bmr018.D.dialogueact968	1948.21	1948.71	D	PhD	s^2	-1	0	whatever ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact969	1948.84	1949.04	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact970	1949.56	1951.2	D	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That 's actually a better way to do it
Bmr018.D.dialogueact971	1951.2	1954.94	D	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	cuz the a the forced alignment will probably be more consistent than {disfmarker}
Bmr018.A.dialogueact972	1954.71	1959.52	A	Postdoc	fg|s.%--	-1	0	Well , like , I think there 's a complication which is that {disfmarker} that you can have speech and noise in s

Bmr018.E.dialogueact1249	2468.03	2469.48	E	Grad	s	-1	0	That {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that tilts ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1251	2469.48	2469.78	E	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1252	2471.17	2472.35	E	Grad	s	-1	0	In lots and lots of different ways .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1253	2472.91	2477.01	D	PhD	s^j^rt	-1	0	So I 'm not saying anything about bias towards small headsize ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1254	2474.82	2475.47	E	Grad	qy^2^d^rt	-1	0	About heads ?
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1255	2477.01	2479.38	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	but does seem , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1256	2477.98	2478.9	B	PhD	s	-1	0	It would be an advantage .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1257	2478.99	2482.83	A	Postdoc	fg|s	-1	0	Well , wonder if it 's {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if he was wearing it over his hair instead of under his hair .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1258	2481.2	2485.74	C	Professor	s^cs^j.%--	-1	0	Well , we should {disfmarker} We shou we should work on compressing the heads , and {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1259	2482.8	2483.83	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	I think probably it was {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1260	2485.3	2485.38	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1261	2486.33	2488.54	E	Grad	s	-1	0	It probably just wasn't tight enough to the back of his head .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1262	2488.8	2494.0	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	I mean , so the directions do talk about bending it to your size , which is not really what we want .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1263	2490.0	2492.54	B	PhD	s^j	-1	0	The other thing that would do it would be to hang a five pound weight off the back .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1264	2492.94	2493.1	C	Professor	s^aa^j	-1	0	Yeah
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1265	2493.2	2493.36	D	PhD	s^aa^j	-1	0	Right .

Bmr018.E.dialogueact1274	2498.84	2503.12	E	Grad	s	-1	0	We {disfmarker} at Boeing I used {disfmarker} I was doing augmented reality so they had head - mounts on ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1276	2503.12	2505.9	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and we {disfmarker} we had a little jury - rigged one with a welder 's helmet ,

Bmr018.E.dialogueact1278	2506.11	2511.09	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and we had just a bag with a bunch of marbles in it {vocalsound} as a counter - balance .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1279	2510.15	2513.54	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Or maybe this could be helpful just for evening the conversation between people .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1280	2513.54	2516.56	C	Professor	s^cs^j	-1	0	If people {disfmarker} those who talk a lot have to wear heavier weights or something ,

Bmr018.C.dialogueact1285	2521.63	2524.87	C	Professor	fg|qw	-1	0	um , so , uh , what was I gonna say ?
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1286	2525.11	2530.29	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Oh , yeah , I was gonna say , uh , I had these , uh , conversations with NIST folks also while I was there
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1288	2530.29	2544.87	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and , uh , um , so they {disfmarker} they have their {disfmarker} their plan for a room , uh , with , um , mikes in the middle of the table , and , uh , close - mounted mikes ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1287	2529.84	2530.08	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1289	2544.87	2548.17	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and they 're talking about close - mounted and lapels , just cuz
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1290	2548.0	2548.78	D	PhD	s^2	-1	0	And arrays ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1292	2549.05	2549.81	C	Professor	s^aa^m	-1	0	sort of {disfmarker} and the array .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1291	2549.04	2549.64	E	Grad	s^aa^m	-1	0	And arrays ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1293	2549.81	2550.36	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	Yeah , so they were {disfmarker}
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1295	2549.95	2551.23	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	which is the i interesting {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1294	2549.85	2550.13	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yep .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1296	2550.62	2551.47	E	Grad	s	-1	0	And cameras .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1298	2551.84	2556.76	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And yeah , like multiple {disfmarker} multiple video cameras coverin covering every {disfmarker} everybody {disfmarker} every place in the room ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1297	2551.81	2552.68	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and video , right .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1299	2557.6	2564.51	C	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	uh , the {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the mikes in the middle , the head - mounted mikes , the lapel mikes , the array , uh , with {disfmarker}
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1300	2565.04	2566.69	C	Professor	s	-1	0	well , there 's some discussion of fifty - nine ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1301	2565.49	2566.44	E	Grad	s^bc	-1	0	Fifty - nine elements .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1302	2567.05	2568.47	C	Professor	s	-1	0	they might go down to fifty - seven
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1303	2569.43	2576.42	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Because , uh , there is , uh , some pressure from a couple people at the meeting for them to use a KEMAR head .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1305	2577.71	2579.63	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I forget what KEMAR , uh , stands for ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1304	2577.57	2577.9	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1306	2579.63	2582.35	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but what it is is it 's dummy head that is very specially designed ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1307	2581.22	2581.77	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , that 's right .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1310	2582.35	2588.27	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , so what they 're actually doing is they 're really {disfmarker} there 's really two recording systems .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1309	2582.05	2582.23	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1308	2581.98	2582.19	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1311	2582.87	2583.78	D	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That 's a great idea .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1312	2588.38	2592.86	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So they may not be precisely synchronous , but the but there 's two {disfmarker} two recording systems ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1313	2592.86	2595.89	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	one with , I think , twenty - four channels , and one with sixty - four channels .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1314	2595.89	2598.36	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	And the sixty - four channel one is for the array ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1315	2598.81	2600.63	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but they 've got some empty channels there ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1316	2600.63	2607.56	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and anyway they {disfmarker} like they 're saying they may give up a couple or something if {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for the KEMAR head if they go {disfmarker} go with that .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1317	2603.8	2604.03	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1318	2607.36	2608.09	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Yeah , it is a good idea .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1320	2609.23	2609.47	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1319	2608.97	2617.99	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , h uh , J Jonathan Fiscus did say that , uh , they have lots of software for doing calibration for skew and offset between channels
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1321	2617.37	2617.8	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1322	2617.99	2619.86	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and that they 've found that 's just not a big deal .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1323	2620.3	2620.47	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1324	2621.51	2621.75	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1325	2622.59	2624.24	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah , I 'm not {pause} too worried about that .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1326	2624.24	2624.68	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I was thinking {disfmarker}
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1327	2625.13	2628.5	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	But they 're still planning to do like fake {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1328	2628.94	2629.86	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Scenario - based .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1329	2629.79	2631.43	D	PhD	s	-1	0	they have to do something like that ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1330	2631.03	2631.25	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Y right .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1332	2631.57	2631.68	D	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1331	2631.25	2634.58	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Their {disfmarker} their legal issues won't allow them to do otherwise .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1333	2635.83	2636.38	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1334	2636.0	2638.24	E	Grad	s	-1	0	But it sounded like they were {pause} pretty well thought out
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1335	2638.13	2639.38	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , th that 's true .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1336	2638.24	2639.95	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and they 're {disfmarker} they 're gonna be real meetings ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1338	2640.02	2640.41	A	Postdoc	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1337	2639.95	2644.07	E	Grad	s	-1	0	it 's just that they 're with str with people who would not be meeting otherwise .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1340	2644.19	2646.82	B	PhD	qr	-1	0	Did {disfmarker} did they give a talk on this or was this informal ?
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1339	2643.83	2644.2	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1341	2644.81	2645.03	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .

Bmr018.C.dialogueact1345	2646.9	2651.21	C	Professor	s	-1	0	No , we just had some discussions , various discussions with them .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1344	2646.54	2647.39	E	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's just informal .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1346	2648.28	2648.57	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1347	2648.65	2648.86	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1348	2649.59	2649.79	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1349	2650.28	2653.8	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , I also sat and chatted with several of the NIST folks .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1350	2653.8	2654.91	E	Grad	s	-1	0	They seemed like a good group .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1351	2655.29	2659.03	B	PhD	qw	-1	0	What was the , um {disfmarker} the paper by , um , Lori Lamel that you mentioned ?
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1352	2659.9	2667.13	C	Professor	h|s	-1	0	Um , yeah , we sh we should just have you {disfmarker} have you read it , but , I mea ba i i uh , we 've all got these little proceedings ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1353	2660.45	2661.08	A	Postdoc	h	-1	0	Mmm , yeah .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1354	2667.13	2680.08	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	but , um , basically , it was about , um , uh , going to a new task where you have insufficient data and using {disfmarker} using data from something else , and adapting , and how well that works .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1355	2680.85	2687.31	C	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Uh , so in {disfmarker} in fact it was pretty related to what Liz and Andreas did , uh , except that this was not with meeting stuff , it was with
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1356	2684.39	2684.64	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1357	2688.16	2691.24	C	Professor	fh|qy^rt	-1	0	uh , like I think they s didn't they start off with Broadcast News system ?
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1359	2691.24	2691.9	C	Professor	s^rt.%-	-1	0	And then they went to {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1358	2690.88	2693.03	E	Grad	s^na	-1	0	The - their Broadcast News was their acoustic models
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1360	2693.03	2695.11	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and then all the other tasks were much simpler .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1361	2695.92	2696.26	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1362	2696.17	2699.23	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	So they were command and control and that sort of thing .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1363	2699.08	2703.83	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	TI - digits was one of them , and , uh , Wall Street Journal .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1364	2700.27	2700.48	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1365	2703.08	2706.06	B	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	What was their rough {disfmarker} what was their conclusion ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1366	2704.23	2705.13	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	Yeah , read Wall Street Journal .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1367	2706.5	2706.98	E	Grad	s	-1	0	It works .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1368	2707.19	2707.41	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1369	2709.16	2710.5	D	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Well , it 's {disfmarker} it 's a good paper , I mean {disfmarker}

Bmr018.E.dialogueact1374	2713.22	2715.6	E	Grad	s	-1	0	That {disfmarker} It not only works , in some cases it was better ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1375	2715.6	2716.73	E	Grad	s	-1	0	which I thought was pretty interesting ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1376	2716.73	2718.45	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	but that 's cuz they didn't control for parameters .

Bmr018.E.dialogueact1386	2733.11	2738.99	E	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , well , one of the big problems with that is {disfmarker} is often the simpler task isn't fully {disfmarker} doesn't have all the phones in it ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1388	2739.83	2740.1	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1387	2739.49	2740.85	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and that {disfmarker} that makes it very hard .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1389	2741.69	2742.01	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1390	2742.02	2742.48	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1391	2742.17	2743.03	E	Grad	s	-1	0	But I 've done the same thing .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1392	2743.03	2745.21	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I 've been using Broadcast News nets for digits ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1393	2745.47	2745.72	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1394	2745.74	2747.81	E	Grad	s^f^rt	-1	0	like for the spr speech proxy thing that I did ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1395	2747.81	2748.41	E	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's what I did .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1396	2748.63	2748.87	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1397	2749.14	2749.51	C	Professor	b	-1	0	sure .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1398	2749.78	2750.82	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	So . It works .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1399	2751.66	2751.97	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1400	2752.93	2758.24	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , and they have {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} they have better adaptation than we had than that {disfmarker} that system ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1401	2757.4	2757.6	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1402	2758.24	2758.55	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	so they {disfmarker}
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1403	2759.76	2760.2	C	Professor	h	-1	0	um ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1404	2760.43	2761.42	E	Grad	s^bc	-1	0	You mean they have some .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1405	2762.48	2763.65	C	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	yeah , we should probably what would {disfmarker}
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1406	2763.84	2767.27	C	Professor	s	-1	0	actually what we should do , uh , I haven't said anything about this ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1407	2767.27	2775.57	C	Professor	s^cs^e	-1	0	but probably the five of us should pick out a paper or two that {disfmarker} that , uh , you know , got our interest ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1408	2775.57	2782.66	C	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	and we should go around the room at one of the Tuesday lunch meetings and say , you know , what {disfmarker} what was good about the conference ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1409	2777.38	2777.69	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Present .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1410	2779.4	2779.57	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1411	2781.54	2782.27	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Do a trip report .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1412	2782.66	2782.96	C	Professor	s^aa^rt	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1413	2784.41	2786.48	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , the summarization stuff was interesting ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1414	2786.48	2788.12	D	PhD	s^bd^no	-1	0	I mean , I don't know anything about that field ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1415	2788.12	2791.29	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but for this proposal on meeting summarization ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1416	2792.07	2793.54	D	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um , I mean , it 's sort of a far cry
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1417	2793.54	2796.45	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because they weren't working with meeting type data ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1418	2796.45	2799.52	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but he got sort of an overview on some of the different approaches ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1419	2796.61	2796.8	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1420	2800.09	2802.29	B	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Do you remember who the groups were that we 're doing ?
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1421	2800.78	2801.37	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	so .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1422	2801.99	2802.45	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Well there 're {disfmarker}
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1424	2802.66	2804.4	D	PhD	s	-1	0	this was the last day ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1423	2802.2	2803.3	E	Grad	s	-1	0	A lot of different ones .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1425	2803.81	2804.36	A	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	R I think {disfmarker}
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1427	2804.61	2804.85	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1426	2804.4	2810.11	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but , I mean , there 's {disfmarker} that 's a huge field and probably the groups there may not be representative of the field ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1428	2810.11	2814.45	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I don't know exactly that everyone submits to this particular conference ,
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1429	2813.13	2815.5	B	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Was {disfmarker} were there folks from BBN presenting ?
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1430	2814.45	2814.67	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	but
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1431	2815.45	2821.96	D	PhD	s	-1	0	yet there was , let 's see , this was on the last day , Mitre , BBN , and , um , Prager {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1432	2817.83	2820.13	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Mitre , BBN , IBM .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1433	2821.06	2821.82	E	Grad	h	-1	0	Uh ,

Bmr018.C.dialogueact1436	2825.38	2826.34	C	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	Columbia have anything ?
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1437	2826.54	2826.7	C	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1438	2826.89	2827.39	D	PhD	s^ar.%--	-1	0	no it was {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1439	2826.99	2829.28	E	Grad	qw	-1	0	Wasn't {disfmarker} Who {disfmarker} who {disfmarker} who did the order one ?
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1440	2827.49	2828.93	D	PhD	s	-1	0	this was Wednesday morning .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1441	2829.75	2833.02	D	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	The sentence ordering one , was that Barselou , and these guys ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1442	2833.16	2834.48	E	Grad	h|s	-1	0	Ugh ! {comment} I 'm just so bad at that .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1443	2833.79	2834.12	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1444	2833.97	2835.62	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Anyway , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} it 's in the program ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1445	2835.62	2838.52	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I should have read it to remind myself ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1446	2838.52	2840.13	D	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	but that 's sort of useful
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1447	2840.13	2849.05	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	and I think like when Mari and Katrin and Jeff are here it 'd be good to figure out some kinds of things that we can start doing maybe just on the transcripts
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1448	2849.05	2849.91	D	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	cuz we already have {disfmarker}
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1450	2850.35	2850.98	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1449	2850.33	2851.53	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Yeah , we do have word transcripts .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1451	2850.87	2851.2	D	PhD	b	-1	0	you know ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1453	2851.58	2851.96	D	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1452	2851.53	2851.86	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1454	2852.36	2859.58	A	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	Well , I like the idea that Adam had of {disfmarker} of , um , z maybe generating minutes based on some of these things that we have
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1455	2859.58	2861.82	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	because it would be easy to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to do that
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1456	2861.96	2862.83	A	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	just , you know ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1458	2862.9	2863.42	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1457	2862.51	2863.18	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1459	2863.5	2867.35	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it has to be , though , someone from this group because of the technical nature of the thing .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1460	2867.7	2869.59	E	Grad	s^j	-1	0	Someone who actually does take notes ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1461	2869.59	2871.97	E	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	um , {vocalsound} I 'm very bad at note - taking .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1462	2870.77	2878.5	D	PhD	s	-1	0	But I think what 's interesting is there 's all these different evaluations , like {disfmarker} just , you know , how do you evaluate whether the summary is good or not ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1463	2872.94	2874.38	E	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	I always write down the wrong things .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1464	2876.62	2877.25	A	Postdoc	s^t3	-1	0	I do take notes .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1465	2878.5	2881.84	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and that 's what 's {disfmarker} was sort of interesting to me is that there 's different ways to do it ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1466	2879.37	2879.93	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	A judge .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1467	2881.84	2882.0	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1469	2882.4	2885.82	B	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Was SRA one of the groups talking about summarization , no ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1468	2882.06	2882.24	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1470	2884.73	2885.06	D	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	Hm - umm .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1471	2885.69	2885.91	D	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1472	2886.78	2887.87	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	It was an interesting session .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1474	2888.26	2889.09	A	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	One of those w
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1473	2888.14	2893.63	E	Grad	s	-1	0	And as I said , I like the Microsoft talk on {pause} scaling issues in , uh , word sense disambiguation ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1475	2888.72	2889.1	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1476	2893.63	2894.32	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	that was interesting .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1477	2896.05	2897.85	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Yeah , that was an interesting discussion ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1478	2896.1	2896.29	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	The {disfmarker}
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1479	2898.11	2899.59	C	Professor	fh|%-	-1	0	uh , I
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1480	2899.74	2905.56	E	Grad	s	-1	0	It {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it was the only one {disfmarker} It was the only one that had any sort of real disagreement about .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1481	2900.32	2902.17	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	The data issue comes up all the ti
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1483	2906.23	2908.24	C	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	Well , I didn't have as much disagreement as I would have liked ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1482	2905.83	2906.42	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1484	2908.24	2913.87	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	but I didn't wanna {disfmarker} I wouldn I didn't wanna get into it because , uh , you know , it was the application was one I didn't know anything about ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1485	2913.28	2913.51	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1486	2913.87	2916.97	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh , it just would have been , you know , me getting up to be argumentative ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1487	2916.97	2918.47	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but , uh ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1488	2918.47	2919.39	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , the missing thi
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1489	2919.39	2923.66	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	so {disfmarker} so what they were saying {disfmarker} it 's one of these things {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} you know , all you need is more data , sort of {disfmarker}
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1490	2924.11	2927.56	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But I mea i wh it {disfmarker} @ @ that 's {disfmarker} that 's dissing it , uh , improperly ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1491	2927.56	2928.76	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , it was a nice study .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1492	2928.84	2932.09	C	Professor	fh|s.%-	-1	0	Uh , they were doing this {disfmarker} it wasn't word - sense disambiguation , it was {disfmarker}
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1493	2931.57	2932.97	D	PhD	s^ar.%--	-1	0	Yeah {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1494	2931.63	2932.55	E	Grad	fg|s^ng	-1	0	Well , it sort of was .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1495	2932.44	2933.49	C	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	was it w was it word - sense ?
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1497	2933.49	2933.71	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1496	2933.32	2937.89	E	Grad	s	-1	0	But it was {disfmarker} it was a very simple case of " to " versus " too " versus " two " and " there " , " their " , " they 're " {disfmarker}
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1498	2936.13	2937.47	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	And there and their and {disfmarker}
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1499	2936.87	2937.1	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1500	2937.59	2937.93	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	OK .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1501	2937.7	2942.57	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and that you could do better with more data , I mean , that 's clearly statistically {disfmarker}
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1502	2940.16	2940.62	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1503	2940.3	2940.55	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1504	2941.33	2946.47	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	And so , what they did was they had these different kinds of learning machines , and they had different amounts of data ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1505	2946.71	2953.3	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and so they did like , you know , eight different methods that everybody , you know , uh , argues about {disfmarker} about , " Oh my {disfmarker} my kind of learning machine is better than your kind of learning machine . "
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1506	2954.04	2957.67	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	And , uh , they were {disfmarker} started off with a million words that they used ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1507	2957.67	2961.61	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	which was evidently a number that a lot of people doing that particular kind of task had been using .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1508	2961.99	2963.94	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So they went up , being Microsoft , they went up to a billion .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1509	2965.01	2966.89	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And then they had this log scale showing a {disfmarker}
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1510	2967.46	2969.9	C	Professor	fh|s.%-	-1	0	you know , and {disfmarker} and naturally everything gets {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1511	2969.12	2971.17	E	Grad	s^j	-1	0	Them being beep , {comment} they went off to a billion .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1512	2972.61	2972.93	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	they {disfmarker}
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1513	2973.19	2973.92	C	Professor	s	-1	0	well , it 's a big company ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1514	2974.19	2976.04	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I didn't {disfmarker} I didn't mean it as a ne anything negative ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1515	2974.21	2974.47	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1516	2976.19	2977.2	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	but i i i
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1517	2976.34	2978.88	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	You mean the bigger the company the more words they use for training ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1518	2977.01	2984.49	E	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Well , I think the reason they can do that , is that they assumed that text that they get off the web , like from Wall Street Journal , is correct , and edit it .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1520	2985.21	2985.46	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1519	2985.1	2986.47	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	So that 's what they used as training data .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1521	2986.55	2988.79	E	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's just saying if it 's in this corpus it 's correct .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1522	2988.81	2989.03	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1523	2989.28	2990.26	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But , I mean , yes .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1524	2990.26	2996.07	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Of course there was the kind of effect that , you know , one would expect that {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} that you got better and better performance with more and more data .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1525	2997.14	3003.43	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um , but the {disfmarker} the real point was that the {disfmarker} the different learning machines are sort of all over the place ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1526	3003.43	3009.91	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and by {disfmarker} by going up significantly in data you can have much bigger effect then by switching learning machines
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1527	3009.91	3014.36	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and furthermore which learning machine was on top kind of depended on where you were in this picture ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1528	3014.36	3014.7	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so ,
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1529	3015.16	3017.67	B	PhD	s	-1	0	This was my concern about the recognizer in Aurora .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1530	3015.17	3015.59	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1531	3020.26	3020.68	C	Professor	qw^d.%--	-1	0	That {disfmarker}
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1532	3021.08	3024.16	B	PhD	s^m.%-	-1	0	That the differences we 're seeing in the front - end is b
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1533	3023.31	3023.59	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1534	3023.7	3024.44	E	Grad	s^2^rt	-1	0	Are irrelevant .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1535	3024.48	3025.27	B	PhD	s^aa^m	-1	0	are irrelevant
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1536	3025.27	3027.79	B	PhD	s	-1	0	once you get a real recognizer at the back - end .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1537	3025.47	3026.13	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1538	3025.87	3026.9	D	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	If you add more data ?
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1539	3027.31	3027.36	D	PhD	qrr.%-	-1	0	Or {disfmarker}
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1541	3028.49	3028.8	B	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	You know ?
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1540	3028.0	3028.27	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1542	3028.51	3028.72	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Huh .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1543	3029.07	3029.26	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1544	3029.62	3030.22	C	Professor	s^am	-1	0	could well be .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1545	3030.9	3034.4	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so , I mean , that was {disfmarker} that was kind of , you know , it 's a good point ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1546	3035.28	3044.14	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but the problem I had with it was that the implications out of this was that , uh , the kind of choices you make about learning machines were therefore irrelevant
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1547	3044.66	3050.26	C	Professor	s	-1	0	which is not at {disfmarker} n t as for as I know in {disfmarker} in tasks I 'm more familiar with @ @ is not at all true .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1548	3050.76	3054.1	C	Professor	s	-1	0	What i what is {disfmarker} is true is that different learning machines have different properties ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1549	3054.99	3056.99	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and you wanna know what those properties are .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1550	3056.99	3061.43	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And someone else sort of implied that well we s you know , a all the study of learning machine we still don't know what those properties are .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1551	3061.75	3068.18	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	We don't know them perfectly , but we know that some kinds use more memory and {disfmarker} and some other kinds use more computation
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1552	3068.18	3073.81	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	and some are {disfmarker} are hav have limited kind of discrimination , but are just easy to use , and others are {disfmarker}
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1553	3073.61	3077.82	B	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	But doesn't their conclusion just sort of {disfmarker} you could have guessed that before they even started ?
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1554	3077.82	3082.46	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Because if you assume that these learning things get better and better and better ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1555	3079.96	3080.86	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	You would guess {disfmarker}
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1556	3083.71	3086.69	B	PhD	s	-1	0	then as you approach {disfmarker} there 's a point where you can't get any better ,
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1557	3086.69	3086.83	B	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1558	3086.83	3087.67	B	PhD	s	-1	0	You get everything right .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1559	3087.18	3087.37	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1560	3087.49	3088.66	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	It 's just no {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1561	3087.51	3087.72	E	Grad	fg.%	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1563	3088.1	3089.04	B	PhD	s	-1	0	So they 're all approaching .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1562	3087.72	3089.23	E	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	No , but there was still a spread .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1564	3089.37	3090.06	E	Grad	s^nd.%--	-1	0	They weren't all up
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1565	3090.06	3090.96	E	Grad	s^bc^nd	-1	0	They weren't converging .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1568	3091.11	3095.29	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	But what I 'm saying is that th they have to , as they all get better , they have to get closer together .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1567	3091.05	3091.5	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	It w
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1566	3090.96	3092.18	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	They were all still spread .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1569	3093.89	3094.19	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	But they {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1570	3094.45	3094.81	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right , right .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1571	3094.81	3095.04	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Sure .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1572	3095.04	3097.32	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	But they hadn't even come close to that point .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1573	3097.32	3099.62	E	Grad	s	-1	0	All the tasks were still improving when they hit a billion .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1574	3099.97	3100.42	C	Professor	s^am	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1575	3100.76	3102.01	B	PhD	s	-1	0	But they 're all going the same way ,
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1576	3102.01	3102.28	B	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1577	3102.28	3103.64	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	So you have to get closer .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1578	3102.43	3103.12	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Eventually .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1579	3103.62	3104.19	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	O one would
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1580	3103.99	3105.02	E	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	But they didn't get closer .
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1581	3105.54	3106.0	B	PhD	s^bk^m	-1	0	Oh they didn't ?
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1583	3106.35	3106.88	C	Professor	h	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1582	3105.88	3106.82	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	They just switched position .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1584	3107.64	3108.38	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	well that 's getting cl
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1585	3108.38	3108.74	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	I mean ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1586	3109.93	3112.19	C	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	yeah , the spread was still pretty wide that 's th that 's true ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1587	3111.5	3111.65	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1588	3112.19	3117.68	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but , uh , I think it would be irntu intu intuition that this would be the case ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1589	3117.76	3120.72	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but , uh , to really see it and to have the intuition is quite different ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1590	3120.72	3129.92	C	Professor	fh|s^rt	-1	0	I mean , I think somebody w w let 's see who was talking about earlier that the effect of having a lot more data is quite different in Switchboard than it is in {disfmarker} in Broadcast News ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1591	3128.0	3129.96	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	Well it 's different for different tasks .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1592	3128.64	3128.73	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1593	3128.73	3129.33	E	Grad	s.%	-1	0	It was Liz .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1594	3129.33	3129.57	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1595	3130.09	3130.35	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1596	3130.09	3135.61	D	PhD	s	-1	0	So it depends a lot on whether , you know , it {disfmarker} disambiguation is exactly the case where more data is better ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1597	3135.61	3135.78	D	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1598	3135.78	3138.94	D	PhD	s	-1	0	You 're {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} you can assume similar distributions ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1599	3136.35	3136.66	C	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1600	3138.94	3146.21	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but if you wanted to do disambiguation on a different type of , uh , test data then your training data , then that extra data wouldn't generalize ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1601	3142.67	3142.89	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1602	3146.21	3146.64	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	so .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1603	3147.14	3147.38	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1604	3147.15	3149.49	E	Grad	s	-1	0	But , I think one of their p They {disfmarker} they had a couple points .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1605	3149.55	3154.29	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	w {comment} Uh , I think one of them was that " Well , maybe simpler algorithms and more data are {disfmarker} is better " .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1606	3154.41	3155.12	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Less memory ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1607	3155.29	3156.15	E	Grad	s	-1	0	faster operation ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1608	3156.15	3156.61	E	Grad	s	-1	0	simpler .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1609	3158.03	3158.2	E	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1610	3158.2	3161.55	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Because their simplest , most brain - dead algorithm did pretty darn well
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1611	3161.87	3162.37	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1612	3162.12	3163.49	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	when you got {disfmarker} gave it a lot more data .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1613	3163.49	3167.78	E	Grad	s	-1	0	And then also they were saying , " Well , m You have access to a lot more data .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1614	3167.78	3169.43	E	Grad	qw	-1	0	Why are you sticking with a million words ? "
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1615	3169.43	3174.86	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , their point was that this million - word corpus that everyone uses is apparently ten or fifteen years old .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1616	3175.85	3177.06	E	Grad	s	-1	0	And everyone is still using it ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1617	3177.55	3177.85	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	so .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1618	3178.53	3178.75	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1619	3179.95	3193.68	C	Professor	s^tc.x	-1	0	But anyway , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's just the {disfmarker} the i it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's not really the conclusion they came to so much , as the conclusion that some of the , uh , uh , commenters in the crowd {vocalsound} came up with
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1620	3181.79	3182.99	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	But we could talk about this stuff ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1621	3182.99	3184.0	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I think this would be fun to do .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1622	3185.71	3189.15	E	Grad	b^rt	-1	0	
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1623	3192.3	3192.6	E	Grad	b.x	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1624	3193.68	3198.87	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that , uh , you know , this therefore is further evidence that , you know , more data is really all you should care about ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1625	3198.97	3202.89	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and that I thought was just kind of going too far the other way ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1626	3201.79	3202.57	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Machine - learning .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1627	3202.89	3204.48	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} the , uh ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1628	3205.32	3209.36	C	Professor	s	-1	0	one {disfmarker} one person ga g g got up and made a {disfmarker} a brief defense ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1629	3209.36	3210.96	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh , but it was a different kind of grounds ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1630	3210.96	3221.11	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it was that {disfmarker} that , uh , i w the reason people were not using so much data before was not because they were stupid or didn't realize data was important , but in fact th they didn't have it available .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1631	3221.84	3227.22	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um , but the other point to make a again is that , uh , machine learning still does matter ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1632	3227.96	3231.27	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	but it {disfmarker} it matters more in some situations than in others ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1633	3231.27	3237.29	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and it {disfmarker} and also there 's {disfmarker} there 's not just mattering or not mattering , but there 's mattering in different ways .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1634	3237.29	3242.29	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , you might be in some situation where you care how much memory you 're using ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1636	3243.07	3244.98	C	Professor	s	-1	0	or you care , you know , what recall time is ,

Bmr018.C.dialogueact1657	3260.88	3266.77	C	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	so {disfmarker} so these , I mean th the {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} in the speech side , the thing that @ @ always occurs to me is that if you {disfmarker}
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1658	3267.34	3268.26	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	if you {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker}
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1659	3268.33	3274.7	C	Professor	s	-1	0	one person has a system that requires ten thousand hours to train on , and the other only requires a hundred ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1660	3275.25	3278.67	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and they both do about the same because the hundred hour one was smarter ,
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1661	3279.3	3281.1	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	that 's {disfmarker} that 's gonna be better .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1663	3281.62	3285.19	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because people , I mean , there isn't gonna be just one system that people train on
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1662	3281.23	3281.42	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1664	3285.19	3287.04	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and then that 's it for the r for all of time .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1665	3287.04	3292.43	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , people are gonna be doing other different things , and so it {disfmarker} these {disfmarker} these things matters {disfmarker} matter .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1666	3293.05	3293.66	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , that 's it .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1668	3293.66	3295.04	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , so that 's one of the slides they put up .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1667	3293.66	3295.55	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So , I mean , this was a very provocative slide .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1669	3295.55	3299.74	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	She put this up , and it was like this is {disfmarker} this p people kept saying , " Can I see that slide again ? "

Bmr018.D.dialogueact1671	3299.58	3299.82	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1673	3300.13	3307.75	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and then they 'd make a comment , and one person said , well - known person said , um , you know , " Before you dismiss forty - five years including my work {disfmarker} "
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1672	3300.05	3300.33	D	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1674	3305.68	3307.1	E	Grad	s^2^m	-1	0	Forty - five years of research .

Bmr018.D.dialogueact1677	3308.92	3311.94	D	PhD	s	-1	0	But th you know , the same thing has happened in computational linguistics ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1678	3312.06	3312.28	D	PhD	qy^d^f^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1679	3312.28	3316.99	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	You look at the ACL papers coming out , and now there 's sort of a turn back towards , OK we 've learned statistic {disfmarker}
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1680	3316.99	3320.85	D	PhD	s	-1	0	you know , we 're basically getting what we expect out of some statistical methods ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1681	3320.85	3321.05	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	and ,
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1682	3321.19	3323.76	D	PhD	s	-1	0	you know , the there 's arguments on both sides ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1683	3323.45	3323.66	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1685	3324.12	3324.45	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1684	3324.03	3327.49	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I think the matters is the thing that {disfmarker} that was misleading .
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1686	3326.51	3327.61	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	That was very offending ,
Bmr018.A.dialogueact1688	3327.69	3328.36	A	Postdoc	s^r	-1	0	very offending .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1687	3327.67	3329.28	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1689	3327.81	3330.52	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Is that {disfmarker} all {disfmarker} all of them are based on all the others ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1690	3330.52	3330.7	E	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1691	3330.7	3331.84	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	Just , you {disfmarker} you can't say {disfmarker}
Bmr018.B.dialogueact1693	3331.2	3333.27	B	PhD	s^cs:s	-1	0	Maybe they should have said " focus " or something .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1692	3330.75	3330.97	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1694	3333.51	3333.82	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1695	3333.94	3334.48	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	I mean , so . {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1696	3334.74	3336.73	E	Grad	s	-1	0	And I 'm saying the same thing happened with speech recognition ,
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1697	3336.73	3336.88	E	Grad	qh	-1	0	right ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1698	3336.88	3339.33	E	Grad	s	-1	0	For a long time people were hand - c coding linguistic rules
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1699	3339.33	3341.72	E	Grad	s^e^rt	-1	0	and then they discovered machine - learning worked better .
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1700	3342.2	3349.28	E	Grad	s	-1	0	And now they 're throwing more and more data and worrying {disfmarker} perhaps worrying less and less about , uh , the exact details of the algorithms .
Bmr018.D.dialogueact1701	3344.43	3345.57	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and then you hit this {disfmarker}
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1702	3350.12	3351.72	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Except when they have a Eurospeech paper .

Bmr018.E.dialogueact1707	3354.8	3355.8	E	Grad	qy^cs^rt^t	-1	0	Shall we read some digits ?
Bmr018.E.dialogueact1709	3357.15	3359.88	E	Grad	qr	-1	0	Are we gonna do one at a time ? Or should we read them all agai at once again .
Bmr018.C.dialogueact1710	3360.17	3360.95	C	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	Let 's do it all at once .
