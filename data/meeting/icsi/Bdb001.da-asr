Bdb001.C.dialogueact0	0.216	5.914	C	Grad	z	-1	0	yeah we had a long discussion about how much how easy we want to make it for people to believe things out so 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1	5.914	6.254	C	Grad	z	-1	0	things out so 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact2	8.339	9.499	C	Grad	z	-1	0	morgan wants to make it hard 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact3	13.38	14.41	D	PhD	z	-1	0	it it doesn't 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact4	16.433	17.023	C	Grad	z	-1	0	did did did i didn't even check yesterday 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact5	17.133	19.073	C	Grad	z	-1	0	i didn't even check yesterday weather was moving it didn't move yesterday either when i started it 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact6	18.067	19.977	D	PhD	z	-1	0	weather was moving it didn't move yesterday either when i started it 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact7	20.3	20.57	C	Grad	z	-1	0	i don't know it 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact8	20.56	21.89	D	PhD	z	-1	0	three i don't know it doesn't like both 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact9	21.436	21.946	C	Grad	z	-1	0	three doesn't like both 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact10	22.685	23.215	C	Grad	z	-1	0	channel three 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact11	25.97	29.0	D	PhD	z	-1	0	channel too you know i discovered something yesterday on these um where this one's you can 
Bdb001.B.dialogueact12	28.413	29.393	B	Grad	z	-1	0	channel too where this one's you can 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact13	28.939	29.429	C	Grad	z	-1	0	channel too where this one's you can 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact14	29.868	32.988	D	PhD	z	-1	0	too it you can tell if it's picking up breast noise and stuff 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact15	32.893	33.013	C	Grad	z	-1	0	it has a little indicator noise and stuff 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact16	33.013	35.213	C	Grad	z	-1	0	has a little indicator on it on the ass huh 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact17	33.997	34.437	D	PhD	z	-1	0	has a little indicator on it on the ass huh 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact18	36.739	37.319	D	PhD	z	-1	0	so if you 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact19	38.329	44.639	D	PhD	z	-1	0	yeah if you breathe under breathing in the caf boston you know picking up your mouth right well that's 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact20	44.814	45.384	F	PhD	z	-1	0	your mouth right well that's good because we 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact21	45.694	47.144	F	PhD	z	-1	0	yep test good because we have a lot of breath 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact22	46.568	46.818	C	Grad	z	-1	0	yep test have a lot of breath 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact23	46.818	47.218	C	Grad	z	-1	0	yep test have a lot of breath 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact24	48.76	51.89	F	PhD	z	-1	0	in fact if you listen to to just the channels of people not talking to 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact25	55.774	56.874	F	PhD	z	-1	0	what did 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact26	56.629	56.869	C	Grad	z	-1	0	what did 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact27	56.869	58.889	C	Grad	z	-1	0	what did you see a cannibal recent years something it's 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact28	56.874	57.114	F	PhD	z	-1	0	what did you see a cannibal recent 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact29	58.318	59.278	F	PhD	z	-1	0	years something it's very disconcerting 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact30	59.338	60.208	F	PhD	z	-1	0	very disconcerting okay 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact31	60.208	60.668	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	okay 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact32	61.228	62.188	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	so um i was going 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact33	62.011	62.586	C	Grad	%	-1	0	i was going 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact34	62.628	65.918	F	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	i was going to try to get out of here like in half an hour um 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact35	65.988	66.428	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	half an hour um because i 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact36	66.498	68.88	F	PhD	s	-1	0	because i really appreciate people coming and 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact37	68.88	89.054	F	PhD	s	+1	1	people coming and the main thing that i was going to ask people to help with today is two give input on what kinds of database format we should use and starting to link up things like word transcription indications of we're transcript so anything that 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact38	89.054	100.288	F	PhD	s^e	+1	0	so anything that transcribers or discourse toters whatever put in the say no with tire marks for like words and phone boundaries and all the stuff we get out of the forced alignment and the recognize or 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact39	101.209	103.819	F	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	so we have this um 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact40	104.331	110.301	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i think a starting point is clearly that the generalized output of dave cal arts program which don brought 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact41	110.301	111.791	F	PhD	s^e^rt	-1	0	which don brought a copy of 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact42	111.016	111.196	C	Grad	b	-1	0	a copy of 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact43	112.119	113.159	C	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	yeah i'm i'm familiar with i mean we i sort um which 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact44	113.159	118.67	C	Grad	s	+1	2	i mean we i sort of already have developed an x. m. l. format for this sort of stuff and so the um which 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact45	113.219	113.699	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	i mean we i sort um which 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact46	113.829	114.139	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	i mean we i sort of already have developed um which 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact47	114.568	114.928	D	PhD	qy^rt^t3	-1	0	of already have developed 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact48	118.75	123.316	C	Grad	s	-1	0	of stuff and so the only question is that the sort of thing that you want to use or not have you looked 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact49	123.677	124.477	C	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	not have you looked at that mean i had a web 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact50	124.477	125.657	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	at that mean i had a web page up right 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact51	125.724	126.084	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	page up right so 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact52	126.084	126.514	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact54	127.894	128.074	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	i actually mostly need to 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact53	127.512	131.082	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i actually mostly need to be able to link up or it's 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact55	131.082	134.512	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	i guess i am going to be standing up it's it's a question both of what the representation isn't 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact56	131.673	132.063	C	Grad	qy^d^rt^t3	-1	0	it's it's a question both of 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact57	133.759	135.789	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i guess i am going to be standing up and drawing on the floor what the representation isn't okay yeah so 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact58	135.176	135.436	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and drawing on the floor okay yeah so 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact59	135.436	135.716	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and drawing on the floor okay yeah so 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact60	135.716	136.846	F	PhD	s^na	-1	0	and drawing on the floor i'm okay yeah so you should definitely 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact61	136.983	139.473	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i'm so so it definitely had that as a concept so that it you should definitely 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact62	139.473	141.353	C	Grad	s	+1	2	so that it has a single timeline and 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact63	141.329	141.789	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact64	141.955	144.605	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and then you can have lots of different sections each of which 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact65	144.605	146.195	C	Grad	s	-1	0	sections each of which have ideas attached to it and then you can refer 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact66	146.195	148.885	C	Grad	s	-1	0	to it and then you can refer from other sections to those i. d.'s 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact67	149.277	149.987	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	if you want to 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact68	150.801	151.341	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so that um 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact69	151.341	151.801	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact70	152.9	155.08	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	so that you start with with the timeline tag 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact71	157.74	158.32	C	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact72	159.518	160.938	C	Grad	s	+1	1	and then you have a bunch of times 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact73	161.658	164.278	C	Grad	s^no	-1	0	oh i remember seeing i don't i don't remember exactly what my notation was but right 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact74	164.014	165.974	A	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	i remember seeing a sample of yeah but right right 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact75	164.278	164.578	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	i remember seeing but right 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact76	164.737	165.217	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i remember seeing a sample of yeah but right right 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact77	165.437	165.847	F	PhD	s^bk^r	-1	0	a sample of yeah right 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact78	165.974	166.184	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	a sample of yeah yeah see equals right 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact79	166.357	166.627	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah see equals 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact80	166.627	170.611	C	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	yeah see equals one point three two uh 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact81	170.611	171.121	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	two uh and then i i also had 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact82	171.121	173.991	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and then i i also had optional things like accuracy 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact83	174.579	179.699	C	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	and then id close to you one though and then 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact84	179.759	187.122	C	Grad	s	+1	1	and then i also wanted to to be to be able to not specify specifically what the time was and just have a stamp 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact85	186.094	186.454	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and just have a stamp 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact86	189.909	192.219	C	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah so these are arbitrary assigned by program not not by 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact87	192.359	193.299	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	not not by users they have a whole bunch 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact88	193.299	194.499	C	Grad	s	-1	0	users they have a whole bunch of those and 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact89	194.923	198.473	C	Grad	s	+1	1	of those and then somewhere like further down you might have something like an not a tag 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact90	199.481	203.78	C	Grad	s^e	+1	0	which has start equal t. seventeen 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact91	204.38	206.1	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and equals t. eighteen so what that saying 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact92	206.33	208.98	C	Grad	s:s	+1	0	so what that saying is we know it starts at this particular time we 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact93	208.98	210.37	C	Grad	s:s^no	-1	0	at this particular time we don't know when to dance 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact94	210.93	211.41	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	right 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact95	211.498	211.888	C	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact96	212.138	214.098	C	Grad	s	-1	0	but it and that this t. eighteen which maybe somewhere 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact97	214.098	215.408	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	which maybe somewhere else we say there's 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact98	215.408	217.068	C	Grad	s	-1	0	else we say there's another outer ends 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact99	218.284	220.134	C	Grad	s	-1	0	we don't know what the time actually is but we know that it's the same 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact100	220.134	222.714	C	Grad	s	-1	0	but we know that it's the same time as the same time 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact101	225.315	225.605	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact102	226.157	227.027	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	yeah whatever you want 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact103	227.027	227.767	C	Grad	s	-1	0	you want 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact104	228.508	230.338	A	PhD	s^bu	+1	0	so yes especially defining a lot of 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact105	228.936	229.176	C	Grad	b	-1	0	so yes especially defining a lot 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact106	231.21	231.41	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yes exactly 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact107	231.41	231.9	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yes exactly 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact108	232.164	232.484	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact109	233.606	236.446	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and then uh and then these also have ideas 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact110	240.331	240.691	C	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right so 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact111	240.961	258.509	C	Grad	s^cs	+1	0	right so you could you could have some sort of other other tag later in the file that would be something like um oh i don't know uh no ways type equals door slam yeah oh 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact112	258.509	259.229	C	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	slam yeah oh 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact113	260.887	267.479	C	Grad	s^cs	+1	0	and then uh you could either say time e. equals a particular time mark or you could do other sorts of references or 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact114	267.83	269.44	C	Grad	s	-1	0	or or you might have a process d. 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact115	270.561	271.481	C	Grad	s	-1	0	d. right 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact116	271.641	272.011	C	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	d. right d. t.

Bdb001.C.dialogueact118	272.921	273.211	C	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	d. t. it's a oh 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact119	273.48	275.01	F	PhD	s^df^nd	-1	0	it's a oh instead of and i have it the d. is good 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact120	275.01	276.04	F	PhD	s^aap	-1	0	she'd like to it the d. is good 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact121	276.594	277.424	C	Grad	qy^d^j^rt	-1	0	she'd like to be if i could be yeah 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact123	277.424	277.954	C	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	be if i could be yeah 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact122	277.314	277.614	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	be if i could be yeah 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact124	278.426	278.886	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	um 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact125	279.345	281.225	C	Grad	s	-1	0	you know so you could have some sort of type here 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact126	282.223	283.083	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and then you could have um 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact127	283.083	283.723	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact128	284.393	288.213	C	Grad	s	-1	0	beyond her instead it's referring to could be used seventeen or something like that 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact129	289.499	289.989	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact130	289.989	290.489	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	okay so i mean 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact131	290.489	299.33	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	so i mean that seems that seems great for all of uh in coding of things with time and 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact132	299.33	299.77	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	and 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact133	300.224	300.494	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact134	300.75	301.08	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	i 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact135	301.997	307.777	F	PhD	qw	-1	0	i i guess my question is more uh what what do you do with say a forced alignment he's 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact136	305.329	305.999	A	PhD	%	-1	0	uh what what do you do 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact137	307.777	309.717	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	alignment he's got all these phone labels and what 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact138	309.717	322.056	F	PhD	qw	+1	0	labels and what do you do if you just conception lee if you get um transcription where the words are staying but the time boundaries are changing because you've got a new recognition out porters sort of what's 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact139	322.056	337.256	F	PhD	qw	+1	0	that's actually very nicely sort of what's the sequence of going from way forms that stay the same the transcripts that may or may not change and and uh audience which are this time boundaries that may or may not change 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact140	334.621	335.011	A	PhD	s^bk.%-	-1	0	which are this time boundaries 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact141	337.036	338.646	A	PhD	s	+1	0	that's actually very nicely handle it because 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact143	338.646	348.199	A	PhD	s^df	+1	0	handle it because you could you could all you'd have to change is the um times stance in the timeline without without changing the idea right that's so that's why and you'd be able to propagate all of uh information

Bdb001.F.dialogueact280	549.043	549.273	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	used them i don't but 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact281	549.752	551.412	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	used them i don't know what they're structures i forgot for but but 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact282	549.976	550.476	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	used them i don't know what they're structures but 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact283	551.412	552.382	A	PhD	s^no.%-	-1	0	i forgot for this but have peace i'll for 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact284	551.908	552.398	D	PhD	s^co	-1	0	i forgot for this but have peace i'll for 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact285	552.398	557.118	D	PhD	s^bu	+1	0	this whatever you want have peace i'll for each frame is storing uh victor of kept stroller appeal l. they'll use right 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact287	557.22	558.75	C	Grad	s^ng	+1	0	whatever you want actually so that right right 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact286	557.118	557.508	D	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	whatever you want right 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact288	558.122	558.532	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	actually so that right 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact289	558.75	561.36	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	actually so that what's nice about the file it it right 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact290	562.185	567.815	C	Grad	s	+1	0	built into it is the concept of frames utter and so senses that sort of thing that structure 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact291	568.317	572.927	C	Grad	s	+1	0	and then also attached to it is an arbitrary factor of values 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact293	573.611	575.301	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and they can take different types so it they don't 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact292	573.388	573.748	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and they can 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact294	575.301	577.241	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so it they don't all have to be floats you know you can have into jersey 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact295	577.241	579.861	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	you know you can have into jersey you can have doubles and all that sort of stuff so that that sounds 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact296	578.604	581.624	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	you can have doubles and all that sort of stuff um right so that that sounds that sounds about 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact297	580.745	581.095	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um right that sounds about 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact298	581.901	582.081	C	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right and have a header it has 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact299	582.081	587.051	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and have a header it has a header format that describes it to some extent so the 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact300	587.051	587.311	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	so the 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact301	587.991	594.911	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so the only problem with it is actually storing thee under its numbers andi frame numbers in the file 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact302	595.332	596.802	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	even though their voice sequential 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact303	597.152	598.892	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and so it does waste a lot of space 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact304	599.781	599.981	A	PhD	b	-1	0	but it's 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact305	599.787	601.937	C	Grad	s	-1	0	but it's still a lot tighter than the nasty and 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact306	601.937	604.067	C	Grad	s	+1	2	than the nasty and we have a lot of tools already to deal with it you do okay is 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact307	603.795	604.195	F	PhD	qy^d	-1	0	already to deal with it you do okay is 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact308	604.195	604.715	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay is 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact309	605.005	607.205	F	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	yeah there's a ton of it man there some documentation on this summer okay great 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact310	606.69	606.87	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah there's on this summer 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact311	606.87	607.55	C	Grad	s^na	-1	0	yeah there's a ton of it man on this summer okay great 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact314	607.77	611.658	C	Grad	s^df	+1	1	a ton of it man pages and uh source code in okay great so i mean that sounds 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact312	607.455	607.725	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	a ton of it man okay great 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact313	607.725	608.225	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	a ton of it man pages and uh okay great so 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact315	608.225	608.725	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	pages and uh so 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact316	611.299	612.429	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	i mean that sounds good i i was just 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact317	612.539	613.839	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	good i i was just looking for something i'm not 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact318	613.839	615.029	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	looking for something i'm not a database person but something sort of standard 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact319	615.089	620.062	F	PhD	s	+1	0	yeah it's but something sort of standard enough that you know if we start using this week and give it out other people can work on 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact320	620.062	621.342	F	PhD	s	+1	0	yeah it's not standard other people can work on it or 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact321	620.861	622.011	C	Grad	s^bk|s^nd	-1	0	yeah it's not standard i mean something that we developed other people can work on it or 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact322	621.342	622.152	F	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	not standard i mean something that we developed it or 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact323	622.011	623.661	C	Grad	s^df^nd	+1	2	i mean something that we developed a dixie 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact324	624.682	625.292	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	but uh but 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact325	626.009	628.039	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but it's been used here and it's then used here and people 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact326	627.839	628.879	C	Grad	s^m^na	-1	0	but it's been used here and then used here and people 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact327	628.039	629.049	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	been used here and and you know we and people 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact328	628.879	634.039	C	Grad	s	+1	0	been used here and and you know we have uh well configured system that you can distribute for free and i mean it it and people 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact329	634.039	634.369	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	and i mean it it 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact330	634.512	640.062	D	PhD	s^bu|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	yeah but we have and i mean it it must be the equivalent of what ever you guys used to store feed your computer teachers and and 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact331	635.317	635.987	F	PhD	b	-1	0	must be the equivalent 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact332	640.16	640.52	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah but we have 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact333	640.52	640.97	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah but we have 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact334	641.719	646.239	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	actually we we use a generalization if the the fear 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact335	645.514	645.984	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact336	647.337	647.927	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact337	648.757	649.077	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	but 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact338	650.551	651.951	A	PhD	s^na	-1	0	yeah so there's something like that 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact339	652.031	654.381	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	but it's um probably other this is whereas h. d. k. do for features i i think that's 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact341	653.264	655.304	C	Grad	qw	-1	0	probably other this is that whereas h. d. k. do for features or doesn't even have i think that's 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact340	652.843	653.663	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	but it's um probably other this is whereas h. d. k. i i think that's 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact342	655.304	657.214	C	Grad	qy	-1	0	that has its own i mean or doesn't even have a concept of teachers 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact343	655.952	657.062	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	that has its own i mean or doesn't even have a concept of teachers 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact344	657.922	664.242	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean the topic has their own future format called like s. s. d. d.'s and that's that for something like that i'm just wondering would yeah 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact345	662.116	662.716	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and that's yeah 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact347	664.41	666.88	C	Grad	qy^cs^df^rt	-1	0	i'm just wondering would it be worthwhile to use that instead yeah 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact346	664.04	664.52	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i'm just wondering would 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact348	665.164	665.514	A	PhD	%	-1	0	it be worthwhile to use 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact349	666.922	667.182	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	that instead yeah did this is exactly 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact350	667.182	670.062	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	but i mean people don't typically share this did this is exactly kind of decision it's just whatever 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact351	668.338	672.778	D	PhD	s^bu|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	but i mean people don't typically share this kind of stuff right i mean kind of decision it's just whatever 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact352	672.675	672.975	A	PhD	b	-1	0	of stuff right i mean 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact354	673.214	674.234	C	Grad	s^na	-1	0	they generate their own yeah actually 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact353	672.778	673.178	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	they generate their own of stuff right i mean 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact356	674.275	674.635	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah actually 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact355	674.143	679.54	F	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	yeah actually i i just you know we we've done this stuff on kazaa takes and 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact357	679.54	682.727	F	PhD	s	-1	0	takes and three or four places of vast for those preside x. files and we 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact358	682.727	685.977	F	PhD	s	-1	0	oh right x. files and we just have an ask e. uh i'll put a frame by frame 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact359	684.637	685.117	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	oh right uh i'll put a frame by frame 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact360	686.107	687.007	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	which is fine but he gets unwieldy 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact361	687.585	692.405	F	PhD	s	-1	0	right but he gets unwieldy to go in and and greedy styles with really huge files 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact362	692.736	693.046	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right and we could do it i 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact363	693.07	693.89	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and we could do it i 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact364	693.89	697.29	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and and again if you have a if you have and we could do it i was just think if there's something that where all the frame values are huh 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact365	695.261	696.411	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	and and again if you have a that where all the frame values 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact367	697.72	701.49	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	if you have a two hour long meeting that's going to are huh their their for their quite 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact366	697.39	697.6	F	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	if you have are huh 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact368	701.169	702.709	F	PhD	s	-1	0	going to yeah i mean their their for their quite large and these 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact370	702.712	704.182	C	Grad	s^na	-1	0	yeah i mean they vehement enormous large and these are for ten minute switchboard 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact369	702.709	706.419	F	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah i mean they vehement enormous large and these are for ten minute switchboard conversation's and 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact371	705.99	706.26	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	conversation's and 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact372	706.419	706.649	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	and 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact373	707.3	708.04	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so it's doable it's just that you can 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact374	708.04	711.88	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	it's just that you can only store a feature featured actor it frame by frame it 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact375	711.88	713.08	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	frame by frame it doesn't have any kind of 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact377	714.869	719.709	D	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	is is the sharing part of this a pretty important consideration or does 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact376	714.57	714.91	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	is 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact378	719.709	722.149	D	PhD	qrr	-1	0	or does that just sort of a a nice thing to have i 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact379	722.987	727.657	F	PhD	s^no^rt	-1	0	i i don't know enough about what we're going to do with the data but i 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact380	727.717	736.566	F	PhD	s	+1	1	with the data but i thought it would be good to get something that we can that other people can use or adopt for their own kinds of in coding and just 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact381	736.566	740.456	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	coding and just we have to use some we have to make some decision about what to do especially for 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact382	739.731	739.971	C	Grad	b	-1	0	about what to 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact383	740.456	745.918	F	PhD	s	+1	0	do especially for the probably work what what it ends up being is you get teachers from the signal in of 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact384	745.918	748.168	F	PhD	s	-1	0	from the signal in of course those change every time your alignments change so he rerun a recognizing 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact385	748.168	749.478	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so he rerun a recognizing you to re compute 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact386	749.478	754.869	F	PhD	s	+1	0	you to re compute your features um and and keep the database up to date or you 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact387	754.857	755.057	C	Grad	b	-1	0	up to date or you change a word or you change 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact388	754.869	760.04	F	PhD	s	+1	0	up to date or you change a word or you change uh i'd rinse boundary segment which is going to happen a lot and 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact389	760.737	765.097	F	PhD	s	+1	1	and so i wanted something where all of this can be done in an elegant way and that if somebody 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact390	765.097	770.747	F	PhD	s	+1	1	and that if somebody want to try something or compute something else that it can be done selectively 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact391	771.375	771.845	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	um it 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact392	772.005	773.365	F	PhD	s	-1	0	doesn't have to be pretty it just has to be 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact393	773.365	776.693	F	PhD	s.%--	+1	0	pretty it just has to be yeah he to is and 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact394	777.3	778.25	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	yeah the other thing 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact395	779.196	780.546	C	Grad	s^cs	+1	1	we should look at less than 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact396	780.876	781.766	C	Grad	s^e	+1	0	less than this thing 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact397	781.293	781.413	F	PhD	b	-1	0	this thing 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact398	781.979	782.299	A	PhD	b	-1	0	this thing and 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact399	783.008	784.808	C	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	see if they have anything at that level i mean i'm 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact400	783.026	783.226	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	see if they have anything 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact401	784.808	787.278	C	Grad	s^no	-1	0	at that level i mean i'm not sure what to do about this with that was because they chose a different 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact402	787.278	788.678	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	was because they chose a different route 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact403	789.206	790.306	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i chose something that that they're sort of 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact404	790.456	791.666	C	Grad	s	+1	1	that that they're sort of two choices your your 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact405	791.666	800.135	C	Grad	s^e	+1	0	two choices your your file format can know about know that you're talking about language and speech which is what i chose in time or your file 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact406	800.501	803.111	C	Grad	s^e	+1	0	or your file format can just be a graph representation and then 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact407	803.798	806.248	C	Grad	s	+1	0	and then the application has to impose structure on top so what 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact408	806.884	809.404	C	Grad	s	+1	0	so what looked like atlas chose as they chose the other way which was 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact409	809.504	813.268	C	Grad	s^e	+1	1	way which was that file format is justin nodes and likes and you have 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact410	813.668	815.628	C	Grad	s^e	+1	0	and you have to interpret what they mean yourself 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact411	816.797	819.697	F	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	i because i knew that we were doing and why did you not choose that type of approach 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact412	818.751	820.401	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i because i knew that we were doing speech and i thought it was better that type of approach 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact413	820.401	828.131	C	Grad	s	+1	1	speech and i thought it was better if you're looking at a raw file to too for the tax to say it's a not a rents as opposed to attack to say it's a link okay 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact414	820.738	821.168	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	speech and i thought it was better 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact415	828.718	829.148	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so okay but other than that 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact417	829.901	830.201	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	so but but other than that are they compatible 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact416	829.532	831.102	F	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	so but but other than that are they compatible i mean you could sort of 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact418	831.102	831.782	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i mean you could sort of 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact419	832.17	832.37	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah they reasonably compatible i 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact420	832.37	833.52	C	Grad	s^na	-1	0	yeah they reasonably compatible probably i mean you could you could 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact421	832.954	834.074	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	yeah they reasonably compatible probably translate to tune i mean you could you could 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact422	833.855	835.255	D	PhD	s	-1	0	yep probably translate to tune in mean you could you could yeah that's 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact424	835.779	836.039	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yep so in yeah that's so 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact423	835.57	836.02	F	PhD	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	yep so in yeah that's so 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact425	836.07	836.55	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	so so 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact426	836.772	837.032	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	so well the other thing is so 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact427	837.032	844.882	C	Grad	s	-1	0	well the other thing is if we choose to use that less which maybe we should just do we should just throw this out before we invest a lot of time in it 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact428	837.19	837.42	F	PhD	b	-1	0	well the other thing is 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact429	842.417	842.707	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	we should just throw this 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact430	845.099	846.419	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so this is what the means about just sort of how 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact432	846.61	846.84	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	about just sort of how 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact431	846.419	847.309	F	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	about just sort of how to um because 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact433	847.709	851.379	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	to um because we need to come up with the davis like this just to do our work and i actually don't 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact434	851.379	855.643	F	PhD	s	-1	0	work and i actually don't care as long as it's something useful other people what we choose so maybe 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact435	855.078	855.288	C	Grad	b	-1	0	we choose so maybe 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact436	855.643	857.751	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	we choose so maybe it's yet you know 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact437	857.751	860.441	F	PhD	s^no	-1	0	the only thing yeah yet you know if you have any idea of how to choose because i don't 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact438	858.335	858.895	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	the only thing if you have any idea 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact439	860.908	861.188	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	the very have yeah me don't 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact440	861.452	862.482	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	the very have tools me i i chose this 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact441	861.929	864.059	C	Grad	s	+1	0	the very have tools me i i chose this for a couple of reasons one of them is that's easy 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact442	864.059	865.709	C	Grad	s^df	+1	1	one of them is that's easy to parse 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact443	866.518	868.238	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	you don't need a full x. m. l. purse or it's very easy to just 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact444	868.238	871.568	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	as long or it's very easy to just write script to parse it 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact445	871.757	874.277	A	PhD	s	-1	0	as long as it each tag is so it exactly exactly 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact446	874.08	874.74	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	exactly exactly 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact447	874.74	875.18	C	Grad	s^aa^r	-1	0	exactly exactly which i always do 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact448	875.18	876.09	C	Grad	s	-1	0	which i always do and you can have as 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact449	876.405	879.565	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and you can have as much information in the tag if you want right 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact450	879.705	879.915	F	PhD	qy^d^g	-1	0	want right 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact451	880.612	881.762	C	Grad	s	-1	0	well i have it structure right so 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact452	881.762	881.992	C	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	it structure right so 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact453	881.992	885.992	C	Grad	s	-1	0	it structure right so each tight tag has only particular items that they can take 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact454	886.53	890.508	F	PhD	s^bu.%--	+1	1	sure if can you but you can add to those structures 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact455	889.252	889.582	C	Grad	s^aa	+1	0	sure 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact456	891.02	891.72	C	Grad	s^2	-1	0	you have more information so what 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact457	891.84	901.764	C	Grad	s:s	+1	0	you have more information so what what nist would say is that instead of doing this you would say something like a link start the schools um you know some note id 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact458	891.912	892.342	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	you have more information so what what nist would 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact459	892.342	892.952	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	what nist would 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact460	902.654	904.484	C	Grad	s:s	+1	0	and equal some other note id 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact461	905.905	908.755	C	Grad	s	+1	1	and then typed would be under 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact462	910.531	910.701	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact463	911.141	912.291	C	Grad	s	-1	0	know so it's very similar 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact464	913.429	918.819	F	PhD	qw	-1	0	it probably wouldn't be a so why would it be a a waste to do it this way if it's similar enough that we can always translate it 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact465	918.322	919.372	D	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	it probably wouldn't be a waste it would mean that at translate it 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact466	919.372	923.96	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	right a translator but it's it since waste it would mean that at some point if we wanted to switch we just have to translate but 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact467	922.187	922.967	C	Grad	s^2	-1	0	right a translator but translate 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact468	922.967	923.397	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	right a translator but it's it since translate but 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact470	923.95	925.52	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	it's it since they're developing a pig but that's i don't think it's but it doesn't that sounds as long 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact469	923.86	924.98	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	it's it since they're developing a but but it doesn't that sounds

Bdb001.C.dialogueact474	927.043	928.723	C	Grad	s	+1	1	they're developing a big infrastructure and so 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact475	928.723	934.873	C	Grad	s^cs.%-	-1	0	you want to because they already have something and so it seems to me that if if we want to use that we might as well go directly to what they're doing rather than 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact476	930.694	931.424	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	you want to if we want to use that we 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact477	933.977	937.757	A	PhD	qy^rt	+1	2	because they already have something that's that would be useful for in place directly to what they're doing rather than yeah see that's the question i mean 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact478	936.66	936.91	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	would be useful for yeah see 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact479	936.91	937.92	D	PhD	s	-1	0	would be useful for in place yeah see that's the question i mean 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact480	937.92	939.54	D	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	in place that's the question i mean how stable is there 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact481	940.251	941.141	D	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	well i looked at it are they ready to go or 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact482	940.891	942.081	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	well i looked at it the last time are they ready to go or 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact483	941.141	941.421	D	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	i looked at it or 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact484	942.521	944.191	C	Grad	s^no	+1	0	the last time i looked at it was a while ago probably a year ago 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact485	944.191	945.121	C	Grad	s^e	+1	0	ago probably a year ago uh 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact487	945.839	947.709	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	uh when we first started talking about this and at that 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact486	945.472	945.722	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	uh 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact488	947.709	951.576	C	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	about this and at that time at least it was still not very complete 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact489	952.036	956.766	C	Grad	s^e^nd	+1	0	and so specifically they didn't have any external format representation at that time 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact490	957.109	962.339	C	Grad	s^e	+1	0	they just had this sort of conceptual will nosed i indicated transcription graph which i really 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact491	962.499	963.449	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	which i really liked and that's exactly 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact492	963.449	965.289	C	Grad	s	-1	0	liked and that's exactly what this stuff is based on since 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact493	965.856	968.556	C	Grad	s	+1	0	on since then they've developed their own extra file format 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact494	969.139	972.039	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	which is uh you know the sort of this sort of thing um and 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact495	972.601	974.741	C	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	um and apparently they've also developed a lot of tools but i haven't 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact496	974.741	975.691	C	Grad	s	+1	0	a lot of tools but i haven't looked at them maybe i 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact497	975.691	976.351	C	Grad	s^cs	+1	1	we should we looked at them maybe i should they would 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact498	976.505	977.905	A	PhD	s^cs^na	-1	0	we should we should find out should they would the tools with 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact499	976.862	981.362	F	PhD	qy	-1	0	we should we should find out should they would the tools with the chills run on something like this if you can translate them anyway 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact500	982.166	988.036	C	Grad	h|s	+1	1	um what would would would what would worry me is that maybe we might miss a little detail that would make it very i mean that i guess it's the question it 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact502	982.773	983.663	A	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	um what would would would what i mean that i guess it's the question it 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact501	982.657	984.187	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	um what would would would what would worry me i mean that i guess it's the question it 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact504	984.73	984.88	A	PhD	%	-1	0	would worry me 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact503	984.287	984.577	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	would worry me 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact505	988.296	990.886	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	think of its conception that would make it very difficult to translate from one to the other 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact506	988.603	989.083	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	that would make it very difficult to translate 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact507	990.113	1003.47	A	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	think of its conception like close and they already have or will have tools that everybody else will be using i mean it would be crazy to do something you know separate that from one to the other yeah we might as well yep 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact508	990.9	991.29	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	think of its conception like close from one to the other 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact509	998.916	999.676	C	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	i mean it would be crazy yeah we might as well 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact510	1003.32	1003.57	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	that yep 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact511	1004.08	1004.27	F	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact512	1005.06	1006.6	C	Grad	s^cc	+1	1	so i'll take a closer look at it actually so it's that 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact513	1005.87	1006.3	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	so i'll take a closer look at it actually so it's that 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact514	1006.3	1006.74	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	look at it so it's that 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact515	1006.74	1011.31	F	PhD	s	-1	0	look at it so it's that that would really be the question is just what you feel is in the long run the best thing because 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact516	1008.28	1008.67	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	the question is just what 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact517	1009.85	1010.11	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	you feel is in the long run the best 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact518	1011.31	1019.16	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	the other thing thing because once we start sort of doing this i don't we don't actually have enough time to probably have to rehash of that again 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact519	1011.85	1012.1	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	thing because once we start sort 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact520	1014.97	1015.19	C	Grad	b	-1	0	this i don't we don't actually have enough time 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact522	1019.57	1026.36	C	Grad	s	+1	1	the other thing the other ways that i sort of establish this was as easy translation to and from the transcriber format right 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact521	1019.16	1019.37	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	the other thing 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact523	1020.23	1020.29	F	PhD	%	-1	0	the other 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact524	1026.81	1027.18	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	right right 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact525	1027.51	1027.98	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	right 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact526	1027.69	1028.01	F	PhD	s^bk^r	-1	0	but right 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact527	1028.66	1028.94	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	but 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact528	1029.21	1029.99	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean i like this this 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact529	1029.99	1033.03	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean i like this this is sort of intuitively easy to actually read as easy it could it 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact530	1032.07	1032.27	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	read 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact531	1033.03	1034.64	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	as easy it could it could be 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact532	1035.03	1035.32	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	but i 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact533	1035.97	1040.22	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but i suppose that as long as they have a type here that specifies i 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact534	1040.64	1040.94	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bdb001.C.dialogueact535	1041.25	1042.23	C	Grad	s	-1	0	it's almost the same that the it's yeah close 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact536	1042.12	1043.6	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	that the the the point is it's yeah close enough 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact537	1042.82	1047.4	C	Grad	s	+1	0	that the the the point is with this though is that you can't really add any supplementary information it's yeah close enough 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact538	1048.56	1048.75	C	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right so if you 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact539	1048.75	1050.49	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	right so if you suddenly decide that you want you have to make a different 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact540	1050.42	1051.51	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	yeah you have to make a different type 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact541	1051.75	1051.99	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah type 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact542	1052.51	1053.62	C	Grad	s^m^na	-1	0	you have to make a different type so well 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact543	1053.53	1053.94	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	a different type so well 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact544	1053.99	1054.97	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	a different type so well if you look at it and 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact545	1054.97	1056.03	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	if you look at it and um i guess in my mind 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact546	1056.27	1062.39	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i guess in my mind i don't know enough jane would know better about types of medications and and 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact547	1062.39	1067.91	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and and but i imagine that those are things that would well you guys mentioned this that could stand any 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact548	1068.79	1070.23	F	PhD	s	-1	0	it could be in its own channel i could stand 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact549	1070.23	1073.08	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i could stand time boundaries of any type they could be instantaneous 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact550	1072.56	1072.86	C	Grad	b	-1	0	of any type 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact551	1073.08	1074.44	F	PhD	s	-1	0	they could be instantaneous things 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact552	1074.81	1075.57	F	PhD	s	-1	0	things like that 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact553	1075.93	1076.4	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	like that and 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact554	1076.89	1081.58	F	PhD	s	-1	0	right and then from the recognition side we have back traces that the phone level if if i can 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact556	1081.8	1082.14	C	Grad	b	-1	0	right level if if i can handle that could 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact555	1081.58	1084.16	F	PhD	s	-1	0	right level if if i can handle that could handle states or whatever and 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact557	1084.84	1091.09	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and then at the probably level we have frame sort of like capsule feature files uh like these 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact558	1089.19	1089.47	C	Grad	b	-1	0	like capsule 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact559	1091.48	1093.58	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	uh like these peace aisles or anything like that and that's sort 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact560	1093.58	1095.12	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	like that and that's sort of the world of things that i and 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact561	1095.87	1098.3	F	PhD	s	-1	0	it seems and then we have the line channels 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact562	1097.59	1097.84	C	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bdb001.A.dialogueact564	1098.79	1101.55	A	PhD	s^bs	+1	1	it seems to me you want to keep the frame level stuff separate yeah 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact563	1098.3	1098.4	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	it seems 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact565	1101.82	1102.04	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and then yeah i i definitely agree 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact567	1102.32	1102.91	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	and then i i definitely agree 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact566	1102.04	1103.2	F	PhD	s^na	-1	0	and then i i definitely agree and i wanted to find 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact568	1103.2	1108.75	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and i wanted to find actually if a nicer format or uh maybe a more compact from it than what we use before just because 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact569	1107.69	1107.97	C	Grad	b	-1	0	from it than what we 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact570	1108.75	1113.11	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	no use before just because you got ten channels or whatever and two hours of a meeting at 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact571	1113.11	1114.77	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	no no how would you huge at 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact573	1113.98	1114.34	C	Grad	s^na	-1	0	no no how would you huge at 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact572	1113.98	1121.16	A	PhD	qw	+1	0	no no how would you how would you represents multiple speakers in this framework where you would just represent huge at 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact574	1121.16	1122.99	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	where you would just represent them as 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact575	1121.52	1122.22	C	Grad	h	-1	0	where you would just represent them as 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact576	1123.42	1125.45	A	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	you would have like a speaker tag or something there's a speak to 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact577	1125.26	1127.93	C	Grad	s	+1	1	there's a speak to your tag up at the top which identifies them and 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact578	1127.93	1128.61	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	which identifies them and then he chopped the way i 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact579	1128.73	1135.54	C	Grad	s	+1	0	then he chopped the way i had is each turn or each other and so i don't even remember now had a speaker id tag attached to it 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact580	1129.72	1130.17	A	PhD	b	-1	0	had is each turn 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact581	1136.26	1136.69	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact582	1136.71	1139.12	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and this format you would have a different tack 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact583	1140.16	1142.87	C	Grad	s	-1	0	which which would uh be linked to the link 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact585	1144.2	1147.45	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so-so somewhere else you would have another thing that would be um 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact584	1143.86	1144.18	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so-so somewhere 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact586	1147.45	1148.46	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	be um 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact587	1150.52	1151.95	C	Grad	qr^t1	-1	0	but to would be neuter like um 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact588	1151.95	1152.56	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	neuter like um 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact589	1153.59	1160.9	C	Grad	s	-1	0	that's so so this one would have um an id is link one seventy four something like that 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact591	1161.01	1161.48	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and then somewhere 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact590	1160.9	1172.4	C	Grad	s	-1	0	like that and then somewhere here you would have a link that that uh you know was reference saying l. seventy four and had speaker 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact593	1173.58	1174.0	A	PhD	%	-1	0	you know or something like that actually it's the channel i think 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact594	1173.62	1173.81	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	you know or something actually it's 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact595	1173.81	1174.83	C	Grad	s	-1	0	you know or something like that actually it's the channel i think 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact592	1173.54	1175.48	F	PhD	s^ng.%--	-1	0	you know or something like that actually it's the channel i think that 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact597	1176.21	1177.73	A	PhD	s	-1	0	well chandler speaker whatever doesn't i mean yeah channel is 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact596	1176.17	1176.92	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	well chandler speaker i mean yeah 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact598	1176.92	1179.52	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	well chandler speaker whatever doesn't this isn't quite right i mean yeah channel is what the channel eyes output out 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact599	1177.73	1178.17	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	whatever doesn't channel is what the channel eyes output 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact600	1179.15	1180.0	C	Grad	s	-1	0	but this isn't quite right i have to look at it again out yeah but 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact602	1180.21	1180.39	A	PhD	b	-1	0	but i have to look at it again yeah but 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact601	1180.0	1181.01	C	Grad	s	-1	0	but but still holland and i have to look at it again yeah but 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact603	1180.25	1181.04	F	PhD	s^bk|%-	-1	0	but but still holland and i have to look at it again yeah but 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact604	1180.93	1190.47	A	PhD	fg|qw	+1	0	but but still holland and this one meant to be express uh hah rocket the relationship between um say i'd rents and words within it so how do you i have to look at it again yeah but 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact605	1190.47	1195.86	A	PhD	qw	-1	0	it so how do you tell these are the words that belonged to that under 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact606	1196.92	1203.66	C	Grad	h|s	+1	0	um you have another structure lower down and this that would be saying they're all belonging to this id 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact607	1200.33	1200.74	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	that would be 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact608	1205.5	1209.53	D	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	right so each thing refers to be better instead of belongs to 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact609	1209.44	1209.76	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right to 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact611	1211.02	1213.26	C	Grad	s	-1	0	then each other and could refer to it turn and each turn it's it's not it's sort of bottom up 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact610	1211.01	1213.04	D	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	then each other and could refer to it turn and each turn it's it's not it's sort of bottom up 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact612	1213.66	1215.79	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and each turn could refer to something higher up 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact613	1216.2	1217.49	F	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	so what if you actually have 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact614	1218.03	1228.43	F	PhD	s	-1	0	right now what you have is utter and um the closest thing that comes out of the channel eyes is the stuff between the segment boundaries that the transcribers put in or that tivo put in 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact615	1229.25	1235.93	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	well which may or may not actually be like us it's usually not um the beginning and end of a sentence 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact616	1235.98	1237.19	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	well it's why called sense sentence so right um 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact617	1236.66	1236.95	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	it's why called sense so right 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact618	1236.95	1237.27	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	it's why called sense so right um 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact619	1237.85	1239.45	F	PhD	s	-1	0	yep um so it's like a segment or say so 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact620	1239.4	1239.65	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yep or say so 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact621	1239.75	1240.32	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	yep or say so 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact622	1241.3	1254.59	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean i assume this is possible that if you have someone and it takes the punctuation or whatever when they transcribe you can say you know from for from the kit beginning of the sense to the end of the sentence from the indications this is a unit you know 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact623	1254.89	1256.07	F	PhD	s^e.%--	-1	0	a unit you know it never actually it's 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact624	1256.87	1260.82	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	sure it's only unit by virtue of the indications at the level 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact625	1260.94	1261.28	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	sure i mean so you would you would the level and then 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact626	1261.28	1263.25	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i mean so you would you would have yet another tag and then that would get a tag somehow 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact627	1261.5	1264.22	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean so you would you would have yet another tag you have another attack which and then that would get a tag somehow okay 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact628	1264.2	1266.66	C	Grad	s	-1	0	you have another attack which says this is of type descendants okay okay 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact629	1264.22	1264.62	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	you have another attack which okay 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact630	1266.62	1267.1	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and okay 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact631	1267.34	1267.74	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	and 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact633	1268.1	1268.43	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	what but it's just not 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact632	1268.02	1270.27	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	what but it's just not overtly and uh 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact634	1269.91	1270.14	A	PhD	b	-1	0	overtly and uh 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact635	1271.98	1273.52	F	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	so um because this is exactly the kind of 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact636	1273.38	1273.71	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	so the kind of 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact637	1275.04	1277.55	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i think that should be possible as long as the 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact638	1278.1	1283.13	F	PhD	s^no	-1	0	but what i don't understand where the where in this type of file that would be expressed 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact639	1284.91	1285.09	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right you have another attack 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact640	1285.09	1286.59	C	Grad	s	-1	0	you have another attack somewhere 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact641	1287.26	1288.92	C	Grad	s	-1	0	well they're two ways of doing it so it would just be floating before 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact642	1287.37	1291.94	F	PhD	s	-1	0	well they're two ways of doing it you could have some sort of link so it would just be floating before the are floating after the sentence without a timer 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact643	1290.69	1292.66	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	you could have some sort of link type the sentence without a timer 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact644	1294.02	1295.16	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	people sentence 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact645	1297.17	1299.42	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	and id is ass or whatever 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact646	1300.2	1303.38	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	and then lower down you could have not daughter rents so the 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact647	1303.74	1307.1	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	so the type is utter it's equal but you could either 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact648	1307.17	1308.72	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	you could either say that 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact649	1309.57	1309.88	C	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	no i don't 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact650	1309.88	1310.29	C	Grad	s^no	-1	0	so you no i don't know i take that 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact652	1310.7	1311.6	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so you the thing know i take that back 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact651	1310.67	1311.31	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so you the thing know i take that back 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact653	1312.01	1312.5	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	because 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact655	1313.24	1318.0	C	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	can you can you say that this is part of this or do you see this is part of you would just have or it's 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact654	1312.94	1313.5	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	can you can you say because it's

Bdb001.D.dialogueact663	1319.92	1321.28	D	PhD	s	-1	0	this i think so you would refer up to the sentence but there they're actually overlapping

Bdb001.A.dialogueact664	1320.76	1321.33	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	so refer up to the sentence they're actually overlapping 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact665	1321.14	1323.08	F	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	the thing is that some so right they're actually overlapping each others 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact666	1321.77	1321.99	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	so they're actually overlapping 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact667	1323.14	1329.28	A	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	the thing is that some something maybe a part of one thing for one purpose in another thing of another purpose right 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact668	1323.42	1323.71	C	Grad	b	-1	0	the thing is that some right 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact670	1330.31	1330.66	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	so you have to have another type 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact669	1330.06	1332.0	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so you have to have another type then again 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact671	1331.47	1331.9	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	then again 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact672	1332.46	1333.02	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	well well i

Bdb001.A.dialogueact675	1333.75	1335.31	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	well that that's tasteless let's well i think i'm i think we i had better look at

Bdb001.A.dialogueact683	1341.12	1343.22	A	PhD	s	-1	0	suppose you have a what sequence and you have two different

Bdb001.A.dialogueact685	1346.94	1353.92	A	PhD	s	+1	0	sequence for say one thing station is in terms of offensive 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact686	1354.61	1359.28	A	PhD	s	+1	0	and another segment patient is in terms of um i don't know provided phrases 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact687	1360.15	1362.67	A	PhD	s	+1	0	and let's say that they don't that's so 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact688	1362.8	1367.62	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	that's so you know i presided phrase my cross two senses or something i don't know if right 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact689	1365.27	1365.48	C	Grad	b	-1	0	right 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact690	1367.62	1368.71	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	or something i don't know if that's true or not but well 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact691	1368.78	1369.87	A	PhD	fh|s.%-	-1	0	that's true or not but that's it well it's definitely true with 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact692	1368.91	1370.65	F	PhD	s	-1	0	that's true or not but that's it well it's definitely true with this segment that's what i 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact693	1370.62	1370.82	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	this segment that's what i 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact694	1370.65	1374.39	F	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	so you want to be you want to say this segment that's what i exactly what i meant by the other and says versus a sentence can be sort of 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact695	1371.36	1371.59	A	PhD	b	-1	0	exactly what i meant by 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact696	1373.32	1379.71	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so you want to be you want to say this this word is part of that sentence and the spurs are like phrase a sentence can be sort of 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact697	1375.31	1375.43	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	this this word 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact699	1381.07	1382.81	A	PhD	s	-1	0	the phrase is not part of the settings and you 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact698	1381.0	1381.16	F	PhD	b	-1	0	the phrase is not 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact700	1382.81	1384.4	A	PhD	s	-1	0	part of the settings and you there's a sense part of the frame or i'm pretty sure that 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact701	1383.62	1384.02	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	there's a sense part of the frame or i'm pretty sure that 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact702	1384.17	1385.71	C	Grad	s^na	+1	0	frame or i'm pretty sure that you can do that but i'm 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact703	1385.71	1388.09	C	Grad	s^no	+1	1	so you would have to have two different pointers you can do that but i'm forgetting the exact level of nesting 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact704	1386.42	1391.25	A	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	so you would have to have two different pointers from the word up what level up one of forgetting the exact level of nesting so so what you 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact705	1391.43	1392.81	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	up one of those so so what you would end up having is attacked 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact706	1391.57	1394.67	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	up one of those so so what you would end up having is attacked saying here's a word it starts 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact707	1394.67	1396.14	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	a word it starts here and it ends here and then lower down 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact708	1395.67	1396.07	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	here and it ends here and then lower down 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact709	1396.45	1399.1	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	and then lower down you'd say here's aprons audit boundary and has these words 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact710	1399.27	1400.3	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	and has these words in it 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact711	1401.05	1402.6	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	and lord now you'd have here's a sentence and it has these and right 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact713	1401.88	1402.27	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and lord now you'd have here's a sentence and it has these and right 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact712	1401.44	1402.32	F	PhD	b	-1	0	and lord now you'd have here's a sentence and it has these and right 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact714	1402.6	1403.78	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	a sentence and it has these words in it so you would be able to go 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact715	1403.12	1407.52	F	PhD	s:s^co	-1	0	words in it yep so you would be able to go in and say you know give me all the words in the bound in the presided phrasing email or 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact717	1407.86	1408.22	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yep phrasing email or the yeah 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact716	1407.52	1408.3	F	PhD	s.%-:s^co.%-	-1	0	yep phrasing email or the yeah 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact718	1408.36	1408.59	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	the yeah 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact719	1409.38	1410.44	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so i think that's that would really look at it 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact720	1409.5	1410.46	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so i think that's that would really look at it 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact721	1410.44	1411.41	C	Grad	s^co	-1	0	would really look at it again okay 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact722	1411.28	1411.58	A	PhD	b	-1	0	again okay 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact724	1412.06	1423.88	A	PhD	s^tc	-1	0	they had the other issue that you had with hobby actually efficiently extract um find an extract information and instructional office type 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact723	1411.66	1412.09	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	they had the other issue again okay 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact725	1412.2	1412.41	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	they had the other issue 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact726	1413.34	1413.61	F	PhD	s^ba^t3	-1	0	that you had with 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact727	1424.73	1426.77	A	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	so you give some examples like 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact728	1427.38	1427.83	F	PhD	h	-1	0	well 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact729	1428.24	1429.86	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and i mean you guys might 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact730	1430.94	1432.32	F	PhD	s^no	-1	0	i don't know if this is premature because i suppose 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact731	1432.32	1436.04	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because i suppose once you get the representation you can do this but the kinds of things 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact732	1436.04	1438.17	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but the kinds of things i was worried about is 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact733	1439.21	1440.06	A	PhD	s^ar|s^nd	-1	0	no that's not clear i mean yeah you could well okay so 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact734	1439.21	1439.64	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	no that's not clear 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact735	1440.06	1441.92	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	i mean yeah you could sure you can do it but well okay so if it 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact736	1440.28	1440.91	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i mean yeah you could well okay so 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact737	1440.91	1441.84	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	i mean yeah you could sure you can do it but well okay so if it 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact738	1441.92	1446.23	A	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	sure you can do it but can you do it so that you know if it i mean i can't do it um 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact739	1443.44	1444.59	F	PhD	s^j^nd	-1	0	so that i mean i can't do it 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact740	1444.59	1445.41	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so that you know do it 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact741	1446.2	1446.64	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact742	1446.77	1450.82	A	PhD	s	-1	0	you good you going to do this you you got to want to do this very quickly wealths well um 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact743	1447.15	1447.39	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	you good you going to do well 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact744	1450.97	1455.92	A	PhD	s	-1	0	very quickly wealths you'll spend all your time for the searching for very complex data structures right you need it's sort of a paradigm for 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact745	1454.0	1454.32	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	complex you need it's sort 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact746	1454.32	1456.97	F	PhD	s	-1	0	complex data structures you need it's sort of a paradigm for how to do it but 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact747	1456.97	1470.04	F	PhD	s	-1	0	how to do it but an example would be find all the cases in which adam started to talk well while is was talking and his pitch was rising under 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact748	1470.27	1471.07	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	under that kind of 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact749	1471.33	1471.88	F	PhD	s	-1	0	that kind of 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact750	1472.67	1472.85	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right i mean 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact751	1472.85	1473.62	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	right i mean that's going to be 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact752	1474.35	1476.82	C	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	is the rising pitch uh feature or 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact753	1476.82	1478.66	C	Grad	qrr	-1	0	feature or is it going to be in the same file well 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact754	1478.67	1482.14	F	PhD	h|s	-1	0	file well the rising pitch will never be hand annotated so the all the presiding 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact755	1482.14	1485.34	F	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	well i mean that's going to be so the all the presiding features are going to be automatically they're going to be in 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact756	1484.48	1484.93	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	well i to be automatically 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact757	1485.47	1487.21	C	Grad	s	-1	0	mean that's going to be hard regardless right because you're going to have to they're going to be in those 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact758	1485.5	1486.5	F	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	mean that's going to be hard regardless they're going to be in those 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact759	1487.21	1487.43	C	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right because you're going to have to 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact760	1487.43	1492.06	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	right because you're going to have to write a program that goes through your future filing looks verizon pitches so right so normally what we would do 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact761	1489.68	1489.95	A	PhD	b	-1	0	that goes through your future 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact762	1491.41	1491.72	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	verizon pitches so right 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact763	1491.78	1492.05	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	verizon pitches so right so normally what we would do 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact764	1492.05	1496.28	F	PhD	s:qw^rt	-1	0	so normally what we would do is we would say what i way to sign rising pitch to are we going to such 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact765	1496.28	1497.52	F	PhD	s:qy^rt	-1	0	to are we going to such a word words are going to just 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact766	1497.52	1498.94	F	PhD	s.%--:qy.%--	-1	0	a word words are going to just decided to sort of 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact767	1499.51	1502.42	F	PhD	s	-1	0	one is and we have it be in and rise representation but suppose we 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact768	1502.42	1503.99	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but suppose we dump out this file 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact769	1503.99	1509.36	F	PhD	s:s	-1	0	okay well dump out this file they say for every word we just classified is you know rise or fall or neither 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact770	1509.65	1509.83	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay well 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact771	1509.83	1512.99	C	Grad	s	-1	0	okay well in that case you would add that to this format okay so we 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact772	1510.08	1510.46	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	in that case you would add okay 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact774	1512.99	1513.23	C	Grad	%--	-1	0	format so we would basically be sort of 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact773	1512.78	1522.51	F	PhD	s	+1	0	format right so we would basically be sort of um taking the format and enriching it with things that we wanted weary in relation to the words that are already in the file and then 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact775	1522.07	1522.3	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right file and then 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact776	1522.84	1523.69	F	PhD	s	-1	0	right file and then create 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact778	1524.3	1529.26	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	you want some of the crap that's that works at the structural on the structure up and you have that there's uh

Bdb001.F.dialogueact817	1595.34	1599.52	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	frame level teachers true that's why i was trying to figure out what's the best format for this representation and it's still 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact818	1599.21	1599.43	C	Grad	b	-1	0	and it's still 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact819	1599.52	1600.48	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and it's still going to be 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact821	1602.4	1602.86	A	PhD	b	-1	0	it's still going to be 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact820	1602.05	1604.05	F	PhD	s	-1	0	right it's still going to be uh not direct you know it 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact823	1604.23	1604.46	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right you know it 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact822	1604.13	1604.57	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	right you know it 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact824	1605.66	1614.09	F	PhD	s	-1	0	or another example was you know uh where in the language where in the word sequence are people interrupting so 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact825	1614.28	1614.74	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact826	1615.92	1617.24	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	i guess that was actually easier 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact827	1618.88	1619.27	D	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	what about what about 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact828	1619.69	1628.92	D	PhD	qo^r	+1	0	about what about um the idea of using a relational database too uh store the information from the x. amount so 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact829	1628.92	1629.62	D	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	from the x. amount so you would have 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact830	1630.22	1632.22	D	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	x. m. l. basically would 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact831	1633.67	1634.33	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh you you could use 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact832	1634.33	1637.14	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	you you could use the x. m. l. to put the data in and then when you get it out 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact833	1637.25	1639.37	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	and then when you get it out you put it back in x. amount to use x. m. l. 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact834	1639.37	1642.08	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	transfer amount to use x. m. l. a sort of the the transfer format it but then you store 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact835	1640.39	1640.87	C	Grad	s^2	-1	0	transfer a sort of the the 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact836	1642.08	1644.4	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	it but then you store the data in the database which 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact837	1644.4	1648.63	D	PhD	s^e	+1	0	when things that alice which allows you to do all kinds of good search things in there 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact838	1645.44	1646.26	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	allows you to do all kinds of 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact839	1648.35	1653.59	C	Grad	s	+1	1	when things that alice is doing is they're trying to find anybody i which is independent of the back store in there 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact840	1649.49	1649.74	F	PhD	qy^bh	-1	0	is doing is they're trying 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact841	1654.99	1661.14	C	Grad	s^df	+1	1	so that uh you could define a single a. t. i. and uh the storage could be flat x. m. l. files or data base my opinion 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact842	1659.01	1659.4	D	PhD	b	-1	0	flat x. m. l. 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact843	1661.51	1674.88	C	Grad	s^ba	+1	0	my opinion on that is for this sort of stuff that we're doing i suspect it's overkill to do it for relational database that um just a flat file and uh search tools i bet will be enough 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact844	1668.62	1668.83	A	PhD	%	-1	0	um 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact845	1675.82	1685.48	C	Grad	s	-1	0	but that's the advantage of is that we actually take decide to go that route completely and we program to their a. p. i. then if we want to database later would be pretty easy 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact846	1680.53	1680.98	D	PhD	b	-1	0	completely and we 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact847	1682.84	1683.13	D	PhD	b	-1	0	p. i. then if we want to database 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact848	1688.09	1695.01	F	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	it seems like the kind of thing you do if i don't know if people start adding all kinds of bells and whistles to the date uh and so that might be 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact849	1695.23	1696.09	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and so that might be maybe good for us to 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact850	1696.09	1705.18	F	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	maybe good for us to know to use a format where we know we can easily input that to some database of other people are using 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact851	1703.99	1704.25	C	Grad	b	-1	0	that to some database of other people are using 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact852	1705.62	1706.21	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i guess i'm just 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact853	1706.55	1716.99	C	Grad	s^bd^na	+1	0	i guess i'm just a little hesitant to try to go whole hog on sort of uh the whole framework that that nist is talking about with that and the database and all that sort of stuff because 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact854	1707.47	1707.74	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	a little hesitant 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact855	1716.99	1719.97	C	Grad	s^df	+1	0	and all that sort of stuff because the big learning curve just to get going whereas 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact856	1718.66	1719.02	D	PhD	b	-1	0	just to get going whereas 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact857	1719.33	1719.69	A	PhD	b	-1	0	just to get going whereas 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact858	1719.97	1724.3	C	Grad	s^cs^df	-1	0	just to get going whereas if we just do a flat file format sure it may not be a sufficient but everyone 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact859	1724.3	1727.23	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	but everyone can programing parole and and use it 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact860	1727.25	1727.75	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	it 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact861	1729.16	1729.41	C	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	but this right so as opposed 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact863	1729.77	1730.33	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but this is i i'm still right so as opposed to 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact862	1729.41	1730.51	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	but this is i i'm still right so as opposed to 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact864	1730.49	1740.8	A	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	is i i'm still um not convinced that you can do much at all um the text on the flat file that that you know the text position to 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact865	1741.77	1742.05	A	PhD	%	-1	0	because the text 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact866	1742.05	1750.66	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because the text of inflation is going to be uh not reflecting the structure of your words of adaptation 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact867	1751.59	1752.39	A	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	it's just well it's not representing 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact868	1751.81	1754.41	C	Grad	qw^df^nd^rt	-1	0	it's just no well it's not representing it then how do you recover of course it's representing 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact869	1754.41	1755.58	C	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	no you you have to what of course it's representing it that's the whole 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact870	1754.91	1755.17	A	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	no you you have to what of course it's representing it that's the whole 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact871	1755.17	1756.02	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	you you have to what you have to do is it that's the whole point 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact873	1756.02	1758.09	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	you have to do is you have to basically yeah point 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact872	1755.58	1756.62	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	you you have to what you have to do is it that's the whole point 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact874	1758.77	1765.0	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	yeah you can use pro to read it in and construct a internal representations that is essentially lettuce 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact875	1766.57	1768.0	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but the and that okay well that was 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact878	1768.42	1768.83	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and that okay well that was 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact877	1768.41	1768.58	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	and that okay well that was 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact876	1768.07	1768.46	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and that okay well that was 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact879	1768.58	1769.73	C	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	and that okay well that was a different point right 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact882	1770.12	1770.56	A	PhD	b	-1	0	to what i was saying 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact880	1769.82	1770.08	C	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	a different point right to what i was saying 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact881	1770.08	1772.39	C	Grad	s^df.%-	-1	0	but that's what you to what i was saying that 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact883	1772.4	1773.56	A	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	but that's what you have to do that 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact885	1774.31	1774.72	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	parole if you want 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact884	1774.04	1775.76	C	Grad	s^df^ng	-1	0	parole if you want just to parole if you want 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact886	1775.76	1779.28	C	Grad	s^nd	+1	0	just to parole if you want to use the structured x. m. l. curry language that's a different thing and it's a set of tools 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact887	1779.28	1789.34	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	thing and it's a set of tools that let you specified given the d. d. t. kiki d. of the document um what sorts of structural searches you want to do 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact888	1790.38	1801.69	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	so you want to say that you know you're looking for um i tech within a tag within a particular tag that has this particular text in that and uh refers to a particular value 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact889	1803.03	1810.24	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	so the point isn't that and and user who was looking for corey like you specifies wouldn't programming in this language what you would do is 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact890	1810.24	1814.48	C	Grad	s^e	+1	1	what you would do is someone would build a tool that use that as a lifer 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact891	1816.36	1820.4	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	so that they too that you wouldn't have to construct the internal representations yourself 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact892	1819.11	1819.33	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	representations yourself 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact893	1822.37	1829.54	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i think the kinds of questions based in the next to the end of this year are there may be a lot of different ones but they'll have 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact894	1829.54	1830.92	F	PhD	s	-1	0	ones but they'll have a similar nature they'll 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact895	1830.92	1838.67	F	PhD	s	-1	0	a similar nature they'll be looking at either a word level preside ike uh and i value like a continuous 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact897	1839.06	1839.45	C	Grad	b	-1	0	valley like the slope 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact896	1838.67	1839.69	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	value like a continuous valley like the slope 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact898	1839.69	1841.11	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	valley like the slope of something but 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact899	1841.46	1841.7	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	but 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact900	1842.4	1851.48	F	PhD	s	-1	0	right know well do something we're re some kind of data reduction where the presided features are sort of either at the word level or at uh segment level or or something 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact901	1851.48	1851.77	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right level or or something 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact902	1851.48	1852.5	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	right level or or something like that they're not going to get the 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact903	1852.5	1859.43	F	PhD	s	-1	0	like that they're not going to get the phone level and i'm not going to be at the frame level when we get done with giving them simpler shapes and things 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact904	1860.3	1862.81	F	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	and so the main thing is just being able 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact905	1864.97	1866.25	F	PhD	s	+1	0	well i guess the two girls um one that chuck 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact906	1866.25	1874.02	F	PhD	s^df	+1	0	um one that chuck mention is starting out with something that we don't have to start over that we don't have to throw away if other people want to extend it for other kinds of questions and being able 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact907	1872.57	1872.84	C	Grad	b	-1	0	to extend it for 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact908	1874.34	1886.68	F	PhD	s^df	+1	0	and being able to at least get enough uh information out on where we condition the location of features on information that's in the kind of file that you put up there 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact909	1887.24	1888.4	F	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah i and that would that would do it i mean for 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact911	1888.83	1888.93	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah i do it i mean for 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact912	1888.93	1891.49	C	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah i think that there are quick and dirty solutions and then there do it i mean for me 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact910	1888.62	1889.45	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	yeah i think that there do it i mean for me 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact913	1891.49	1894.78	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and then there are long term big infrastructure solutions so 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact914	1894.78	1898.17	C	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	solutions so we want to try to pick something that let's just do a little bit of both in between right especially 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact915	1897.47	1898.18	F	PhD	s^2	-1	0	just do a little bit of both in between right especially 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact916	1898.18	1898.54	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right especially 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact917	1898.54	1901.2	F	PhD	s^df^na	-1	0	right right especially that the representation doesn't have to be thrown away even if your tools 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact918	1899.1	1899.53	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	that the representation 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact919	1901.3	1901.61	C	Grad	b	-1	0	right even if your tools 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact920	1901.36	1903.33	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	right and so even if your tools change 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact921	1903.82	1904.73	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and so it seems to me that mean i have 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact922	1904.73	1907.55	C	Grad	s	+1	2	it seems to me that mean i have to look at it again to see whether can really do what we want but 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact923	1908.01	1918.43	C	Grad	s	+1	0	if we use thee outlets external file representation it seems like it's rich enough that you could do quick tools just as i said in parole 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact925	1919.08	1925.1	C	Grad	s	+1	0	and then later on if we choose to go up the learning curve we can use the whole atlas and the infrastructure and that sounds good 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact924	1919.01	1919.4	F	PhD	b	-1	0	and then later on 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact926	1925.41	1926.6	F	PhD	s^na	-1	0	which has all that built and that sounds good to me i i 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact927	1926.21	1927.45	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	which has all that built in to me i i don't 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact928	1926.73	1927.35	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	which has all that built in to me i i don't 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact929	1928.07	1928.16	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	just if you 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact930	1928.16	1931.03	F	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	sure just if you look at that and let us know what you think i mean i think we're 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact931	1930.5	1930.69	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	sure know what you think 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact932	1931.09	1932.87	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	i mean i think we're sort of guinea pigs because 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact933	1932.87	1934.91	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	sort of guinea pigs because i i want to get the probably the work done but 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact934	1934.91	1938.44	F	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	the work done but i don't want to waste time you know getting the yeah 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact935	1936.57	1937.05	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	you know getting 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact936	1938.62	1938.8	F	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	the yeah 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact937	1939.31	1939.73	A	PhD	h	-1	0	well 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact938	1940.0	1945.14	C	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	i wouldn't wait for the formats because anything you pick will be able to translate to another form 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact939	1941.4	1941.7	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	because anything you 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact940	1945.85	1946.39	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	maybe you 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact942	1946.39	1952.84	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	maybe you should actually look at it yourself to to get a sense of what it feel he'll be dealing with because 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact941	1946.0	1946.41	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	maybe you 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact943	1952.84	1958.48	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	be dealing with because you know adam might have one opinion but you have another so yeah definitely 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact945	1958.48	1958.83	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	another so yeah definitely 
Bdb001.B.dialogueact944	1958.21	1958.54	B	Grad	b	-1	0	another so yeah definitely 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact946	1958.79	1959.54	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	another so yeah definitely 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact947	1960.63	1962.47	A	PhD	s^cs^df	-1	0	i think the more eyes looking this especially 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact948	1962.79	1969.42	F	PhD	s^na.%--	-1	0	especially if there's um you know if someone can help with at least uh the set up of the right 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact950	1970.53	1971.02	C	Grad	s	-1	0	oh hi 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact949	1970.37	1970.77	F	PhD	s	-1	0	oh hi 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact951	1971.73	1972.01	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact952	1974.62	1975.84	F	PhD	s^r	-1	0	the right representations then 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact953	1975.84	1977.66	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	then you know i hope it won't 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact954	1978.35	1981.73	F	PhD	s	-1	0	we don't actually need the whole full-blown thing to be 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact955	1980.44	1981.02	C	Grad	qy^t3.%--	-1	0	thing to be 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact956	1981.42	1981.7	C	Grad	s^ba^t3	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact957	1981.73	1982.09	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact958	1984.32	1984.88	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	um so 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact959	1984.88	1988.58	F	PhD	s^co.%--	-1	0	um so it maybe if you guys can look at and and sort of see what 
Bdb001.B.dialogueact961	1987.6	1987.88	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	at and and sort of see 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact960	1987.22	1987.38	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	at and and sort of see 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact962	1989.67	1990.1	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact963	1991.04	1993.16	F	PhD	s^tc.%--	-1	0	for about than i think we're we're so just yeah wrapping 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact964	1992.2	1992.89	C	Grad	s	-1	0	for about than so just 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact965	1993.16	1993.73	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah wrapping 
Bdb001.B.dialogueact967	1993.86	1994.0	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah wrapping up but um 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact966	1993.73	1994.36	F	PhD	s^na	-1	0	yeah wrapping up but um 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact968	1994.36	1994.57	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	up but um 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact969	1994.99	1995.28	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	up but um yeah so 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact970	1995.46	1995.82	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah so 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact971	1995.82	1997.39	F	PhD	s^fa|s^df	-1	0	yeah so it's a short meeting but um 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact972	1997.39	1998.34	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	meeting but um well 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact973	1998.93	1999.25	F	PhD	s^no	-1	0	well i don't know does anything 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact974	1999.25	2000.25	F	PhD	qo^rt^tc	-1	0	i don't know does anything else like 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact975	2000.36	2000.52	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	else like 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact976	2001.42	2002.35	F	PhD	s	-1	0	well i think yeah and that helps me that 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact977	2002.14	2006.01	C	Grad	h|s^cs	-1	0	well i think yeah i think we might want to look at is alternatives to be file i mean the reason i like that 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact978	2002.42	2002.59	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	well i think yeah that 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact979	2006.01	2008.62	C	Grad	s^df	+1	0	i mean the reason i like the files i'm already familiar with it we have expertise 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact980	2008.62	2009.84	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	with it we have expertise here 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact981	2010.41	2013.04	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and so we pick something else there's learning curve problem but i mean it is just 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact982	2013.37	2015.66	C	Grad	s^df	+1	2	but i mean it is just something we developed attic see 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact984	2016.31	2018.11	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	then it then i p. a. p. i. and so 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact983	2016.26	2016.73	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	then it then and so 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact985	2019.13	2019.33	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah disney 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact986	2019.7	2020.1	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah disney p. i for it and 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact987	2019.86	2020.79	C	Grad	s^na	+1	1	yeah disney p. i for it and 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact988	2020.79	2021.45	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	they p. i for it and uh 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact989	2022.0	2024.51	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	used to be a problem that they get too large and a bunch of library speed file utilities 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact990	2022.13	2024.0	C	Grad	s^na	+1	1	used to be a problem that they get too large and a bunch of library speed file utilities 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact991	2024.97	2029.71	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and so busy basically did the file system well that's going to be a problem no matter 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact992	2029.07	2030.43	C	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	well that's going to be a problem no matter what you have the two gigabyte 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact993	2030.43	2032.87	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	what you have the two gigabyte limit on the file system size 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact994	2033.14	2035.15	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and we definitely hit that was broadcast news 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact995	2036.72	2045.35	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	maybe you could extend a. t. i. to support uh like a splitting up you know because actually one file into smaller files on this so that you 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact996	2045.47	2049.85	A	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	so that you can essentially you know how arbitrary at all yep most of the tools can handle that 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact997	2047.5	2047.78	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	you yep 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact998	2048.51	2050.16	C	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	know how arbitrary at all most of the tools can handle that so that 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1000	2050.28	2050.48	A	PhD	b	-1	0	so that 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact999	2050.27	2050.69	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so that 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1001	2051.2	2052.45	C	Grad	s	-1	0	we enjoyed at the eight i level we did the 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1002	2052.45	2053.68	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i level we did the usual level that that 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1003	2053.68	2057.39	C	Grad	s	-1	0	usual level that that most many of them can you can specify several p. files and they'll just 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1004	2057.68	2059.01	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and they'll just be done sequentially

Bdb001.C.dialogueact1006	2060.25	2060.45	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1007	2062.08	2062.52	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so i guess yes if 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1008	2062.52	2062.76	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so i guess yes if 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1009	2062.76	2066.54	F	PhD	s^co	-1	0	sure maybe so i guess yes if you and don can you can join the peace i'll stuff and see so this would be 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1010	2065.99	2066.25	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	sure maybe the peace i'll stuff and see so this would be 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1011	2066.54	2068.2	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	maybe you do man he filed or apropos see so this would be like for that zero 
Bdb001.B.dialogueact1013	2067.05	2067.47	B	Grad	b	-1	0	you do man he filed like for that zero 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1012	2066.81	2070.2	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i used the peace i i think i've maybe you do man he filed or apropos p. file you'll see a lot see so this would be like for that zero 
Bdb001.B.dialogueact1014	2069.19	2070.87	B	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	i used the peace i i think i've p. file you'll see a lot 
Bdb001.B.dialogueact1015	2070.87	2076.03	B	Grad	s^bd	-1	0	the peace then fine i i think i've looked at it at least briefly i think we're doing something i have no idea

Bdb001.C.dialogueact1021	2084.02	2086.0	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	so it's all part of the quick that library has all these two of these were

Bdb001.C.dialogueact1038	2107.0	2110.2	C	Grad	s	-1	0	quit net library has a bunch of things in it to handle so it works pretty well 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1039	2109.57	2109.87	A	PhD	b	-1	0	in it to handle 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1040	2110.2	2111.07	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so it works pretty well

Bdb001.F.dialogueact1042	2112.25	2118.64	F	PhD	s	-1	0	to do i probably stands for and that isn't really i guess as important as the the main i don't know what you call the major word level

Bdb001.D.dialogueact1045	2120.96	2121.51	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	they'll come

Bdb001.F.dialogueact1050	2128.65	2128.97	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	okay well 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1051	2128.97	2130.21	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	okay well that's really useful i mean this is actually 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1052	2130.21	2133.47	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean this is actually the kind of thing that wanted to set out um

Bdb001.C.dialogueact1055	2136.19	2138.87	C	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah they need to look at the dallas stuff again anyway so 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1056	2136.62	2137.08	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	yeah they need to look at the dallas stuff 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1057	2139.06	2140.11	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	keep i guess it's also sort 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1058	2139.16	2139.48	F	PhD	b	-1	0	keep 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1059	2140.25	2142.45	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i guess it's also sort of a political decision i mean if 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1060	2142.45	2150.86	F	PhD	s^na	-1	0	i yeah i think it analyze decision i mean if if you feel like that's a community that would be good to tie into anyway then sounds like it's worth doing 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1061	2149.92	2150.68	C	Grad	s^bk|s.%-	-1	0	i yeah i think it analyze sounds like it's worth doing 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1062	2150.61	2151.4	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	i think that i think it analyze i said i what it's worth doing 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1063	2151.03	2154.79	C	Grad	s	-1	0	think that i said i what i did with this stuff i based that on there's it's just 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1064	2154.79	2157.5	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	on there's it's just a hadn't actually come up with an extra format yet 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1065	2158.13	2162.99	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	so now that they have come up with a format doesn't it seems pretty reasonable to use it 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1066	2161.12	2161.79	A	PhD	b	-1	0	it seems pretty reasonable 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1067	2163.96	2165.05	C	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	but let me look at it again i said okay great 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1068	2164.91	2165.21	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	let me look at it again i said okay great 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1069	2165.2	2165.72	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	i said great 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1070	2165.74	2166.69	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i said that great because we actually can 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1071	2166.27	2167.54	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	that there's one level there's because we actually can start 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1072	2167.09	2169.13	C	Grad	s	-1	0	there's one level there's one more level of in direction i'm just blanking start 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1073	2169.13	2171.63	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i'm just blanking on exactly how it works 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1074	2172.11	2173.24	C	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	i got a look at it again 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1075	2174.88	2178.59	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	and we can start with um i guess this input from days which 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1076	2178.93	2181.87	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	from days which you had printed out the channel eyes it because 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1077	2181.87	2184.27	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	it because he has all of the uh channels you know with the channels 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1078	2184.46	2186.66	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	yeah i've seen it you know with the channels in the tag and stuff like that so that 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1079	2185.28	2185.91	C	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	yeah i've seen it in the tag 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1080	2186.66	2188.55	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yep and stuff like that so that would be directly 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1081	2189.03	2189.21	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	easy 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1083	2189.71	2190.66	C	Grad	s^2	-1	0	easy the map yeah and so 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1082	2189.33	2189.68	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	easy 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1084	2190.34	2190.79	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	the map yeah and so

Bdb001.F.dialogueact1087	2200.78	2203.21	F	PhD	s^no.%--	-1	0	from um well right now like jane would would 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1088	2202.49	2202.79	C	Grad	b	-1	0	would

Bdb001.F.dialogueact1093	2213.13	2214.77	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	you know anything you can envision 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1094	2214.05	2214.31	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	you can envision 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1095	2215.07	2219.91	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so what i was imagining was it um today says we can have unlimited numbers of green ribbons 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1096	2220.42	2223.9	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and so put uh i green ribbon on for overlap code 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1097	2224.29	2226.05	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and we we i i 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1098	2226.76	2230.72	E	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	i i think it's important to remain flexible regarding the time bins right now 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1099	2231.3	2233.17	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and so it's nice to have however 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1100	2233.64	2239.49	E	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	however you know you want to have it the uh time time uh located in the course so 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1101	2240.01	2240.36	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	um 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1102	2240.77	2241.16	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	um if we 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1103	2241.66	2248.48	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	if we if we tightly overlap code to the first word any overlap and you'll have it i marking it won't it'll 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1104	2248.66	2250.74	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	marking it won't it'll be independent at the time bins however 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1105	2250.87	2253.62	E	Postdoc	s^e	+1	0	bins however these befalls drinker whatever increase 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1106	2253.72	2254.16	E	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	whatever increase or also 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1107	2254.16	2254.32	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	or also 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1108	2254.73	2257.09	E	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	or also you could have different ideas for different purposes and having a 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1109	2257.49	2264.09	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and having a tighter the first word in overlap segment is unique you know anchored 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1110	2265.08	2266.83	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and they would put up on a separate ridden 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1112	2267.59	2267.86	C	Grad	b	-1	0	so they are not 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1111	2267.41	2269.56	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so they are not going to be with respect that

Bdb001.E.dialogueact1137	2301.53	2304.36	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	then you can indicate that here was perhaps it's back back to where you can say that

Bdb001.E.dialogueact1140	2309.27	2315.76	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but the fact is you have a time to act in a way it's independent of the uh other time then that the word ends up in 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1141	2316.13	2318.14	E	Postdoc	s^e.%--	-1	0	if it's a large unit or a small unit or we could change

Bdb001.E.dialogueact1143	2318.42	2320.08	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	we could change the boundaries of the units so unique 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1145	2320.53	2323.51	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so unique and and uh this was before that

Bdb001.A.dialogueact1151	2335.91	2349.22	A	PhD	s	+1	0	of discussion but when it comes to adaptations you often find yourself in the situation where you have different adaptations off the same they were taking

Bdb001.A.dialogueact1155	2351.09	2356.69	A	PhD	s	+1	1	and sometimes the word sequences even differs slightly because they were it's it's one place but but the other 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1154	2351.03	2351.21	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	and sometimes the word sequences 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1156	2357.21	2371.29	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so what's the state it gets out there some people might start and a taping this for you know topics or what the heck you know this 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1157	2371.29	2371.65	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	you know this

Bdb001.A.dialogueact1159	2374.92	2383.42	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and they only thing that is really sort of common among all desires and the various versions of this data is the what's the or

Bdb001.A.dialogueact1164	2387.01	2392.64	A	PhD	s^ng	+1	1	see if you hadn't a dialogue x. you don't necessarily want to our topics you don't really want to be dealing with time huge 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1165	2387.27	2387.48	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	see if you hadn't 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1166	2392.74	2396.03	A	PhD	s^df|qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	with time huge it's much more efficient for them to just see the what secrets right

Bdb001.A.dialogueact1168	2397.4	2403.78	A	PhD	s^bd^df	-1	0	i mean most people aren't as sophisticated as as we are here with you know time alignments and stuff so

Bdb001.A.dialogueact1175	2412.54	2419.58	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but my point is that you're going to end up with uh what sequences that are differently annotated and 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1176	2419.58	2430.04	A	PhD	s	+1	0	and you want some school uh that is able to this merged these different adaptations back into a single uh version

Bdb001.A.dialogueact1180	2444.76	2445.09	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	i don't well all the switchboard

Bdb001.A.dialogueact1185	2451.07	2460.01	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because we had one set of and the patients that were based on one version of the transcript with a particular segment asian and then we had another

Bdb001.A.dialogueact1187	2468.21	2476.2	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so we had these two different versions which where you know you could tell they were from the same source but they weren't identical said was extremely hard 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1188	2476.2	2483.27	A	PhD	s	-1	0	said was extremely hard to reliably merged these two back together to car like information from the different notation yep i i don't

Bdb001.A.dialogueact1206	2516.93	2523.03	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	that um but operating on the these is that i really what's behind this uh this adaptation from yep there's you could 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1207	2522.36	2522.63	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	adaptation from yep

Bdb001.A.dialogueact1219	2546.73	2547.33	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	exactly mean by her h. and that's but the one thing 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1221	2547.79	2548.82	C	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	and that's very difficult but the one thing that would work here actually 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1220	2547.39	2556.38	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	and that's very difficult but the one thing that would work here actually for it that is more reliable than the other and says is uh the speakers ons and offs if you have a good 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1222	2556.38	2557.28	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	if you have a good 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1224	2558.41	2561.67	C	Grad	s^na.%-	-1	0	this is exactly what i mean is that that the problem it you just have to know it what to tie 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1223	2557.93	2558.28	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	this is exactly 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1225	2559.16	2559.57	F	PhD	b	-1	0	what i mean is that that 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1226	2560.71	2562.65	F	PhD	s	-1	0	the problem it yeah exactly you just have to know it what to tie it too 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1227	2562.56	2562.8	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah exactly it too 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1228	2562.8	2563.29	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah exactly the problem is saying it too and 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1229	2563.29	2565.74	C	Grad	s:qw	-1	0	the problem is saying are the semantics what do you mean and 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1230	2563.48	2563.97	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	the problem is saying and 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1231	2565.74	2567.13	C	Grad	s:qw	-1	0	so semantics what do you mean by merge right right 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1232	2566.23	2567.09	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	so by merge right right 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1233	2566.74	2567.05	A	PhD	b	-1	0	so by merge right right 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1235	2567.88	2574.74	A	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	so so just to let you know every we week foods said by uh doing uh by doing 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1234	2567.74	2568.04	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	so so just to let you know 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1236	2575.3	2576.49	A	PhD	s	-1	0	both were based on words so but 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1237	2576.49	2582.68	A	PhD	s	-1	0	words so but we had two versions of the same words interest you know sprinkles with with different tax presentations and then you did did 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1238	2582.02	2582.82	C	Grad	s	-1	0	then you did did 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1239	2583.13	2583.98	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and we did death exactly yep 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1241	2583.98	2584.58	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and we did death exactly yep that's just what i thought

Bdb001.C.dialogueact1242	2584.11	2585.1	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and that's how that's just what i thought it's just how 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1243	2585.15	2586.14	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and that's how yeah it's just how i would

Bdb001.A.dialogueact1245	2586.67	2587.06	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah but you i would 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1246	2587.56	2589.19	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but you know it had lots of terrorists and things would 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1247	2589.24	2591.72	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and things would end up in the wrong order and so forth uh 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1248	2591.92	2592.25	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and so forth uh so 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1249	2592.32	2592.7	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1251	2593.27	2595.02	A	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	um if you had a more uh 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1250	2592.91	2593.18	C	Grad	b	-1	0	so um if 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1252	2595.71	2596.42	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh it it was 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1253	2596.62	2597.51	A	PhD	s	-1	0	it it was a kluge because it was 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1254	2597.51	2602.26	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	a kluge because it was basically reducing everything till uh two uh two textural alignment text rule

Bdb001.A.dialogueact1256	2602.97	2603.49	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	but 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1257	2603.49	2604.07	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	but that it's not something 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1258	2603.88	2604.06	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	but that it's not something 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1259	2604.06	2619.45	F	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	that it's not something where whoever if if the people who are making changes in the transcripts because it's all happened when the transcripts were different it um if they tie it to something like if they try to take who's excitement if they you 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1260	2619.97	2620.66	F	PhD	qy^d^f^rt	-1	0	if they you know what i mean that 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1261	2620.73	2624.89	F	PhD	s	-1	0	know what i mean that it was they tied it to an acoustic segment and we had the time or that would help but 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1263	2625.15	2625.39	C	Grad	b	-1	0	the problem is is exactly 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1262	2624.89	2632.12	F	PhD	s	-1	0	or that would help but the problem is is exactly is adam said that you get you know you you don't have that information or it's lost in them or somehow 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1265	2632.7	2633.54	E	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	question it seems 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1264	2632.24	2632.38	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1266	2633.54	2641.25	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	question it seems to me that um we will have unofficial versions of corpus which will be only one one version in terms of the words brother was a concern with other emerging 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1267	2641.3	2645.0	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and you're going to get with other emerging issue maybe if coding were done independently of the 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1268	2645.44	2646.35	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and you're going to get that because it's 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1269	2645.62	2646.49	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and you're going to get that because it's 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1270	2646.35	2650.53	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	that because it's the day i guess out people will do all kinds of things to it 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1271	2651.31	2662.24	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and uh you know several years from now you might want to look into the probably the um referring expression and someone 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1272	2662.44	2668.2	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and someone at the university off who knows where has annotated the referring expressions so you want to get right 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1274	2668.42	2672.5	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so you want to get that adaptation and bring it back in line with your data right but unfortunately 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1273	2668.39	2668.67	C	Grad	b	-1	0	so you want to get right 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1276	2673.04	2673.76	A	PhD	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	okay they've also 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1275	2672.72	2675.4	C	Grad	s	-1	0	data okay but unfortunately they've also and edited it but they've all the exactly and so that's 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1277	2673.08	2673.62	E	Postdoc	%	-1	0	okay they've also 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1278	2674.27	2674.88	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and edited but they've all the exactly 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1279	2674.88	2675.41	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and edited it but they've all the exactly and so that's 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1280	2675.41	2686.05	F	PhD	s	-1	0	it what's what's wrong with doing times and so that's it exactly what we should somehow when you just data say that you know that have some way of knowing how to merge it back in and asking people to try to do that 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1281	2675.96	2676.23	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	it and so that's it exactly what we should

Bdb001.C.dialogueact1303	2700.53	2705.96	C	Grad	s	-1	0	is a good one imagine that this person who developed the corpus of the referring expressions didn't include time 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1304	2704.64	2705.09	A	PhD	b	-1	0	didn't include time 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1305	2706.21	2706.48	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	he included

Bdb001.E.dialogueact1308	2708.51	2708.79	E	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	he said well then 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1311	2710.99	2711.51	A	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	or she is when when it happened foresee but then 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1313	2711.93	2712.29	C	Grad	s^m^na	-1	0	she it happened foresee but then you just indirectly but still they 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1312	2711.57	2715.22	E	Postdoc	qy	-1	0	she it happened foresee sure but what if what if they changed but then you just indirectly figure out the time but still they exactly yeah 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1314	2712.2	2713.01	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	you just indirectly figure out the time but still they exactly 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1315	2713.76	2714.42	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	sure but what figure out the time exactly yeah 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1316	2714.42	2714.79	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	sure but what yeah 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1318	2714.85	2716.58	C	Grad	qw^ng^rt	-1	0	sure but what if what if they changed the words that yeah 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1317	2714.42	2714.77	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	sure but what yeah 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1319	2716.76	2716.96	E	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	the words that 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1320	2717.05	2717.29	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	well but you have 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1321	2717.52	2719.58	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	well but you have some anchoring point you couldn't change 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1322	2719.58	2720.68	E	Postdoc	s^ng	-1	0	but can they change point you couldn't change all the work 
Bdb001.D.dialogueact1323	2720.47	2722.98	D	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	sure it's addictive too but can they change the words without changing the time of the word all the work 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1324	2721.22	2721.56	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	sure it's addictive too the words without changing 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1325	2721.56	2722.48	C	Grad	s^arp	-1	0	sure it's addictive too the words without changing the time of the word 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1326	2723.96	2730.07	C	Grad	s	-1	0	but the point is that that they made annotated off word transcript that isn't the same as our word transcript so how do you merge it back 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1327	2730.07	2731.24	C	Grad	qw	-1	0	so how do you merge it back and i understand what you're saying 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1328	2731.24	2732.25	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and i understand what you're saying and i 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1329	2731.84	2731.95	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and i understand what you're saying 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1330	2731.95	2732.7	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and i understand what you're saying and i 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1331	2732.78	2737.77	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and i i guess the answer is um it's going to be different every time 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1332	2738.27	2739.46	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	it's sick it's just going to be you only 
Bdb001.E.dialogueact1334	2738.68	2738.74	E	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	it's sick it's just going 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1333	2738.33	2738.74	F	PhD	b	-1	0	it's sick it's just going 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1336	2740.29	2742.06	C	Grad	s	-1	0	it's exactly what i said before which is that what know the boundaries of uh 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1335	2739.8	2741.4	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	to be it's exactly what i said before you only know the boundaries of uh 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1337	2742.06	2744.26	C	Grad	s	-1	0	which is that what you mean by emerge so in this 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1338	2744.48	2748.95	C	Grad	qw	-1	0	so in this case where you have the words and you don't have the times well what do you mean by merge 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1340	2749.18	2751.64	C	Grad	s	-1	0	you tell me what you mean i can write a program to do it right you can 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1339	2749.14	2749.35	F	PhD	b	-1	0	you tell me what you mean 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1341	2751.5	2751.73	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	to do it right you can 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1342	2751.73	2755.76	F	PhD	s	-1	0	to do it right right you can merge at the level of the representation that the other person preserved and that's it 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1343	2755.5	2755.78	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right and that's it 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1344	2755.78	2757.32	C	Grad	s	-1	0	right and that's about all you can do and that's it and beyond that all you know is is relative 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1345	2756.11	2758.79	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and that's about all you can do and beyond that all you know is is relative ordering and sometimes 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1346	2758.79	2760.12	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so so and it's ordering and sometimes even that is wrong 
Bdb001.C.dialogueact1347	2760.35	2765.19	C	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	so so and it's so and this one you would have to do a best match between the word sequences extracted 
Bdb001.F.dialogueact1348	2761.08	2761.37	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	so and this one you would have 
Bdb001.A.dialogueact1349	2765.41	2765.7	A	PhD	b	-1	0	extracted
