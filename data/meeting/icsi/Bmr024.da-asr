Bmr024.F.dialogueact45	110.062	112.252	F	Grad	s^t	-1	0	if there's time i want to talk about they just but look like we were pretty 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact46	112.252	114.672	F	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	just but look like we were pretty full so i can wait till next week

Bmr024.D.dialogueact48	117.428	117.688	D	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr024.D.dialogueact49	119.449	119.999	D	Professor	fg|s^t1	-1	0	well let's see 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact50	120.356	127.291	D	Professor	s^co	-1	0	i think the that it's certainly i think there's a recognition we want to maybe focus eminent andrea sincere since i was tickling his and also the smoke them 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact51	126.539	129.145	E	PhD	s^2^cs.%--	-1	0	his smart i'm also and also the smoke them 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact52	128.362	130.854	D	Professor	s^bk^t1	-1	0	smart i'm also and grass 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact53	131.369	135.012	D	Professor	s	-1	0	absence i think also he should've have been involved in one of those things yeah at least it it'd probably 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact54	134.478	134.788	F	Grad	%-	-1	0	in one of those things at least 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact56	135.012	135.272	D	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah it it'd probably 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact55	134.978	135.058	F	Grad	b	-1	0	in one of those things yeah at least it it'd probably 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact57	135.458	136.878	F	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah it it'd probably be interested 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact59	137.117	137.377	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	but 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact58	137.073	137.243	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	but 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact60	138.231	138.781	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	um 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact61	139.631	141.921	D	Professor	fg|s^na	-1	0	so i mean i think they'll be inches be interested in all this but 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact62	141.921	152.836	D	Professor	qy^cs^d^rt	+1	2	interested in all this but but uh probably if we had to pick something that we would talk on for ten minutes or so while they're coming here i guess would be we were going to station status or 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact63	152.836	153.236	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	status or yeah 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact64	153.997	154.147	F	Grad	fg	-1	0	yeah i mean i think truck 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact65	154.147	157.098	F	Grad	s	+1	2	i mean i think truck was the one who has at the age and i'm going to really have anything to say 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact66	157.098	159.338	F	Grad	s	+1	2	well i mean going to really have anything to say of and we still haven't done it so 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact68	159.665	162.371	B	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	well i mean i just basically that done it so 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact67	159.534	159.794	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	well i mean done it so 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact69	163.315	166.505	B	PhD	s	-1	0	maybe i said new we said this before just that we met and we talked about it and 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact70	166.505	170.168	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and and about it and we sort of have a plan for getting things organized and 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact71	170.168	170.308	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	and and and 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact72	170.671	179.067	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and and i think a crucial part of that is the idea of of not wanting to do it until right before the next level zero backups so that there won't be huge number of and 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact73	177.411	177.751	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	huge number of 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact74	179.297	179.347	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr024.F.dialogueact75	179.764	179.984	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr024.B.dialogueact76	181.38	182.23	B	PhD	s	-1	0	that that was basically and uh although day basically 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact77	182.23	182.64	B	PhD	s.%	-1	0	and uh although day basically 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact78	182.422	187.929	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and uh although day basically said that if we want to do it just tell him and he'll do it level zero then 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact79	183.048	183.328	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	said 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact80	185.738	185.958	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	to do it just tell 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact81	188.191	188.991	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	oh excellent 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact82	188.81	189.13	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	oh excellent so good oh so maybe we should 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact84	189.344	190.104	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	so good oh so maybe we should just go ahead and get everything 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact83	189.218	191.508	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	so good oh so maybe we should just go ahead and get everything ready and yep 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact85	191.508	191.638	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	ready and yep 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact86	191.843	192.023	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	ready and yep so 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact87	192.935	194.775	F	Grad	s^t.%-	-1	0	so i think we do need to talk a little bit about 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact88	195.107	196.607	F	Grad	s	-1	0	well we don't do during this meeting we have a little 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact90	196.864	197.004	B	PhD	b	-1	0	this meeting we have a little more to discuss 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact89	196.607	197.937	F	Grad	s^t	-1	0	this meeting we have a little more to discuss 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact91	198.189	200.64	F	Grad	s	-1	0	but uh we're we're basically ready to do it 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact92	203.123	206.665	F	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and uh i have some web pages on more of the background 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact93	207.39	211.46	F	Grad	s	+1	2	so naming conventions and things like that and i've been trying to keep actually up-to-date uh 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact94	211.71	211.85	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact95	212.83	215.51	F	Grad	s	+1	2	uh and i've been trying with you do you w. folks also 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact96	218.407	219.137	A	Postdoc	qw^bu^d^fa^rt	-1	0	i'm sorry and what showing them sharing sharing 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact98	219.137	219.667	A	Postdoc	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	showing them sharing sharing 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact97	218.682	218.792	D	Professor	b.%	-1	0	i'm sorry and what 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact100	219.667	220.367	A	Postdoc	s^m	-1	0	showing them sharing them okay sharing them with you w. 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact99	219.523	221.573	F	Grad	s^bc^ng	-1	0	showing them sharing them okay sharing them with you w. folks 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact101	220.507	220.787	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	them okay them with you w. 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact102	221.416	221.506	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	folks 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact103	223.769	224.169	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr024.D.dialogueact104	224.736	229.438	D	Professor	s^cs^t^tc	+1	2	and so desperate for one maybe we should talk about the i've been transcription status someone can 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact105	229.438	231.701	D	Professor	s^co	-1	0	someone can films and wrestling okay 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact107	232.061	232.381	D	Professor	b	-1	0	so we uh 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact106	232.034	232.264	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	so we uh 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact108	232.264	239.213	F	Grad	s	+1	2	so we uh we did another version of the beats where we separated each beats with uh spoken digit chuck came 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact109	239.529	242.809	F	Grad	s	+1	1	chuck came up here and recorded some it himself speaking some digits 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact110	243.253	246.497	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and so it just goes beep one beat and then the phrase and then deep 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact111	246.497	248.507	F	Grad	s	-1	0	phrase and then deep too beaten in the phrase and 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact112	248.945	250.045	F	Grad	s	-1	0	phrase and that seems pretty good um i think 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact113	250.233	254.354	F	Grad	fh|s	+1	0	yeah but some um i think they'll have an easier time keeping track of where they are in the file 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact114	254.723	257.558	E	PhD	s	+1	1	yeah but some of them do automatic the conditions and we did with the automatic 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact115	257.063	258.793	F	Grad	s^m	-1	0	conditions and we did with the automatic segment asian and i don't 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact116	258.793	261.153	F	Grad	s	-1	0	segment asian and i don't think we need we look at it in detail we just ended i 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact117	261.334	262.434	F	Grad	s	+1	1	we just ended i b. m. we we sort of spot 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact118	262.434	263.794	F	Grad	s	-1	0	i b. m. we we sort of spot check that 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact119	264.057	269.026	B	PhD	s	-1	0	listen to probably uh five or ten minutes of it from the beginning oh really okay 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact120	264.069	264.179	E	PhD	b.%	-1	0	listen to probably 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact121	269.25	269.62	F	Grad	qy^bh	-1	0	oh really okay 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact123	269.816	270.056	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	oh really okay i sort of spot 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact122	269.81	270.08	F	Grad	fg	-1	0	oh really okay i sort of spot 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact124	270.365	270.735	B	PhD	fg	-1	0	i sort of spot 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact125	270.433	272.913	F	Grad	s	-1	0	i sort of spot check here and there and it sounded pretty good 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact126	273.783	276.113	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so i think it'll work 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact127	275.115	275.425	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	i think it'll work 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact128	277.813	280.402	F	Grad	fh|s^cs	-1	0	and uh we'll just have to see what we get back from them uh 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact129	280.848	281.218	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	the main thing would from them uh 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact130	281.403	286.574	B	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	the main thing would be if we can align what they give us with what we sent them 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact131	287.233	289.089	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and that's the crucial part and right 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact132	289.353	289.623	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	and right 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact133	289.987	294.095	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and i think we'll be able to do that with this new beeped format right yep 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact134	294.118	294.338	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yep 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact135	295.907	300.21	F	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	well i think it's also they are much less likely to do have errors 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact136	300.374	300.714	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr024.F.dialogueact137	301.01	308.058	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so the time it was last time is that there were errors in the transcripts where they put beeps where there weren't any hour and they put in extraneous beeps and 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact138	305.755	306.035	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	weren't any hour and they put in extraneous 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact139	308.291	308.541	B	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact140	308.843	310.693	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and with the numbers there it's much less likely 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact141	311.623	314.22	B	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	yeah one interesting note is uh a problem i don't know if this is just 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact142	314.22	319.596	B	PhD	s	-1	0	i don't know if this is just because of how i play back i say uh as cindy playing in the file every 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact143	319.921	323.711	B	PhD	s	-1	0	in the file every once in a while uh like a beep sounds like it's cut into two beats yeah it's a two pieces

Bmr024.B.dialogueact156	332.849	333.249	B	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah but i didn't hear that 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact157	333.88	339.72	B	PhD	s	-1	0	but with this new format um that hopefully they're not hearing that and if they are it shouldn't throw them 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact158	338.578	338.748	E	PhD	b	-1	0	that and if they are it shouldn't 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact159	340.91	341.27	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	well maybe 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact160	341.863	343.173	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	well maybe they're listen to it again make sure but 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact161	343.173	343.673	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	make sure but 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact162	343.673	346.552	F	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah that's what i thought make sure but certainly the software shouldn't do that so 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact163	346.265	346.535	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah that's what i thought that so 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact164	346.535	347.145	B	PhD	s^na	-1	0	yeah that's what i thought i it's probably just that so

Bmr024.F.dialogueact195	376.312	377.932	F	Grad	s	-1	0	that so we they are transcribing the digits 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact197	378.069	378.159	A	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	we can or we could tell 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact199	378.515	380.755	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	we can we can ignore it when we get it back or we could tell them we could tell them 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact198	378.29	385.101	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	we can we can ignore it when we get it back or we could tell them we could tell them if you hear someone reading a digit string just say a digit bracket and don't bother actually 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact200	380.815	380.925	B	PhD	b	-1	0	we get it back we could tell them 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact201	385.101	388.656	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	that yeah and don't bother actually computing that it writing down the digits 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact202	387.783	388.063	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	that yeah that it writing down the digits 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact203	389.0	389.4	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	the great that be what i'm having 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact204	389.4	393.079	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	the great that be what i'm having the transcript sure do because it can be extracted yeah and then 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact205	393.284	393.484	F	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah and then 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact206	393.76	398.446	F	Grad	s^t	-1	0	yeah and then i wanted to talk about but as i said i we may not have time what we should do about they just we have a whole pilot

Bmr024.F.dialogueact227	430.987	432.297	F	Grad	s	-1	0	actually i of digits if we want to move on to digits 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact228	432.38	435.2	D	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	actually i when when they're they're more related anything transcription so that see i've been 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact229	435.2	436.36	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so that see i've been stuff we got that sorted 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact230	436.36	437.25	D	Professor	s	-1	0	stuff we got that sorted out i'm how're doing 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact231	437.49	439.18	D	Professor	fh|qw	-1	0	we're doing well out i'm how're doing on the on the rest of the 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact232	439.443	440.033	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	we're doing well i i hire i've hired of the 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact233	440.033	444.043	A	Postdoc	s	+1	2	i i hire i've hired two extra people already expected hire two more and um 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact234	440.389	440.449	F	Grad	b.%	-1	0	i i hire i've hired 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact235	444.57	450.085	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and um i've prepared um a set of five which i'm which i'm calling set to which are now 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact236	450.586	455.01	A	Postdoc	s	+1	2	which are now being attitude by my head transcriber in terms of spelling errors and all that she's also checking through 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact237	455.01	460.787	A	Postdoc	s	+1	2	also checking through and my and and monitoring um be transcription of another transcriber you 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact238	461.061	463.011	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	know i mean she's going through doing these kinds of checks and i've 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact239	461.216	461.456	D	Professor	b	-1	0	know i mean she's going through 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact240	463.54	465.9	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and i've moved on now too i'm calling set three i sort 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact241	465.9	472.86	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	i'm calling set three i sort of thought if i do it set some groups of five then i can have like sort of a uh parallel processing through through the current 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact242	470.372	470.662	D	Professor	b	-1	0	uh parallel processing 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact243	473.203	481.438	A	Postdoc	s	+1	2	and and you indicated to me that we have a a goal now for it for the um be uh dark the demo of twenty hours so 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact244	481.805	489.323	A	Postdoc	s	+1	2	hours so i'm going to go up to twenty hours be should everything is processed and released and and that's that's what my goal is package twenty 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact245	489.493	492.827	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	goal is package twenty hours right now and once that's done move on to the next 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact246	493.282	493.802	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah um 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact247	494.124	494.704	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	so twenty hours but i guess 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact248	494.704	506.687	D	Professor	s	+1	2	so twenty hours but i guess the other thing is that um that's that's kind of twenty hours a sad because the longer before the demo we actually have twenty hours more time to be for people to actually do cool things with it 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact249	506.674	506.814	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	cool things with it 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact251	507.106	507.356	A	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	good i'm i'm hiring people 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact252	507.52	509.707	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	good i'm i'm hiring people who uh really are they would 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact250	507.104	508.898	D	Professor	b	-1	0	good i'm i'm hiring people who uh 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact253	509.886	511.906	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	really are they would like to do it full time several these people 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact255	512.392	519.609	A	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	and and i don't think it's possible really to do this full time but that would shows is motivation to do as many hours as possible director crackers yeah yeah 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact254	512.244	512.564	D	Professor	b	-1	0	and and 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact256	517.538	518.638	F	Grad	s	-1	0	is motivation to do as many hours director crackers yeah yeah 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact257	518.855	519.025	F	Grad	b	-1	0	to do as many hours as possible yeah yeah 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact258	519.542	519.822	D	Professor	b	-1	0	as possible 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact260	520.584	521.544	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and they're really excellent 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact259	520.439	520.649	D	Professor	b	-1	0	and they're really 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact261	520.865	521.285	D	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	and they're really excellent 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact262	521.924	522.124	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	excellent got i mean i guess 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact264	523.028	523.988	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	a good core group yeah the 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact263	522.718	536.289	D	Professor	fg|qy^d^rt	+1	4	got a good core group yeah i mean i guess the so the difference if if um if the idea and stuff works out the difference in the job would be that they primarily would be checking through things that were already done by someone else is the most unpleasant and correcting 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact265	527.694	527.904	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	stuff works out 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact266	533.423	533.563	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	that were 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact267	536.289	537.239	D	Professor	qy^rt.%-	-1	0	is the most unpleasant and correcting and correcting correcting 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact268	536.44	537.13	F	Grad	s^2	-1	0	is the most unpleasant and correcting and correcting correcting 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact269	537.389	538.169	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	and correcting correcting oil will expect 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact270	537.79	538.16	F	Grad	s^r	-1	0	and correcting correcting oil will expect 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact271	538.16	542.14	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and you know i've oil will expect that they'll have to move sometime bins and do some corrections 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact272	542.548	544.328	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and you know i've also the uh discovered so with the new 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact273	544.57	546.06	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	so with the new transcriber and um so 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact274	546.534	546.844	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	um so 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact275	547.011	547.171	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	i may say 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact276	547.591	548.98	A	Postdoc	fh|s.%--	-1	0	i may say that my 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact277	549.226	549.446	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact278	550.856	551.819	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact279	552.407	556.777	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	at present um people have been doing these transcription a channel at a time and 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact280	556.907	559.817	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	at a time and that sort of um is useful and you 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact281	559.817	563.187	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	useful and you know and then once in a while they'll have to refer to the other channels square something up okay well 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact282	563.779	563.989	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	up okay well 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact283	563.989	568.511	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	up okay well i realize that um we were using the preset rented version and 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact284	568.946	572.882	A	Postdoc	fh|s	+1	1	version and um the pre segmented version is extremely useful 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact285	573.191	577.452	A	Postdoc	qy^cs	+1	1	and wouldn't it be useful also to have the visual representation of those segments and 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact286	577.882	591.048	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and so i've uh i i i trained the new one the new the newest one to um use the visual from the channel that is going to be transcribed at any given time and it's just 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact287	591.47	593.04	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and it's just amazingly helpful because what happens 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact288	593.339	598.919	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	because what happens then is you scan across the signaled once in a while you'll find a blip that didn't show up in the pre segment patient oh 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact289	598.792	599.262	F	Grad	b	-1	0	pre segment patient and that'll be something oh i see you mean 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact291	599.442	602.043	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and that'll be something like it's it it's interesting once in a while to back i see you mean a back channel or 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact290	599.262	599.872	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	and that'll be something i see you mean 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact292	601.639	602.499	F	Grad	s^2.%-	-1	0	it it's interesting once in a while to back a back channel or 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact293	602.365	603.535	A	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	once in a while to back channel sometimes or 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact294	602.931	603.101	E	PhD	b	-1	0	once in a while to back channel sometimes or 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact295	603.625	607.317	A	Postdoc	s^rt	-1	0	channel sometimes it seems to be um similar to the ones you're being picked up and 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact296	607.415	607.735	F	Grad	b	-1	0	up and 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact297	607.969	611.169	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	up and they're rare events but you can really go through a meeting very quickly just you just 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact298	611.169	615.912	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	just you just you know east you scroll from screen to screen looking for blips 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact299	616.5	619.81	A	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and i think that we're going to end up with uh better coverage of the back channels 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact300	616.757	617.007	D	Professor	b	-1	0	and i think that we're going to end up with uh 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact301	620.119	622.959	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	but the same time we're benefiting tremendously for the precipitation because 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact302	622.959	627.604	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	the precipitation because there are huge places where there's just absolutely no activity at all 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact304	628.184	629.944	A	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	and uh the idea qualities so good so they can they 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact303	627.833	628.253	D	Professor	b	-1	0	at all and uh the idea 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact305	629.348	632.622	B	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	qualities so good yeah so they can they can um scrolling through that pretty quick 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact306	632.881	633.121	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yeah uhhuh yeah pretty quick that's great 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact307	633.295	633.505	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	uhhuh yeah that's great 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact308	633.355	633.875	B	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	uhhuh yeah that's great 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact309	634.015	634.255	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr024.A.dialogueact310	635.41	640.321	A	Postdoc	fg|s	-1	0	so i think that that's going to also you know the c. d. efficiency of this part of the process 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact311	643.123	643.213	D	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr024.D.dialogueact312	643.383	643.653	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr024.D.dialogueact313	645.544	646.464	D	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr024.D.dialogueact314	648.801	650.031	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	so uh yes 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact315	650.804	650.994	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	yes 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact316	650.994	652.724	D	Professor	s^co^t^tc	-1	0	yes let's talk about digits in that area 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact317	653.138	657.004	F	Grad	h|s	-1	0	uh so we have a whole bunch of dues that we've read we have the forms and so on um but only 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact318	657.122	659.252	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	um but only a small number of that had a well not a small 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact319	659.394	660.514	F	Grad	s^bsc	-1	0	had a well not a small number only 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact320	660.922	663.118	F	Grad	s	-1	0	number only a subset of that has been transcribed and so we need to decide 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact321	663.118	665.068	F	Grad	s^co^rt	-1	0	and so we need to decide what we want to do and 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact322	665.625	672.386	F	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and uh lives and then dress actually they're not here but they did say a one point that they thought they could do pretty good job of just doing a forced alignment 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact323	673.317	680.909	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and again i don't think we'll be able to do with that alone because um sometimes people correct themselves and things like that 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact324	681.866	682.126	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	but so i was just wondering 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact325	682.126	690.961	F	Grad	s	+1	2	so i was just wondering what people thought about how automated can we make the process of finding where the people read the digits doing the forced alignment and doing the timing 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact326	691.674	692.904	D	Professor	s	+1	2	before and be one thing about 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact327	692.904	694.614	D	Professor	qw^rt	+1	2	be one thing about just actually doing recognition 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact328	695.313	697.973	F	Grad	h|s	-1	0	no well we we know what they read because we have the forms 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact329	697.837	698.927	D	Professor	s^ar|s^ng	-1	0	no they make mistakes we have the forms 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact330	699.369	699.709	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact331	700.175	704.549	F	Grad	s	-1	0	but the point is that we want to get a set of clean digits 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact333	706.413	707.783	B	PhD	s	-1	0	your time has a preprocessing step right 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact332	706.228	706.618	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	your time has a preprocessing 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact334	707.843	708.323	B	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	step right morgan 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact335	709.218	709.608	D	Professor	h	-1	0	um 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact336	710.534	711.054	B	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	the winter yeah i'm i'm not quite sure i'm 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact337	710.642	712.412	D	Professor	s	-1	0	the winter yeah i'm i'm not quite sure i'm talking about i mean i 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact338	712.412	712.962	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	talking about i mean i 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact339	713.637	715.695	D	Professor	s^r	-1	0	i mean uh what time it it just now and 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact340	715.785	722.171	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	it just now and and so um there's a bunch of stuff that hasn't been marked yet and 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact341	722.599	722.989	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	and 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact342	723.077	728.349	D	Professor	fh|qy	-1	0	and um there's the issue that that they we know what what was said but do we because people it's not an option it 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact343	723.999	725.019	F	Grad	fg|s.%-	-1	0	and um there's the issue that that they it's not an option it 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact344	728.349	730.523	D	Professor	s	-1	0	we because people make mistakes and stuff i was 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact345	730.905	737.122	D	Professor	s	+1	2	and stuff i was just asking just out of curiosity if if with uh uh ds or i recognize are getting one percent were there 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact346	738.25	741.723	D	Professor	fh|qy	+1	2	would we would we do better 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact347	742.167	753.83	D	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	+1	2	so if you go forced alignment that the force but the but the transcription you have is wrong because they actually made mistakes or false starts it's it's much less it's much less common than one percent but that's pretty uncommon 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact348	748.227	749.327	F	Grad	s	-1	0	false starts it's it's but that's pretty uncommon 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact349	755.395	758.005	F	Grad	h|s.%--	-1	0	um if we could really get one percent on 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact351	759.629	760.239	D	Professor	s	-1	0	we should be able to write well i guess yeah i guess if we segmented 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact350	759.249	763.179	F	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	we should be able to write well i guess yeah i guess if we segmented it we can get one percent on digits 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact352	760.239	760.529	D	Professor	qy^bu^d^g^rt	-1	0	to write yeah i guess if we segmented 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact353	760.902	761.092	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	to write yeah i guess if we segmented it we can get 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact354	763.414	763.574	D	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr024.D.dialogueact355	764.38	765.19	D	Professor	s	-1	0	that's my question i'm not saying it should be one 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact357	765.19	767.29	D	Professor	s.%-	+1	1	i'm not saying it should be one or the other but it's like well they're they're couple different 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact356	765.06	765.23	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	i'm not saying it should be one 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact358	767.063	768.563	F	Grad	s	-1	0	like they're they're couple different ways of doing it we could 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact359	768.563	771.512	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	ways of doing it we could use the tools ivory developing transcribe it hire some people 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact360	771.512	773.862	F	Grad	s^cs	+1	2	it hire some people or use the transfer to do we get 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact361	773.862	775.552	F	Grad	s^cs	+1	3	to do we get like i. b. m. transcribe it 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact362	776.474	777.504	F	Grad	s	-1	0	you know they're doing it anyway and unless we tell 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact363	777.504	779.714	F	Grad	s	-1	0	anyway and unless we tell them different they're going to transcribe it 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact364	780.765	782.835	F	Grad	fh|s^cs	+1	3	um or we could try some automated methods 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact366	784.859	785.179	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	well and my my tendency 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact365	784.798	791.495	F	Grad	s^cs	+1	3	well and my my tendency right now is well if i b. m. comes back with this meeting in the transcript is good slip and do it 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact367	792.511	795.882	D	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah that's it you race appoint kind of uh euphemistic it but 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact368	795.882	797.962	D	Professor	s	-1	0	euphemistic it but i mean maybe there's a serious problem what 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact369	797.962	802.036	D	Professor	qw	-1	0	a serious problem what will they do when they go here beep seven beep seven three five two i mean you 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact370	802.036	804.281	D	Professor	qy^d.%-	-1	0	i mean you think so okay it's pretty distinct the beats 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact371	803.459	804.459	F	Grad	s	-1	0	think so okay it's pretty distinct the beats 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact373	804.734	804.954	D	Professor	b	-1	0	the beats 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact372	804.559	806.229	F	Grad	s	-1	0	would be a problem from from mine the beats are pre recorded 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact374	805.58	806.98	B	PhD	s	-1	0	would be a problem from from mine are pre recorded 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact375	807.811	807.971	E	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr024.A.dialogueact376	808.688	812.312	A	Postdoc	qy^d^rt	-1	0	well it it will it be preceded by i'm reading transcript and so yes 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact377	812.454	812.634	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	so yes 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact378	812.578	812.868	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	so yes 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact379	813.32	815.383	A	Postdoc	fg|s.%-	-1	0	so i think it depressing it it mean it'll be it'll be in the midst 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact380	814.502	816.842	F	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	think it depressing it it mean it'll be it'll be in the midst of a digit string so 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact382	817.242	817.512	D	Professor	b	-1	0	made 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact381	816.912	817.332	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	of a digit string so made 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact383	818.079	818.279	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	sure there there might 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact384	818.279	825.306	F	Grad	s	-1	0	sure there there might be a place where it's deep seven deep eight beep eight he 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact385	826.128	829.168	F	Grad	s	-1	0	they're they're going to have macro sprints hurting the beat marks 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact386	830.088	831.778	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and so i i don't think it would be a problem let's 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact387	831.778	832.358	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	think it would be a problem let's see but i don't think it's 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact388	832.358	833.658	F	Grad	s^r	-1	0	see but i don't think it's going to be a problem 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact389	834.653	834.913	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact390	835.111	836.051	D	Professor	fg|s^ng	-1	0	well i i i don't know i i think that is 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact391	836.051	848.204	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	i i think that is if they are in fact going to transcribe these things uh certainly any process would have to correct them or whatever's used to be much less elaborate for digits or other stuff so we're not sure right 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact392	847.039	847.259	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	or other stuff 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact393	848.204	848.894	D	Professor	qh	-1	0	so we're not sure 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact394	849.039	849.299	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr024.D.dialogueact395	852.233	852.543	D	Professor	qy^d	-1	0	does it 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact396	852.7	853.04	F	Grad	s^na	-1	0	does it just what we do with 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact397	853.315	854.393	F	Grad	s	-1	0	just what we do with digits we have so many 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact398	854.256	854.566	D	Professor	b	-1	0	digits we have so many 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact399	854.393	857.898	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	well we we we want to have him digits we have so many of them that would be nice to actually do something with them 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact400	855.77	857.406	D	Professor	s	-1	0	well we we we want to have him of them that would be nice to actually do something with them 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact402	858.181	858.441	D	Professor	%	-1	0	that yeah more than ten 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact401	858.055	858.865	I	PhD	qy	-1	0	that yeah more than ten 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact403	859.076	859.416	F	Grad	qo	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr024.F.dialogueact404	861.379	862.559	F	Grad	s	-1	0	in you're mike is a little over there 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact405	862.86	863.72	D	Professor	s	-1	0	in berkeley uh over there 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact406	864.405	868.84	D	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	so uh you you have to go really right 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact407	868.84	869.05	D	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	really right well like 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact409	869.691	870.131	D	Professor	%	-1	0	well like they tell about uh 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact408	869.32	872.448	I	PhD	h|s	-1	0	well like they tell about uh 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact410	873.145	873.405	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	all right so let let's make 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact411	873.405	876.772	D	Professor	s^co^t^tc	-1	0	all right so let let's make sure we do the ones that that uh says so there's 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact412	873.665	873.755	I	PhD	b	-1	0	all right so let let's make 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact413	874.952	875.192	I	PhD	b	-1	0	sure we do the ones that that uh 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact414	876.772	880.873	D	Professor	s	-1	0	says so there's some uh in in adams agenda list you had 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact415	880.873	883.703	D	Professor	qy^d	-1	0	agenda list you had something from you about segment rationed class for tradition 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact416	884.27	884.76	I	PhD	h|s^aa	-1	0	well yeah so this 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact417	884.76	890.082	I	PhD	s	-1	0	well yeah so this this party to inform everybody um and and of course to get input 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact418	886.078	886.168	F	Grad	s^fe^t1	-1	0	to inform everybody 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact419	890.838	901.639	I	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	uh we had a discussion and i had discussed last week about how to proceed with you know with tom's work and 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact420	900.353	900.553	E	PhD	%	-1	0	you know with tom's 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact421	901.639	921.987	I	PhD	fh|s^cs	+1	2	work and and and uh one of the obvious current restless that since we now have two of segment turning it works you know amazingly well we should actually basically reevaluate the recognition result using you know without cheating on the second page 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact423	923.393	923.753	E	PhD	fg	-1	0	that should be fairly 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact422	922.955	924.345	I	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and how that should be fairly 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact424	924.75	928.16	E	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	and how do we find the transcripts all those so the yeah oh 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact425	928.573	928.753	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah oh 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact427	929.062	930.962	E	PhD	qy^d	+1	2	the reference this also those segments okay so there's actually 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact426	928.883	929.463	I	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah the reference this also oh okay so 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact428	929.939	931.069	I	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	the reference this also those segments it's okay so there's actually i 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact429	931.821	932.521	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	it's not that i just 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact430	932.02	932.37	I	PhD	qw	-1	0	not that just 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact431	933.084	933.404	F	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	i can no actually 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact432	933.086	943.312	I	PhD	fh|s	+1	2	i can hand once well no actually um miss have uh they sort sophisticated scoring program that you can give a um that time 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact434	934.279	934.889	F	Grad	s	-1	0	hand once well um miss 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact433	934.079	934.499	G	PhD	%	-1	0	hand once well um miss 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact435	939.292	939.632	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	that you 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact436	944.49	956.086	I	PhD	fh|s.%-	+1	2	does all the work for you you know you basically just give to tie mark of words in the computer that it it does all the work for you 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact437	955.286	956.226	B	PhD	s^2	-1	0	does all the work for you that it it does all the work for you 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact438	956.086	956.976	I	PhD	s^m^na	-1	0	you it does all the work for you 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact439	957.205	957.405	B	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr024.E.dialogueact440	957.34	957.53	E	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr024.I.dialogueact441	958.074	961.963	I	PhD	fh|s	+1	2	so it we just and we use that actually and have five to do the scoring 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact442	962.695	966.635	I	PhD	fh|s	+1	2	um so what been using so far with us a simplified version of 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact443	967.246	970.687	I	PhD	s	-1	0	we can handle this the the type of problem we have here 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact445	971.254	975.844	E	PhD	s^bs	-1	0	especially when you get some time constraints for for the references and for for the habits or something yeah 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact444	971.178	971.658	I	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	especially when you get some 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact446	973.829	973.979	I	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	for for the references 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact447	974.741	974.861	I	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and for for 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact449	975.844	976.114	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	the habits or something yeah maybe the started 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact452	976.314	976.584	E	PhD	b	-1	0	maybe the started 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact450	975.902	976.202	G	PhD	b	-1	0	the habits or something yeah maybe the started 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact448	975.67	975.78	I	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	the habits or something yeah 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact451	976.202	978.942	G	PhD	s	-1	0	maybe the started your speech in the end of it or 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact453	976.378	976.688	I	PhD	%-	-1	0	maybe the started 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact455	979.322	979.422	E	PhD	b	-1	0	something like that it 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact454	978.942	979.722	G	PhD	s	-1	0	in the end of it or something like that it 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact456	979.765	979.855	I	PhD	b	-1	0	something like that it 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact457	980.022	981.662	I	PhD	s	+1	2	does time constraint would alignment 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact458	981.9	982.15	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	would alignment 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact459	982.174	982.384	I	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bmr024.I.dialogueact462	988.118	989.318	I	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	uh so that was the one thing and the other one 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact463	989.318	990.578	I	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	thing and the other one 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact464	990.678	991.058	I	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr024.I.dialogueact465	992.375	993.115	I	PhD	qw	-1	0	what was the other problem all that 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact466	993.115	993.295	I	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	all that 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact467	993.733	999.39	I	PhD	s	+1	2	all that two i wanted to use the year recognize alignment to train up it's um it's a factor 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact468	999.712	999.892	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	a factor 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact469	1000.23	1009.78	I	PhD	fh|s	+1	2	yeah justin programs we could use uh you know there would be so much hand labeling need that generally train 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact470	1009.27	1009.37	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah justin programs 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact471	1009.37	1011.05	E	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah justin programs stuff doing that so and i think you're in the 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact472	1011.05	1011.29	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	so and i think you're in the 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact473	1011.35	1012.81	I	PhD	s	-1	0	so and i think you're in the process of doing that so 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact475	1012.95	1013.04	E	PhD	b	-1	0	i'll give process of doing that so 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact474	1012.81	1014.28	I	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	i'll give you a lot more data to want process of doing that so 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact476	1013.8	1014.87	B	PhD	s	-1	0	i'll give you a lot more data to want 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact477	1014.87	1015.14	B	PhD	qy^g	-1	0	you a lot more data to want so 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact478	1015.23	1015.35	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	so 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact479	1015.89	1016.93	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so it's basically 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact480	1017.17	1017.25	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	i think eight meetings 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact481	1017.44	1019.64	E	PhD	s	-1	0	i think eight meetings or something which which i'm using um 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact482	1019.64	1023.65	E	PhD	s	-1	0	i'm using um before it was twenty minutes if one meeting so 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact483	1019.94	1020.25	I	PhD	b	-1	0	i'm using um 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact484	1023.65	1025.37	E	PhD	s	-1	0	if one meeting so there's a little bit better that won't be perfect 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact485	1023.98	1024.11	I	PhD	b	-1	0	if one meeting so there's a little bit that 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact487	1025.03	1025.37	B	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	better won't be perfect 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact486	1024.99	1027.04	I	PhD	s	-1	0	there's a little bit better yeah that won't be perfect alignment aren't perfect but um 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact488	1027.26	1027.36	E	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah but um 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact490	1027.52	1027.68	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	yeah but um 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact489	1027.27	1030.67	I	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah but um it's probably still better to have all this extra data 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact491	1027.86	1028.22	G	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah but um it's probably still better 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact492	1029.41	1029.49	E	PhD	b	-1	0	to have all this extra 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact493	1030.32	1030.5	E	PhD	b	-1	0	data 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact494	1030.67	1030.73	I	PhD	b	-1	0	data 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact495	1031.7	1032.15	E	PhD	s	-1	0	well see that's 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact496	1032.63	1032.76	I	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr024.D.dialogueact497	1035.84	1036.27	D	Professor	b	-1	0	actually i had a question 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact498	1036.23	1037.53	G	PhD	s	-1	0	actually i had a question that that if you find 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact499	1037.53	1046.28	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	that that if you find that you can lower the false alarms that you get where there's no speech that would be useful for us to know so 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact500	1046.28	1048.23	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	there was a false alarm so 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact501	1047.99	1049.03	E	PhD	s	-1	0	there was a false alarm yeah so 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact502	1049.24	1049.52	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	yeah so 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact503	1049.52	1057.44	G	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah so right now you get fall you know false false on speech regions when it's just like um breath or something like that and interested 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact504	1052.15	1052.4	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	fall you know false 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact505	1055.1	1055.24	E	PhD	b	-1	0	it's just like um 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact507	1057.62	1057.73	E	PhD	b	-1	0	like that and interested 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact506	1057.44	1060.69	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	like that and interested to know that what with you retrain um 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact508	1060.9	1061.27	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	um to those 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact509	1061.59	1061.74	E	PhD	b	-1	0	to those 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact510	1061.7	1062.91	G	PhD	qy	-1	0	to those actually go down or not because 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact511	1062.91	1064.36	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah i'll come make uh actually go down or not because 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact512	1063.53	1063.66	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah i'll come 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact513	1063.66	1068.33	E	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	yeah i'll come make uh can make make a comparison to fulfill to some to this new one and yeah just to see if 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact515	1068.44	1069.16	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	one and and yeah just to see if by doing nothing and 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact514	1068.08	1072.78	G	PhD	s	-1	0	one and and yeah just to see if by doing nothing and the molly just having that training to what happens 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact516	1069.33	1069.46	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and by doing nothing and 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact517	1071.8	1071.95	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	that training to what 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact518	1072.92	1073.07	E	PhD	b	-1	0	happens 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact519	1075.92	1081.86	D	Professor	fg|qy^d^t^tc	-1	0	um another one that we had um items gender uh that definitely dog too was talking about spark come 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact520	1082.83	1083.0	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right so rob pours 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact521	1083.0	1084.43	F	Grad	fg|s.%--	-1	0	so rob pours elena that personal 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact522	1084.43	1085.05	F	Grad	qy^bsc^d^rt	-1	0	elena that personal andy uh 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact523	1085.33	1090.67	F	Grad	s	+1	4	andy uh purple and they uh smart come grouper collecting some dialogues basically 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact524	1085.83	1086.2	I	PhD	s^bc	-1	0	andy uh purple 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact525	1087.07	1087.31	I	PhD	s^bc^r	-1	0	and they uh 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact526	1090.67	1096.95	F	Grad	s	+1	1	basically they have one person sitting in here looking at a picture and uh wizard sitting in another room somewhere 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact527	1097.69	1099.72	F	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	and uh they're doing i travel task 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact528	1100.24	1103.85	F	Grad	fh|s.%--	-1	0	and uh it involves starting i believe starting with they 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact529	1104.75	1105.9	F	Grad	s	-1	0	it it's always the wizard but 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact530	1105.9	1111.54	F	Grad	s	+1	1	yeah actually always the wizard but it starts where the was just pretending to be a computer and it goes through a uh each generation system 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact531	1111.63	1111.69	E	PhD	b.%	-1	0	yeah actually system 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact532	1111.69	1114.72	E	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	yeah actually it's changed so synthesis for for the first time now system the system 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact533	1113.56	1114.44	F	Grad	s^bk^m	-1	0	for for the first time now the system 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact534	1114.89	1114.99	E	PhD	b	-1	0	the first time now 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact535	1115.37	1118.66	F	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um and then it goes to a real was there and they're evaluating then they wanted 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact536	1118.66	1122.18	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	then they wanted to use this equipment and so that would question came up as well here's some more 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact537	1122.18	1123.48	F	Grad	s	-1	0	as well here's some more data should just be part 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact538	1123.48	1125.05	F	Grad	qy	+1	1	data should just be part of the corpus or not 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact539	1126.15	1133.23	F	Grad	s	+1	1	and my attitude was yes because there might be people who are using this corpus for acoustics as opposed to adjust for language i'm 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact540	1134.03	1136.18	F	Grad	s	-1	0	also for dialogue of various sorts 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact541	1137.25	1138.77	F	Grad	s	-1	0	i'm so it's not a meeting right 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact542	1138.77	1139.03	F	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	a meeting right because it's two people 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact543	1139.03	1141.31	F	Grad	s	-1	0	right so because it's two people and they're not face to face 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact544	1141.51	1141.78	D	Professor	s^co	-1	0	right so 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact546	1141.84	1147.34	D	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	right so i just went under say i'm hadn't quite follow this process um 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact545	1141.8	1141.99	E	PhD	b	-1	0	right so 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact547	1147.34	1156.13	D	Professor	fh|qy^bu^d	-1	0	um so it's wizard in the sand usual sense that the person who is asking questions doesn't know that it's uh a machine is not a machine at the beginning actually actually 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact548	1154.66	1154.96	I	PhD	b	-1	0	it's uh a machine 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact550	1155.61	1156.2	F	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	is not a machine at the beginning actually actually 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact549	1155.52	1158.17	I	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	is not a machine at the beginning actually actually the the reader this i don't know who came up with 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact551	1158.17	1160.52	I	PhD	s	-1	0	i don't know who came up with it but i think they're really clever idea we 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact552	1161.03	1169.57	I	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	to you know bridger stimulate the computer breakdown halfway through the session and so then after that the person's told that they're not talking to 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact553	1163.24	1163.49	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	halfway through the session 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact554	1168.44	1169.45	E	PhD	s^t3	-1	0	to you know bridger 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact556	1170.12	1170.37	D	Professor	b	-1	0	of course they don't know that so we we collect

Bmr024.D.dialogueact649	1274.89	1275.62	D	Professor	qy	-1	0	discuss pretty cheap such we say that now and then 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact650	1275.16	1275.5	F	Grad	%-	-1	0	we say that now and then 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact651	1276.06	1276.29	D	Professor	%--	-1	0	that yeah so 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact652	1276.29	1276.52	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	that yeah so 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact653	1277.01	1279.44	D	Professor	s	-1	0	we say that because it's it's it's potentially useful and right 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact655	1279.92	1282.85	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and now what we do is is is is separate question i right 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact654	1279.5	1279.7	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	and right 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact656	1283.03	1288.37	D	Professor	s	-1	0	mean anybody who's training something up could choose to put it it you include this or not i i would not say 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact657	1286.36	1286.7	I	PhD	b.%	-1	0	to put it it 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact658	1288.37	1290.44	D	Professor	s	+1	1	not i i would not say was part of the meetings corpus citizen

Bmr024.D.dialogueact660	1291.73	1292.98	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but it's another day we have and 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact661	1292.98	1296.76	D	Professor	s	-1	0	another day we have and if somebody doing experiment once strain up including that then they can right 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact663	1296.76	1296.87	D	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	that then they can right 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact662	1296.71	1296.97	I	PhD	b	-1	0	that then they can right 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact664	1297.33	1303.95	F	Grad	fg|s	+1	1	so it it i guess it dick begs the question of what is the meaning corpus so 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact665	1304.09	1311.68	F	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	i think if i q. w. they start recording person conversations is that part of the meeting corpus 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact666	1309.0	1315.43	D	Professor	s	+1	1	i think i think the idea of two more people conversing with one another ski conversations is that part of the meeting corpus 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact667	1316.26	1318.36	F	Grad	s	+1	1	well this has two or more people conversing with each other just not face to what if we just give

Bmr024.I.dialogueact693	1355.74	1357.94	I	PhD	s^cs.%-	-1	0	well it's it's i don't see why not meeting corp should let it be it 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact696	1357.57	1358.69	A	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	well it's it's well because i don't see why not it's just a different topic it be it 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact695	1357.37	1358.15	F	Grad	s^na	-1	0	well it's it's well because i don't see why not it's just a different topic it be it 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact697	1358.15	1359.28	F	Grad	s	-1	0	well because i i have an extra it's just a different topic 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact698	1359.13	1361.82	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i i have an extra point which is the natural in this issue 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact699	1362.39	1364.47	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	because we have like meeting to have a reason that's one of the reasons 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact700	1364.47	1366.64	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	a reason that's one of the reasons that we were talking about this and and 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact701	1366.64	1370.06	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	about this and and those and the sounds like it's more of an experimental setup it's kind of different groups it's an area based it's

Bmr024.D.dialogueact705	1375.05	1379.39	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but i i have no problem with somebody folding it in for some experiment they're going to do but i don't think 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact707	1379.39	1382.89	D	Professor	s	-1	0	to do but i don't think it it doesn't match anything we've described about meetings

Bmr024.D.dialogueact716	1391.86	1398.95	D	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	you can you can again as as i think and it's just saying if you want to use the same tools of the same conventions is no problem with that is 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact717	1398.95	1402.29	D	Professor	s.%--	+1	2	no problem with that is just that it's you know different directory it's called something different it's you know is 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact718	1402.29	1402.51	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	it's you know is 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact719	1402.9	1403.52	D	Professor	s	-1	0	it's you know is different you can't 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact720	1403.93	1405.18	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	different you can't just hold is if it's i mean did you two different 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact721	1405.18	1406.23	D	Professor	s	-1	0	it's i mean did you two different too right yeah but might don't be potentially 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact722	1406.23	1406.42	D	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	too right yeah but might don't be potentially 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact724	1406.72	1408.06	F	Grad	s	-1	0	too right yeah but those are folded and and it's just you just mark might don't be potentially confusing 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact723	1406.37	1408.1	I	PhD	s	-1	0	too right yeah but those are folded and and it's just you just mark might don't be potentially confusing 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact725	1408.06	1410.26	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and it's just you just mark the transcripts differently so so one option 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact726	1410.26	1412.34	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	so so one option is you folded in and just 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact727	1410.51	1410.61	I	PhD	b	-1	0	so so one option 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact728	1412.71	1419.75	F	Grad	s^cs	+1	4	well i don't i wouldn't in and just simply in the file you mark somewhere that this is this type of interaction rather than another type of interaction

Bmr024.D.dialogueact730	1419.28	1422.43	D	Professor	s	+1	1	well i don't i wouldn't call reading digits meetings of interaction 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact731	1423.16	1423.5	D	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right i mean we

Bmr024.D.dialogueact752	1449.69	1453.48	D	Professor	s^co	-1	0	convenient for you all saying is that there's no way they were going to tell people that reading digits as meetings right 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact754	1454.1	1458.92	D	Professor	s^co	-1	0	and similarly we're not going to tell them to someone talking to a computer to get travel information is meetings 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact753	1454.05	1454.24	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	and similarly we're 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact755	1459.45	1460.19	D	Professor	s	-1	0	those are meetings but if it 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact756	1460.51	1465.42	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	there's a but if it makes it easier for you to put full in the same procedures and have in the same directory tree knock yourself uh that 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact758	1465.68	1467.81	B	PhD	s	-1	0	there's a couple of other questions that i have to and uh that 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact757	1465.62	1465.74	D	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	there's a uh that 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact759	1467.81	1471.32	B	PhD	qw	-1	0	that i have to and and one of them is what about uh consent issues and the 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact760	1471.89	1473.45	B	PhD	qw	-1	0	and the other one is what about transcription or inscriptions 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact762	1473.87	1474.08	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	or inscriptions type of music 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact761	1473.79	1475.02	E	PhD	s	-1	0	or okay so we don't inscriptions type of music 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact763	1475.5	1475.73	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay so we don't 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact764	1475.73	1477.51	B	PhD	qy^bu^d	-1	0	okay so we don't have to worry about transcribing so what we will have 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact766	1477.04	1477.34	D	Professor	b	-1	0	so what we will have 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact765	1476.64	1476.75	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	have to worry about transcribing 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact767	1477.14	1479.5	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so what we will have to worry about formats that's uh that's another argument to keep 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact768	1478.34	1480.57	I	PhD	s	-1	0	to worry about formats that's uh that's another argument to keep it separate because it's going 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact769	1480.57	1486.65	I	PhD	s^df	-1	0	uh probably oh okay okay well i didn't realize that that's it separate because it's going to follow these smart com transcription conventions and not the dixie meeting so 
Bmr024.E.dialogueact771	1483.41	1483.57	E	PhD	b	-1	0	okay conventions and not 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact770	1482.96	1483.48	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay com transcription conventions and not

Bmr024.F.dialogueact814	1532.56	1536.0	F	Grad	s^na	-1	0	were more than uh with a little more than that because we're using up some space that we shouldn't be on 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact815	1537.14	1542.94	F	Grad	fh|s^na	+1	1	so once everything gets converted over to the just were supposed to be using will be probably uh seventy five percent

Bmr024.D.dialogueact853	1604.67	1609.01	D	Professor	s^co	-1	0	you do that it'll take the opportunity and get another big raft of disk i guess it's well the

Bmr024.F.dialogueact856	1610.03	1612.49	F	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	really the backup issue rather than the file server yeah thing i think there's an argument for having you know you 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact855	1609.54	1619.2	I	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	it's really the backup issue rather than the file server yeah well the thing i think there's an argument for having you know you can use our old file servers for for this that have day that that is very rarely access and then have 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact857	1619.2	1625.39	I	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	my understanding is the issue isn't and then have a fast you pop server for they of that us um heavily

Bmr024.I.dialogueact947	1744.33	1751.38	I	PhD	fg|qw^cs	+1	1	decades i think that um so so how about putting them on that plus like on the um on that or something and 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact948	1750.82	1751.29	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i think that um

Bmr024.F.dialogueact950	1752.36	1753.63	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	we can already put them on tape

Bmr024.F.dialogueact954	1757.12	1759.67	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so the the only issue is then if we need access to 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact956	1760.28	1761.99	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so that's fine but if we don't need access to 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact955	1760.15	1760.34	I	PhD	b	-1	0	so that's fine but if we 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact957	1762.53	1764.25	I	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	well if if if you if they last say they actually 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact958	1764.61	1768.23	I	PhD	s	-1	0	say they actually last like five years typical okay and and

Bmr024.F.dialogueact973	1789.84	1791.03	F	Grad	s	-1	0	which you you can do that but that's pretty annoying because the c. d.'s are so slow

Bmr024.B.dialogueact987	1801.99	1802.24	B	PhD	b	-1	0	before just before they were before because goes right 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact986	1801.65	1804.21	G	PhD	s^2	-1	0	before that the c. d. is an alternative just before they were before because goes bad it right

Bmr024.F.dialogueact990	1805.91	1808.87	F	Grad	s	+1	1	to tape it he already has a perfectly good tape system it's more reliable 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact991	1809.19	1811.51	D	Professor	fg|s.%-	-1	0	i would think so archive angle just use tape one one thing i don't understand 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact992	1809.22	1810.75	F	Grad	s^co	+1	1	i so archive angle just use tape one one 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact993	1810.35	1822.58	I	PhD	s	-1	0	i would think just use tape well regardless one one thing i don't understand is if you have the day that if if you if the meeting that is put on this exact you want and it's backed up once in the backup system should never have to bother with it and more and more 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact994	1821.24	1823.37	F	Grad	fg|s.%--	-1	0	well regardless well first bother with it and more and more 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact995	1823.58	1833.53	F	Grad	s	-1	0	well first of all there was um a problem with thee archive in that i was every once in a while doing that you mod on all the directors emperor cursive to mangione because 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact996	1833.53	1836.24	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because they weren't getting set correctly every once in a while and i was just doing

Bmr024.F.dialogueact998	1836.24	1841.99	F	Grad	s	-1	0	a while and i was just doing uh minus our star not realizing that that cause it to be read backed up uh

Bmr024.F.dialogueact1001	1842.99	1844.34	F	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	but normally are correct but even 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact1002	1844.59	1847.44	F	Grad	s	+1	1	but even without that the backup system is becoming saturated 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1003	1848.54	1853.67	I	PhD	s	+1	1	sure but we still have but but this backup system is smart enough to figure out that something hasn't changed it doesn't need to be back up again 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1005	1853.49	1863.66	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i think that it's at least the ones the that that you put it on it would but we still have enough changed that the nightly backups are starting to take too long it has nothing to do with up again okay so so then it so

Bmr024.I.dialogueact1233	2185.23	2188.66	I	PhD	fh	-1	0	so uh so then um oh 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1234	2188.84	2194.22	I	PhD	s	+1	1	oh and plus the the vocal track victimization didn't actually make things worse so something's 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1235	2194.46	2196.03	I	PhD	s	+1	1	so something's seriously wrong so 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1236	2196.12	2196.42	I	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1237	2197.43	2198.0	I	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bmr024.D.dialogueact1240	2200.64	2201.16	D	Professor	b	-1	0	okay so but she so so 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1239	2200.59	2202.01	I	PhD	fh	-1	0	okay so but she now between between so so 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1241	2201.44	2212.43	D	Professor	fg|s	+1	2	so but she now between between the males and females to certainly a much bigger difference in the scaling range than there is they just within males and so 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1242	2213.01	2219.05	D	Professor	s	-1	0	what you're using before was scaling factors that were just from the they made s. or i friend and networks that's true 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1243	2219.57	2221.28	D	Professor	s	-1	0	networks that worked fine that's true 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1244	2219.7	2220.22	I	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	networks that worked fine that's true

Bmr024.D.dialogueact1246	2222.18	2226.29	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh but now you're looking over a larger range and may not be so fine 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1247	2227.27	2228.03	I	PhD	fg	-1	0	well um so i just 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1248	2228.22	2228.55	I	PhD	fg	-1	0	so i just 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1249	2228.85	2229.21	I	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so i just 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1250	2230.49	2236.01	I	PhD	s.%--	+1	3	that so the one thing that i then tried was to put in the low pass filter which we have so most 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1251	2236.56	2245.48	I	PhD	s	+1	2	so most most i'm five systems actually bands that uh uh it's about thirty seven hundred hurts although you 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1252	2244.25	2244.55	D	Professor	b	-1	0	hurts 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1253	2245.48	2248.91	I	PhD	s	+1	2	although you know movie the child goes to for for thousand right 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1254	2248.91	2249.15	I	PhD	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	for thousand right so 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1255	2249.15	2250.61	I	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1256	2251.28	2254.38	I	PhD	s	-1	0	and that actually help 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1257	2253.07	2253.38	D	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1258	2255.15	2257.02	I	PhD	fh|s	+1	4	um and it didn't hurt on the male so 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1259	2257.02	2258.39	I	PhD	fh	-1	0	and 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1260	2258.94	2262.13	I	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and i'm now uh trying be time suddenly 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1261	2262.49	2267.17	I	PhD	s	+1	4	time suddenly also the the vocal track accommodation only in the tests on the test data so 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1262	2268.03	2273.17	I	PhD	s	-1	0	you can do vocal track determination on the test they only or almost the training in the test 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1263	2269.32	2269.49	D	Professor	b	-1	0	determination 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1264	2274.04	2279.82	I	PhD	s	-1	0	you're expected to help a little bit if you do it on the on the tests and more if you do it on both training and stuff 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1265	2279.51	2279.72	D	Professor	b	-1	0	training and stuff 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1266	2280.51	2285.16	I	PhD	s	-1	0	so the it's not helps if you it only on the test and i'm 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1267	2285.24	2289.84	I	PhD	s	-1	0	and i'm currently retraining another set of models whereas both in the training in the past and then 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1268	2289.84	2293.2	I	PhD	s	-1	0	in the past and then will have hopefully better though so but this 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1269	2293.3	2293.5	I	PhD	fh	-1	0	so but this 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1270	2293.7	2293.97	I	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so but this 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1271	2294.38	2296.46	I	PhD	s	-1	0	it looks like that would still be some difference maybe 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1272	2296.52	2301.22	I	PhD	s	+1	4	maybe between one and two percent for the female and so um 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1273	2300.06	2300.26	D	Professor	b	-1	0	for the female 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1274	2301.22	2304.3	I	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	and so um you know i'm open to suggestions and it is 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact1276	2304.72	2305.11	F	Grad	b	-1	0	and it is true that's the uh that's 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1275	2304.69	2308.03	I	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and it is true that's the uh that's the you know we are using the 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1277	2309.25	2309.39	I	PhD	%--	-1	0	but it can 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1278	2309.74	2311.47	I	PhD	s	-1	0	but it can be just a b. t. l. because 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1279	2310.96	2311.22	D	Professor	b	-1	0	be just a b. t. l. because 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1280	2311.6	2319.38	I	PhD	s^df	-1	0	it's much worse yeah t. l. because if you don't you'll be now in both systems uh you know the the females are completely worth with the yuppie future so there must be 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1281	2312.34	2312.61	D	Professor	b	-1	0	if you don't you'll be 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1282	2312.61	2313.39	D	Professor	s	-1	0	it's much if you don't you'll be now in both systems 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact1283	2313.76	2314.43	F	Grad	s^2	-1	0	it's much worse yeah now in both systems uh 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact1284	2314.61	2314.78	F	Grad	b	-1	0	worse yeah uh 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1285	2319.52	2321.31	I	PhD	s	-1	0	well future so there must be some something else 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact1286	2322.02	2323.01	G	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	what's the standard that's i thought 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact1287	2323.51	2326.49	G	PhD	s	-1	0	that's i thought the performances actually a little better and you know some males 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact1288	2326.65	2327.28	F	Grad	s^na^t3	-1	0	males um 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1289	2327.86	2330.39	I	PhD	h|s^aap	-1	0	um that you overall yes but on this 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1290	2330.51	2333.93	I	PhD	s^arp	-1	0	yes but on this particular development tests that they're actually little more 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1291	2335.19	2336.15	I	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	but that's beside the point we're looking at the discrepancy 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1292	2336.15	2342.44	I	PhD	s	+1	4	we're looking at the discrepancy between the sri that's right to someone trained with the teacher 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact1293	2343.5	2343.65	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	right is funny 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact1294	2343.65	2348.69	G	PhD	s	-1	0	what's of the free right is funny is that if if you have any indication of your standard futures you 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact1295	2345.99	2346.79	F	Grad	qy.%-	-1	0	what's of the free if if you have any 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact1296	2348.95	2351.89	G	PhD	s	-1	0	futures you know if that's also different in the same direction or not 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1297	2350.97	2354.16	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	this is the mass cook more basically i mean is this uh different in the same direction or not 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact1298	2352.58	2352.88	G	PhD	%--	-1	0	this is the mass cook 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1300	2354.16	2357.96	D	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	i mean is this uh uh that of almost training or 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1299	2353.81	2353.97	I	PhD	b	-1	0	more basically 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1301	2357.96	2359.33	D	Professor	qrr^rt	-1	0	training or is it that you're training or it's almost 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1302	2359.33	2359.54	D	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	or it's almost 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1303	2359.51	2360.62	I	PhD	s	-1	0	or almost it's almost training 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1304	2360.71	2361.55	D	Professor	s^bk^m	-1	0	almost training and training 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1305	2361.77	2364.45	D	Professor	qw	-1	0	training and how do you determine one to to stop it or 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1306	2366.16	2366.68	I	PhD	h	-1	0	um 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1307	2367.88	2373.17	I	PhD	h|s	-1	0	well actually we we just basically do uh uh fixed number of iterations uh 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact1308	2373.64	2373.98	F	Grad	b	-1	0	uh 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1309	2373.97	2375.23	I	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	uh in this case for 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1310	2376.24	2379.0	I	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	which we used to do only three and then we found 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1311	2379.0	2381.02	I	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	then we found out that can it in with 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1312	2381.33	2384.93	I	PhD	s	-1	0	it in with i think we just with keeping on the safe side but 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1313	2384.93	2385.37	I	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	on the safe side but you'd write it might 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1314	2385.37	2385.67	I	PhD	fh	-1	0	you'd write it might 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1315	2385.67	2389.96	I	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	you'd write it might be that one more iterations would would help but it's stuff 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1317	2390.45	2392.36	D	Professor	s^ng	+1	4	or maybe or maybe using one too many i mean it's it's you know 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1316	2390.35	2390.66	I	PhD	fh	-1	0	or maybe you know 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1318	2392.36	2393.38	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	i mean it's it's no but this 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1319	2393.49	2398.01	I	PhD	s^ar|s^nd	+1	4	uh well there can't no but this bomb welsh there shouldn't be an over fitting if you're really 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1320	2396.93	2399.22	D	Professor	s^arp^rt	-1	0	uh well there can't be sure be an over fitting if you're really

Bmr024.D.dialogueact1345	2434.89	2435.31	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay and the the question a big difference 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1346	2435.31	2438.24	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and the the question he was asking one point about pruning 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1347	2439.2	2439.95	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1349	2443.04	2443.64	D	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	remember that one he pruning

Bmr024.D.dialogueact1351	2444.01	2451.66	D	Professor	s^rt	+1	2	was he's it looks like the probability once we just look at the probabilities he was getting uh the likelihood was getting out of kill peeve snuck up some they look pretty different in there 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1350	2443.96	2444.65	I	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	remember that one he was he's it looks like pruning in there 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact1352	2453.01	2457.54	B	PhD	s^na	-1	0	the likelihood for lower for the guilty p. and so uh there's the question oh if 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1353	2453.18	2453.72	D	Professor	s	-1	0	the likelihood for 
Bmr024.G.dialogueact1354	2454.17	2454.52	G	PhD	b	-1	0	lower oh

Bmr024.I.dialogueact1356	2457.85	2460.61	I	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	the guilty p. if you mean did you see this and the sri system 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact1357	2461.13	2461.46	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	was um 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact1359	2461.82	2463.08	B	PhD	s	-1	0	was looking through log files and um well the likelihood 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1358	2461.59	2464.75	I	PhD	h|s.%--	-1	0	was looking through log files and um well the likelihood are

Bmr024.I.dialogueact1361	2465.15	2470.85	I	PhD	s	-1	0	you can't directly compare them because for every set of models you computer new normalization 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1362	2471.81	2475.64	I	PhD	s	-1	0	and so these locker movies are and directing terrible because you 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact1363	2475.49	2476.02	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	terrible because you have different normalization 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1364	2475.64	2478.79	I	PhD	s^df	-1	0	terrible because you have different normalization comp for each of you try 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact1366	2479.24	2479.59	B	PhD	b	-1	0	but still it's a question 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1367	2479.39	2480.35	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but still it's a question if you have some threshold 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1365	2478.91	2479.2	I	PhD	fh	-1	0	but still it's a question you try 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1368	2480.35	2483.39	D	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	well yeah that's if you have some threshold somewhere in terms of being search or something 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact1369	2483.55	2483.9	B	PhD	fg	-1	0	well yeah that's something 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact1371	2483.9	2484.79	B	PhD	s	-1	0	well yeah that's what i was wondering something yeah i i mean 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1370	2483.64	2483.69	D	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	well yeah that's something 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1372	2484.25	2484.54	I	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	what i was wondering yeah i i mean 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1373	2484.54	2485.2	I	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	what i was wondering yeah i i mean

Bmr024.B.dialogueact1375	2487.38	2492.28	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	i mean if you have one threshold that works well because the range of your likelihood is in this area true and very conservatively 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1376	2491.81	2493.48	I	PhD	s	-1	0	is in this area true and very conservatively i mean 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1377	2493.48	2500.51	I	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i mean as we saw was the meeting uh um we could probably the pruning without really so we 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1378	2500.81	2503.07	I	PhD	s	-1	0	but you're only talking about so we we basically we have a very open 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1379	2503.04	2504.85	D	Professor	s	+1	2	you're only talking about a percent or two right 
Bmr024.B.dialogueact1380	2503.57	2503.78	B	PhD	b	-1	0	you're only talking about 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1381	2505.0	2505.26	D	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	here we were saying 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1382	2505.26	2508.55	D	Professor	s	-1	0	here we were saying that would there's jesus but this is difference here 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1383	2509.17	2509.6	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and it 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1384	2509.98	2511.99	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and it because there could be lots of things right 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1385	2511.99	2512.3	D	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	could be lots of things right but the but the but 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1387	2512.3	2523.22	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	but the but the but but um let's suppose just for a second that uh we sort of taking out a lot of the the major difference is uh because until doing already sort of 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1386	2512.18	2512.42	I	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	but the but the but 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1388	2512.82	2513.02	I	PhD	b	-1	0	but the but the but but um 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1389	2520.73	2520.97	I	PhD	b	-1	0	a lot of the 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1390	2522.33	2522.59	I	PhD	b	-1	0	uh because until 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1391	2523.22	2527.96	D	Professor	s	-1	0	doing already sort of using email scale and using the same style filter integration and

Bmr024.I.dialogueact1397	2540.92	2541.86	I	PhD	s	-1	0	well now it's the same 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1398	2542.11	2544.45	I	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah one's triangular one strap it's thirty thirty seven hundred and sixty hurt

Bmr024.I.dialogueact1409	2555.16	2560.83	I	PhD	s	-1	0	since current duffy cock program doesn't allow me to change the filter shape independently of the scale

Bmr024.I.dialogueact1411	2561.74	2568.26	I	PhD	s	-1	0	um i did the experiment on guests arrive friends and where i tried to where the standard is to be used couples of the filters you 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1412	2569.02	2571.01	I	PhD	s	-1	0	can actually continuously varies between the two and so i went 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1413	2571.01	2574.62	I	PhD	s	-1	0	and so i went i swear i tried the trap uh trying triangular one 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1414	2575.31	2577.75	I	PhD	s	-1	0	and it it's like he works but it's really small difference so 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact1415	2576.48	2576.74	F	Grad	b	-1	0	he works but it's really 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1417	2578.08	2579.66	D	Professor	s^2	-1	0	couple times are percent or something okay so it's not just yeah exactly so

Bmr024.I.dialogueact1423	2580.7	2585.25	I	PhD	s	-1	0	right so the other the losing some frequency range it's not i don't think the filter shape by itself or make

Bmr024.D.dialogueact1428	2587.43	2587.83	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	that so 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1429	2588.14	2588.27	D	Professor	%	-1	0	we've 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1430	2588.92	2593.64	D	Professor	s	+1	3	we've always use it anyways the major difference between the two is actually it's 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1432	2594.26	2606.48	D	Professor	s	+1	3	that the that the um peel e. and and the reason guilty is been advantageous in slightly noisy situations is because peel t. does this moving at the end by on her breast model and 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1431	2594.2	2594.49	I	PhD	b	-1	0	that the that 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1433	2601.12	2601.37	I	PhD	b	-1	0	is because 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1434	2607.04	2610.96	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i'll caps and does it by just computing in the lower tester coefficients

Bmr024.D.dialogueact1436	2611.88	2639.59	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	okay so one thing i haven't done yet is to actually do all of this with a much larger with a full training so so right now we're using uh forty it's just strange said that's about you know that factor for smaller than what we use when we trying the focus so somebody 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1437	2614.41	2614.66	I	PhD	fg	-1	0	okay so one 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1438	2614.66	2620.83	I	PhD	s	-1	0	okay so one thing i haven't done yet is to actually do all of this with a much larger with a full training so 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1439	2621.72	2623.14	I	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so right now we're using uh

Bmr024.I.dialogueact1443	2639.13	2642.26	I	PhD	s	-1	0	so somebody smoothing issues or or fitting for that matter and uh somewhere 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1445	2642.58	2642.84	D	Professor	b	-1	0	and uh somewhere 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1444	2642.26	2648.93	I	PhD	s	-1	0	and uh somewhere welsh pretty much less of a factor if you go fully wholehearted and 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1446	2647.92	2648.29	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	fully wholehearted and 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1447	2648.29	2648.52	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	wholehearted and 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1448	2648.93	2661.74	I	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	wholehearted and so so just um so the strategy is to festive treats things with fast turnaround on a smaller training said and then when you saw this narrowed it down you tried on a larger train seven so 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1449	2660.65	2660.87	D	Professor	b	-1	0	on a 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1450	2661.74	2662.89	I	PhD	s	-1	0	larger train seven so we 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1451	2663.27	2668.59	D	Professor	qw	-1	0	that is other quite related question though is is uh what's the boot models for this thing 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1452	2669.29	2671.38	I	PhD	s	-1	0	the boot models are trained from scratch so we compute 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1453	2671.38	2672.37	I	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	scratch so we compute

Bmr024.I.dialogueact1455	2674.27	2683.01	I	PhD	s	-1	0	so we started with a hello the alignment that be computers with the some of the best system we have 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1456	2683.9	2686.41	I	PhD	s	-1	0	and then we train from scratch so we can we 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1457	2686.41	2699.02	I	PhD	s	-1	0	scratch so we can we do uh we collect uh the other missions from those alignments under each of the future that's that that we trained 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1458	2700.02	2701.83	I	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	from there we do 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1459	2701.98	2702.42	I	PhD	fh	-1	0	there we do there's a lot of 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1460	2702.58	2703.09	I	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	there's a lot of actually the way 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1461	2703.09	2707.2	I	PhD	s	-1	0	actually the way it works you first train uh phonetically tied mixture model 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1462	2707.97	2708.27	I	PhD	fh	-1	0	you do 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1463	2708.8	2709.63	I	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	you do a total off 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1464	2710.04	2712.78	I	PhD	s	-1	0	first to do it context independent p. t. a model then you 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1465	2712.78	2714.15	I	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	t. a model then you switched to context you do too iterations 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1466	2714.41	2715.59	I	PhD	s	-1	0	you do too iterations of that 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1467	2716.08	2720.45	I	PhD	s	-1	0	they need you to iterations of stuff of context depending financially type mixers 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1468	2721.14	2725.24	I	PhD	s	-1	0	and then from that you you do the you you go to state custard model and you do 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1469	2725.53	2725.77	D	Professor	b	-1	0	and you do 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1470	2725.74	2727.2	I	PhD	s	-1	0	and you do four iterations of that so there's a lot of iterations 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1471	2727.2	2732.06	I	PhD	s	-1	0	so there's a lot of iterations overall between your original boot models and the final models i don't think that 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1472	2732.13	2732.81	I	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i don't think that

Bmr024.D.dialogueact1502	2797.07	2797.45	D	Professor	b	-1	0	you 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1503	2798.53	2804.91	I	PhD	s	-1	0	his addiction different dictionary with the considerably different dictionary which was much less details and much less well suited 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1504	2802.13	2802.48	D	Professor	b	-1	0	was much less details 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1505	2804.4	2804.64	D	Professor	b	-1	0	less well suited 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1506	2805.56	2808.24	I	PhD	s	-1	0	and so then we switched to new boot alignments which which now 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1507	2808.31	2813.34	I	PhD	s	-1	0	which which now had the benefit of all these improvements that we've made over two years in the system 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1508	2813.65	2813.9	D	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1509	2814.29	2816.8	I	PhD	s	-1	0	the result the indiana's another 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1510	2817.37	2817.61	D	Professor	b	-1	0	so what i'm saying 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1511	2817.4	2823.86	I	PhD	s	-1	0	so what i'm saying is the exact nature of these books alignment 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1512	2825.42	2826.04	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	but it's it's 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1513	2826.28	2830.71	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but it's it's i it's still see it is i mean there's there's a history this too but i 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1514	2826.37	2826.59	I	PhD	b	-1	0	but it's it's 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1515	2830.71	2832.11	D	Professor	s	-1	0	this too but i uh i don't go into but but i i 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1516	2831.12	2831.4	I	PhD	b	-1	0	uh i don't go into 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1517	2832.11	2842.25	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but but i i i i think it could be the things that the data is being viewed in a certain way uh that the beginning is here rather than there and so forth because the actual 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1518	2832.45	2832.64	I	PhD	b	-1	0	but but i i 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1519	2838.85	2839.07	I	PhD	b	-1	0	a certain way uh that the beginning 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1520	2842.25	2845.11	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because the actual signal processing doing slightly different but 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1521	2844.28	2844.5	I	PhD	b	-1	0	doing slightly different 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1522	2845.29	2847.49	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but it's it's it's anyway i i i 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1523	2845.8	2845.99	I	PhD	b	-1	0	but 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1524	2847.32	2858.4	I	PhD	fg|s^cc	-1	0	yeah anyway i i i should really reserves uh any conclusions until we large training set 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1526	2858.85	2859.09	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah at some point also might 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1527	2859.09	2871.78	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	at some point also might want to take the same thing and try it on uh some broadcast news date or something else but actually it's it's noisy nice you component so i can see if any conclusions become to holds us different today 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1525	2858.68	2858.97	I	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1528	2859.94	2860.2	I	PhD	b	-1	0	at some point also might want to take the same thing 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1529	2870.77	2870.96	I	PhD	b	-1	0	us 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1530	2873.85	2874.23	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	with this i 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1531	2874.0	2875.67	I	PhD	s	-1	0	with this i have to leave 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1533	2876.25	2876.48	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay just 
Bmr024.H.dialogueact1532	2876.2	2876.32	H	Grad	b	-1	0	okay just 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1534	2876.75	2878.77	D	Professor	qy^tc.%--	+1	2	okay just something quick about absence uh then 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1535	2876.82	2877.39	I	PhD	s	-1	0	okay just something quick about absence then 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact1536	2878.73	2883.14	F	Grad	h|s	-1	0	uh just what we were talking about before which is that i ordered a blast library taps into and then got 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact1537	2883.37	2885.76	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and then got started working with fast forward 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact1538	2886.27	2891.37	F	Grad	s	+1	2	and thought i speed up roughly proportional to the number of processors times the clock cycle so that's pretty 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1539	2886.31	2886.53	I	PhD	b	-1	0	and thought 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact1540	2891.37	2892.35	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so that's pretty good um 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1541	2891.69	2891.94	I	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	so that's pretty 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1542	2892.39	2892.61	I	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	good um 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact1543	2892.95	2894.95	F	Grad	s	-1	0	good um i'm in the process of doing it for quick net that 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact1544	2894.95	2896.39	F	Grad	s	-1	0	it for quick net that there's something going wrong and it's about half 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact1545	2896.39	2899.46	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	wrong and it's about half the speed that i was estimating it should be and i'm not sure 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact1546	2899.46	2900.35	F	Grad	s	-1	0	be and i'm not sure why but i'll 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1547	2899.56	2899.85	I	PhD	b	-1	0	be and i'm not sure 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact1548	2900.87	2901.78	F	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	why but i'll keep working on it but uh 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact1549	2901.78	2908.68	F	Grad	s	+1	2	keep working on it but uh well i mean is it's likely that for net training and poured passes will absence will be a good machine 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact1550	2909.26	2912.11	F	Grad	s	+1	2	especially if we get a few more processors and upgrade the processors humor 
Bmr024.I.dialogueact1551	2912.9	2913.88	I	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	humor crosses in so many

Bmr024.D.dialogueact1609	3004.76	3010.32	D	Professor	fh|s^co	-1	0	like that um uh you know maybe maybe will involved and it's some some levels 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact1610	3009.17	3009.48	F	Grad	b	-1	0	some some levels 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1611	3011.61	3012.0	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	okay 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1612	3012.86	3019.94	D	Professor	s^cs^tc	-1	0	okay the the t. is is going so uh actually just we do uh in unison 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact1613	3020.18	3021.13	F	Grad	qy^bu^d	-1	0	unison digits was just 
Bmr024.A.dialogueact1614	3021.3	3021.56	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	was just 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1615	3021.42	3021.67	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	was just 
Bmr024.D.dialogueact1617	3022.14	3022.52	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	going to be a little hard for 
Bmr024.F.dialogueact1616	3021.79	3025.07	F	Grad	s	-1	0	was just going to be a little hard for a couple of people because we have different digit forms we uh
