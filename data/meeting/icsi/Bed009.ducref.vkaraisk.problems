A native english speaker will have to oversee the generator translation and resolve any grammar issues that may arise.
A few issues regarding the ongoing development of the project came into focus.
The current M3L specifications are incomplete as to tourist path information and intention recognition.
The current parser itself extracts no syntactic information.
A more sophisticated parser is needed , yet most of the available ones would not satisfy the speed requirements of the project.
The belief-net whose inputs include the parse , is not fully instantiated yet: some rules of combination and conditional probabilities are not there yet.
Also underspecified are the details of the interaction between different modules: the dialogue manager and action planner , although separate modules , need to interact closely and update each other's state.
The current dialogue manager is also designed with a much narrower domain in mind.
Finally , some ambiguities and other terminology issues were identified , although it is not clear how difficult changes may be.
