Bmr026.F.dialogueact126	249.91	252.84	F	PhD	qrr.%-	+1	2	oh that's a good point compressed version or what you have scripted like and compress the various pieces and 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact127	252.269	253.159	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	oh that's a good point pieces and 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact128	254.22	254.87	A	Grad	s^ba^r	-1	0	that's a good point yeah 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact129	254.95	263.53	A	Grad	h|s	+1	2	that's a good point yeah it's it's probably going to have to be the young compressed versions because uh uh it takes too long to do random access decompression 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact130	262.7	263.15	F	PhD	b	-1	0	random access decompression 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact131	264.73	269.55	F	PhD	s.%-	+1	1	well i was the other point yeah i was just wondering because we're uh running out of be i'm backed up disk space and 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact132	268.867	269.767	A	Grad	s	-1	0	well i was the other point i'm backed up disk space and 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact133	270.17	270.74	F	PhD	qy^bu	-1	0	yeah that's i was another knocking how

Bmr026.A.dialogueact139	277.55	280.14	A	Grad	h|s	+1	2	too um starve a demo status not much to say the back and stuff is 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact140	280.14	282.11	A	Grad	s	+1	2	the back and stuff is working out fine it's more or less ready 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact141	282.25	283.63	A	Grad	s	-1	0	it's more or less ready to go i've added 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact142	283.63	290.2	A	Grad	s	+1	1	to go i've added some stuff that uh in s. indexes by the meeting type m. r. e. d. u. et cetera and also by the 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact143	290.2	291.77	A	Grad	s	+1	1	and also by the user id 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact144	292.6	295.31	A	Grad	s	+1	1	so that the friend and can and do filtering based on that as well uh 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact145	295.89	303.05	A	Grad	fh|s	+1	2	well uh the back and is uh going more slowly atlas i think i said before just because i'm not much of a tickle t. k. programmer and uh 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact146	303.5	306.63	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and uh they've gal bart says he's a little too busy so i think 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact147	306.63	311.64	A	Grad	s	-1	0	too busy so i think dawn and i are going to work on that and and you and i can just talk about it offline more 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact148	311.5	311.72	E	Grad	b	-1	0	more 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact149	313.16	315.47	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	but uh the back and was pretty smooth so i think we'll 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact150	314.247	314.687	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	the back and was pretty 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact151	315.47	317.02	A	Grad	s	-1	0	smooth so i think we'll have something you may not 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact152	317.58	321.87	A	Grad	s	-1	0	you may not be as that's pretty as we might like go have something i 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact153	321.926	324.316	B	Professor	s	-1	0	have something i wonder when when we reached a saturation point sort of the 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact154	324.316	326.546	B	Professor	s	-1	0	point sort of the involuntary for everything and 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact156	326.614	326.894	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	everything and 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact155	326.546	327.876	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	everything and and uh 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact157	327.032	327.622	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and uh 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact158	329.597	329.987	B	Professor	s^fe^rt	-1	0	okay 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact159	329.987	331.037	B	Professor	s	-1	0	okay i said he was too busy i 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact160	332.007	332.737	B	Professor	s	-1	0	guess we reached it 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact161	333.206	336.096	A	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	yeah he actually he volunteered but denny's penny retracted it's so oh well 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact162	336.096	336.406	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	so oh well 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact163	336.826	337.216	A	Grad	s^bd	-1	0	so oh well um 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact164	337.91	338.47	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	um 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact165	339.56	344.885	E	Grad	fg|s^tc	+1	2	and also um i was just showing address i got i'm an ex ways kind of display and i 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact166	344.885	346.795	E	Grad	s^no	+1	2	kind of display and i don't know how much more we can do with it with like 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact167	346.795	353.095	E	Grad	s	+1	2	oh cool we can do with it with like the person like stuff for we have like style eyes pitches and signals and the transcripts in the bottom so right now it's just 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact168	350.039	350.459	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	cool signals and 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact169	353.095	354.605	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so right now it's just an ex ways and we have three 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact170	354.605	355.585	E	Grad	s	-1	0	an ex ways and we have three windows but 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact171	355.585	357.245	E	Grad	s	-1	0	windows but i don't know it's pretty nice i'm sure that 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact172	357.245	360.53	E	Grad	s	-1	0	for demo i'm sure that they get as potential for a little something yeah 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact173	359.44	359.94	A	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	for demo a little 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact174	360.53	361.83	E	Grad	s^aa^r	-1	0	yeah sounds good something yeah for a demo 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact175	361.05	361.63	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah sounds good for a demo 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact176	362.46	362.75	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact177	363.194	370.784	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	okay so again the issues for july is going to be what can we fit into a windows machine um 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact179	370.784	370.874	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact178	370.39	370.67	E	Grad	b	-1	0	um 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact180	371.5	371.79	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact181	372.013	373.253	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so might just be flights yeah okay 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact182	373.42	374.28	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah okay well 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact184	374.789	375.989	C	PhD	b	-1	0	well we'll see 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact183	374.7	376.7	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	well we'll see um 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact185	377.059	379.859	C	PhD	s	+1	2	i've been putting together a transcriber things from windows so 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact186	379.859	380.469	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	things from windows so and i 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact187	380.649	384.559	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and i saw that on they scuttled p. c. n. and breakfast fine so 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact188	384.559	386.009	C	PhD	s	-1	0	fine so hopefully it will work really so that because 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact189	385.39	385.68	D	PhD	qy^bh	-1	0	hopefully it will work really so that 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact190	385.68	386.2	D	PhD	qy^rt.%--	-1	0	hopefully it will work really so that because 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact191	386.886	388.156	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	because there's some people um it would be cool 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact192	388.73	392.27	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	it would be cool if we could i guess that's work uh but that's all right because they 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact193	391.122	391.242	C	PhD	b	-1	0	but that's all 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact195	392.449	392.609	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	right because they 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact194	392.27	394.25	D	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	right because they 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact197	395.1	400.656	A	Grad	s	+1	1	so transcriber is tickle t. k.'s very generic with snack so basically mean we have more windows machines 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact196	395.07	398.03	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so transcriber is tickle t. k.'s mean we have more windows machines 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact198	399.409	399.549	C	PhD	b	-1	0	very generic 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact199	400.746	403.756	A	Grad	s	-1	0	with snack so basically anything you can get snack to run on it will work yeah but but the problem 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact200	400.88	401.45	D	PhD	b	-1	0	with snack so basically anything you can get snack 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact201	401.623	401.853	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	anything you can get snack 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact202	403.1	403.16	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	it will work but but the problem 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact203	403.16	409.6	C	PhD	s	+1	1	it will work but but the problem is the version transcriber expose this neck version is one point six whatever and 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact204	409.92	411.84	C	PhD	s	-1	0	whatever and that's not anymore it's pulled it it's not 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact205	411.84	413.4	C	PhD	s	-1	0	it's pulled it it's not on on about page anymore but i 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact206	413.78	416.74	C	PhD	s	-1	0	anymore but i jobs through an email to the to the although the snake will find you sent 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact207	416.74	419.64	C	PhD	s	-1	0	well the snake will find you sent me know one point six whatever library and so 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact209	419.887	422.757	A	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	well i thought it was packaged with transcriber library and so it breaks yeah but 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact208	419.64	420.59	C	PhD	s	-1	0	well i thought it was packaged library and so it breaks 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact210	422.575	422.875	C	PhD	s^aap	-1	0	transcriber yeah but 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact211	422.925	425.045	C	PhD	s^arp	-1	0	transcriber yeah but then you kind of at our patches that then 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact212	425.045	428.14	C	PhD	s	-1	0	oh that then that then you version is is totally different and 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact213	426.14	426.45	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	oh that then you version 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact214	428.14	431.11	C	PhD	s	-1	0	uh and and yeah in terms of if the off code you you confines 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact216	431.471	431.751	A	Grad	b	-1	0	uh you you confines 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact215	431.46	433.13	C	PhD	s	-1	0	uh you you confines it took defies anymore it's some 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact217	433.13	435.55	C	PhD	s	-1	0	it's some whatever rep thing and you're 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact218	434.115	434.485	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	whatever rep 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact219	435.55	437.12	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	thing and you're kind kind exit that so you have 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact220	437.12	441.128	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so you have to install justin still tickled then install snack and then install the transcriber 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact221	441.128	442.838	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and then install the transcriber thing and then 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact222	442.838	444.7	C	PhD	s	-1	0	patch uh thing and then do the patch i i 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact223	444.492	444.852	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	patch uh the patch i i 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact225	444.992	445.232	A	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	patch uh the patch yeah i i wonder if if we should 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact224	444.517	452.044	D	PhD	s^cs.%-	-1	0	patch uh we have yeah the patch yeah i i wonder if if we should contribute dollar changes back to the author so that they maintain those changes along 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact226	445.13	445.28	C	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah wonder if if we should 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact227	449.075	449.225	C	PhD	b	-1	0	author so that they 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact228	451.428	451.828	A	Grad	s	-1	0	we have changes along 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact230	452.858	454.728	A	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah that's just hasn't made is release yet 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact229	452.454	452.774	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^m^rt	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact231	452.974	453.214	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah that's just hasn't made is 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact232	454.58	455.13	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	release yet so did you 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact233	455.63	460.911	F	PhD	qr^tc.%--	-1	0	so did you um put thee uh into the n. t. varies now and the recorded pager 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact234	461.2	462.23	C	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	no i haven't done that yet and 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact235	462.51	463.12	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	yet and no 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact236	463.12	463.91	C	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	no 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact237	464.49	465.7	C	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	but i definitely will do that 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact238	466.448	470.078	B	Professor	qy^tc	-1	0	so can some of the stuff that i'm talking about somehow fit into this 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact239	471.257	474.837	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	i mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with uh yeah 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact240	474.25	474.49	E	Grad	b	-1	0	with uh yeah 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact242	476.05	476.44	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	basically ask if i was 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact241	475.83	478.95	E	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah it's basically ask if i was a planner files whatever representation 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact243	479.37	480.16	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	just three different it's away 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact244	480.28	484.956	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	it's away form and stylish pitch factor basically so it's 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact246	485.924	487.884	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	so i mean we could get a map i mean you can do it and number 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact245	485.676	489.396	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so but but it would i mean we could get a map i mean you can do it and number of different places i'm sure 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact247	489.072	503.97	D	PhD	s^cs	+1	4	it'd be easy enough to add that again it's it's yeah but but it would be cool if the transcriber interface had like another window for the you know maybe about the way for them when they show some arbitrary valued function that is that is you know times thinker that i tight times thinking it's with the way form i'm sure yeah yeah that is very cool 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact248	491.522	491.702	C	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah interface 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact249	495.65	495.9	E	Grad	b	-1	0	them when they show yeah 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact251	499.291	499.641	B	Professor	b	-1	0	is that is yeah that is very cool 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact250	499.23	500.06	E	Grad	s^aa^ba	-1	0	it'd be easy enough is that is you know times thinker that yeah that is very cool 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact252	500.357	501.867	A	Grad	s	-1	0	it'd be easy enough to add that again you know times thinker that i 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact253	501.867	505.577	A	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	to add that again it's it's it's more tickle t. k. programming so someone i tight times thinking it's with the way form 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact254	504.13	504.31	E	Grad	b	-1	0	it's more tickle t. k. programming 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact255	505.577	508.137	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so someone is familiar tickle t. k. has to do it but uh it wouldn't 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact256	505.827	506.447	D	PhD	b	-1	0	so someone is familiar tickle 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact258	508.257	509.747	A	Grad	s	-1	0	it but uh it wouldn't be hard to do 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact257	507.784	508.164	D	PhD	b	-1	0	t. k. has to do it but uh it wouldn't 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact259	510.29	512.7	D	PhD	s	-1	0	yep but it would almost be like having another way from displayed 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact261	512.876	513.066	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yep displayed right 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact263	513.074	513.264	C	PhD	b	-1	0	right 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact262	512.89	513.24	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	yep displayed right

Bmr026.C.dialogueact266	516.295	517.905	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	yeah maybe we could look into that 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact267	518.01	518.2	E	Grad	b	-1	0	but it it 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact268	518.689	520.577	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	but it it seems to me that i 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact269	518.815	519.045	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	but it it seems to me that 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact270	521.21	524.29	A	Grad	s	-1	0	it doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary say it seems to me 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact271	524.29	526.63	A	Grad	s	-1	0	say it seems to me you could do images 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact272	527.56	529.94	E	Grad	h|qw	-1	0	um what do you mean by realtime 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact273	529.94	531.09	E	Grad	qy.%-	-1	0	do you mean by realtime you mean like like being able to scroll through and 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact274	530.71	533.14	F	PhD	s^bu^rt	-1	0	you mean like okay like being able to scroll through and stuff for the demo 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact275	532.58	532.88	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay stuff for the demo 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact277	534.22	534.94	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah just yeah it is know what you mean yeah 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact276	534.19	534.71	F	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	yeah just yeah it is know what you mean yeah 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact279	535.01	535.8	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	seems to me just it'd be cool to 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact280	535.24	536.65	E	Grad	s.x	-1	0	seems to me just it'd be cool to see it it would be

Bmr026.E.dialogueact284	540.42	542.04	E	Grad	s	+1	4	sure yeah and see the pitch contour is also i think it 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact287	542.578	546.808	A	Grad	s^aap|s^nd	-1	0	sure but i don't think i you can do all that just adequate in powerpoint i think it was 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact286	542.155	542.325	C	PhD	b	-1	0	sure i think it 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact288	542.63	543.62	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	sure but i don't think i think it was 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact289	547.35	548.34	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	just record the audio yeah i mean right 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact290	548.043	550.853	A	Grad	s.%-	+1	4	just record the audio clip and showing image i think that's right right i just got few human 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact291	548.72	549.82	E	Grad	fg	-1	0	just record the audio clip and showing image right right 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact292	550.36	556.57	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	i think that's you know what i just got few human side i thought you meant like just uh would you grass or something 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact293	556.486	557.086	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	you know what yeah so or something 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact294	557.086	557.406	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah so 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact295	557.406	558.326	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	yeah so now we're kind of on 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact296	558.326	559.646	B	Professor	s	-1	0	now we're kind of on the computer and right 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact298	559.886	565.476	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	the computer and and um i think when we were talking about this before we had little this little demo meeting right 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact297	559.81	560.08	E	Grad	b	-1	0	the computer and and right 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact299	566.046	570.376	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you sort of set up a range of different degrees of life mess that you could have and 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact300	570.986	577.156	B	Professor	s	+1	4	have and mm the more lives a better butts uh given the crunch of time we may have to retreat from it to some extent so i think 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact301	577.156	585.566	B	Professor	s	+1	4	so i think for a lot of reasons i think i'd be very nice to have this transcriber interface be able to shows some other interesting signal along with it so 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact302	583.848	584.328	D	PhD	b	-1	0	interesting signal along 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact303	585.626	587.396	B	Professor	s	-1	0	with it so to be good thing to get in there 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact304	587.686	587.886	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	in there 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact305	588.776	595.025	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	right just just looking for ways that we can actually show what you're doing 
Bmr026.E.dialogueact306	593.15	593.46	E	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact307	596.029	603.479	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it's a lot of the stuff ticket for communicator that's certainly significant chunk the things we we've terms about originally had had to do with preside 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact308	604.294	607.473	B	Professor	s	-1	0	nice to show that we can actually kept him in 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact310	606.163	606.573	D	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr026.E.dialogueact309	605.799	606.579	E	Grad	b	-1	0	actually kept him in 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact311	612.03	615.56	A	Grad	s^tc	+1	1	unless that vitamin need in day is disc issues yet again so we're 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact312	615.56	617.83	A	Grad	s	-1	0	again so we're doing okay on backed up we're 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact313	617.88	621.66	A	Grad	s	+1	2	backed up we're we're only about thirty percent on all uh second desk 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact314	622.35	626.36	A	Grad	s	+1	1	so uh we have a little bit of time before that becomes critical but we are 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact315	626.36	632.05	A	Grad	s	+1	2	but we are like ninety five percent ninety eight percent on the scratch desks for the expanded meetings 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact316	632.362	632.512	C	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr026.A.dialogueact317	633.17	637.73	A	Grad	s^rt	+1	1	and my original intention was like we would just delete them and we need more space but unfortunately 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact318	637.73	644.55	A	Grad	s	+1	1	more space but unfortunately we're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data all at once and a lot of different ways there's a lot 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact319	644.669	644.889	C	PhD	b	-1	0	ways there's a lot 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact320	644.68	646.04	F	PhD	s	-1	0	ways yeah there are a lot of transcribers there's a lot of transcribers too 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact321	646.305	647.355	A	Grad	s^bk|s^m	-1	0	yeah there are a lot of transcribers all those need 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact322	646.545	646.735	C	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah there are a lot of transcribers 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact323	647.355	649.085	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	all those need to be expanded and then people 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact325	649.085	657.07	A	Grad	s^rt^t	-1	0	and then people are doing sean king and i want to do uh uh uh the permission form so i want those to be life 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact324	648.968	649.398	F	PhD	b	-1	0	to be expanded and then people 
Bmr026.C.dialogueact326	650.153	650.473	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	are doing sean 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact327	653.47	653.74	F	PhD	b	-1	0	uh 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact328	657.07	660.29	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so i want those to be life so there's a lot of data that has to be around 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact329	661.19	665.83	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um and jane was going to talk too i gave johnson about it one of 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact330	665.83	668.49	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	johnson about it one of the things i was thinking is we we just got these hundred our excuse

Bmr026.A.dialogueact340	676.53	681.6	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	up yet and so it seems to me we could paying scratch disk on those because they'll be in the machine room they'll be on 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact341	681.6	684.44	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	room they'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines and 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact342	684.91	688.08	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and if we just need on backed up space we just hang discs off them well is there

Bmr026.F.dialogueact509	919.74	924.9	F	PhD	s	+1	1	yeah why send that message on to i guess you and dave asking for if we can get some desk i said 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact510	922.511	922.821	B	Professor	b	-1	0	you and dave asking 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact511	924.9	927.66	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and put where we can get some desk i said i sent this out uh uh a day ago but then 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact512	925.467	926.257	A	Grad	qw	-1	0	and put where i sent this out uh uh a 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact513	925.799	926.059	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and put where i sent this out uh uh a 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact514	927.66	932.066	F	PhD	s	-1	0	day ago but then they didn't response i don't i don't know how the whole process works i mean does he just 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact515	932.066	934.926	F	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	yep i mean does he just go out and get them in if it's okay and 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact516	934.17	934.31	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yep if it's okay and 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact517	935.81	937.79	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so i was assuming he was going to take over that but 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact518	937.79	939.82	F	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah i think over that but he's probably too busy given that he's leaving 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact519	939.774	941.814	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	yeah i think you need a direct conversation with them and that he's leaving 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact520	941.994	944.934	B	Professor	s^cs:qw	-1	0	with them and just can't say it just asking that you know what what should you do 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact521	945.474	947.964	B	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	in in my answer back wizard issue just someone 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact522	948.124	955.854	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well i know so i mean i think to what you want to do is plan has a little bit and secure well here's what we of grand doing for the next few months 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact523	948.473	948.663	F	PhD	b	-1	0	so i mean i think 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact524	955.252	956.642	A	Grad	s	-1	0	well i know what they want that few months 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact525	956.842	960.632	A	Grad	s	+1	1	what they want that says edmonds would prefer to have one external drive per machine 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact527	961.082	963.312	A	Grad	s	+1	1	so they don't want to stack up external drives um 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact526	961.035	961.325	B	Professor	b	-1	0	so they don't want to stack 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact528	963.97	966.53	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um and then they want everything else in the machine or 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact529	967.629	967.849	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr026.A.dialogueact530	968.9	970.46	A	Grad	qw	-1	0	so the question is where are you going to hang up 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact531	971.154	971.694	F	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr026.F.dialogueact532	972.22	974.46	F	PhD	s	-1	0	right i don't know what the space situation is in the machine room 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact533	974.792	975.042	A	Grad	b	-1	0	right room 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact534	975.718	976.028	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact535	978.038	978.258	B	Professor	b	-1	0	so this is a question 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact536	978.258	981.158	B	Professor	s	+1	4	so this is a question is pretty hard to solve without talking today dave concerned i think part of the reason why dave can't get 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact537	978.334	978.734	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	so this is a question 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact538	980.32	986.25	F	PhD	s	+1	1	yep without talking today dave concerned one one one i think part of the reason why dave can't get the the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine room right now we have to rearrange 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact539	981.218	981.588	B	Professor	s^df.%-	-1	0	concerned why dave can't get 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact540	982.78	983.02	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	one the the new machines up is because 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact541	983.71	983.91	D	PhD	%	-1	0	machines up is because 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact542	985.367	985.537	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yep one in the machine room right 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact543	985.79	992.131	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yep one one one one thing too and to um to do when you were need to consider spaces i bet there's in the machine room right now we have to rearrange of stuff 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact544	986.25	987.62	F	PhD	s	-1	0	one one now we have to rearrange of stuff 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact545	992.718	997.18	D	PhD	s	-1	0	i bet there's still some old i like nine gig this uh around and you can probably consolidate 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact546	997.18	999.66	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and you can probably consolidate them onto larger this and and 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact547	999.66	1001.77	D	PhD	s	-1	0	yep this and and you know her the space 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact548	1001.82	1002.05	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yep yeah i know i think space 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact549	1002.68	1002.77	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah i know i think 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact550	1002.77	1002.9	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah i know i think 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact551	1002.9	1005.08	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah i know i think they've they've done is always things person and 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact553	1005.08	1012.27	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but i i know that generally their and so he always has a a lot of plans of things is going to do to make things better in many ways and i rent out of time 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact552	1004.82	1005.09	D	PhD	b	-1	0	is always things person and 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact554	1010.29	1010.75	D	PhD	b	-1	0	but i ways and i 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact555	1010.79	1015.1	A	Grad	s	-1	0	but i i know that generally their first priority has been for backed up this desk and so i think what he's ways and i rent out of time 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact556	1015.1	1022.6	A	Grad	s	+1	1	desk and so i think what he's been concentrating on is uh the back but uh backup system rather than on your disk so 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact557	1017.85	1018.2	D	PhD	b	-1	0	is uh the back 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact558	1022.07	1022.33	D	PhD	b	-1	0	disk so 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact559	1022.86	1023.1	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	disk so 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact562	1026.25	1026.52	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	which some but this this is a 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact560	1025.84	1026.14	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	which well some but this this is a 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact561	1026.14	1026.29	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	which some but this this is a 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact563	1026.29	1028.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	which some but this this is a very specific question forming basically 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact564	1028.29	1032.22	B	Professor	s	-1	0	basically we can easily get one four discs i mean you just got good 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact565	1032.22	1034.5	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean you just got good for and got the money for it it's no big deal 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact566	1034.5	1035.31	B	Professor	s	-1	0	for it it's no big deal uh 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact567	1035.95	1037.77	B	Professor	fh|qo	-1	0	uh but the question is where they go 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact568	1038.08	1039.28	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and i don't think we can solve it here is just asking that we can put some this 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact570	1039.28	1040.12	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	here is just asking that we can put some this and not 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact569	1039.17	1041.77	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	yeah here is just asking that we can put some this and not back from there 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact571	1042.07	1042.48	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	really 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact572	1044.27	1045.11	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	popcorn that that's too 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact573	1045.66	1046.15	A	Grad	s	-1	0	popcorn to the machine

Bmr026.D.dialogueact586	1061.19	1062.3	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and also on oh 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact588	1062.34	1065.02	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and also on the list is to get it on the normal like seeing that but 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact589	1065.1	1067.54	A	Grad	qh	-1	0	but who knows when that will happen they might be 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact591	1068.08	1069.19	D	PhD	s	-1	0	no but that can't be that hard i mean good short term solution 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact590	1067.66	1070.44	F	PhD	s	-1	0	will happen no the the problem with that but that can't be that hard i mean they might be good short term solution 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact592	1069.19	1069.48	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	no i mean short term solution 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact593	1070.02	1077.59	A	Grad	s	-1	0	the the problem with that apparently is that they don't currently have a wire running to that back room that goes anywhere near one of the exceed 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact594	1078.06	1078.55	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	so 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact595	1078.79	1081.4	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so they actually have to run a wire somewhere 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact596	1081.84	1082.01	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah it 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact597	1082.87	1086.7	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah it then you know anyone of these things certainly not a big deal if there is 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact598	1086.7	1093.44	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	but they've has to do all of them a big deal if there is a person dedicated to doing it have happened pretty easily but it's it's never ever everybody everybody has a has well 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact599	1090.78	1092.13	A	Grad	s^arp	-1	0	but they've has to do all of them it's never ever everybody everybody has a 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact600	1093.8	1096.34	B	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	has well all of us this of the things they're doing 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact601	1097.29	1101.06	B	Professor	s	+1	5	but i agree i think that there's a there's a longer term thing in his immediate need and i think we need to 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact602	1101.06	1103.17	B	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	and i think we need to a conversation with 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact603	1103.96	1109.49	B	Professor	fh|s^cs.x	-1	0	uh maybe maybe after after tea or something you know i can go down and and talk to him

Bmr026.B.dialogueact739	1401.53	1402.72	B	Professor	qw^cs	-1	0	well would start was that and 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact740	1401.76	1405.17	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	well would start was that and then if we find you know we're just not getting enough done there's all these topics 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact741	1402.85	1409.48	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	2	was that and then if we find you know we're just not getting enough done there's all these topics not coming up then we can expand into another meeting but i i think 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact742	1407.34	1407.84	D	PhD	b	-1	0	then we can 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact743	1409.48	1411.08	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	meeting but i i think that's a great idea 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact744	1411.63	1420.29	B	Professor	fh|s^cs.%--	+1	3	sad about it with us and jane get you if they think yeah that would be good i mean andreas

Bmr026.D.dialogueact773	1494.07	1495.94	D	PhD	s^bd.%--	-1	0	well it it was a little bit of a 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact772	1493.7	1493.96	F	PhD	s^bk^fe	-1	0	uh oh 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact774	1498.11	1498.7	D	PhD	s	-1	0	the overall they 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact775	1498.87	1503.79	D	PhD	s	+1	2	the overall they they wear the veils i think were slightly better than the females are slightly worse but nothing really i mean 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact776	1499.16	1499.71	F	PhD	b	-1	0	they wear the veils 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact778	1504.02	1504.32	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	definitely not significant 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact777	1503.79	1505.09	D	PhD	s	-1	0	really i mean definitely not significant and 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact779	1504.44	1505.08	F	PhD	b.%	-1	0	definitely not significant and 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact780	1505.85	1511.74	D	PhD	s	+1	2	wow and then the really nice thing with that is if we combine the two systems we got to one and a half percent improvement 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact781	1511.45	1511.7	A	Grad	b	-1	0	wow improvement 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact783	1512.79	1513.46	A	Grad	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	just with the rover so 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact782	1512.36	1512.79	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	just with so

Bmr026.D.dialogueact785	1514.38	1518.6	D	PhD	s	-1	0	with investor over which is like our new and improved version of for over which 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact786	1518.2	1518.44	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	of for over which 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact787	1518.79	1524.25	D	PhD	s	+1	1	so of for over which actually uses the whole investments from both systems 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact788	1524.81	1533.57	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so i said to me the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing it and it's just uh other aggressive versus uh because the vacation 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact789	1531.97	1532.29	D	PhD	b	-1	0	uh because the vacation 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact790	1533.98	1534.5	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and be but

Bmr026.D.dialogueact795	1536.96	1545.56	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah that's pretty impressive and and so uh after i told the my uh comics that's wry about that you know now they definitely want to you know to have it next time 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact796	1545.56	1551.07	D	PhD	s	-1	0	to have it next time we haven't even nation they want to do uh you know the kid at least assist in common

Bmr026.A.dialogueact804	1566.86	1569.67	A	Grad	s	-1	0	futures you know we did guilty and no caster let's 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact805	1569.67	1572.56	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	no caster let's you know try ross uh an m. s. g. and oh i mean yeah well right so 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact806	1570.36	1570.87	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	you know try ross uh oh i mean yeah

Bmr026.D.dialogueact809	1572.5	1572.8	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and right so 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact810	1572.8	1573.59	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and right so we could yeah 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact811	1573.59	1573.87	D	PhD	b	-1	0	we could yeah 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact812	1574.07	1575.54	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	that's they there's one 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact813	1575.73	1580.17	D	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	they there's one thing i mean you don't want to overdo it because every friends and you know if you 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact814	1580.34	1586.13	D	PhD	s	+1	1	you know if you you know you if you multiply effort by and number and it's a number of different systems in 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact815	1580.71	1580.86	F	PhD	b.%	-1	0	you know if you 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact816	1586.05	1586.62	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	in 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact817	1586.13	1587.5	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	in um so 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact818	1587.62	1598.49	D	PhD	s	-1	0	um so so one one um compromise would be to only to have the everything up to the point regenerate gladys is because he one system and then 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact819	1598.49	1602.99	D	PhD	s	-1	0	system and then after that to re score lettuce this was the multiple systems and 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact820	1602.99	1607.45	D	PhD	s	-1	0	multiple systems and combine results and that's a fairly painless do you think 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact821	1604.67	1605.04	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and that's a fairly painless 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact822	1607.18	1607.61	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	do you think 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact824	1608.17	1608.3	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	we'd still get the one 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact823	1607.76	1609.97	F	PhD	qy^rt.%--	-1	0	i do you think we'd still get the one and a half so 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact825	1610.06	1610.84	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	i think so 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact826	1611.33	1611.6	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact827	1612.06	1614.75	D	PhD	s	-1	0	maybe less because at that point yeah right so lower and so 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact828	1614.75	1615.35	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so lower and so you know maybe 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact830	1615.73	1619.08	D	PhD	s	-1	0	you know maybe it's only one percent or something but that would still be worth while doing so 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact829	1615.63	1616.16	F	PhD	b	-1	0	you know maybe it's only one percent 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact831	1619.83	1620.19	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact832	1621.4	1625.73	D	PhD	s	-1	0	just you know from what you know that that's working out very nicely 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact833	1624.56	1624.74	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	that that's working 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact834	1627.49	1633.04	D	PhD	s^tc.%--	+1	2	and then we had some results and digits we we so 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact835	1633.25	1633.7	D	PhD	%--	-1	0	we we so 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact836	1634.0	1641.69	D	PhD	s	-1	0	this was uh run it really so that's just to get days going with this um experiments 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact837	1641.79	1642.16	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and so 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact838	1642.1	1643.78	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and so uh but as 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact839	1643.78	1650.36	D	PhD	s	-1	0	uh but as a result of um you know we were sort of wondering wise the outside system doing so well in the business and the reason is basically 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact841	1650.54	1650.76	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and the reason is basically 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact840	1650.36	1654.44	D	PhD	s	+1	2	right including are and the reason is basically that there's a whole bunch of threats each data and how five training set and 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact842	1653.13	1653.41	A	Grad	b	-1	0	right and how five training 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact843	1654.57	1656.09	B	Professor	s	-1	0	including are together yeah set and you and not all of no it's 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact844	1654.91	1655.37	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	including are together yeah set and you and 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact845	1655.96	1656.17	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	together yeah you and not all of no it's 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact846	1656.23	1656.67	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	not all of no it's 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact847	1656.78	1660.33	D	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	not all of no it's actually did this is only uh maybe if if so of it the rest 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact849	1660.93	1662.19	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	fifth of it just how much it the rest is is red is red timid 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact848	1660.6	1666.76	D	PhD	s	+1	1	fifth of it just how much right but if if it the rest is is red is red timid they'd uh and uh it just and uh and lots of travel and stuff like that 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact850	1666.33	1666.61	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	right but if if stuff like that 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact851	1666.61	1668.08	B	Professor	qw^r	-1	0	right but if if this is how much stuff like that 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact852	1672.96	1679.73	D	PhD	s	+1	1	yeah so i mean that's actually this would be maybe uh two hours 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact853	1679.18	1682.75	B	Professor	s	+1	0	yeah so i mean that's actually not that different from on the training and so but it definitely 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact854	1681.32	1681.61	D	PhD	b	-1	0	on the training 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact856	1682.75	1682.96	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and so but it definitely 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact855	1682.56	1684.61	D	PhD	s	+1	1	and so but it definitely helps to have the other outdated in there 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact858	1685.31	1685.57	B	Professor	qy^bh^d	-1	0	because we're doing 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact857	1685.18	1686.39	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	because we're doing 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact859	1685.81	1686.25	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	because we're doing 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact860	1687.21	1692.13	D	PhD	s	+1	1	you know they're right is half of what you do if you train onianta attend that uh not to metallica digits which is only 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact861	1692.53	1693.02	B	Professor	b	-1	0	which is only about two hours 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact862	1692.69	1693.37	D	PhD	qw	-1	0	which is only about two hours 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact863	1693.37	1694.61	D	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	about two hours something 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact864	1694.48	1694.67	B	Professor	b	-1	0	something 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact865	1694.99	1695.37	A	Grad	s^no	-1	0	and something 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact866	1695.71	1699.38	D	PhD	s	+1	1	and uh more read speech that definitely helps and you can't leave 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact867	1699.38	1703.3	D	PhD	s	+1	1	yeah that was the interesting and you can't leave out all the conversational data with all of them uh okay 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact869	1703.39	1704.57	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah that was the interesting thing because okay that was a right 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact868	1703.38	1704.21	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	yeah that was the interesting thing because okay that was a right 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact871	1704.57	1708.64	B	Professor	s	+1	1	thing because because uh it was apparent if you put in a bunch more data would be better but that was a right right 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact870	1704.33	1704.78	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	thing because that was a right 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact872	1704.78	1705.48	D	PhD	b	-1	0	thing because because that was a right right 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact873	1708.64	1709.5	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	would be better but but well if they're even more 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact874	1709.04	1709.67	D	PhD	b	-1	0	but well if they're even more 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact875	1709.14	1711.37	F	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	but oh yeah so well if they're even more read speech kid ever 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact876	1711.6	1711.94	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh yeah so ever 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact877	1711.94	1718.31	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	oh yeah so we only for the hot five training we're only using uh a fairly small subset of the microphone database ever 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact878	1717.49	1717.85	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	database 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact879	1718.98	1722.52	D	PhD	fh|s^cs	-1	0	like it also put um so you could be set up and probably do even better 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact880	1722.44	1730.98	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	like it also put in uh bogus condition zero from hope before from burqas news which is mostly prepared speech better 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact881	1722.58	1723.02	F	PhD	b.%	-1	0	like it also put in better 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact882	1731.7	1734.2	A	Grad	s	-1	0	not exactly read speech but it's pretty darn close 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact883	1731.91	1732.23	D	PhD	b	-1	0	not exactly read speech 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact884	1733.3	1733.62	D	PhD	b	-1	0	but it's pretty darn close 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact885	1734.32	1734.64	D	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact886	1735.42	1736.84	D	PhD	s	+1	1	no i mean if they never read speech did i mean 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact887	1736.84	1739.82	D	PhD	s	+1	1	yeah that's right read speech did i mean well show uh pick one example 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact888	1738.06	1738.27	A	Grad	b	-1	0	that's right uh 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact889	1738.57	1739.05	A	Grad	b	-1	0	that's right uh pick one example 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact890	1740.61	1741.64	D	PhD	%--	-1	0	but um 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact891	1742.32	1749.7	D	PhD	s	+1	1	so you know that might be useful for the people who are trained uh that that just just to to use something other than candidates 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact892	1747.71	1747.96	A	Grad	b.%	-1	0	just to to 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact893	1750.64	1751.72	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well they've been using tonight 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact894	1752.28	1752.55	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	but 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact895	1752.92	1753.16	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but uh they 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact896	1753.16	1761.04	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh they they uh they experimented for a while with a bunch of different databases with french and spanish and so forth because they're multi lingual times and and 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact897	1759.21	1759.85	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and so forth because they're 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact898	1761.22	1766.45	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and and uh um and actually the best results they got well we're using tonight 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact899	1767.12	1767.36	A	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact900	1767.71	1771.45	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that's what they're using now but 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact901	1770.36	1770.95	D	PhD	b	-1	0	that's what they're using 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact902	1771.45	1774.6	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	now but but yeah certainly if we 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact903	1775.42	1778.95	B	Professor	s	-1	0	if we knew what the structure of what we're doing there wasn't 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact904	1778.95	1783.37	B	Professor	s	-1	0	there wasn't and there's still bunch of messing around with different kinds of uh those are buses however them so we 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact905	1779.09	1779.56	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and there's still bunch of 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact907	1783.37	1786.99	B	Professor	s	-1	0	them so we don't know exactly which combination we're going to be going with 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact906	1783.02	1783.47	D	PhD	b	-1	0	them so we 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact908	1787.61	1793.26	B	Professor	s	-1	0	once we know then that trainable parts of it would be great to run 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact909	1792.34	1792.87	D	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact910	1793.57	1793.75	D	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact911	1795.58	1796.08	D	PhD	s^tc	-1	0	well that was that and then i guess 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact912	1796.08	1801.81	D	PhD	s^tc	+1	2	and then i guess chuck and i had some discussions about how to proceed with it and then uh system and 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact913	1801.81	1805.59	D	PhD	qy^cs^d	-1	0	system and you want to tennessee well that's that that's well i'm yeah so under 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact914	1804.45	1805.1	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	tennessee well that's that that's well i'm yeah so under 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact916	1805.58	1805.95	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	that's that that's yeah so under 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact915	1805.47	1811.07	F	PhD	s	+1	1	that's that that's okay yeah so under is uh brought over the uh alignments that the or the sri it's 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact917	1811.52	1821.03	F	PhD	s	+1	1	it's just a converting those alignment into uh label files that we can use to train uh and the that and 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact918	1821.63	1823.21	F	PhD	s	+1	1	and uh so that all training that and 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact919	1823.28	1823.81	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	that and 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact920	1824.22	1828.55	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and then one side effect of that would be that it's um that this one i would change right 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact922	1829.17	1833.71	D	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	so the m. l. p. would be trained on i think only forty six forty eight forty eight 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact921	1828.92	1829.1	F	PhD	b	-1	0	change so the m. right 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact923	1833.19	1833.43	F	PhD	s^bc	-1	0	forty eight forty eight 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact924	1833.71	1834.41	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	forty eight forty eight phones 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact925	1834.25	1834.58	F	PhD	b	-1	0	phones 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact926	1835.59	1841.66	D	PhD	s	+1	1	uh which is smaller than the and uh thought that that's pretty interesting so 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact927	1842.26	1842.49	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and that that it's a little 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact928	1842.51	1844.63	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and that that that would probably help actually because it's a little different 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact929	1842.64	1843.46	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and that that that would probably help it's a little different 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact930	1844.63	1853.35	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	actually because the fear dimensions it's less trouble probably with as far as just the 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact931	1854.45	1854.73	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	just you know 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact932	1854.73	1858.12	D	PhD	s	+1	1	just you know we want to try things like dealt us on the attendant teachers and so 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact933	1858.12	1861.1	D	PhD	s	+1	1	and so you have to most everything but two or three and so you know 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact934	1861.1	1867.45	D	PhD	s	+1	1	sure although and so you know if you're dimensions and the phone sex would be actually helpful just from a logistics 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact935	1867.67	1867.96	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	sure although 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact936	1867.96	1872.54	B	Professor	s.%-	+1	1	sure although we i mean it's not that many fewer and and and we take k. l. p. anyway so we exactly so so that was 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact937	1870.32	1870.58	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	and and and we take 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact938	1871.86	1872.3	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	k. l. p. anyway so we exactly so so that was 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact940	1872.64	1872.87	B	Professor	b	-1	0	so we so so that was 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact939	1872.3	1873.62	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so we so so that was the other thing and then we 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact941	1873.62	1882.81	D	PhD	s	+1	1	the other thing and then we want it to is just limited to maybe uh something on the same order us dimensions as we use in this and it's um front and so 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact942	1882.81	1889.96	D	PhD	s	+1	1	yeah and i think it was front and so that would mean this doing the top i don't know ten or twelve or something if the county 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact943	1888.77	1891.75	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	yeah and i think it was again check we should check with stuff and my impression 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact944	1891.75	1896.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	with stuff and my impression was that when he did that before that had very little uh using those lose much 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact945	1896.44	1896.71	D	PhD	b	-1	0	much 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact946	1897.11	1898.74	F	PhD	qy^bu^d	-1	0	yep by just taking the top whatever 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact947	1898.49	1898.64	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yep whatever 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact948	1899.01	1899.17	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact949	1899.88	1900.04	B	Professor	b	-1	0	but then and 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact950	1900.61	1900.9	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but then and 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact951	1900.9	1902.14	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but then and then something once we have the 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact952	1902.14	1915.71	D	PhD	s	+1	1	once we have the new m. l. p. train up uh one thing i wanted to try just for the fun of it plus to actually run uh like standard hybrid system that is based on you know those features uh 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact953	1915.71	1922.76	D	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	kind uh and uh retrain m. l. p. and also the you know the dictionary that we use for the five system 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact954	1923.01	1927.99	B	Professor	s	+1	1	of in the base is starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from pretty decent system exactly yeah 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact955	1926.51	1927.02	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	you got from pretty decent system exactly yeah 
Bmr026.F.dialogueact956	1926.55	1926.73	F	PhD	b	-1	0	you got from exactly 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact957	1927.84	1928.08	D	PhD	b	-1	0	pretty decent system yeah so 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact958	1928.08	1935.32	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so that would basically give us a um more hopefully you uh better system um 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact959	1929.11	1929.32	B	Professor	b	-1	0	that would basically 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact960	1935.92	1941.93	D	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um because you know compared to what eric to awhile ago where he trained up i think it just missing broadcast news something 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact961	1941.93	1945.17	D	PhD	s	-1	0	broadcast news something train retraining them switch partners 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact962	1945.17	1946.55	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact963	1945.8	1946.02	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact964	1947.34	1952.4	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but he i think he didn't he probably didn't use all the training day that was available and his dictionary 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact965	1952.4	1960.25	D	PhD	s	-1	0	that's that's and his dictionary probably wasn't as humans too conversational speech is is as a horse so 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact967	1960.59	1962.5	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	that's that's certainly one thing is so and experiment 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact966	1960.25	1960.62	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	that's that's so

Bmr026.B.dialogueact1124	2236.9	2239.46	B	Professor	s	-1	0	friends i mean they were using pretty difference in my future sets so

Bmr026.B.dialogueact1126	2240.27	2244.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i expected something had a different future set would would to benefit what

Bmr026.B.dialogueact1132	2248.62	2248.88	B	Professor	s^fa^t3	-1	0	i say is 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1133	2248.88	2254.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i say is the other thing is that what was uncommon the camera system in our system is that both for training posters 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1134	2255.21	2255.47	A	Grad	b	-1	0	right so i mean 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1136	2256.14	2256.33	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah that's another big difference that's another pretty 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1135	2255.68	2257.83	B	Professor	s	-1	0	right yeah that's another big difference so i mean that's another pretty big difference and 
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1137	2256.33	2257.45	A	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah that's another big difference that's another pretty big difference and 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1138	2257.83	2260.29	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	big difference and uh went back at least you mean with soft

Bmr026.D.dialogueact1144	2266.17	2267.68	D	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	oh what puts the keys figure 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1145	2268.06	2274.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	is that um both the cambridge system in our system where we're training posters and if we're 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1146	2274.59	2279.08	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and if we're we're coming from alignments strikes arise system it's unlikely that they system 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1147	2280.13	2281.74	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so so that's another difference i mean 
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1148	2280.18	2280.5	D	PhD	b	-1	0	so so that's 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1149	2281.74	2287.76	B	Professor	s	-1	0	another difference i mean there's different different and different different uh training criterion 
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1150	2288.75	2297.66	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um i would think that in in that in embedded training would have at least a good shot of improving it's more but we don't
