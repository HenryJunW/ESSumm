Bro022.B.dialogueact9	16.51	19.39	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh we went through a gemini went through females and one point and and for 
Bro022.B.dialogueact10	19.39	23.14	B	Professor	s	-1	0	point and and for two years there's this thing saying yeah whatever too much away from being done 
Bro022.B.dialogueact11	26.895	28.825	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it's very very believable schedules to mean 
Bro022.B.dialogueact12	28.825	30.785	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	it was true for two years schedules to mean went through and with schedules and if 
Bro022.A.dialogueact13	29.757	30.967	A	PhD	s	-1	0	it was true for two years went through and with schedules and if 
Bro022.B.dialogueact14	31.135	31.365	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah oh yeah that's 
Bro022.B.dialogueact15	31.635	31.885	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah oh yeah that's 
Bro022.B.dialogueact16	31.885	32.495	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	yeah oh yeah that's very true 
Bro022.A.dialogueact17	35.124	41.55	A	PhD	qy^cs^rt^t^tc	+1	2	so she would just do the same kind of deal where we go around and to uh status report kind of things 
Bro022.A.dialogueact18	42.848	43.108	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay i guess once 
Bro022.A.dialogueact19	43.108	46.678	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	i guess once anil gets or you can do this last or something 
Bro022.A.dialogueact21	47.348	47.578	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	yeah so we probably 
Bro022.B.dialogueact22	47.35	47.43	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah so we probably 
Bro022.B.dialogueact23	47.43	50.0	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	okay that's a good idea yeah so we probably should wait for him to come before we do this

Bro022.A.dialogueact91	155.39	156.71	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	what what you're what you're going to you said you're 
Bro022.A.dialogueact92	156.71	159.56	A	PhD	s	-1	0	you're going to you said you're talking about the uh particular features that you looking at oh the the right 
Bro022.F.dialogueact93	157.953	158.173	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	talking about the uh particular features that you oh the the

Bro022.F.dialogueact96	159.783	160.053	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	looking at right well i just 
Bro022.F.dialogueact97	160.053	160.693	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	well i just 
Bro022.F.dialogueact98	161.253	161.913	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro022.F.dialogueact99	163.285	166.295	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i think one of the perplexing problems is um 
Bro022.F.dialogueact100	166.595	166.975	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro022.F.dialogueact101	167.535	176.015	F	Grad	s	-1	0	for a while i was thinking that i had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features in intermediate categories to classify right away but what i'm thinking 
Bro022.F.dialogueact102	176.365	180.585	F	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	but what i'm thinking now is i would start with with a reasonable set 
Bro022.F.dialogueact103	181.145	187.88	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	something something like um like a regular phonetics teachers 
Bro022.F.dialogueact104	188.16	190.01	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	just to just to start off that way and 
Bro022.F.dialogueact105	190.44	192.91	F	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	and do some phone recognition 
Bro022.F.dialogueact106	193.23	203.75	F	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	um build assist um that uh classifies these um these feature ivy's intermediate categories using um multi band techniques 
Bro022.F.dialogueact107	204.73	207.8	F	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	combine them and do phony phony recognition 
Bro022.F.dialogueact108	208.42	208.79	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	look at then 
Bro022.F.dialogueact109	209.04	220.33	F	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	i would look at the errors produced in the funny recognition and say okay well i could probably reduce the errors if i included this extra feature or the sector intermediate category that 
Bro022.F.dialogueact110	220.834	224.724	F	Grad	s	-1	0	that would that would reduce certain confusion over other confusion 
Bro022.F.dialogueact111	225.795	228.245	F	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	and then and then reenter it 
Bro022.F.dialogueact112	228.885	231.885	F	Grad	fh|s^cc	-1	0	build intermediate class fires 
Bro022.F.dialogueact113	232.455	234.035	F	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	do funny recognition look at their 
Bro022.F.dialogueact114	234.465	235.435	F	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	look at their is and 
Bro022.F.dialogueact115	235.885	240.805	F	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	is and then i should new or remove um intermediate categories and 
Bro022.F.dialogueact116	240.985	241.905	F	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	categories and then do it again 
Bro022.A.dialogueact117	242.16	242.99	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	syria use tenant 
Bro022.F.dialogueact118	243.43	247.25	F	Grad	h|s^na	-1	0	um for that for that part of the process yeah i used to 
Bro022.A.dialogueact119	246.564	247.024	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah i used to 
Bro022.F.dialogueact120	248.53	249.18	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bro022.F.dialogueact121	249.6	250.79	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro022.F.dialogueact122	251.47	252.06	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	then 
Bro022.F.dialogueact123	253.24	256.56	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	after after um doing tenet right on 
Bro022.F.dialogueact124	256.56	256.91	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	tenet right on 
Bro022.A.dialogueact126	257.118	257.708	A	PhD	b	-1	0	that's 
Bro022.F.dialogueact125	256.91	262.704	F	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah tenet right on that's that's um that's just if the phone recognition task 
Bro022.A.dialogueact127	262.81	263.07	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah task uh one take a look 
Bro022.F.dialogueact128	263.034	267.374	F	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	uh one take a look at um things that can model within word so 
Bro022.F.dialogueact129	267.614	273.444	F	Grad	fh|s^cc	-1	0	so i would move i would then shift the focus to um something like switchboard 
Bro022.F.dialogueact130	274.064	282.054	F	Grad	fh|s^cc^e	-1	0	would be able to um to model intermediate categories that spanned across warnings that just within the phone 
Bro022.A.dialogueact132	282.207	282.987	A	PhD	b	-1	0	that just within the phone 
Bro022.F.dialogueact131	282.184	284.404	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	that just within the phone um 
Bro022.F.dialogueact133	284.764	285.544	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	um and then do 
Bro022.F.dialogueact134	285.544	291.554	F	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	and then do the same process there a large vocabulary test like switchboard 
Bro022.F.dialogueact135	292.393	292.933	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro022.F.dialogueact136	293.083	294.443	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	for that 
Bro022.F.dialogueact137	295.65	299.86	F	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	for that part i would i use the sri recognize there since 
Bro022.F.dialogueact138	299.86	302.93	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	recognize there since it's already set up for for switchboard i'd 
Bro022.F.dialogueact139	302.93	308.56	F	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	so that's for switchboard i'd run some some sort of tandem style processing with um my intermediate classes 
Bro022.A.dialogueact140	308.7	311.95	A	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	so that's why you're interested in getting your own features into the sri files 
Bro022.F.dialogueact141	311.09	313.99	F	Grad	s^na	-1	0	the sri files yeah that's why i was asking about the

Bro022.A.dialogueact158	342.87	344.55	A	PhD	fg|qy^co^rt	+1	2	so uh you want to go next days and will oh 
Bro022.A.dialogueact159	344.55	345.25	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	next days and will do oh okay so 
Bro022.E.dialogueact160	345.05	345.23	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	do okay so 
Bro022.E.dialogueact161	345.49	345.76	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	do okay so 
Bro022.E.dialogueact162	345.76	346.13	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	do okay so so 
Bro022.E.dialogueact163	346.66	347.48	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	so um last 
Bro022.E.dialogueact164	348.01	353.54	E	Grad	s	+1	2	week i finally got results from the sri system about this means attraction approach 
Bro022.E.dialogueact165	354.647	367.567	E	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	and um we we got an improvement of inward error rates training on the t. i. digits data set and tested on meeting recorder digits of um six percent of four point five percent um 
Bro022.E.dialogueact166	367.787	370.545	E	Grad	s^e	+1	1	um on on the farm might data 
Bro022.E.dialogueact167	371.505	372.835	E	Grad	s^e	+1	1	using p. c. m. half 
Bro022.E.dialogueact168	373.105	381.265	E	Grad	s	+1	1	but um the near my performance worse and um from one point two percent to two point four percent 
Bro022.E.dialogueact169	382.069	383.029	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bro022.E.dialogueact170	384.509	390.821	E	Grad	qw^df	+1	3	why would that be um considering that we actually an improvement in your mike performance using h. t. k. so 
Bro022.E.dialogueact171	390.821	391.281	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	h. t. k. so i was samantha 
Bro022.E.dialogueact172	391.633	395.113	E	Grad	s	+1	2	i was samantha from a andrea seven fear into parts um 
Bro022.E.dialogueact173	395.113	395.493	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro022.E.dialogueact174	396.546	400.536	E	Grad	s^e	+1	1	first of all h. d. case sir yes sir yes sir system is doing channel adaptation and 
Bro022.E.dialogueact175	401.036	403.356	E	Grad	s.%--	+1	1	so h. d. k. wasn't um 
Bro022.E.dialogueact176	403.436	403.796	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro022.E.dialogueact177	404.116	404.606	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so this um 
Bro022.E.dialogueact178	404.606	404.946	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	so this um 
Bro022.E.dialogueact179	406.27	409.55	E	Grad	s	-1	0	this means attraction approach will do it kind of channel normalization and so that 
Bro022.E.dialogueact180	409.55	413.78	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	and so that might have given d. h. d. k. u. so that boost it wouldn't apply and you sir i case 
Bro022.E.dialogueact181	414.365	420.755	E	Grad	s	+1	1	and also um the andres pointed out the s. psoriasis and he's using more crown it's it's got 
Bro022.E.dialogueact182	420.755	422.825	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	crown it's it's got finer grain acoustic models 
Bro022.E.dialogueact183	423.205	428.565	E	Grad	s^e	+1	1	so's find a great acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts in every sense of size taty uh 
Bro022.E.dialogueact184	429.5	430.18	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro022.E.dialogueact185	431.617	433.877	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and me and gary were listen to recent the audio and 
Bro022.E.dialogueact186	433.877	438.537	E	Grad	s	-1	0	the audio and sometimes it seems like you get a bit of an echo of speech in the background and 
Bro022.E.dialogueact187	438.807	442.117	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and that that seems like it could be difficult for training because you could have 
Bro022.E.dialogueact188	442.117	451.107	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because you could have different phones lined up with a different foreground phone um depending on the timing of the echo so um 
Bro022.E.dialogueact189	451.107	452.157	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bro022.E.dialogueact190	452.908	456.098	E	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	i'm going to try training on a larger data set and then the 
Bro022.E.dialogueact191	456.168	461.258	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and then the system all see more examples of these artifacts and hopefully we'll be more a bus to them sometimes 
Bro022.E.dialogueact192	461.708	465.76	E	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	them sometimes he's the microphone set of um read speech 
Bro022.E.dialogueact193	466.54	467.47	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um huh 
Bro022.E.dialogueact194	467.79	468.05	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	i um huh 
Bro022.B.dialogueact195	468.804	470.094	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i another thought this now which is um 
Bro022.B.dialogueact196	470.164	478.504	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	which is um member talking before about we were talking our meeting about um the stuff that some of the other stuff that happened on the did where they were 
Bro022.B.dialogueact197	478.504	482.894	B	Professor	s^e^rt	-1	0	on the did where they were um getting rid of low energy sections 
Bro022.B.dialogueact198	483.414	483.904	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro022.B.dialogueact199	484.304	484.924	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh that 
Bro022.B.dialogueact200	485.164	485.714	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	if you 
Bro022.B.dialogueact201	486.174	508.524	B	Professor	s	-1	0	if you did a high pass filtering as first kid late eighties to redo some of the effects of reverberations uh uh having done on a mask you were doing that um perhaps one of the reasons for that working as it may not have even been filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a and all positive power spectrum you get some negative values 
Bro022.B.dialogueact202	509.094	512.804	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and yet figure out what to do with him figures continue treating this as a power spectrum 
Bro022.B.dialogueact203	513.224	516.504	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so what what first did whiz uh them to zero the 
Bro022.B.dialogueact204	516.834	518.124	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	zero the negatives are zero so if you 
Bro022.B.dialogueact205	518.614	521.844	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so if you imagine a a way for me it's all positive which 
Bro022.B.dialogueact206	521.844	524.404	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	positive which is that time trajectory of energy 
Bro022.B.dialogueact207	525.124	532.184	B	Professor	s	-1	0	um and uh shifting it downwards and they get them as a negative parts that's actually frankly low energy things and so low 
Bro022.B.dialogueact208	532.184	536.904	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so low energy parts of the speech where the reverberations most audible 
Bro022.B.dialogueact209	537.204	540.314	B	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	have any reverberations from higher energy thing showing up in in this 
Bro022.B.dialogueact210	540.784	545.064	B	Professor	s	-1	0	in in this case you have some artificially imposed reverberations like same you getting rid of 
Bro022.B.dialogueact211	545.064	547.914	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberations 
Bro022.B.dialogueact212	548.234	553.254	B	Professor	s	-1	0	because you have these non calls the windows getting these funny things coming and uh 
Bro022.B.dialogueact213	553.624	554.304	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	and uh and 
Bro022.B.dialogueact214	554.474	554.904	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and 
Bro022.B.dialogueact215	555.644	556.124	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um what if you did 
Bro022.B.dialogueact216	556.484	557.294	B	Professor	qw.%--	-1	0	what if you did means nothing 
Bro022.B.dialogueact217	557.294	565.984	B	Professor	s	-1	0	means nothing to say that the the processing for this recent this has to be restricted trying to get it back to the original according to some equation i 
Bro022.B.dialogueact219	565.984	570.324	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	to some equation i mean you also uh just try to make it nicer 
Bro022.E.dialogueact218	565.97	566.44	E	Grad	b	-1	0	to some equation i mean you also 
Bro022.B.dialogueact221	571.391	575.071	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and one of the things you could do is you could do some sort of v. a. d. like thing actually could 
Bro022.E.dialogueact220	570.917	571.217	E	Grad	b	-1	0	and one of the things 
Bro022.B.dialogueact222	575.071	582.611	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	actually could take very low energy sections and stuff and some some uh very lower or near zero 
Bro022.B.dialogueact224	583.311	583.631	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	i mean i'm 
Bro022.B.dialogueact225	583.631	589.591	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i mean i'm just saying if in fact it turns out that that these echoes that you're hearing 
Bro022.E.dialogueact223	583.212	583.782	E	Grad	b	-1	0	i mean i'm 
Bro022.B.dialogueact226	590.231	590.921	B	Professor	s^bsc	-1	0	are pre echoes which 
Bro022.B.dialogueact227	590.921	591.551	B	Professor	s^bsc	-1	0	are pre echoes which are they are are are 
Bro022.B.dialogueact228	591.551	596.174	B	Professor	s	-1	0	are they are are are uh part of what's causing the problem you actually can get rid of 
Bro022.E.dialogueact229	599.242	599.702	E	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro022.B.dialogueact230	602.487	603.167	B	Professor	s	-1	0	pretty simple 
Bro022.B.dialogueact232	605.178	606.508	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	do you go to pretty conservative ways so that if you 
Bro022.E.dialogueact231	604.721	604.991	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro022.B.dialogueact233	606.508	611.048	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	ways so that if you made a mistake you were more likely to keep in an echo and uh throughout speech 
Bro022.E.dialogueact234	614.003	614.223	E	Grad	b	-1	0	and what is 
Bro022.G.dialogueact235	614.68	617.7	G	PhD	qw	-1	0	in this in and what is it celebration time like 
Bro022.E.dialogueact236	617.633	618.463	E	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	in this in this or that no 
Bro022.E.dialogueact238	618.853	619.073	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	this or that no uh the one what 
Bro022.G.dialogueact237	618.805	623.095	G	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	this or that yeah i no uh the one what good's in the speech that you you were using like 
Bro022.E.dialogueact239	622.85	623.67	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah i were using like 
Bro022.E.dialogueact240	623.67	625.08	E	Grad	s^no	-1	0	so this is true yeah i that that don't know 
Bro022.B.dialogueact241	625.42	626.18	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so this is true or two well 
Bro022.G.dialogueact242	626.6	626.93	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	or two well 
Bro022.B.dialogueact244	627.164	627.874	B	Professor	s^r	-1	0	if this is true so additional okay 
Bro022.G.dialogueact243	626.98	627.51	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	if this is true so or two well additional okay 
Bro022.B.dialogueact246	627.874	628.234	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	if this is true so so easy just additional okay 
Bro022.G.dialogueact245	627.59	627.96	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	if this is true so additional okay 
Bro022.B.dialogueact247	628.234	629.484	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so easy just microphone this microphone 
Bro022.B.dialogueact248	629.484	633.124	B	Professor	s	-1	0	microphone this microphone cos microphone and a distant my crown he's doing these different tests on uh 
Bro022.F.dialogueact249	629.789	630.109	F	Grad	b	-1	0	microphone this microphone cos microphone and 
Bro022.B.dialogueact250	633.634	635.184	B	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	uh we should do measurement here i could take we never have 
Bro022.B.dialogueact251	635.184	636.134	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	i could take we never have i think it's i would 
Bro022.B.dialogueact252	636.134	641.344	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	i think it's i would guess uh point seven point eight seconds r. t. sixty something like that 
Bro022.F.dialogueact253	636.988	637.198	F	Grad	b	-1	0	i think it's i would guess uh 
Bro022.B.dialogueact254	641.344	642.074	B	Professor	s	-1	0	something like that that's you 
Bro022.B.dialogueact256	642.654	643.784	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that's you know the sister 
Bro022.G.dialogueact255	642.2	642.71	G	PhD	b	-1	0	that's you 
Bro022.B.dialogueact257	644.214	644.514	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so okay 
Bro022.G.dialogueact258	644.232	644.522	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so okay 
Bro022.G.dialogueact259	645.062	645.472	G	PhD	b	-1	0	uh 
Bro022.B.dialogueact260	645.683	646.313	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bro022.B.dialogueact261	648.76	650.65	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but the other thing is he's putting in where i was using 
Bro022.B.dialogueact262	650.65	652.47	B	Professor	s	-1	0	in where i was using word reverberations into two ways he's also putting 
Bro022.B.dialogueact263	652.47	654.67	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	into two ways he's also putting in 
Bro022.B.dialogueact264	654.67	656.91	B	Professor	s	-1	0	he's taking out some reverberations he's 
Bro022.B.dialogueact265	656.91	658.04	B	Professor	s	-1	0	some reverberations he's putting in something because he has 
Bro022.B.dialogueact266	658.04	662.81	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because he has averages over multiple windows stretching out twelve seconds 
Bro022.B.dialogueact267	663.45	666.11	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	which are then thinks attracted from the speech and since 
Bro022.B.dialogueact268	666.11	671.99	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and since you know what you subtract sometimes we could be subtracting from some larger number and 
Bro022.B.dialogueact269	671.99	673.15	B	Professor	s	-1	0	some larger number and sometimes she won't and seeking 
Bro022.B.dialogueact271	673.15	673.32	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	and seeking 
Bro022.G.dialogueact270	672.8	673.53	G	PhD	b	-1	0	sometimes she won't and seeking 
Bro022.B.dialogueact272	673.87	678.47	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and seeking and to put some components in it that are affected by things that are seconds away 
Bro022.B.dialogueact273	679.243	684.813	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	energy compel portion you might actually hear some 
Bro022.G.dialogueact274	685.04	685.26	G	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro022.E.dialogueact275	686.583	695.893	E	Grad	s	+1	1	one thing um i noticed is that um i mean subtraction seems to make the t. v. on signals louder after they being desensitized 
Bro022.E.dialogueact276	696.473	703.163	E	Grad	qy^rt	+1	1	so i was wondering is it possible that one reason help with the arrow baseline system is just as a kind of gain control because some of the p. 
Bro022.E.dialogueact277	703.523	706.903	E	Grad	s^df	+1	1	because some of the p. c. m. signal sound pretty quiet if you don't amplified them 
Bro022.C.dialogueact278	708.953	709.343	C	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro022.C.dialogueact279	710.411	714.251	C	PhD	s^no	+1	1	i don't see way you sing at least that would restore processing because yeah i 
Bro022.C.dialogueact280	714.251	714.611	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	because yeah i 
Bro022.E.dialogueact281	714.82	716.2	E	Grad	s^bk|s^no	-1	0	because yeah i don't know why uh 
Bro022.C.dialogueact282	716.738	717.078	C	PhD	b	-1	0	i 
Bro022.B.dialogueact283	717.992	720.912	B	Professor	s	+1	1	i don't think just multiplying the signal like two would have 
Bro022.C.dialogueact284	720.101	720.901	C	PhD	b	-1	0	have 
Bro022.E.dialogueact285	721.332	721.602	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay 
Bro022.E.dialogueact286	721.602	721.872	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay 
Bro022.B.dialogueact287	722.31	722.46	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro022.B.dialogueact288	723.09	729.34	B	Professor	s	+1	1	i mean i think if you really have louder signals which i mean is that you have are sick noise ratio whether really 
Bro022.C.dialogueact289	723.216	723.556	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	i mean i think if you really whether really 
Bro022.B.dialogueact290	730.22	733.66	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	so if what you're doing is improving this ignores ratio than it would be better but just 
Bro022.C.dialogueact291	732.613	733.053	C	PhD	b	-1	0	ratio than it would be better but just 
Bro022.B.dialogueact292	733.66	736.65	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it would be better but just being bigger but the same signature issue it would it would affect affecting 
Bro022.E.dialogueact293	735.079	737.109	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	but the same signature issue but it would it would affect affecting okay 
Bro022.B.dialogueact296	737.46	737.61	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	but okay 
Bro022.C.dialogueact294	737.05	737.36	C	PhD	b	-1	0	but okay 
Bro022.E.dialogueact295	737.179	737.439	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	but okay 
Bro022.C.dialogueact297	738.019	746.0	C	PhD	s	-1	0	the system is use the absolute energy sweets related but depending on and uh thing that so 
Bro022.C.dialogueact298	747.191	748.751	C	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	well but not so much

Bro022.A.dialogueact353	854.08	864.157	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i'm just wondering if there's something about the um they're doing i mean normalization where uh it could cause you'd have better said no measuring show um 
Bro022.A.dialogueact354	864.867	865.287	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	um well you know there is 
Bro022.B.dialogueact355	865.458	866.698	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	well you know there is this and 
Bro022.B.dialogueact356	866.698	867.198	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	this and it it it maybe 
Bro022.B.dialogueact357	867.198	868.448	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it it it maybe

Bro022.B.dialogueact359	870.286	871.116	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yes um subjecting 
Bro022.B.dialogueact360	871.668	876.718	B	Professor	s	-1	0	subjecting the the mean long spectrum is is is like dividing by inspector 
Bro022.B.dialogueact361	877.776	886.71	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so getting but you divide by if you're if you're estimate is often sometimes you're you're you're getting a small number you could take a bigger 
Bro022.A.dialogueact362	885.02	885.38	A	PhD	b	-1	0	you could 
Bro022.E.dialogueact363	886.796	887.236	E	Grad	b	-1	0	take a bigger 
Bro022.B.dialogueact364	888.111	890.141	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so it's it's just uh question 
Bro022.B.dialogueact365	891.347	894.017	B	Professor	s	-1	0	is it it could be that there's some normalization that's missing or something 
Bro022.B.dialogueact366	894.277	894.777	B	Professor	s	-1	0	or something

Bro022.E.dialogueact367	894.876	895.296	E	Grad	b	-1	0	or something 
Bro022.B.dialogueact369	896.744	898.714	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you think it should be larger but 
Bro022.B.dialogueact370	898.714	900.294	B	Professor	s	-1	0	be larger but maybe in practice it is that's something to 
Bro022.B.dialogueact372	900.604	901.464	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that's something to think about 
Bro022.E.dialogueact371	900.429	900.659	E	Grad	b	-1	0	that's something to 
Bro022.B.dialogueact373	901.694	902.084	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	think about 
Bro022.C.dialogueact374	904.684	906.914	C	PhD	s	-1	0	had a question about the system the center i and so 
Bro022.C.dialogueact375	906.914	910.284	C	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	the center i and so you train it some gay digits 
Bro022.C.dialogueact376	911.194	918.014	C	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	but except days it's exactly the same system is the one that's west this before and the was train um microphone right so okay 
Bro022.C.dialogueact377	918.014	918.324	C	PhD	qy^d^g	-1	0	so okay 
Bro022.C.dialogueact378	918.814	921.824	C	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	so okay did you choose keeps you one point two percent error rate um 
Bro022.C.dialogueact379	921.824	924.084	C	PhD	s	-1	0	error rate um microphones to will point eight 
Bro022.C.dialogueact380	925.98	928.39	C	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	but they it exactly the same system 
Bro022.E.dialogueact381	926.012	926.342	E	Grad	h	-1	0	but they it

Bro022.B.dialogueact458	1070.79	1071.82	B	Professor	s^ar|s	+1	1	uh no it's the time 
Bro022.B.dialogueact459	1072.19	1073.12	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and they and and there's 
Bro022.G.dialogueact460	1072.29	1072.97	G	PhD	b	-1	0	and they and 
Bro022.B.dialogueact461	1073.71	1075.37	B	Professor	s	+1	1	and there's amplification afterwards and you can get 
Bro022.B.dialogueact462	1075.37	1075.99	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and you can get 
Bro022.B.dialogueact463	1076.46	1077.13	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i think was 
Bro022.B.dialogueact464	1078.41	1081.21	B	Professor	s^r.%--	-1	0	and he was in the wall street journal data that that i can remember 
Bro022.B.dialogueact465	1081.52	1082.91	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that i can remember one of the top things there 
Bro022.B.dialogueact466	1082.91	1084.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	one of the top things there was this big piece d. c. offset we didn't we 
Bro022.A.dialogueact467	1084.5	1085.23	A	PhD	b	-1	0	offset we didn't we didn't know about for a while 
Bro022.B.dialogueact468	1084.61	1087.4	B	Professor	s	-1	0	offset we didn't we didn't know about for a while where messing with a very and he's 
Bro022.B.dialogueact469	1087.4	1088.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	with a very and he's terrible results than 
Bro022.B.dialogueact470	1088.88	1091.67	B	Professor	s	-1	0	terrible results than talking to somebody and they said only i didn't you know everybody 
Bro022.B.dialogueact471	1091.67	1092.5	B	Professor	s	-1	0	didn't you know everybody knows that there's all this d. 
Bro022.B.dialogueact472	1092.5	1093.91	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	knows that there's all this d. c. helps 
Bro022.B.dialogueact473	1094.38	1094.86	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	so yes you can 
Bro022.B.dialogueact474	1094.86	1096.22	B	Professor	s	+1	1	so yes you can that they you know so that they 
Bro022.G.dialogueact475	1095.57	1095.99	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	that they you know so that they 
Bro022.B.dialogueact477	1096.69	1096.85	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro022.G.dialogueact476	1096.51	1096.84	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro022.A.dialogueact478	1098.93	1100.56	A	PhD	qo^rt	-1	0	was that was that everything they 
Bro022.E.dialogueact479	1101.55	1101.79	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	oh and i also 
Bro022.E.dialogueact480	1101.79	1106.55	E	Grad	s	+1	2	oh and i also um did some experiment's about normalized and the phase 
Bro022.E.dialogueact481	1107.34	1107.82	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro022.E.dialogueact482	1108.31	1112.32	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so i i came up with a webpage that people can take a look at and 
Bro022.E.dialogueact483	1112.82	1113.75	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bro022.E.dialogueact484	1114.73	1119.18	E	Grad	s	+1	1	the interesting thing that i tried was um adam in morgan had this idea um since 
Bro022.E.dialogueact485	1119.18	1135.14	E	Grad	s	+1	1	um since my original attempts to um take the meaning of the face spectra overtime normalize using that as a tracking that often work um so well that we thought that might be due to um problems with um the arithmetic the faces it's the ad in the 
Bro022.E.dialogueact486	1135.14	1137.15	E	Grad	s	-1	0	it's the ad in the small you look too far and 
Bro022.E.dialogueact487	1137.15	1137.48	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	and 
Bro022.E.dialogueact488	1138.06	1138.5	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro022.E.dialogueact489	1139.09	1144.88	E	Grad	s	-1	0	there's reason to believe that that approach of taking i mean if the face spectrum wasn't really mathematically correct so 
Bro022.E.dialogueact490	1144.88	1153.89	E	Grad	s	+1	1	correct so what i do instead is i took the meaning of the at fifty spectrum without taking the log or anything and i took the face of that 
Bro022.E.dialogueact491	1154.42	1157.32	E	Grad	s	+1	1	nice to track to that phase 
Bro022.E.dialogueact492	1158.4	1159.03	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	to normal i said that um 
Bro022.E.dialogueact493	1159.03	1161.75	E	Grad	s	+1	1	that um didn't work either 
Bro022.B.dialogueact494	1163.27	1164.68	B	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	see we have different or proficiency says it 
Bro022.B.dialogueact495	1164.68	1165.47	B	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	proficiency says it doesn't work i said i 
Bro022.B.dialogueact496	1165.47	1167.32	B	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	doesn't work i said i think it works making instantly but just not the task 
Bro022.B.dialogueact497	1167.32	1168.76	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but just not the task intended 
Bro022.B.dialogueact498	1170.01	1171.03	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	guess there the speech 
Bro022.A.dialogueact500	1172.95	1173.76	A	PhD	qw	-1	0	what does it leave speech 
Bro022.F.dialogueact499	1172.92	1174.22	F	Grad	s^m	-1	0	what does it leave uh at least you know at least speech 
Bro022.B.dialogueact501	1174.2	1175.61	B	Professor	h|s	-1	0	uh at least you know at least the junk i mean i 
Bro022.B.dialogueact502	1175.68	1177.5	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	the junk i mean i i think it's it's tremendous 
Bro022.F.dialogueact503	1177.78	1178.38	F	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	oh yes just 
Bro022.B.dialogueact504	1178.5	1180.69	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	oh yes just go back and reverse we did before 
Bro022.B.dialogueact505	1181.2	1182.08	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	well could you take what was left over then it's really got something exactly 
Bro022.A.dialogueact506	1181.72	1183.77	A	PhD	qy	-1	0	well could you take what was left over then subtract that it's really got something exactly yeah you yeah 
Bro022.B.dialogueact507	1183.02	1183.72	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	subtract that yeah you yeah 
Bro022.B.dialogueact509	1183.72	1184.23	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	subtract that yeah you got yeah 
Bro022.F.dialogueact510	1183.76	1184.31	F	Grad	b	-1	0	subtract that yeah you got yeah 
Bro022.G.dialogueact508	1183.42	1183.92	G	PhD	b	-1	0	subtract that yeah you yeah 
Bro022.B.dialogueact511	1186.43	1187.87	B	Professor	s^j	-1	0	so it's it's a general just it's 
Bro022.G.dialogueact512	1186.78	1187.11	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	so it's it's a general just it's 
Bro022.B.dialogueact513	1187.87	1189.54	B	Professor	s^co^j	-1	0	it's a general just listen very carefully to what i say and do the opposite 
Bro022.B.dialogueact514	1189.54	1190.3	B	Professor	s^co^j	-1	0	to what i say and do the opposite 
Bro022.B.dialogueact515	1192.62	1193.51	B	Professor	s^co^j	-1	0	including i just said 
Bro022.E.dialogueact516	1202.43	1203.43	E	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah that's everything 
Bro022.A.dialogueact517	1203.78	1204.01	A	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro022.A.dialogueact518	1206.24	1206.99	A	PhD	qy^cs^rt	+1	2	going to go stuff on 
Bro022.C.dialogueact519	1208.28	1209.6	C	PhD	h|s	-1	0	um yeah maybe be 
Bro022.C.dialogueact520	1209.6	1214.31	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	yeah maybe be consuming these do these making digits 
Bro022.C.dialogueact521	1215.24	1221.46	C	PhD	s	+1	3	i'm into resting trying to figure out what's the difference between this or it's just and and over system 
Bro022.C.dialogueact522	1222.38	1222.99	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro022.C.dialogueact523	1224.69	1225.45	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	um yes 
Bro022.C.dialogueact524	1225.77	1229.07	C	PhD	s^bk|s^cc	+1	1	yes i think they will maybe train like gender depend on all those because she's so 
Bro022.C.dialogueact525	1229.07	1233.02	C	PhD	s^df	+1	2	because she's so so one big difference between the two systems 
Bro022.C.dialogueact526	1233.87	1234.55	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro022.C.dialogueact527	1236.14	1244.0	C	PhD	s^rt	+1	2	the other different just swear the effect that maybe get taking all of those those are sure i i'm more star them are more complex but 
Bro022.C.dialogueact528	1244.86	1247.89	C	PhD	s	+1	1	but uh check you did some experiments edition 
Bro022.C.dialogueact529	1247.89	1248.2	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	edition 
Bro022.A.dialogueact530	1249.35	1251.15	A	PhD	s	+1	1	it didn't seem to help in h. k. system if it's ought to have some express some 
Bro022.C.dialogueact531	1249.54	1253.08	C	PhD	s	-1	0	it didn't seem to help in h. k. system if it's ought to have some express some improvement with this 
Bro022.C.dialogueact532	1253.79	1254.42	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	what's it 
Bro022.B.dialogueact533	1254.65	1255.88	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	what's it like they also have the 
Bro022.B.dialogueact534	1255.88	1259.61	B	Professor	s	-1	0	like they also have the same they have all these uh uh it depends adaptation of the chow 
Bro022.C.dialogueact535	1257.65	1258.19	C	PhD	b	-1	0	uh uh it depends adaptation 
Bro022.B.dialogueact536	1259.61	1260.89	B	Professor	s^e	+1	2	of the chow rotation as yeah right 
Bro022.B.dialogueact538	1260.89	1262.12	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	well there's also the rotation as speaker adaptation yeah right 
Bro022.C.dialogueact537	1260.51	1260.9	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	rotation as yeah right 
Bro022.C.dialogueact539	1260.9	1261.24	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	rotation as speaker adaptation yeah right 
Bro022.A.dialogueact543	1262.55	1264.24	A	PhD	s	+1	2	well there's also the normalization like they do um 
Bro022.B.dialogueact542	1262.4	1262.86	B	Professor	b	-1	0	well there's also the 
Bro022.C.dialogueact540	1262.21	1262.36	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	well there's also the 
Bro022.F.dialogueact541	1262.31	1262.56	F	Grad	b	-1	0	well there's also the 
Bro022.A.dialogueact544	1264.24	1264.89	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	like they do um 
Bro022.A.dialogueact545	1264.89	1265.44	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	like they do um 
Bro022.A.dialogueact546	1266.17	1268.37	A	PhD	s^no	+1	1	i'm not sure how they do when they're working with the digits but like the focus 
Bro022.C.dialogueact547	1266.22	1266.88	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	i'm not sure how they do the focus 
Bro022.A.dialogueact548	1268.38	1276.77	A	PhD	s^e	+1	1	but like in the switchboard theater there's um conversations i'd normalization for or the non sees arrow components and then 
Bro022.A.dialogueact549	1276.77	1280.15	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	components and then other ends normalization procedural components 
Bro022.C.dialogueact550	1279.85	1280.12	C	PhD	b	-1	0	components 
Bro022.C.dialogueact551	1281.57	1283.08	C	PhD	s^bk|s	+1	1	yeah it's just another difference my education 
Bro022.C.dialogueact552	1283.41	1288.53	C	PhD	s	+1	1	my education works like on it around seven 
Bro022.A.dialogueact553	1288.9	1289.4	A	PhD	b	-1	0	seven but 
Bro022.C.dialogueact554	1289.93	1290.79	C	PhD	s	-1	0	but you have to do it 
Bro022.C.dialogueact555	1291.59	1293.06	C	PhD	s	-1	0	right we have a system that does it online so might 
Bro022.A.dialogueact557	1293.45	1293.8	A	PhD	b	-1	0	right so might 
Bro022.C.dialogueact556	1293.06	1294.5	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	right so might be 
Bro022.C.dialogueact558	1295.43	1296.2	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	might be better with my divorce 
Bro022.C.dialogueact559	1296.23	1300.7	C	PhD	s	-1	0	with my divorce ten minutes comes to 
Bro022.A.dialogueact560	1297.49	1297.8	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro022.C.dialogueact561	1300.7	1300.9	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	comes to 
Bro022.C.dialogueact562	1302.95	1303.27	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and uh sick more is 
Bro022.G.dialogueact563	1302.96	1308.49	G	PhD	qr	+1	1	their rights and uh sick more is utterly by phone or and so what is it what would 
Bro022.C.dialogueact564	1308.43	1310.06	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	their rights it's yeah get away would 
Bro022.F.dialogueact565	1308.79	1309.21	F	Grad	s	-1	0	their rights it's would 
Bro022.G.dialogueact566	1309.1	1309.32	G	PhD	b	-1	0	it's 
Bro022.C.dialogueact567	1310.06	1310.37	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah get away 
Bro022.C.dialogueact568	1310.37	1311.41	C	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah get away from 
Bro022.G.dialogueact569	1311.44	1311.99	G	PhD	s	-1	0	from 
Bro022.B.dialogueact570	1312.35	1313.79	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i think it's probably more than that i mean 
Bro022.C.dialogueact571	1312.72	1313.07	C	PhD	b	-1	0	i think it's probably more than that i mean 
Bro022.B.dialogueact572	1313.86	1320.6	B	Professor	s^df	+1	1	more than that i mean so they they have i think that they think they use these uh things so there's 
Bro022.B.dialogueact573	1320.6	1324.55	B	Professor	s^df	+1	1	things so there's there's these kind of pool models and 
Bro022.B.dialogueact574	1324.55	1327.77	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	and and they can go out to all sorts of dependencies it's like the 
Bro022.G.dialogueact575	1327.63	1328.83	G	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	it's like the paid state 
Bro022.B.dialogueact576	1328.27	1328.44	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	paid state 
Bro022.A.dialogueact577	1329.3	1329.76	A	PhD	b	-1	0	it had states 
Bro022.B.dialogueact578	1329.43	1330.53	B	Professor	s^na	+1	1	it had states and i think 
Bro022.B.dialogueact579	1330.53	1331.11	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and i think i i i'm really 
Bro022.B.dialogueact580	1331.29	1333.2	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	i i i'm really i'm talking i'm just guessing here but i think i think okay 
Bro022.B.dialogueact582	1333.2	1336.14	B	Professor	s	-1	0	here but i think i think they they don't just have tried phones i think they have a range okay

Bro022.C.dialogueact885	1975.19	1975.52	C	PhD	b	-1	0	twenty five years ago or 
Bro022.B.dialogueact886	1978.16	1980.03	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	so it's so you you might be that 
Bro022.C.dialogueact887	1978.35	1978.77	C	PhD	b	-1	0	so it's 
Bro022.F.dialogueact888	1979.32	1979.71	F	Grad	b	-1	0	so you 
Bro022.C.dialogueact889	1979.83	1980.04	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	so you you might be that 
Bro022.C.dialogueact890	1980.04	1982.44	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	you might be that what i did use 
Bro022.C.dialogueact891	1983.44	1991.09	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so removed like no no energy uh speech frames because the way 
Bro022.C.dialogueact892	1991.1	1995.96	C	PhD	s	-1	0	because the way did you said just just combine the two decisions 
Bro022.C.dialogueact893	1996.09	2001.55	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	so the one from the and it being the one from is you based that we that and very true so 
Bro022.C.dialogueact894	2001.64	2001.91	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	very true so 
Bro022.C.dialogueact895	2002.67	2006.77	C	PhD	s	-1	0	i only keep the frame sweat too agree that he speech 
Bro022.C.dialogueact896	2008.31	2014.3	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	so the energy base dropped drop low energy speech yeah

Bro022.B.dialogueact898	2017.2	2017.81	B	Professor	b	-1	0	but sit still 
Bro022.C.dialogueact899	2017.29	2029.22	C	PhD	s	-1	0	but sit still the the way it's done right no like it helps them on the nice where it seems to happen the nice where already and he was not very 
Bro022.B.dialogueact900	2030.04	2030.39	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i guess i mean like 
Bro022.B.dialogueact901	2030.39	2030.87	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	i guess i mean like 
Bro022.B.dialogueact902	2030.87	2033.54	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i guess i mean like i imagine combining in different ways but but 
Bro022.B.dialogueact903	2033.54	2034.39	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	ways but but i guess 
Bro022.B.dialogueact904	2034.78	2039.29	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	i guess what you're saying is that the the m. o. p. based one has spectrum information yeah 
Bro022.B.dialogueact906	2040.37	2040.68	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro022.C.dialogueact905	2039.91	2040.14	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah

Bro022.C.dialogueact908	2043.14	2043.25	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	but the weights

Bro022.B.dialogueact911	2048.16	2049.01	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	well you can imagine well the i use it and 
Bro022.C.dialogueact912	2048.3	2050.72	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	well you can imagine well the i use it and the very term 
Bro022.C.dialogueact913	2053.4	2053.89	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so i i 
Bro022.B.dialogueact914	2054.41	2054.85	B	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	the friends 
Bro022.C.dialogueact915	2054.9	2061.78	C	PhD	s	-1	0	the friends i thought drop by the energy based system are are corrupt even if uh and it be nice to keep it 
Bro022.B.dialogueact916	2059.1	2059.34	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	if uh 
Bro022.B.dialogueact917	2062.72	2062.87	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	right and that 
Bro022.B.dialogueact918	2062.87	2064.19	B	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	right and that might not be optimal but but i mean 
Bro022.C.dialogueact919	2063.14	2063.62	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	might not be optimal 
Bro022.B.dialogueact920	2064.19	2064.42	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	but but i mean 
Bro022.C.dialogueact921	2064.36	2064.83	C	PhD	b	-1	0	but but i mean 
Bro022.A.dialogueact923	2065.09	2065.3	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	i guess principle 
Bro022.B.dialogueact922	2064.75	2070.47	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	but but i mean i guess principle which would want to do is uh probability estimated to each one 
Bro022.B.dialogueact924	2070.47	2071.97	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	one put them together 
Bro022.C.dialogueact925	2071.02	2071.18	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	put them together 
Bro022.C.dialogueact926	2071.34	2072.4	C	PhD	b	-1	0	something put them together 
Bro022.A.dialogueact927	2072.78	2078.33	A	PhD	s	-1	0	something that that i've used in the past this um one just the king at the end or g. is to look at the derivative and 
Bro022.A.dialogueact928	2079.01	2084.54	A	PhD	s	-1	0	you make your decision when the derivative is increasing for so many frames and you 
Bro022.A.dialogueact929	2084.85	2086.72	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and you say that's beginning of speech 
Bro022.C.dialogueact930	2084.95	2085.42	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and you say that's beginning 
Bro022.A.dialogueact931	2087.36	2094.24	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but i'm i'm trying to remember that requires that you keep some amount of speech in a buffer 
Bro022.A.dialogueact932	2095.29	2096.46	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i guess it depends on how you do it but 
Bro022.A.dialogueact933	2096.46	2099.18	A	PhD	s	-1	0	you do it but and that's that's been a useful thing 
Bro022.B.dialogueact934	2097.34	2097.61	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and that's

Bro022.A.dialogueact939	2107.83	2108.29	A	PhD	b	-1	0	then you make a decision 
Bro022.G.dialogueact940	2108.32	2112.71	G	PhD	s	-1	0	then you make a decision because speed is most them decision but 
Bro022.A.dialogueact941	2111.86	2112.16	A	PhD	b	-1	0	them decision but

Bro022.C.dialogueact946	2119.59	2123.17	C	PhD	s	+1	1	but actually i done maybe i don't want to work too much of only try no i just wanted to 
Bro022.C.dialogueact947	2123.17	2130.55	C	PhD	s	+1	1	i just wanted to to she said right up so during this goes by the c. d. programming

Bro022.C.dialogueact955	2152.76	2157.83	C	PhD	fh|s^e	+1	1	uh we be friends uh that useful department because the to use 
Bro022.C.dialogueact956	2157.83	2158.23	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	because the to use so it's the michael 
Bro022.C.dialogueact957	2158.58	2163.64	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so it's the michael type spectra subtraction we choose and oversee missions factor also 
Bro022.C.dialogueact958	2163.64	2177.05	C	PhD	s	-1	0	factor also ships i should talk more no it down the nice to credit history meet on the nice portion of this is 
Bro022.C.dialogueact959	2178.3	2183.09	C	PhD	s	-1	0	sure i tried sever i'll uh oversee mission factor is and 
Bro022.C.dialogueact960	2183.99	2187.91	C	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	and after subtraction i also had the constant noise 
Bro022.C.dialogueact961	2188.08	2195.55	C	PhD	s	-1	0	um i tried to from no he's that use 
Bro022.C.dialogueact962	2196.55	2197.58	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and we see what happens

Bro022.C.dialogueact969	2208.64	2210.42	C	PhD	s	-1	0	but it depends on the bar me too that you was that 
Bro022.C.dialogueact970	2210.42	2217.97	C	PhD	s	-1	0	you was that formal jerry diverse commission sector us and whether it's nice to have a that you i just had a that if you become he's noise

Bro022.C.dialogueact972	2220.85	2227.15	C	PhD	s	-1	0	on the other hand when you subtract more and when you have more knowledge you get rid of just music all these but maybe 
Bro022.C.dialogueact973	2227.15	2229.7	C	PhD	s	-1	0	these but maybe you'd be storms up the speech 
Bro022.C.dialogueact974	2229.7	2229.83	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	up the speech

Bro022.C.dialogueact980	2243.22	2259.27	C	PhD	s^cc	+1	1	so next thing maybe or where they wouldn't try to to do is just to try to move to smooth the the results of destruction to get rid of 
Bro022.C.dialogueact981	2259.53	2260.99	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	to get rid of the music and now he's

Bro022.G.dialogueact1011	2300.9	2303.57	G	PhD	s	+1	1	you know for because it and there there was some bucks in the programs us 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1012	2303.57	2305.42	G	PhD	s	+1	1	in the programs us initially to to them up because 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1013	2305.76	2311.66	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	them up because one of the bug was it was assuming that all they divide uh they need she it seems a silence know 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1014	2311.87	2313.49	G	PhD	s	-1	0	a silence know they started in deciding state but it wasn't 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1015	2313.49	2315.03	G	PhD	s	-1	0	state but it wasn't for some our defenses so the 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1016	2315.75	2318.26	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so the he doesn't estimating the noise initially and then 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1017	2318.64	2320.0	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and then they'd notice to me to be without seem that it was all 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1018	2320.0	2322.61	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	so this without seem that it was all these assignments 
Bro022.C.dialogueact1019	2321.86	2322.07	C	PhD	b	-1	0	so this these assignments 
Bro022.C.dialogueact1020	2322.8	2324.52	C	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	so this see some speech a scary time assignments yeah 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1021	2324.61	2324.96	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	time yeah 
Bro022.C.dialogueact1023	2325.39	2327.21	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	in some cases you know credit and you have a few cases actually read that 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1022	2324.96	2325.71	G	PhD	s^m^na	-1	0	time in some cases yeah credit and 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1024	2326.33	2326.54	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	you know you have a few cases 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1025	2326.54	2329.49	G	PhD	s	-1	0	you know you have a few cases actually read that phone later that the uh 
Bro022.C.dialogueact1026	2327.91	2328.19	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	actually read that phone later that 
Bro022.C.dialogueact1027	2329.06	2329.44	C	PhD	b	-1	0	the uh 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1028	2330.11	2333.79	G	PhD	s	-1	0	that is one of the bugs that it was that in meeting the noise 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1029	2334.51	2347.4	G	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	and uh so once it was kid uh uh that if you experiment of it different ways of smoking the is to me to clean speech and heart is committed the noise and it smoothie odessa not also 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1030	2349.05	2359.36	G	PhD	s	+1	1	and so the the time seems to be like uh smoothing the got estimate that being speech where did i mean the s. and i would just like 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1031	2359.36	2361.33	G	PhD	s^e	+1	1	and i would just like having to be afraid of seems 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1032	2361.91	2364.75	G	PhD	s	+1	1	of seems to be helping than updating it quite frost using 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1033	2364.75	2366.19	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	quite frost using a very more time constant so 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1034	2366.86	2368.97	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so how'd like putative that uh 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1035	2370.39	2371.14	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	isolating the the most 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1036	2371.6	2373.09	G	PhD	s	-1	0	the most moving is having but still 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1037	2373.34	2376.06	G	PhD	s	+1	1	but still it's like it's become better word of the base and i in heard anything beyond 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1038	2376.06	2377.91	G	PhD	s	-1	0	i in heard anything beyond a baseline 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1039	2378.28	2380.18	G	PhD	s	+1	1	but that's like not using any i mean if he does 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1040	2381.2	2391.25	G	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	and uh so i'm i'm playing a few more experiments of it different time conscience for smoking then i spectrum and smoothing the being speech and switching is enough of that they time 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1041	2391.25	2393.09	G	PhD	s	-1	0	enough of that they time constants that i have so i'm 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1042	2393.38	2394.71	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so i'm just putting on 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1043	2395.13	2398.91	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so one is fixed in his mind like smoothing the team's because is having so 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1044	2398.91	2400.24	G	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	is having so i'm not going to change that much but does 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1045	2400.24	2405.7	G	PhD	s	-1	0	but does yeah estimating the noise and the demonstrating this and i'm just trying to think of later but 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1046	2406.55	2407.58	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so that and 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1047	2407.75	2412.03	G	PhD	s	+1	1	that and the other thing is like putting a it on though uh s. and not big oh that if 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1048	2412.03	2412.98	G	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	big oh that if 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1049	2413.62	2418.31	G	PhD	s^df	+1	1	some in some cases the clean speed is like my existing that it goes to the allow you so the it's 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1050	2418.31	2420.62	G	PhD	s	+1	1	you so the it's an not it's like pretty low and 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1051	2420.82	2421.08	G	PhD	%--	-1	0	pretty low and so that actually 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1052	2421.5	2425.19	G	PhD	s	+1	1	so that actually creates are off another way to do the you know if the speech so 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1053	2425.56	2431.6	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so thing of like putting afloat also for this enough so that it doesn't video locked no energy regions 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1054	2432.66	2435.74	G	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	and uh so that it does i like 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1055	2436.18	2441.82	G	PhD	s	+1	1	so far i've been testing on live it the baseline be decent it doesn't have any if thing an online on is is that i just 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1056	2441.82	2444.61	G	PhD	s	+1	1	on is is that i just want to do something that the corn to be consult so it's just 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1057	2444.61	2448.24	G	PhD	s^e	+1	1	be consult so it's just lactose i mean if you're going to close the baseline system we just 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1058	2448.74	2454.31	G	PhD	s^e	+1	1	we just uh just the spectrum him and a mess was uh frequency coffee and 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1059	2455.38	2455.94	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1060	2456.82	2464.63	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and the other thing that i was by just took one of those so carlos for this which he and he had 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1061	2465.21	2466.99	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	to see that they have had some automated 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1062	2466.99	2470.19	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	have had some automated adjusted around to see that they need to get it so it has and 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1063	2470.19	2470.47	G	PhD	%--	-1	0	and 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1064	2471.13	2476.98	G	PhD	s	-1	0	it it seems to me like it's not hiding a lot by just blindly picking up once it does we 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1065	2476.98	2483.68	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	up once it does we just nothing but in fort hoods abound bussing said that on that could be could what else the boss spectrum 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1066	2484.45	2487.95	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so that was the food to that uh carlos had 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1067	2488.76	2489.23	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	and so 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1068	2489.59	2489.97	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1069	2490.34	2493.49	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	it just just to see really it really it's it's good to look let's or towards it it doesn't 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1070	2493.49	2495.62	G	PhD	s	-1	0	let's or towards it it doesn't seems to be degrading a log on that so there must 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1071	2495.62	2501.01	G	PhD	s	-1	0	on that so there must be something that i can that can be done but that i both nice coleman dish and all is a bitch 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1072	2501.4	2504.18	G	PhD	s	-1	0	bitch i guess that ross carlos aboard that island hard how 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1073	2504.18	2506.03	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	that island hard how he did that this freezes and 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1074	2506.03	2506.31	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	and 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1075	2507.23	2513.63	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and that is he if he has any food is you got to do that on would you stories i admit some type of noise each board we have using carly uh something 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1076	2513.63	2514.63	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	carly uh something that so maybe 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1077	2514.63	2515.16	G	PhD	s^cc.%--	-1	0	this is that so maybe it 
Bro022.B.dialogueact1078	2515.79	2517.21	B	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	this is keep critter power sector it you have to be real faucets 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1079	2517.28	2517.54	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	you have to be real faucets 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1080	2517.54	2518.65	G	PhD	s^m^na	-1	0	you have to be real faucets and 
Bro022.B.dialogueact1081	2519.19	2523.19	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	so if you have a spent has so you probably get you get negative values right yeah and i'm like 
Bro022.B.dialogueact1082	2523.19	2523.5	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right yeah and i'm like 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1083	2523.38	2523.59	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right yeah and i'm like 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1084	2523.59	2525.91	G	PhD	s	-1	0	right yeah and i'm like floating it it goes right now 
Bro022.B.dialogueact1085	2526.22	2526.39	B	Professor	b	-1	0	so 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1086	2526.88	2529.08	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so it has like the spec program has like uh 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1087	2529.55	2529.89	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1088	2530.09	2536.27	G	PhD	s	-1	0	it actually uh and hands is uh onset and i'll say to him and uh the big in and and if the speech so it just seems 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1089	2536.27	2540.48	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so it just seems to me like deep values and the begin and uh and off like high energy being sick of the food 
Bro022.B.dialogueact1091	2540.84	2541.57	B	Professor	b	-1	0	being sick of the food that has like a 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1090	2540.48	2543.85	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	being sick of the food that has like a self mix again high type stuff too 
Bro022.B.dialogueact1093	2544.28	2544.98	B	Professor	b	-1	0	so those other regions 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1092	2544.2	2545.97	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so those other regions that that like 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1094	2546.19	2549.92	G	PhD	s	-1	0	when i look at the spectrum that others deep valleys on the begin and end of the speech but 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1095	2549.98	2551.93	G	PhD	s	-1	0	end of the speech but i stuff it seems to be like pretty nice 
Bro022.B.dialogueact1096	2552.34	2553.0	B	Professor	b	-1	0	that's 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1097	2552.65	2553.02	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	that's 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1098	2554.04	2556.58	G	PhD	s	-1	0	something i also using that for that 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1099	2557.71	2558.19	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	and yeah that out a 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1100	2558.49	2558.68	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	yeah that out a 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1101	2558.68	2559.38	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah that out a few maybe 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1102	2559.56	2559.86	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	few maybe 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1103	2559.95	2560.85	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	few maybe not a lot off 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1104	2561.25	2564.42	G	PhD	s	-1	0	because the food it doesn't have it be a deep negative portion so that 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1105	2564.83	2567.82	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	so that it's not really creating a lot of negative values and that could be group 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1106	2568.84	2569.13	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1107	2569.58	2572.65	G	PhD	s^cc.%--	-1	0	uh i just met clinton was that for some uh 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1108	2572.75	2576.62	G	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	for some uh maybe i'll ask carlos i didn't want to work hard to play with those for this and 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1109	2577.02	2579.6	G	PhD	s	-1	0	but lies making is you for the better 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1110	2581.13	2581.41	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1111	2581.98	2582.34	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah that that's it 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1112	2582.34	2583.51	G	PhD	s	-1	0	that that's it boring 
Bro022.B.dialogueact1113	2585.71	2586.31	B	Professor	h	-1	0	uh less secure 
Bro022.B.dialogueact1114	2586.43	2589.87	B	Professor	qo^bu^d^rt	-1	0	less secure also talking about building up the sub space yeah i 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1115	2589.35	2589.61	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah i 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1116	2589.61	2593.67	G	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	yeah i i don't actually in didn't get enough time to work on the substance last because most 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1117	2593.67	2596.04	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	last because most people are finding those bugs and 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1118	2596.04	2596.34	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	and 
Bro022.B.dialogueact1120	2597.89	2598.03	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yep 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1119	2597.64	2599.53	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	yep things and didn't 
Bro022.G.dialogueact1121	2599.68	2600.93	G	PhD	s	-1	0	things and didn't look much on that 
Bro022.A.dialogueact1122	2606.62	2607.32	A	PhD	qo^rt	+1	2	but you can

Bro022.D.dialogueact1131	2641.36	2649.37	D	PhD	s	+1	1	like thinking about that we would they would decide that maybe ease ugly baby we know 
Bro022.D.dialogueact1132	2649.8	2650.47	D	PhD	s^no	+1	1	we know and 
Bro022.D.dialogueact1133	2650.47	2651.08	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and i i don't 
Bro022.D.dialogueact1134	2651.18	2651.85	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i i don't

Bro022.B.dialogueact1140	2669.06	2669.5	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	not it's easier 
Bro022.B.dialogueact1141	2669.66	2671.1	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	not it's easier would be different 
Bro022.B.dialogueact1142	2672.25	2675.42	B	Professor	s	-1	0	she could do different no official procedural them for other things 
Bro022.B.dialogueact1143	2676.7	2683.57	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	yeah the thing i was going to suggest is that you could have two kinds normalization with with uh different time constants so 
Bro022.B.dialogueact1144	2683.66	2684.03	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so uh 
Bro022.B.dialogueact1145	2684.82	2685.77	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh you could 
Bro022.B.dialogueact1146	2685.88	2689.77	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	you could do some normalization uh before the test and then do 
Bro022.B.dialogueact1147	2689.77	2691.63	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	the test and then do some the normalization

Bro022.B.dialogueact1149	2693.93	2697.16	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but see zero certainly acts differently than the others too so that's 
Bro022.D.dialogueact1150	2695.25	2695.44	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	see zero certainly acts 
Bro022.B.dialogueact1151	2697.16	2697.76	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so that's
