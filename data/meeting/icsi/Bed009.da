Bed009.A.dialogueact42	227.218	227.678	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact43	229.032	233.562	F	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	And you guys are g giving talks on tomorrow and Wednesday lunch times ,
Bed009.A.dialogueact44	233.037	233.367	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bed009.D.dialogueact45	233.389	233.629	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact46	233.562	233.832	F	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	right ?
Bed009.F.dialogueact47	233.872	234.262	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	That 's great .
Bed009.F.dialogueact48	235.217	236.977	F	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	OK so , do y do you know what we 're gonna do ?
Bed009.B.dialogueact49	238.042	239.322	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	I thought two things
Bed009.B.dialogueact50	239.322	241.802	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	uh we 'll introduce ourselves and what we do .
Bed009.B.dialogueact51	242.53	247.59	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	And um we already talked with Andreas , Thilo and David
Bed009.B.dialogueact52	247.59	251.07	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and some lines of code were already written today
Bed009.B.dialogueact53	251.82	253.2	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and almost tested
Bed009.B.dialogueact54	254.04	260.997	B	Grad	s^rt	+1	1	and just gonna say we have um again the recognizer to parser thing where we 're working on
Bed009.B.dialogueact55	260.997	262.977	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and that should be no problem
Bed009.B.dialogueact56	263.865	271.58	B	Grad	s	+1	1	and then that can be sort of developed uh as needed when we get {disfmarker} enter the tourism domain .
Bed009.B.dialogueact57	272.468	276.628	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	em we have talked this morning with the {disfmarker} with Tilman about the generator .
Bed009.A.dialogueact59	277.798	278.218	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	S
Bed009.B.dialogueact58	277.76	288.823	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and um There one of our diligent workers has to sort of volunteer to look over Tilman 's shoulder while he is changing the grammars to English
Bed009.A.dialogueact60	289.258	289.708	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.B.dialogueact61	289.803	293.026	B	Grad	s	-1	0	because w we have {disfmarker} we face two ways .
Bed009.B.dialogueact62	293.026	301.42	B	Grad	s^rt	+1	0	Either we do a syllable concatenating um grammar for the English generation which is sort of starting from scratch and doing it the easy way ,
Bed009.B.dialogueact63	301.873	309.15	B	Grad	s^rt	+1	1	or we simply adopt the ah um more in - depth um style that is implemented in the German system
Bed009.B.dialogueact64	309.81	315.28	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and um are then able not only to produce strings but also the syntactic parse
Bed009.B.dialogueact65	316.08	317.01	B	Grad	s^bsc.%--	-1	0	uh not parse not
Bed009.B.dialogueact66	317.27	320.01	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	the syntactic tree that is underneath in the syntactic structure
Bed009.B.dialogueact67	320.867	325.097	B	Grad	s^df^rt	-1	0	which is the way we decided we were gonna go because A , it 's easier in the beginning
Bed009.A.dialogueact68	323.423	323.783	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.B.dialogueact69	325.67	332.569	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and um it does require some {disfmarker} some knowledge of {disfmarker} of those grammars and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and some ling linguistic background .
Bed009.B.dialogueact70	333.444	336.054	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	But um it shouldn't be a problem for anyone .
Bed009.F.dialogueact71	337.58	340.31	F	Professor	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	OK So That sounds good .
Bed009.F.dialogueact72	340.45	343.9	F	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Johno , are you gonna have some time t to do that uh w with these guys ?
Bed009.E.dialogueact73	344.34	344.64	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Sure .
Bed009.F.dialogueact74	345.471	348.49	F	Professor	s^ba^df	-1	0	cuz y you 're the grammar maven .
Bed009.E.dialogueact75	350.436	350.886	E	Grad	s^bk^rt	-1	0	OK .
Bed009.F.dialogueact76	351.231	351.851	F	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	I mean it makes sense ,
Bed009.E.dialogueact78	352.21	352.5	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed009.F.dialogueact77	351.851	352.571	F	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	doesn't it ?
Bed009.F.dialogueact79	352.571	353.311	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah Good .
Bed009.F.dialogueact80	354.143	354.423	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed009.F.dialogueact81	354.423	358.556	F	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	So , I think that 's probably the {disfmarker} the right way to do that .
Bed009.F.dialogueact82	359.309	361.316	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	And an
Bed009.F.dialogueact83	361.316	363.676	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah , so I {disfmarker} I actually wanna f to find out about it too ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact84	363.676	366.75	F	Professor	s	-1	0	but I may not have time to get in .
Bed009.B.dialogueact85	366.058	376.88	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	the {disfmarker} the ultimate goal is that before they leave we {disfmarker} we can run through the entire system input through output on at least one or two sample things .
Bed009.B.dialogueact86	377.63	385.395	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And um and by virtue of doing that then in this case Johno will have acquired the knowledge of how to extend it .
Bed009.B.dialogueact87	385.865	386.645	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Ad infinitum .
Bed009.B.dialogueact88	388.12	391.927	B	Grad	s	-1	0	When needed , if needed , when wanted and so forth .
Bed009.F.dialogueact89	396.43	397.35	F	Professor	s^bk|s^ba^rt	-1	0	OK that sounds great .
Bed009.B.dialogueact90	397.878	412.18	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And um also um Ralf has hooked up with David and you 're gonna continue either all through tonight or tomorrow on whatever to get the er parser interface working .
Bed009.D.dialogueact91	407.046	407.326	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed009.B.dialogueact92	412.79	414.66	B	Grad	s	-1	0	They are thinning out and thickening out lattices
Bed009.B.dialogueact93	414.66	417.02	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and doing this kind of stuff to see what works best .
Bed009.D.dialogueact94	416.37	416.65	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm ,
Bed009.D.dialogueact95	416.65	416.81	D	Grad	b	-1	0	yep .
Bed009.F.dialogueact96	418.728	418.848	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Great .

Bed009.F.dialogueact157	578.86	580.17	F	Professor	s	-1	0	He 's off {disfmarker} off on his trip already .
Bed009.B.dialogueact158	583.498	592.44	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but um David is here and he 's actually knows everything about the SmartKom recognizer .
Bed009.F.dialogueact159	587.636	587.946	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Thilo .
Bed009.F.dialogueact160	591.871	592.351	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK well yeah
Bed009.F.dialogueact161	592.351	593.431	F	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	maybe we 'll see if David could make it .
Bed009.F.dialogueact162	593.431	593.861	F	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	That would be good .
Bed009.B.dialogueact163	601.594	602.234	B	Grad	fg	-1	0	OK so
Bed009.B.dialogueact164	603.98	606.56	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	facing to {disfmarker} to what we 've sort of been doing here
Bed009.B.dialogueact165	607.51	607.93	B	Grad	h	-1	0	um
Bed009.B.dialogueact166	609.66	611.83	B	Grad	s	+1	1	well for one thing we 're also using this room to collect data .
Bed009.A.dialogueact167	612.46	613.31	A	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	Yeah obviously .
Bed009.B.dialogueact168	612.53	616.247	B	Grad	fh|s.x	-1	0	um um Not this type of data ,
Bed009.A.dialogueact170	616.49	617.06	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bed009.B.dialogueact169	616.247	621.147	B	Grad	s.%--	+1	1	no not meeting data but sort of {disfmarker} sort ah our version of a wizard experiment such
Bed009.B.dialogueact171	621.687	625.117	B	Grad	s	-1	0	not like the ones in Munich but pretty close to it .
Bed009.A.dialogueact172	624.77	625.01	A	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.B.dialogueact173	625.577	630.425	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	The major difference to the Munich ones is that we do it via the telephone
Bed009.A.dialogueact174	631.263	631.383	A	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bed009.B.dialogueact175	631.48	633.0	B	Grad	s	-1	0	even though all the recording is done here
Bed009.B.dialogueact176	633.753	638.424	B	Grad	s	+1	1	and so it 's a {disfmarker} sort of a computer call system that gives you tourist information
Bed009.A.dialogueact177	637.048	637.218	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.B.dialogueact178	638.424	639.484	B	Grad	s	-1	0	tells you how to get places .
Bed009.B.dialogueact179	640.2	643.55	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And it breaks halfway through the experiment and a human operator comes on .
Bed009.B.dialogueact180	644.681	654.44	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and part of that is sort of trying to find out whether people change their linguistic verbal behavior when first thinking they speak to a machine and then to a human .
Bed009.A.dialogueact181	652.869	653.069	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed009.B.dialogueact182	655.61	661.01	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and we 're setting it up so that we can {disfmarker} we hope to implant certain intentions in people .
Bed009.B.dialogueact183	661.01	670.3	B	Grad	s:qw	-1	0	For example um we have first looked at a simple sentence that " How do I get to the Powder - Tower ? "
Bed009.B.dialogueact184	671.24	673.09	B	Grad	s^f	-1	0	OK so you have the {disfmarker} castle of Heidelberg
Bed009.A.dialogueact185	672.386	672.636	A	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bed009.B.dialogueact186	673.09	675.04	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and there is a tower and it 's called Powder - Tower .
Bed009.A.dialogueact187	673.84	674.26	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bed009.A.dialogueact188	674.39	674.54	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed009.B.dialogueact189	676.13	681.25	B	Grad	qh	-1	0	and um so What will you parse out of that sentence ?
Bed009.B.dialogueact190	681.88	683.98	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Probably something that we specified in M - three - L ,
Bed009.B.dialogueact192	683.98	690.04	B	Grad	s	-1	0	that is @ @ {comment} " action go to whatever domain , object whatever Powder - Tower " .
Bed009.D.dialogueact191	683.86	684.29	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed009.B.dialogueact193	691.106	696.706	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And maybe some model will tell us , some GPS module , in the mobile scenario where the person is at the moment .
Bed009.B.dialogueact194	697.87	701.4	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And um we 've sort of gone through that once before in the Deep Mail project
Bed009.B.dialogueact195	701.4	704.12	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and we noticed that first of all what are {disfmarker}
Bed009.B.dialogueact196	704.12	706.62	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I should 've brought some slides ,
Bed009.B.dialogueact197	707.11	708.93	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	but what our {disfmarker}
Bed009.B.dialogueact198	709.3	711.16	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So here 's the tower .
Bed009.B.dialogueact199	712.28	714.61	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Think of this as a two - dimensional representation of the tower .
Bed009.B.dialogueact200	715.01	720.59	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And our system led people here , to a point where they were facing a wall in front of the tower .
Bed009.B.dialogueact201	720.59	725.38	B	Grad	s	-1	0	There is no entrance there , but it just happens to be the closest point of the road network to the geometric center
Bed009.B.dialogueact202	726.804	728.224	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Because that 's how the algorithm works .
Bed009.B.dialogueact203	729.69	731.76	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	So we took out that part of the road network as a hack
Bed009.B.dialogueact204	732.08	733.96	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and then it found actually the way to the entrance .
Bed009.B.dialogueact205	735.13	737.1	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	which was now the closest point of the road network to
Bed009.A.dialogueact206	737.321	737.481	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed009.B.dialogueact207	738.0	738.89	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	OK , geometric center .
Bed009.B.dialogueact208	739.36	743.87	B	Grad	s	-1	0	But what we actually observed in Heidelberg is that most people when they want to go there they actually don't want to enter ,
Bed009.B.dialogueact209	743.87	745.23	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because it 's not really interesting .
Bed009.B.dialogueact210	745.23	749.88	B	Grad	s	-1	0	They wanna go to a completely different point where they can look at it and take a picture .
Bed009.A.dialogueact211	750.31	751.12	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bed009.D.dialogueact212	750.846	751.526	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed009.A.dialogueact213	751.46	751.61	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed009.B.dialogueact214	751.69	755.74	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	And so what uh uh a s you s
Bed009.B.dialogueact215	756.1	761.54	B	Grad	s	+1	0	let 's say a simple parse from a s from an utterance won't really give us is what the person actually wants .
Bed009.B.dialogueact216	762.87	764.55	B	Grad	qy	-1	0	Does he wanna go there to see it ?
Bed009.B.dialogueact217	764.55	765.75	B	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Does he wanna go there now ?
Bed009.B.dialogueact218	765.95	766.41	B	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	Later ?
Bed009.B.dialogueact219	767.09	768.78	B	Grad	qw	-1	0	How does the person wanna go there ?
Bed009.B.dialogueact220	768.78	772.23	B	Grad	qy	-1	0	Is that person more likely to want to walk there ?
Bed009.B.dialogueact221	772.33	773.51	B	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	Walk a scenic route ?
Bed009.B.dialogueact222	773.51	773.93	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and so forth .
Bed009.B.dialogueact223	773.93	781.534	B	Grad	s	-1	0	There are all kinds of decisions that we have identified in terms of getting to places and in terms of finding information about things .
Bed009.B.dialogueact224	782.45	789.65	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And we are constructing {disfmarker} and then we 've identified more or less the extra - linguistic parameters that may f play a role .
Bed009.B.dialogueact225	789.95	793.23	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Information related to the user and information related to the situation .
Bed009.B.dialogueact226	794.13	799.19	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	And we also want to look closely on the linguistic information that
Bed009.B.dialogueact227	799.44	800.73	B	Grad	s	-1	0	what we can get from the utterance .
Bed009.B.dialogueact228	800.73	806.42	B	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's part of why we implant these intentions in the data collection to see whether people actually phrase things differently
Bed009.B.dialogueact229	806.42	811.42	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	whether they want to enter in order to buy something or whether they just wanna go there to look at it .
Bed009.B.dialogueact230	813.21	827.87	B	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	And um so the idea is to construct uh um suitable interfaces and a belief - net for a module that actually tries to guess what the underlying intention {pause} was .
Bed009.B.dialogueact231	827.97	837.25	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And then enrich or augment the M - three - L structures with what it thought what more it sort of got out of that utterance .
Bed009.B.dialogueact232	837.791	840.151	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So if it can make a good suggestion , " Hey ! "
Bed009.B.dialogueact233	840.501	841.901	B	Grad	s	-1	0	you know , " that person doesn't wanna enter .
Bed009.B.dialogueact234	841.901	846.161	B	Grad	s	-1	0	That person just wants to take a picture , " cuz he just bought film ,
Bed009.B.dialogueact235	846.161	849.441	B	Grad	s	-1	0	or " that person wants to enter because he discussed the admission fee before " .
Bed009.B.dialogueact236	849.911	852.731	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Or " that person wants to enter because he wants to buy something
Bed009.B.dialogueact237	852.731	855.081	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and that you usually do inside of buildings " and so forth .
Bed009.B.dialogueact238	855.631	867.987	B	Grad	s^rt	+1	0	These ah these types of uh these bits of additional information are going to be embedded into the M - three - L structure in an {disfmarker} sort of subfield that we have reserved .
Bed009.B.dialogueact239	868.87	871.91	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And if the action planner does something with it , great .
Bed009.B.dialogueact240	872.55	879.23	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	If not you know , then that 's also something um that we can't really {disfmarker}
Bed009.B.dialogueact241	879.88	885.89	B	Grad	s	-1	0	at least we {comment} want to offer the extra information . We don't really {disfmarker} um we 're not too worried .
Bed009.A.dialogueact242	881.883	882.103	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.D.dialogueact243	882.156	882.576	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed009.B.dialogueact244	885.89	892.17	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean {disfmarker} t s Ultimately if you have {disfmarker} if you can offer that information , somebody 's gonna s do something with it sooner or later .
Bed009.B.dialogueact245	892.45	893.82	B	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's sort of part of our belief .
Bed009.E.dialogueact246	892.625	894.145	E	Grad	qw.%	-1	0	What was he saying ?
Bed009.B.dialogueact247	894.89	901.643	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Um , for example , right now I know the GIS from email is not able to calculate these viewpoints .
Bed009.B.dialogueact248	902.37	906.24	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So that 's a functionality that doesn't exist yet to do that dynamically ,
Bed009.A.dialogueact249	904.976	905.166	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.B.dialogueact250	906.24	911.67	B	Grad	s.x	-1	0	but if we can offer it that distinction , maybe somebody will go ahead and implement it .
Bed009.B.dialogueact251	912.71	915.64	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Surely nobody 's gonna go ahead and implement it if it 's never gonna be used ,
Bed009.B.dialogueact252	915.64	915.83	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	so .
Bed009.B.dialogueact253	918.32	919.36	B	Grad	qh	-1	0	What have I forgotten about ?

Bed009.F.dialogueact260	923.134	926.294	F	Professor	s	-1	0	I s I see {pause} questions on peoples ' faces ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact261	926.294	926.724	F	Professor	qh^cs.%--	-1	0	so why don't {disfmarker}

Bed009.F.dialogueact262	926.724	929.09	F	Professor	s	-1	0	let 's {disfmarker} let 's {disfmarker} Let 's hear {disfmarker}
Bed009.A.dialogueact264	930.76	936.52	A	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	Well the obvious one would be if {disfmarker} if you envision this as a module within SmartKom , where exactly would that Sit ?
Bed009.A.dialogueact266	937.59	938.68	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	That 's the d
Bed009.B.dialogueact265	937.24	943.17	B	Grad	h|s.x	+1	1	um {disfmarker} so far I 've thought of it as sort of adding it onto the modeler knowledge module .
Bed009.A.dialogueact268	943.091	943.711	A	PhD	s^bk.x	-1	0	OK , yeah .
Bed009.B.dialogueact269	943.17	947.87	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So this is one that already adds additional information to the

Bed009.A.dialogueact270	944.168	944.948	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Makes perfect sense .

Bed009.B.dialogueact273	948.55	951.38	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but it could sit anywhere in the attention - recognition
Bed009.B.dialogueact274	951.38	955.97	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	I mean basically this is what attention - recognition literally sort of can {disfmarker}
Bed009.A.dialogueact275	955.58	956.36	A	PhD	s^2	-1	0	Well it 's supposed to do .

Bed009.A.dialogueact285	960.86	968.787	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Well f from my understanding of what the people at Phillips were originally trying to do doesn't seem to quite fit into SmartKom currently
Bed009.A.dialogueact286	969.226	980.007	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so what they 're really doing right now is only selecting among the alternatives , the hypotheses that they 're given enriched by the domain knowledge and the um discourse modeler and so on .

Bed009.D.dialogueact302	1020.98	1021.28	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed009.A.dialogueact303	1025.02	1029.39	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and the other is {disfmarker} is my understanding of what SmartKom uh is supposed to be
Bed009.F.dialogueact304	1028.9	1029.05	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed009.A.dialogueact305	1030.26	1031.96	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	and I {disfmarker} I think that fits in perfectly
Bed009.F.dialogueact306	1030.39	1035.66	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So {disfmarker} well , let me {disfmarker} Let me s {pause} expand on that a little bit from the point of view of the generation .
Bed009.D.dialogueact307	1031.89	1032.29	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed009.A.dialogueact308	1034.3	1034.44	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed009.F.dialogueact309	1036.03	1040.65	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So the idea is that we 've actually got this all laid out an and we could show it to you ig
Bed009.F.dialogueact310	1040.9	1049.0	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	um Robert didn't bring it today but there 's a {disfmarker} a belief - net which is {disfmarker}
Bed009.F.dialogueact311	1049.59	1054.33	F	Professor	s	-1	0	There 's a first cut at a belief - net that {disfmarker} that doesn't {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} isn't fully uh instantiated ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact312	1054.33	1059.37	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and in particular some of the {disfmarker} the combination rules and ways of getting the {disfmarker} the conditional probabilities aren't there .
Bed009.F.dialogueact313	1059.67	1064.91	F	Professor	s	-1	0	But we believe that we have laid out the fundamental decisions in this little space
Bed009.A.dialogueact314	1065.25	1065.65	A	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact315	1065.31	1066.9	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and the things that influence them .
Bed009.F.dialogueact316	1067.25	1070.77	F	Professor	s	+1	0	So one of the decisions is what we call this AVE thing .
Bed009.F.dialogueact317	1070.87	1077.21	F	Professor	qh	-1	0	Do you want to um access , view or enter a thing .
Bed009.D.dialogueact318	1077.58	1077.89	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact319	1078.17	1079.48	F	Professor	s	+1	0	So that 's a a discrete decision .
Bed009.A.dialogueact320	1078.96	1079.36	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact321	1079.48	1082.29	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	There are only three possibilities and the uh {disfmarker}
Bed009.F.dialogueact322	1082.29	1093.32	F	Professor	s	-1	0	what one would like is for this uh , knowledge modeling module to add which of those it is and give it to the planner .
Bed009.A.dialogueact323	1092.16	1092.48	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact324	1095.14	1116.49	F	Professor	s	+1	1	But , uh th the current design suggests that if it seems to be an important decision and if the belief - net is equivocal so that it doesn't say that one of these is much more probable than the other , then an option is to go back and ask for the information you want .
Bed009.A.dialogueact325	1114.75	1115.15	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact326	1117.72	1118.01	F	Professor	qy^d^f	-1	0	Alright ?
Bed009.F.dialogueact327	1118.01	1120.78	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Now there are two ways one can go {disfmarker} a imagine doing that .
Bed009.F.dialogueact328	1121.28	1124.26	F	Professor	s	-1	0	For the debugging we 'll probably just have a {disfmarker} a drop - down menu
Bed009.F.dialogueact329	1124.26	1125.79	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and the {disfmarker} while you 're debugging you will just {disfmarker}
Bed009.F.dialogueact330	1125.79	1126.08	F	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bed009.F.dialogueact331	1126.62	1132.61	F	Professor	s	-1	0	But for a full system , then one might very well formulate a query ,
Bed009.A.dialogueact333	1133.52	1133.77	A	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact332	1133.45	1137.54	F	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	give it to the dialogue planner and say this , you know ar are you know you {disfmarker} are you planning to enter ?
Bed009.F.dialogueact334	1137.54	1140.29	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Or whatever it {disfmarker} whatever that might be .
Bed009.F.dialogueact335	1140.87	1143.13	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So that 's {disfmarker} under that model
Bed009.F.dialogueact336	1143.84	1150.42	F	Professor	s	-1	0	then , There would be a {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} um a loop in which this thing would formulate a query ,
Bed009.A.dialogueact337	1148.81	1149.18	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yes .
Bed009.F.dialogueact338	1150.42	1151.81	F	Professor	s	-1	0	presumably give it to you .
Bed009.F.dialogueact339	1152.15	1156.98	F	Professor	s	-1	0	That would get expressed and then hopefully you know , you 'd get an answer {pause} back .
Bed009.A.dialogueact340	1157.33	1157.47	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bed009.F.dialogueact341	1158.1	1160.0	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And that would of course {disfmarker} the answer would have to be parsed .
Bed009.D.dialogueact342	1159.31	1159.73	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed009.D.dialogueact344	1160.94	1161.14	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bed009.F.dialogueact343	1160.85	1161.03	F	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right
Bed009.F.dialogueact345	1161.03	1161.12	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bed009.A.dialogueact347	1161.97	1162.17	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yes .
Bed009.F.dialogueact346	1161.48	1164.11	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	OK so , {pause} th {pause} that uh ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact348	1164.11	1171.71	F	Professor	s	+1	2	We probably won't do this early on , because the current focus is more on the decision making and stuff like that .
Bed009.A.dialogueact349	1167.35	1167.44	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yep .
Bed009.F.dialogueact350	1172.14	1188.86	F	Professor	s	+1	1	But While we 're on the subject I just wanted to give you a sort of head 's up that it could be that some months from now we said " OK we 're now ready to try to close that loop " in terms of querying about some of these decisions .
Bed009.A.dialogueact351	1175.7	1175.88	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.A.dialogueact352	1183.9	1184.1	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.D.dialogueact353	1184.47	1184.73	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed009.A.dialogueact354	1188.04	1188.19	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bed009.A.dialogueact355	1190.08	1198.8	A	PhD	fg|s	+1	0	So {disfmarker} my suggestion then is that you um look into the currently ongoing discussion about how the action plans are supposed to look like .
Bed009.A.dialogueact356	1199.47	1212.08	A	PhD	s	+1	1	And they 're currently um Agreeing or {disfmarker} or in the process of agreeing on an X M L - ification of um something like a state - transition network of how dialogues would proceed .
Bed009.A.dialogueact357	1212.41	1219.39	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} these um transition networks uh will be what the action planner interprets in a sense .
Bed009.F.dialogueact358	1219.71	1219.95	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact359	1220.21	1221.18	F	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	D did you know this Robert ?
Bed009.B.dialogueact360	1221.78	1222.66	B	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	uh Michael is doing that ,
Bed009.B.dialogueact361	1222.66	1222.82	B	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bed009.A.dialogueact362	1223.81	1226.78	A	PhD	s^aap	-1	0	Well uh Marcus Lerkult is actually implementing that stuff
Bed009.A.dialogueact363	1227.03	1231.69	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and Marcus and Michael together are um leading the discussion there ,
Bed009.A.dialogueact365	1231.86	1231.99	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bed009.B.dialogueact364	1231.78	1232.12	B	Grad	s^bk^rt	-1	0	OK .
Bed009.F.dialogueact366	1232.4	1233.77	F	Professor	s	+1	0	So we ha we have to get in on that .
Bed009.A.dialogueact368	1234.38	1234.62	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bed009.B.dialogueact367	1234.14	1234.3	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.D.dialogueact370	1234.96	1235.25	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact369	1234.63	1239.79	F	Professor	s	-1	0	because um partly those are like X - schemas .
Bed009.A.dialogueact371	1236.27	1236.56	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Definitely .
Bed009.F.dialogueact372	1240.55	1241.74	F	Professor	s	-1	0	the transition diagrams .
Bed009.B.dialogueact373	1242.04	1242.47	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact374	1242.21	1250.19	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And it may be that {disfmarker} that um we should early on make sure that they have the flexibility that we need .
Bed009.B.dialogueact375	1250.34	1250.71	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed009.B.dialogueact376	1251.84	1252.99	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	But they uh
Bed009.B.dialogueact377	1253.56	1254.51	B	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Have I understood this right ?
Bed009.B.dialogueact378	1254.51	1259.14	B	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	They {disfmarker} they govern more or less the {disfmarker} the dialogue behavior or the action {disfmarker}
Bed009.A.dialogueact379	1258.93	1259.25	A	PhD	s^aa^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.B.dialogueact380	1259.67	1263.49	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	It 's not really what you do with the content of the dialogue but it 's
Bed009.B.dialogueact381	1266.89	1269.15	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	So , I mean there is this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} this nice interf
Bed009.D.dialogueact382	1267.46	1268.23	D	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	uh , No ,
Bed009.D.dialogueact383	1268.23	1270.55	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	it 's {disfmarker} it 's also a quantrant uh uh {disfmarker}
Bed009.B.dialogueact384	1269.37	1270.77	B	Grad	qy^bu.%--	-1	0	i Is it {disfmarker}
Bed009.F.dialogueact385	1270.84	1276.34	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So there 's ac so there {disfmarker} th the word " action " , OK , is {disfmarker} is what 's ambiguous here .
Bed009.D.dialogueact386	1272.78	1273.38	D	Grad	s^am	-1	0	I think .
Bed009.D.dialogueact387	1275.2	1275.53	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed009.A.dialogueact388	1276.54	1276.84	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bed009.F.dialogueact389	1276.69	1283.92	F	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	So , um one thing is there 's an actual planner that tells the person in the tourist domain now ,
Bed009.A.dialogueact391	1284.52	1284.78	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed009.F.dialogueact390	1284.1	1285.16	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	per tells the person how to go ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact392	1285.16	1285.79	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	" First go here ,
Bed009.D.dialogueact394	1286.17	1286.57	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact393	1285.79	1286.58	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	first go there
Bed009.F.dialogueact395	1287.18	1288.39	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	uh , you know , take a bus " ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact396	1288.39	1289.11	F	Professor	s	-1	0	whatever it is .
Bed009.F.dialogueact397	1289.73	1297.24	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So that 's that form of planning , and action , and a route planner and GIS , all sort of stuff .
Bed009.F.dialogueact398	1297.94	1300.97	F	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh But I think that isn't what you mean .
Bed009.A.dialogueact399	1301.12	1301.4	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	No .
Bed009.A.dialogueact400	1301.46	1307.68	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	No , in SmartKom terminology that 's um called a function that 's modeled by a function modeler .
Bed009.A.dialogueact401	1308.56	1312.96	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And it 's th that 's completely um encapsulated from th the dialogue system .
Bed009.A.dialogueact402	1313.57	1316.57	A	PhD	s	-1	0	That 's simply a functionality that you give data as in a query
Bed009.A.dialogueact403	1316.57	1323.17	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and then you get back from that mmm , a functioning model um which might be a planner or a VCR or whatever .
Bed009.A.dialogueact404	1323.48	1326.2	A	PhD	s	-1	0	um some result and that 's then {disfmarker} then used .
Bed009.F.dialogueact405	1324.74	1325.95	F	Professor	fg|s^bk	-1	0	Well , OK ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact406	1325.94	1327.61	F	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	so that 's what I thought .
Bed009.F.dialogueact407	1327.62	1331.94	F	Professor	s^bu	+1	0	So action he action here means dia uh speech ac uh you know dialogue act .
Bed009.A.dialogueact408	1328.27	1328.75	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bed009.A.dialogueact410	1330.9	1332.18	A	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah , in that {disfmarker} in that sense
Bed009.B.dialogueact409	1330.73	1331.12	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed009.A.dialogueact411	1332.18	1332.33	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yes ,
Bed009.A.dialogueact413	1332.45	1333.07	A	PhD	s^m	-1	0	dialogue act ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact412	1332.2	1332.4	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed009.A.dialogueact414	1333.07	1333.13	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	yeah .
Bed009.F.dialogueact415	1333.62	1339.8	F	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um , I think tha I think it 's not going to {disfmarker} I think that 's not going to be good enough .
Bed009.F.dialogueact416	1339.8	1341.98	F	Professor	s	-1	0	I I don what uh {disfmarker} what I meant by that .
Bed009.F.dialogueact417	1342.22	1351.61	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So I think the idea of having a , you know , transition diagram for the grammar of conversations is a good idea .
Bed009.A.dialogueact418	1350.75	1351.02	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact419	1352.26	1352.49	F	Professor	s^f	-1	0	OK ?
Bed009.F.dialogueact420	1352.49	1355.33	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And I think that we do hav definitely have to get in on it and find out {disfmarker} OK .
Bed009.F.dialogueact421	1356.08	1360.39	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But I think that um
Bed009.F.dialogueact422	1361.66	1368.23	F	Professor	s	+1	0	when {disfmarker} so , when you get to the tourist domain it 's not just an information retrieval system .
Bed009.A.dialogueact423	1365.37	1365.64	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.A.dialogueact425	1368.77	1369.13	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Clearly .
Bed009.A.dialogueact427	1369.13	1369.49	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yes .
Bed009.F.dialogueact424	1368.64	1368.96	F	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bed009.F.dialogueact426	1368.96	1371.14	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So this i this is where I think this {disfmarker}
Bed009.F.dialogueact428	1371.14	1373.33	F	Professor	s	+1	0	people are gonna have to think this through a bit more carefully .
Bed009.A.dialogueact429	1373.53	1373.7	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact430	1373.87	1378.69	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So , if it 's only like in {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} in the film and T V thing ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact431	1379.15	1380.09	F	Professor	s	-1	0	OK , you can do this .
Bed009.F.dialogueact432	1380.09	1381.85	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And you just get information and give it to people .
Bed009.F.dialogueact433	1382.62	1388.66	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But what happens when you actually get them moving and so forth and so on
Bed009.A.dialogueact434	1387.61	1387.77	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bed009.F.dialogueact435	1389.37	1396.79	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh , y y your {disfmarker} I d I think the notion of this as a self contained uh module
Bed009.F.dialogueact436	1397.56	1405.69	F	Professor	s	+1	1	you know th the functional module that {disfmarker} that interacts with {disfmarker} with where the tourism g stuff is going {comment} probably is too restrictive .
Bed009.A.dialogueact437	1401.86	1401.95	A	PhD	s^aa.%	-1	0	Yep .
Bed009.F.dialogueact438	1406.77	1411.5	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Now I dunno how much people have thought ahead to the tourist domain in this
Bed009.A.dialogueact439	1412.53	1413.26	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Probably not enough ,
Bed009.A.dialogueact440	1413.26	1420.85	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I mean an {disfmarker} another uh more basic point there is that the current um tasks and therefore th the concepts in this ac

Bed009.F.dialogueact442	1422.63	1422.8	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah
Bed009.A.dialogueact443	1424.09	1427.13	A	PhD	h|s	+1	1	um is based on slots that have to be filled
Bed009.A.dialogueact444	1427.13	1433.75	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and the um kind of values in these slots would be fixed things like the a time or a movie title or something like this
Bed009.F.dialogueact445	1427.14	1427.44	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact446	1433.08	1433.25	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .

Bed009.F.dialogueact448	1437.16	1437.51	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Indeed .
Bed009.F.dialogueact450	1439.92	1440.12	F	Professor	fg	-1	0	Right .
Bed009.A.dialogueact451	1441.26	1447.54	A	PhD	s^no	+1	1	and I 'm not sure if {disfmarker} if complex slots of that type are really um being taken into consideration .
Bed009.F.dialogueact452	1449.05	1449.36	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed009.A.dialogueact454	1449.58	1451.49	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So that 's {disfmarker} that 's really something we
Bed009.F.dialogueact453	1449.44	1456.6	F	Professor	qy^t3	-1	0	Could you {disfmarker} could you put a message into the right place to see if we can at least ask that question ?

Bed009.A.dialogueact463	1463.43	1464.28	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and that 's
Bed009.B.dialogueact462	1463.18	1465.61	B	Grad	fg|s.%--	-1	0	yeah and um it might actually
Bed009.B.dialogueact464	1465.61	1466.0	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK
Bed009.B.dialogueact465	1466.07	1473.31	B	Grad	s	-1	0	ah also {disfmarker} because um again in in Deep Map we have faced and implemented those problems once already
Bed009.A.dialogueact467	1473.61	1473.81	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.B.dialogueact466	1473.31	1477.99	B	Grad	s	-1	0	maybe we can even shuffle some know how from there to to Markus and Michael .

Bed009.B.dialogueact472	1484.29	1484.9	B	Grad	%--	-1	0	OK th
Bed009.B.dialogueact473	1487.16	1488.32	B	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll talk to Michael
Bed009.B.dialogueact474	1488.61	1490.4	B	Grad	s	-1	0	it 's what I do anyway .
Bed009.B.dialogueact475	1490.64	1499.35	B	Grad	qw.%--	-1	0	Who {disfmarker} How far is the uh the {disfmarker} the M - three - L specification for {disfmarker} for the la natural language input gone on the {disfmarker} the uh
Bed009.B.dialogueact476	1499.6	1505.08	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I haven't seen anything for the uh tourist path domain .
Bed009.D.dialogueact477	1504.16	1505.74	D	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} it 's not defined yet .
Bed009.B.dialogueact478	1507.45	1509.66	B	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	And um you are probably also involved in that ,
Bed009.D.dialogueact479	1508.18	1510.01	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Um {disfmarker} Yeah .
Bed009.B.dialogueact480	1509.66	1509.95	B	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bed009.B.dialogueact481	1510.84	1512.67	B	Grad	s	-1	0	uh together with the usual gang ,
Bed009.B.dialogueact482	1512.67	1514.85	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	um Petra and Jan
Bed009.D.dialogueact483	1513.03	1513.33	D	Grad	x	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed009.D.dialogueact484	1515.19	1519.59	D	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah , there 's a meeting next next week I think
Bed009.B.dialogueact485	1522.17	1525.51	B	Grad	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	OK because That 's {disfmarker} Those are the {disfmarker}
Bed009.B.dialogueact486	1525.51	1532.11	B	Grad	qo	+1	1	I think the {disfmarker} the true key issues is how does the whatever comes out of the language input pipeline look like
Bed009.B.dialogueact487	1532.11	1534.85	B	Grad	qo	+1	1	and then what the action planner does with it {disfmarker}
Bed009.B.dialogueact488	1536.01	1537.97	B	Grad	qo	+1	0	and how that is uh specified .
Bed009.B.dialogueact489	1538.59	1547.52	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I didn't think of the internal working of the uh the action planner and the language {disfmarker} uh the function model as sort of relevant .
Bed009.B.dialogueact490	1548.2	1553.5	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Because what {disfmarker} what they take is sort of this {disfmarker} this fixed representation of a {disfmarker} of an intention .
Bed009.A.dialogueact492	1554.59	1554.94	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.B.dialogueact491	1554.56	1557.93	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And that can be as detailed or as crude as you want it to be .
Bed009.B.dialogueact493	1558.83	1561.95	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	But um the internal workings of of the {disfmarker}
Bed009.B.dialogueact494	1561.95	1567.78	B	Grad	s	-1	0	whether you know there 're dialogue {disfmarker} action planners that work with belief - nets that are action planners that work with you know state automata .
Bed009.B.dialogueact495	1568.42	1570.38	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So that shouldn't really matter too much .
Bed009.B.dialogueact496	1570.73	1571.66	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean it does matter
Bed009.B.dialogueact497	1571.66	1573.24	B	Grad	s^df.%--	-1	0	because it does have to keep track of you {disfmarker}
Bed009.B.dialogueact498	1573.24	1577.74	B	Grad	s	-1	0	we are on part six of r a route that consists of eight steps and so forth
Bed009.A.dialogueact500	1577.44	1577.71	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed009.F.dialogueact499	1577.25	1580.27	F	Professor	fg|s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , th there {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} I think there are a lot of reasons why it matters .
Bed009.F.dialogueact501	1580.38	1580.78	F	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	OK ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact502	1581.06	1581.92	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so that
Bed009.F.dialogueact503	1583.05	1583.8	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact504	1583.89	1594.03	F	Professor	s	-1	0	for example , the i it 's the action planner is going to take some spec and s make some suggestions about what the user should do .
Bed009.F.dialogueact505	1595.41	1605.01	F	Professor	s	-1	0	What the user says after that is going to be very much caught up with what the action planner told it .
Bed009.A.dialogueact506	1602.51	1602.88	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yes .
Bed009.F.dialogueact507	1605.01	1611.01	F	Professor	s^rt.%--	-1	0	If the {disfmarker} If the parser and the language end doesn't know what the person 's been told
Bed009.F.dialogueact508	1611.97	1612.28	F	Professor	s^f^rt	-1	0	OK
Bed009.F.dialogueact509	1612.28	1615.01	F	Professor	s	-1	0	th it 's you 're making your life much more difficult than it has to be .
Bed009.B.dialogueact510	1614.2	1614.38	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed009.F.dialogueact511	1615.96	1616.24	F	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bed009.F.dialogueact512	1616.44	1621.12	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So if someone says the best t to uh go there is by taxi ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact513	1621.77	1622.19	F	Professor	s	-1	0	let 's say .
Bed009.F.dialogueact514	1622.32	1624.56	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Now the planner comes out and says you wanna get there fast ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact515	1624.7	1625.43	F	Professor	s	-1	0	take a taxi .
Bed009.F.dialogueact516	1626.06	1626.37	F	Professor	s^f	-1	0	OK .
Bed009.F.dialogueact517	1626.8	1629.94	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And the language end doesn't know that .
Bed009.F.dialogueact518	1631.54	1635.67	F	Professor	s	-1	0	OK , there 's all sorts of dialogues that won't make any sense which would be just fine .
Bed009.A.dialogueact519	1634.22	1634.42	A	PhD	fg.%	-1	0	hmm
Bed009.B.dialogueact521	1636.8	1637.13	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed009.F.dialogueact520	1636.74	1637.67	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh
Bed009.A.dialogueact522	1637.37	1637.57	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	That would
Bed009.A.dialogueact523	1637.57	1640.88	A	PhD	s	-1	0	b but that {disfmarker} I think that {disfmarker} that uh point has been realized
Bed009.A.dialogueact524	1640.88	1644.12	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and it 's {disfmarker} it 's not really um been defined yet
Bed009.A.dialogueact525	1644.12	1654.94	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but there 's gonna be some kind of feedback and input from uh the action planner into all the analysis modules , telling them what to expect and what the current state of the discourse is .
Bed009.D.dialogueact526	1651.3	1651.57	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed009.A.dialogueact527	1655.04	1658.69	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Beyond what 's currently being implemented which is just word lists .
Bed009.F.dialogueact528	1658.72	1661.55	F	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah , but this is not the st this is not just the state of the discourse .
Bed009.B.dialogueact529	1659.25	1659.64	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.A.dialogueact530	1660.1	1661.16	A	PhD	s^2^t1	-1	0	Of {disfmarker} of special interest .
Bed009.F.dialogueact531	1661.55	1663.67	F	Professor	s	-1	0	This is actually the state of the plan .
Bed009.F.dialogueact532	1663.78	1664.3	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	That 's why
Bed009.A.dialogueact534	1665.27	1666.88	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yes , Yes , Mm - hmm yeah .
Bed009.B.dialogueact533	1664.86	1665.36	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact535	1665.86	1667.41	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	OK so it {disfmarker} z
Bed009.F.dialogueact536	1667.41	1668.18	F	Professor	fg	-1	0	and s
Bed009.F.dialogueact537	1669.03	1672.75	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	uh , It 's great if people are already taking that into account .
Bed009.F.dialogueact538	1673.5	1677.44	F	Professor	s	-1	0	But One would have t have to see {disfmarker} see the details .
Bed009.A.dialogueact539	1677.08	1679.37	A	PhD	s	-1	0	The specifics aren't really there yet .
Bed009.A.dialogueact540	1679.37	1679.5	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yes .
Bed009.A.dialogueact542	1679.79	1681.44	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So , there 's work to do there .
Bed009.F.dialogueact541	1679.65	1679.87	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed009.F.dialogueact543	1681.49	1683.18	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So anyway , Robert , that 's why I was thinking that
Bed009.B.dialogueact544	1683.01	1683.43	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact545	1683.91	1684.85	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	um
Bed009.F.dialogueact546	1685.61	1686.69	F	Professor	s^rt.%--	-1	0	I think you 're gonna need {disfmarker}
Bed009.F.dialogueact547	1687.11	1694.31	F	Professor	s	+1	2	We talked about this several times that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the input end is gonna need a fair amount of feedback from the planning end .
Bed009.A.dialogueact548	1692.79	1693.02	A	PhD	b	-1	0	hmm
Bed009.F.dialogueact549	1694.74	1700.28	F	Professor	s	-1	0	In {disfmarker} in one of these things which are {disfmarker} are much more continuous than the {disfmarker} just the dialogue over movies and stuff .
Bed009.A.dialogueact550	1701.58	1701.73	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed009.D.dialogueact551	1701.96	1702.04	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed009.A.dialogueact552	1704.71	1713.51	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And even on {disfmarker} on a more basic level the {disfmarker} the action planner actually needs to be able to have um an expressive power that can deal with these structures .
Bed009.A.dialogueact554	1714.53	1725.77	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And not just um say um {disfmarker} um the dialogue um will consist of ten possible states and th these states really are fixed in {disfmarker} in a certain sense .
Bed009.F.dialogueact553	1714.06	1714.18	F	Professor	qw^br^rt	-1	0	Hmm ?
Bed009.A.dialogueact556	1725.87	1726.34	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	You have to {disfmarker}
Bed009.F.dialogueact555	1725.74	1732.89	F	Professor	qy	+1	0	Would there be any chance of getting the terminology changed so that the dialogue planner was called a " dialogue planner " ?
Bed009.F.dialogueact557	1733.05	1739.55	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Because there 's this other thing The o There 's this other thing in {disfmarker} in the tourist domain which is gonna be a route planner
Bed009.A.dialogueact558	1733.83	1734.42	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	That 'd be nice .
Bed009.F.dialogueact559	1739.55	1741.25	F	Professor	s	-1	0	or {disfmarker} It 's really gonna be an action planner .
Bed009.F.dialogueact560	1742.78	1745.61	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	And {comment} i it {disfmarker}
Bed009.A.dialogueact561	1745.52	1747.41	A	PhD	s	+1	1	It oughta be called a {disfmarker} a dialogue manager .
Bed009.A.dialogueact562	1747.41	1749.08	A	PhD	s	-1	0	cuz that 's what everybody else calls it .
Bed009.F.dialogueact563	1747.75	1748.41	F	Professor	s^aa^rt	-1	0	I would think ,
Bed009.D.dialogueact565	1748.64	1748.73	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact564	1748.41	1748.65	F	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bed009.A.dialogueact567	1749.44	1749.59	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed009.F.dialogueact566	1749.25	1749.38	F	Professor	qw^br	-1	0	Huh ?
Bed009.F.dialogueact568	1750.46	1757.36	F	Professor	qw^cs	-1	0	So , s So what would happen if we sent a note saying " Gee we 've talked about this and couldn't we change this uh th the whole word ? "
Bed009.F.dialogueact569	1757.36	1759.27	F	Professor	s^df^no	-1	0	I have no idea how complicated these things are .
Bed009.B.dialogueact570	1761.91	1763.12	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Probably close to impossible .
Bed009.A.dialogueact571	1764.42	1767.19	A	PhD	s^arp	-1	0	Depends on who you talk to how .
Bed009.A.dialogueact572	1767.19	1767.77	A	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	We 'll see .
Bed009.A.dialogueact573	1768.82	1769.42	A	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	I 'll go check ,
Bed009.A.dialogueact574	1769.42	1770.6	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	cause I completely agree .
Bed009.A.dialogueact576	1770.81	1770.95	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bed009.D.dialogueact575	1770.34	1770.77	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed009.A.dialogueact577	1771.03	1776.84	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and I think this is just for historical reasons within uh , the preparation phase of the project
Bed009.A.dialogueact578	1776.84	1780.0	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and not because somebody actually believes it ought to be action planner .
Bed009.A.dialogueact579	1780.0	1784.7	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So if there is resistance against changing it , that 's just because " Oh , We don't want to change things . "
Bed009.A.dialogueact580	1784.79	1786.06	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	That {disfmarker} that not deep reason
Bed009.F.dialogueact581	1787.28	1787.55	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact582	1787.69	1787.99	F	Professor	s^t.%--	-1	0	anyway .
Bed009.F.dialogueact583	1789.16	1800.25	F	Professor	s	+1	0	I if {disfmarker} if that c in persists then we 're gonna need another term . for the thing that actually does the planning of the uh routes and whatever we are doing for the tourist .

Bed009.F.dialogueact586	1806.48	1808.8	F	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	That ha has all the wrong connotations .
Bed009.F.dialogueact587	1809.09	1811.11	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	it 's {disfmarker} it sounds like it 's you know stand alone .
Bed009.F.dialogueact588	1811.11	1812.06	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	It doesn't interact ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact589	1812.06	1812.49	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it doesn't
Bed009.F.dialogueact590	1815.37	1815.79	F	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's why I 'm saying .
Bed009.F.dialogueact591	1815.79	1816.45	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I think you can't {disfmarker}
Bed009.F.dialogueact592	1816.88	1820.75	F	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	it 's fine for looking up when T you know when the show 's on TV .
Bed009.F.dialogueact593	1820.75	1821.11	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	You go to th
Bed009.F.dialogueact594	1821.93	1829.49	F	Professor	s	-1	0	but I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think it 's really {disfmarker} really wrong headed for something that you {disfmarker} that has a lot of state ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact595	1829.49	1833.77	F	Professor	s	-1	0	it 's gonna interact co in a complicated way with the uh understanding parts .
Bed009.B.dialogueact596	1831.56	1831.86	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed009.B.dialogueact597	1834.9	1838.06	B	Grad	fg|s	+1	1	Yeah I think just the {disfmarker} the spatial planner and the route planner
Bed009.B.dialogueact598	1838.35	1842.43	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	I showed you once the interac action between them among them in the deep map system
Bed009.F.dialogueact599	1841.15	1841.29	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed009.B.dialogueact600	1842.43	1845.77	B	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	so {disfmarker} a printout of the communication between those two fills up
Bed009.B.dialogueact601	1846.16	1847.16	B	Grad	s^no	+1	1	I don't know how many pages
Bed009.A.dialogueact603	1847.64	1847.84	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm
Bed009.B.dialogueact602	1847.16	1850.32	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and that 's just part of how do I get to one place .
Bed009.B.dialogueact604	1850.32	1852.58	B	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's really insane .
Bed009.B.dialogueact605	1852.58	1853.29	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	and uh
Bed009.B.dialogueact606	1855.15	1861.24	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but um so this is um definitely a good point to get uh Michael into the discussion .
Bed009.B.dialogueact607	1861.46	1862.95	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Or to enter his discussion , actually .
Bed009.A.dialogueact609	1863.6	1864.41	A	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah , Marcus .
Bed009.B.dialogueact608	1863.25	1863.87	B	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's the way around .
Bed009.B.dialogueact610	1864.92	1865.38	B	Grad	s^bk^m	-1	0	Markus
Bed009.A.dialogueact612	1869.11	1869.63	A	PhD	qw.%-	-1	0	Wh - where 's ?
Bed009.B.dialogueact611	1868.91	1870.83	B	Grad	qy^rt.%--	-1	0	Is he new in the {disfmarker} in the ?
Bed009.A.dialogueact613	1870.51	1873.53	A	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah , he 's {disfmarker} he started um I think January .
Bed009.D.dialogueact614	1870.92	1871.18	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed009.A.dialogueact615	1875.75	1879.36	A	PhD	s	+1	0	And he 's gonna be responsible for the implementation of this action planner .
Bed009.A.dialogueact616	1879.73	1880.44	A	PhD	s^bsc	-1	0	Dialogue manager .
Bed009.B.dialogueact617	1882.87	1886.11	B	Grad	qy	-1	0	Is he gonna continue with the old {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} thing ?
Bed009.A.dialogueact618	1885.43	1885.71	A	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No ,
Bed009.A.dialogueact619	1885.71	1889.2	A	PhD	s^ar^r|s	+1	1	no he 's completely gonna rewrite everything . In Java .
Bed009.B.dialogueact620	1887.95	1888.16	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed009.A.dialogueact621	1890.24	1891.15	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	OK so that 's interesting .
Bed009.B.dialogueact622	1891.55	1893.07	B	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yes I was just {disfmarker} that 's my next question
Bed009.A.dialogueact623	1892.21	1892.7	A	PhD	b.x	-1	0	hmm
Bed009.B.dialogueact624	1893.07	1895.18	B	Grad	s	+1	0	whether we 're {disfmarker} we 're gonna stick to Prolog or not .
Bed009.A.dialogueact625	1895.23	1895.5	A	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bed009.A.dialogueact626	1895.61	1897.04	A	PhD	s^ar^m|s	+1	1	No , that 's gonna be phased out .
Bed009.F.dialogueact627	1896.76	1897.02	F	Professor	b.x	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed009.B.dialogueact628	1897.63	1897.86	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK
Bed009.B.dialogueact629	1900.85	1905.96	B	Grad	s	-1	0	But I do think the {disfmarker} the function modeling concept has a certain {disfmarker} makes sense in a {disfmarker} in a certain light
Bed009.A.dialogueact630	1904.7	1904.88	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed009.B.dialogueact631	1906.02	1919.63	B	Grad	s	-1	0	because the action planner should not be {disfmarker} or the dialogue manager in that case should not um w have to worry about whether it 's interfacing with um something that does route planning in this way or that way
Bed009.A.dialogueact632	1917.27	1917.6	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact633	1918.34	1919.2	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	I I totally agree .
Bed009.B.dialogueact635	1919.69	1919.85	B	Grad	qw^br^rt	-1	0	huh ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact634	1919.2	1919.49	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Sure .
Bed009.B.dialogueact636	1919.98	1920.83	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	it j
Bed009.F.dialogueact637	1920.04	1920.92	F	Professor	s^r	-1	0	Yeah I {disfmarker} I agree .
Bed009.F.dialogueact638	1920.91	1924.43	F	Professor	s	-1	0	There is {disfmarker} there 's a logic to dialogue which {disfmarker} which is {disfmarker} is separable .
Bed009.F.dialogueact639	1925.26	1925.46	F	Professor	%-	-1	0	I
Bed009.F.dialogueact640	1926.05	1926.12	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed009.B.dialogueact641	1926.61	1935.08	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and it {disfmarker} cant {disfmarker} sort of formulate its what it wants in a {disfmarker} in a rather a abstract uh way ,
Bed009.B.dialogueact642	1935.08	1937.71	B	Grad	s	-1	0	you know f " Find me a good route for this . "
Bed009.F.dialogueact643	1935.51	1935.7	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.B.dialogueact644	1938.11	1942.82	B	Grad	s	-1	0	It doesn't really have to worry ab how route planner A or how route planner B actually wants it .
Bed009.B.dialogueact645	1943.84	1947.55	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So this is {disfmarker} seemed like a good idea .
Bed009.B.dialogueact646	1949.57	1950.13	B	Grad	s	-1	0	In the beginning .
Bed009.F.dialogueact647	1950.07	1950.69	F	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's tricky .
Bed009.F.dialogueact648	1951.23	1953.54	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	It 's tricky because one could well imagine {disfmarker}
Bed009.F.dialogueact649	1953.54	1965.11	F	Professor	s	-1	0	I think it will turn out to be the case that uh , this thing we 're talking about , th the extended n uh knowledge modeler will fill in some parameters about what the person wants .
Bed009.F.dialogueact650	1965.11	1975.91	F	Professor	s	-1	0	One could well imagine that the next thing that 's trying to fill out the detailed uh , route planning , let 's say , will also have questions that it would like to ask the user .
Bed009.F.dialogueact651	1976.67	1981.98	F	Professor	s	-1	0	You could well imagine you get to a point where it 's got a {disfmarker} a choice to make and it just doesn't know something .
Bed009.A.dialogueact653	1983.43	1983.8	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact652	1983.28	1990.94	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And so y you would like it t also be able to uh formulate a query .
Bed009.F.dialogueact654	1992.41	2000.19	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And to run that back through uh . the dialogue manager and to the output module and back around .
Bed009.B.dialogueact655	2000.46	2001.06	B	Grad	b	-1	0	hmm
Bed009.F.dialogueact656	2001.01	2004.61	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And a I a a good design would {disfmarker} would allow that to happen .
Bed009.B.dialogueact657	2003.22	2003.83	B	Grad	s^2.%--	-1	0	a lot of ,
Bed009.B.dialogueact658	2003.83	2003.9	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah
Bed009.D.dialogueact659	2004.19	2004.43	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact660	2005.39	2008.26	F	Professor	s	-1	0	If {disfmarker} if you know if {disfmarker} if you can't make it happen then you {disfmarker} you do your best .
Bed009.A.dialogueact661	2006.78	2007.12	A	PhD	s^aap^rt	-1	0	Yeah
Bed009.A.dialogueact662	2007.92	2013.87	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but that doesn't necessarily contradict um an architecture where there really is a pers a def well - defined interface .
Bed009.A.dialogueact664	2014.39	2014.98	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and
Bed009.F.dialogueact663	2013.97	2014.52	F	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	I totally agree .
Bed009.F.dialogueact665	2014.8	2015.79	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but what it nee
Bed009.F.dialogueact666	2015.94	2017.05	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but th what the point is the
Bed009.F.dialogueact667	2017.33	2020.57	F	Professor	s	-1	0	in that case the dialogue manager is sort of event driven .
Bed009.F.dialogueact668	2020.69	2025.14	F	Professor	s	+1	0	So the dialogue manager may think it 's in a dialogue state of one sort ,
Bed009.A.dialogueact670	2025.56	2026.02	A	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact669	2025.35	2030.61	F	Professor	s:s	+1	2	and this {disfmarker} one of these planning modules comes along and says " hey , right now we need to ask a question " .
Bed009.F.dialogueact671	2031.08	2033.62	F	Professor	s	+1	1	So that forces the dialogue manager to change state .
Bed009.A.dialogueact672	2034.5	2034.89	A	PhD	s^bk^rt	-1	0	Yes
Bed009.F.dialogueact673	2035.02	2035.32	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed009.A.dialogueact675	2035.96	2036.16	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Sure ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact674	2035.58	2036.05	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	It could be y
Bed009.A.dialogueact676	2036.16	2039.15	A	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	ye yeah I {disfmarker} I think that 's {disfmarker} that 's the um concept that people have ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact677	2036.48	2037.14	F	Professor	fg|%-	-1	0	Yeah , yeah it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker}
Bed009.A.dialogueact679	2039.15	2039.3	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yep .
Bed009.F.dialogueact678	2038.96	2039.23	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed009.A.dialogueact680	2045.65	2058.64	A	PhD	s	+1	1	And {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} the underlying idea of course is that there is something like kernel modules with kernel functionality that you can plug uh certain applications like tourist information or um the home scenario with uh controlling a VCR and so on .
Bed009.A.dialogueact681	2060.61	2063.83	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And then extend it to an arbitrary number of applications eventually .
Bed009.A.dialogueact682	2065.03	2065.8	A	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	So {disfmarker} wouldn't
Bed009.A.dialogueact683	2065.88	2069.32	A	PhD	s	+1	1	That 's an additional reason to have this well - defined interface
Bed009.A.dialogueact685	2069.32	2072.72	A	PhD	s	+1	1	and keep these things like uh tourist information external .
Bed009.F.dialogueact684	2069.25	2069.6	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Oh , yeah , yeah .
Bed009.A.dialogueact686	2073.39	2075.27	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And then call it external services .
Bed009.B.dialogueact687	2074.95	2075.46	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed009.A.dialogueact688	2079.59	2081.12	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	But of course the {disfmarker} the more complex {disfmarker}
Bed009.B.dialogueact689	2080.09	2086.14	B	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , there is another philosophical issue that I think you know you can {disfmarker} evade
Bed009.A.dialogueact690	2081.3	2081.53	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yep .
Bed009.B.dialogueact691	2086.25	2094.83	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but , at at least it makes sense to me that sooner or later uh {disfmarker} a service is gonna come and describe itself to you .
Bed009.B.dialogueact692	2094.83	2105.05	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and that 's sort of what Srini is working on in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the DAML uh project where um you {disfmarker} you find a GIS about {disfmarker} that gives you information on Berkeley ,
Bed009.A.dialogueact693	2097.25	2097.42	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed009.B.dialogueact694	2105.05	2109.24	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and it 's {disfmarker} it 's gonna be there and tell you what it can do and how it wants to do things .
Bed009.B.dialogueact695	2109.86	2113.85	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and so you can actually interface to such a system without ever having met it before
Bed009.B.dialogueact696	2114.1	2120.98	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and the function modeler and a self - description of the um external service haggle it out
Bed009.A.dialogueact697	2114.64	2115.17	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed009.B.dialogueact698	2121.34	2128.43	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and you can use the same language core , understanding core to interface with planner - A , planner - B , planner - C and so forth .
Bed009.A.dialogueact699	2125.62	2125.8	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed009.D.dialogueact700	2125.89	2126.12	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed009.B.dialogueact701	2128.9	2130.92	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	Which is , you know , uh {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} utopian {disfmarker}
Bed009.B.dialogueact702	2131.69	2132.99	B	Grad	s	-1	0	completely utopian at the moment ,
Bed009.B.dialogueact703	2132.99	2138.07	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but slowly , you know , getting into the realm of the uh contingent .
Bed009.A.dialogueact704	2138.28	2138.47	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed009.B.dialogueact705	2144.14	2150.29	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	But we are facing of course much more um realistic problems .
Bed009.B.dialogueact706	2151.32	2158.39	B	Grad	s^rt	+1	0	And language input for example , is of course uh crucial you know also when you do the sort of deep understanding analysis that we envision .
Bed009.B.dialogueact707	2159.21	2162.97	B	Grad	fh|s.%--	-1	0	um Then of course , the uh um , you know
Bed009.B.dialogueact708	2163.72	2164.1	B	Grad	qo	-1	0	what is it {disfmarker}
Bed009.B.dialogueact709	2164.21	2165.32	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	poverty of the stimulus ,
Bed009.B.dialogueact710	2165.32	2167.7	B	Grad	s	-1	0	yet the m uh the less we get of that the better .
Bed009.B.dialogueact711	2168.7	2174.98	B	Grad	fh|qo	-1	0	and um so we {disfmarker} we 're thinking , for example how much syntactic analysis actually happens already in the parser .
Bed009.B.dialogueact713	2175.64	2178.59	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and whether one could interface to that potentially
Bed009.D.dialogueact712	2175.6	2175.92	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed009.D.dialogueact714	2178.3	2178.57	D	Grad	fg	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bed009.D.dialogueact715	2178.78	2180.45	D	Grad	qy.%--	-1	0	are there currently is uh
Bed009.D.dialogueact716	2180.45	2181.96	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	no syntactic analysis
Bed009.D.dialogueact717	2182.64	2185.09	D	Grad	s	-1	0	but in the next release there will be some .
Bed009.B.dialogueact718	2185.53	2185.75	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed009.D.dialogueact720	2186.35	2186.83	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	unless
Bed009.F.dialogueact719	2186.2	2186.69	F	Professor	qw.%--	-1	0	How 's it {disfmarker}
Bed009.D.dialogueact721	2186.83	2187.78	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and it 's
Bed009.D.dialogueact722	2187.78	2189.27	D	Grad	fg	-1	0	um uh
Bed009.D.dialogueact723	2189.27	2191.02	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	you can access this
Bed009.F.dialogueact724	2191.47	2196.89	F	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	S so uh y we {disfmarker} we looked at the e current pattern matching thing .
Bed009.D.dialogueact725	2196.62	2196.89	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact726	2197.57	2200.39	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And as you say it 's just a surface pattern matcher .
Bed009.F.dialogueact727	2200.84	2202.88	F	Professor	qw	+1	0	Uh , So what are {disfmarker} what are the plans roughly ?
Bed009.D.dialogueact728	2203.7	2207.74	D	Grad	h|s^rt	+1	1	um it 's to {disfmarker} to integrate and syntactic analysis .
Bed009.D.dialogueact729	2208.71	2213.64	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and um add some more features like segmentation .
Bed009.D.dialogueact730	2214.39	2223.13	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	So then an utter more than one utterance is {disfmarker} There um there 's often uh pause between it
Bed009.D.dialogueact731	2223.89	2226.37	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and a segmentation occurs .
Bed009.D.dialogueact733	2229.34	2229.66	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	um
Bed009.F.dialogueact732	2229.07	2231.0	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	So , the um {disfmarker}
Bed009.F.dialogueact734	2232.19	2238.05	F	Professor	s^bu.%--	-1	0	So the idea is to uh {disfmarker} have a pa y y a particular {disfmarker}
Bed009.D.dialogueact735	2233.27	2233.53	D	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah
Bed009.F.dialogueact736	2238.05	2240.24	F	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Do you have a particular parser in mind ?
Bed009.F.dialogueact737	2240.24	2242.82	F	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	Is it uh {disfmarker} partic d
Bed009.F.dialogueact738	2242.82	2244.15	F	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	I mean have you thought through {disfmarker} ?
Bed009.F.dialogueact739	2245.23	2247.17	F	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Is it an HPSG parser ?
Bed009.F.dialogueact740	2247.17	2248.23	F	Professor	qrr^rt	-1	0	Is it a whatever ?
Bed009.D.dialogueact741	2248.75	2251.99	D	Grad	s^ar|s.%--	-1	0	No {disfmarker} no it 's {disfmarker} uh I think it 's it 's totally complicated for
Bed009.D.dialogueact742	2252.53	2253.88	D	Grad	s	-1	0	it 's just one {disfmarker} one person
Bed009.F.dialogueact743	2252.67	2252.99	F	Professor	fg	-1	0	OK .
Bed009.D.dialogueact744	2253.88	2256.28	D	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	and so I have to keep the {disfmarker}
Bed009.F.dialogueact745	2255.65	2256.36	F	Professor	s^bk|s^bu	-1	0	Oh , you have to do it .
Bed009.F.dialogueact746	2256.48	2257.0	F	Professor	s^bk^r	-1	0	You have to do it ,
Bed009.D.dialogueact748	2257.35	2257.63	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact747	2257.0	2257.17	F	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bed009.D.dialogueact749	2257.94	2260.63	D	Grad	s	-1	0	ah and so {vocalsound} things must be simpler
Bed009.F.dialogueact750	2261.27	2261.7	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	I see ,
Bed009.D.dialogueact752	2262.11	2266.57	D	Grad	s	-1	0	but uh , Miel syntactic analysis with um finite state transducers .
Bed009.F.dialogueact751	2261.7	2261.98	F	Professor	%-	-1	0	so
Bed009.F.dialogueact753	2264.16	2265.63	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	But the people at D F
Bed009.F.dialogueact754	2266.23	2266.52	F	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed009.F.dialogueact755	2267.01	2269.55	F	Professor	s	+1	0	People at DFKI have written a fair number of parsers .
Bed009.F.dialogueact756	2270.79	2275.56	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Other {disfmarker} you know , people over the years . uh have written various parsers at DFKI .
Bed009.F.dialogueact757	2275.56	2277.44	F	Professor	qy^d^rt	+1	0	None of them are suitable ?
Bed009.F.dialogueact758	2277.61	2278.73	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I d I 'm asking .
Bed009.F.dialogueact759	2278.73	2279.11	F	Professor	s^df^no	-1	0	I don't know .
Bed009.D.dialogueact760	2279.33	2282.81	D	Grad	s^bk|s	+1	1	Yeah , uh the problem is th that it has to be very fast
Bed009.D.dialogueact761	2282.81	2287.46	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	because um if you want to for more than one path anywhere
Bed009.F.dialogueact762	2284.74	2285.01	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed009.D.dialogueact763	2288.36	2291.43	D	Grad	qo	-1	0	what 's in the latches from the speech recognizer
Bed009.F.dialogueact764	2289.74	2290.08	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.D.dialogueact765	2291.43	2293.63	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so it 's speed is crucial .
Bed009.D.dialogueact766	2293.63	2293.88	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	uh
Bed009.D.dialogueact767	2295.94	2297.68	D	Grad	s	-1	0	And they are not fast enough .
Bed009.F.dialogueact768	2298.38	2298.69	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.D.dialogueact769	2300.5	2306.11	D	Grad	s	+1	1	And they also have to be very robust . cuz of um speech recognition errors
Bed009.D.dialogueact770	2306.12	2306.38	D	Grad	%--	-1	0	and
Bed009.F.dialogueact771	2306.42	2306.8	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed009.F.dialogueact772	2307.22	2317.37	F	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	So , um {disfmarker} So there was a chunk parser in Verbmobil , that was one of the uh branchers .
Bed009.F.dialogueact773	2317.37	2318.21	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	You know they {disfmarker} d th I c
Bed009.F.dialogueact774	2318.21	2324.81	F	Professor	s	-1	0	There were these various uh , competing uh syntax modules .
Bed009.F.dialogueact775	2325.73	2328.09	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And I know one of them was a chunk parser
Bed009.F.dialogueact776	2328.09	2330.18	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and I don't remember {pause} who did that .
Bed009.B.dialogueact778	2331.47	2332.34	B	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	A Alan ?
Bed009.D.dialogueact777	2331.08	2332.75	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	I think it 's that
Bed009.D.dialogueact779	2334.04	2334.28	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	might ,
Bed009.D.dialogueact780	2334.39	2336.29	D	Grad	s	-1	0	at Tuebingen I thought .
Bed009.F.dialogueact781	2336.98	2337.89	F	Professor	s^bk|s^no	-1	0	Yeah I d I don't remember .
Bed009.D.dialogueact782	2337.98	2340.24	D	Grad	qy	-1	0	was {disfmarker} Do you know something about that ?
Bed009.A.dialogueact783	2341.41	2344.83	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Tubingen was at least involved in putting the chunks together
Bed009.D.dialogueact784	2341.86	2342.8	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	In Tub - at {disfmarker}
Bed009.A.dialogueact785	2345.21	2350.47	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} can't quite recall whether they actually produced the chunks in the first place .
Bed009.D.dialogueact786	2350.56	2350.9	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	oh
Bed009.F.dialogueact787	2350.93	2351.54	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Uh . I see .
Bed009.F.dialogueact788	2351.54	2352.02	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , that 's right .
Bed009.A.dialogueact789	2352.23	2353.41	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	Or wh
Bed009.D.dialogueact791	2352.34	2354.05	D	Grad	s	-1	0	Oh from {disfmarker} from Stuttgart ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact790	2352.26	2352.49	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	There w
Bed009.F.dialogueact792	2352.49	2352.87	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	That 's right .
Bed009.F.dialogueact793	2352.87	2359.72	F	Professor	s	-1	0	They w They had {disfmarker} There were {disfmarker} This was done with a two phase thing , where {comment} the chunk parser itself was pretty stupid
Bed009.D.dialogueact794	2354.05	2354.48	D	Grad	fg|%-	-1	0	yeah , also
Bed009.F.dialogueact795	2359.72	2364.06	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and then there was a kind of trying to fit them together that h used more context .
Bed009.A.dialogueact796	2362.03	2362.32	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed009.A.dialogueact797	2363.05	2363.32	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah
Bed009.F.dialogueact798	2364.27	2364.48	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Right ?
Bed009.A.dialogueact799	2365.9	2368.69	A	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Well you s and {disfmarker} and especially you did some {disfmarker} some
Bed009.A.dialogueact800	2369.25	2371.04	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	um , l um
Bed009.A.dialogueact801	2371.78	2375.3	A	PhD	s	-1	0	was a learning - based approach which learned from a big corpus of {disfmarker} of trees .
Bed009.D.dialogueact803	2374.8	2375.18	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact802	2374.55	2374.76	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed009.A.dialogueact805	2375.71	2382.67	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And yes the {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} the chunk parser was a finite - state machine that um Mark Light originally w worked on in {disfmarker} while he was in Tuebingen
Bed009.F.dialogueact804	2375.51	2375.67	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed009.A.dialogueact806	2382.67	2385.93	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and then somebody else in Tuebingen picked that up . So it was done in Tuebingen ,
Bed009.A.dialogueact807	2385.93	2386.12	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bed009.A.dialogueact808	2386.32	2386.68	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Definitely .
Bed009.F.dialogueact809	2386.73	2387.9	F	Professor	qy^rt.%--	-1	0	But is that the kind of thing y
Bed009.F.dialogueact810	2387.9	2390.13	F	Professor	s	-1	0	It sounds like the kind of thing that you were thinking of .
Bed009.A.dialogueact812	2391.65	2392.59	A	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah I guess it 's similar .
Bed009.D.dialogueact811	2391.25	2391.51	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah .
Bed009.D.dialogueact813	2392.16	2392.25	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah
Bed009.D.dialogueact814	2392.31	2395.62	D	Grad	s	-1	0	that 's In this direction ,
Bed009.D.dialogueact815	2395.62	2395.79	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yes
Bed009.F.dialogueact816	2396.06	2396.15	F	Professor	qw^br	-1	0	What ?
Bed009.D.dialogueact817	2396.83	2398.33	D	Grad	s^r	-1	0	Yeah , it 's in {disfmarker} in this direction .
Bed009.B.dialogueact819	2400.92	2401.16	B	Grad	%--	-1	0	The {disfmarker}
Bed009.F.dialogueact818	2400.45	2400.89	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed009.B.dialogueact820	2402.24	2409.46	B	Grad	s	-1	0	From Michael Strube , I 've heard very good stuff about the chunk parser that is done by FORWISS ,
Bed009.B.dialogueact821	2409.63	2413.79	B	Grad	s	-1	0	uh , which is in embassy doing the parsing .
Bed009.A.dialogueact822	2414.19	2414.55	A	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.B.dialogueact823	2415.18	2420.93	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So this is sort of {disfmarker} came as a surprise to me that you know , embassy s {comment} is featuring a nice parser
Bed009.B.dialogueact824	2421.82	2428.97	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but it 's {pause} what I hear . One could also look at that and see whether there is some synergy possible .
Bed009.D.dialogueact825	2424.78	2425.63	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm , yeah ,
Bed009.D.dialogueact826	2425.63	2427.39	D	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	it would be very interesting ,
Bed009.D.dialogueact827	2427.39	2427.48	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.D.dialogueact828	2428.46	2429.1	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm , yeah .
Bed009.B.dialogueact829	2429.79	2431.37	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And they 're doing chunk parsing
Bed009.B.dialogueact830	2431.37	2432.16	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and it 's uh {disfmarker}
Bed009.B.dialogueact831	2433.44	2435.51	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I can give you the names of the people who do it there .
Bed009.B.dialogueact832	2436.74	2438.05	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	But um .
Bed009.B.dialogueact833	2440.59	2443.41	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Then there is of course more ways of parsing things .
Bed009.F.dialogueact834	2444.36	2444.87	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Of course .
Bed009.F.dialogueact835	2444.87	2454.32	F	Professor	s^arp	+1	2	But {disfmarker} But uh given th the constraints , that you want it to be small and fast and so forth , my guess is you 're probably into some kind of chunk parsing .
Bed009.F.dialogueact836	2456.61	2466.39	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And uh I 'm not a big believer in this um statistical you know , cleaning up
Bed009.F.dialogueact837	2466.81	2467.97	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh
Bed009.F.dialogueact838	2470.47	2478.91	F	Professor	s	-1	0	It {disfmarker} That seems to me kind of a last resort if uh you can't do it any other way .
Bed009.F.dialogueact839	2479.23	2480.0	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh
Bed009.F.dialogueact840	2480.51	2480.96	F	Professor	s^no	-1	0	but I dunno .
Bed009.D.dialogueact842	2481.37	2481.76	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact841	2480.96	2483.5	F	Professor	s	-1	0	It may {disfmarker} i i may be that 's what you guys finally decide do .
Bed009.F.dialogueact843	2485.64	2485.96	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bed009.F.dialogueact844	2487.56	2488.24	F	Professor	qy.%-	-1	0	And have you looked {disfmarker}
Bed009.F.dialogueact845	2488.24	2489.75	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh just {disfmarker} again for context {disfmarker}
Bed009.D.dialogueact846	2489.86	2490.38	D	Grad	s^bk^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact847	2490.09	2493.33	F	Professor	s	-1	0	There is this {disfmarker} this one that they did at SRI some years ago {disfmarker}
Bed009.F.dialogueact848	2493.33	2494.0	F	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	Fastus ?
Bed009.D.dialogueact849	2495.58	2496.14	D	Grad	h	-1	0	um
Bed009.F.dialogueact850	2495.85	2495.88	F	Professor	%-	-1	0	a {disfmarker}
Bed009.D.dialogueact851	2496.56	2497.94	D	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah , I 've {disfmarker} I 've looked at it
Bed009.D.dialogueact852	2497.99	2501.23	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but it 's no {disfmarker} not much uh information available .
Bed009.D.dialogueact854	2502.05	2502.74	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	I found ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact853	2501.59	2501.74	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	ah !
Bed009.D.dialogueact855	2502.89	2505.82	D	Grad	s	-1	0	but it 's also finite - state transducers , I thought .
Bed009.F.dialogueact856	2505.38	2505.79	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	It is .
Bed009.F.dialogueact857	2505.83	2506.04	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed009.F.dialogueact858	2506.04	2507.23	F	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it was pretty ambitious .
Bed009.D.dialogueact859	2507.31	2507.53	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and
Bed009.F.dialogueact860	2507.63	2509.03	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And of course it was English oriented ,
Bed009.D.dialogueact862	2509.15	2516.87	D	Grad	fg|s^df.%--	-1	0	Yeah , and {disfmarker} and Purely finite - state transducers are not so good for German since there 's um
Bed009.F.dialogueact861	2509.03	2511.75	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	um w
Bed009.F.dialogueact863	2516.05	2516.26	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed009.D.dialogueact865	2517.85	2520.13	D	Grad	s	-1	0	The word order is {disfmarker} is uh not fixed
Bed009.F.dialogueact864	2517.63	2520.4	F	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , I guess that 's the point is {disfmarker} is all the morphology and stuff .
Bed009.F.dialogueact866	2520.86	2522.57	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And English is all th all word order .
Bed009.F.dialogueact867	2523.0	2524.29	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And it makes a lot more sense .
Bed009.D.dialogueact868	2523.9	2524.25	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed009.F.dialogueact869	2524.29	2525.6	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	And {disfmarker} e
Bed009.F.dialogueact870	2525.6	2526.3	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , OK .

Bed009.F.dialogueact881	2546.76	2548.58	F	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	a a e y you 've got stemmers ?
Bed009.F.dialogueact882	2548.58	2551.06	F	Professor	qrr.%-	-1	0	Or is that something that {disfmarker}
Bed009.D.dialogueact883	2550.79	2553.43	D	Grad	h|s	-1	0	Um , yeah but it 's all in the {disfmarker} in the lexicon .
Bed009.D.dialogueact885	2555.12	2555.45	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So it 's {disfmarker}
Bed009.F.dialogueact884	2554.93	2555.88	F	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	But did you have that ?
Bed009.D.dialogueact886	2556.12	2557.89	D	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah th the information is available .

Bed009.D.dialogueact891	2562.85	2563.24	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bed009.F.dialogueact890	2562.68	2565.54	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So y you just connect to the lexicon
Bed009.D.dialogueact892	2565.62	2565.89	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah
Bed009.F.dialogueact893	2565.7	2566.84	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	and uh
Bed009.F.dialogueact894	2566.84	2571.41	F	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	at least for German you have all {disfmarker} all of the {disfmarker} uh the stemming information .
Bed009.D.dialogueact895	2571.83	2572.52	D	Grad	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah , we can ,
Bed009.D.dialogueact896	2572.52	2572.62	D	Grad	b	-1	0	oh yeah .
Bed009.D.dialogueact897	2573.31	2576.56	D	Grad	s	+1	1	We have knowledge bases from {disfmarker} from Verbmobil system we can use
Bed009.F.dialogueact898	2575.71	2575.93	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bed009.D.dialogueact899	2576.56	2576.77	D	Grad	%--	-1	0	and so .

Bed009.F.dialogueact901	2586.84	2588.81	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it doesn't look like i you 're using it .
Bed009.F.dialogueact902	2589.21	2594.48	F	Professor	s	-1	0	I didn't n see it being used in the current template uh parser .
Bed009.F.dialogueact903	2595.08	2597.61	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I didn't see any Uh {disfmarker}
Bed009.F.dialogueact904	2597.68	2599.71	F	Professor	s	-1	0	of course we l actually only looked at the English .
Bed009.D.dialogueact905	2598.74	2599.04	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	It {disfmarker}
Bed009.D.dialogueact907	2600.86	2601.28	D	Grad	h	-1	0	um
Bed009.F.dialogueact906	2600.79	2601.41	F	Professor	qy^rt^t1	-1	0	Did we look at the German ?
Bed009.F.dialogueact908	2602.58	2603.31	F	Professor	s^no^t1	-1	0	I don't remember .
Bed009.D.dialogueact910	2603.34	2605.96	D	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , but {disfmarker} but it 's used for {disfmarker} for stem forms .
Bed009.F.dialogueact909	2603.31	2603.49	F	Professor	qw.%-	-1	0	So w wha
Bed009.A.dialogueact911	2608.08	2610.07	A	PhD	s	-1	0	n Well I think {disfmarker} I think there 's some misunderstanding here

Bed009.A.dialogueact914	2610.07	2612.05	A	PhD	s	-1	0	it 's {disfmarker} Morphix is not used on - line .
Bed009.D.dialogueact913	2609.94	2610.35	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bed009.A.dialogueact915	2613.13	2615.47	A	PhD	s	-1	0	s so the lexicon might be derived by Morphix
Bed009.D.dialogueact916	2613.38	2613.63	D	Grad	qw.%	-1	0	What ?
Bed009.A.dialogueact917	2615.47	2623.4	A	PhD	s	+1	0	but What {disfmarker} what 's happening on - line is just um um a {disfmarker} a retrieval from the lexicon which would give all the stemming information
Bed009.F.dialogueact918	2615.64	2615.82	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed009.D.dialogueact920	2622.31	2622.64	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .

Bed009.F.dialogueact1018	2864.34	2864.72	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Whatever .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1019	2865.2	2871.24	F	Professor	s	+1	0	So all that kind of information could be combined into decision networks and give you decisions .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1020	2871.67	2880.9	F	Professor	qo	+1	1	But the other half of the problem is How would you get that kind of information from the parsed input ?
Bed009.F.dialogueact1021	2881.57	2883.19	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So , um
Bed009.F.dialogueact1022	2883.67	2888.86	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So what you might try to do is just build more templates , saying uh
Bed009.F.dialogueact1023	2888.86	2890.39	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	we 're trying to build a templ
Bed009.F.dialogueact1024	2890.39	2896.58	F	Professor	s	-1	0	you know build a template that w uh somehow would capture the fact that he wants to take a picture .
Bed009.D.dialogueact1025	2891.35	2891.92	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1026	2897.42	2897.77	F	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	OK ?
Bed009.F.dialogueact1027	2897.77	2899.49	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and we could {disfmarker} you could do this .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1028	2899.49	2902.56	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And it 's a small enough domain that probably you , you know {disfmarker}
Bed009.D.dialogueact1029	2902.56	2902.92	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1030	2903.64	2903.95	F	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1031	2903.95	2904.4	F	Professor	s	-1	0	You could do this .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1032	2904.79	2909.22	F	Professor	s	-1	0	But uh from our point of view this is also a research project
Bed009.F.dialogueact1033	2909.3	2915.75	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and there are a couple of people not here for various reasons who are doing doctoral dissertations on this ,
Bed009.A.dialogueact1034	2914.72	2915.02	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1035	2915.85	2924.67	F	Professor	s	+1	0	and the idea that we 're really after is a very deep semantics based on cognitive linguistics
Bed009.F.dialogueact1036	2924.67	2933.8	F	Professor	s	+1	0	and the notion that there are a relatively small number of primitive conceptual schemas that characterize a lot of activity .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1037	2934.22	2938.64	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So a typical one in this formulation is a container .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1038	2939.02	2940.26	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So this is a static thing .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1039	2940.85	2948.83	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And the notion is that all sorts of physical situations are characterized in terms of containers .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1040	2948.83	2950.95	F	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	Going in and out the portals and con
Bed009.D.dialogueact1041	2950.7	2951.1	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1042	2951.19	2951.44	F	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1043	2952.12	2958.94	F	Professor	s	-1	0	But also , importantly for Lakoff and these guys is all sorts of metaphorical things are also characterized this way .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1044	2958.94	2960.43	F	Professor	s	-1	0	You get in trouble and you know et cetera
Bed009.D.dialogueact1045	2959.83	2960.07	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1046	2960.43	2960.81	F	Professor	%--	-1	0	and so {disfmarker} s
Bed009.F.dialogueact1047	2961.24	2969.34	F	Professor	s	+1	0	So , what we 're really trying to do is to map from the discourse to the conceptual semantics level .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1048	2970.13	2973.45	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And from there to the appropriate decisions .
Bed009.A.dialogueact1050	2975.8	2976.23	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1049	2975.42	2982.51	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So another one of these primitive , what are called " image schemas " , is uh goal seeking .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1051	2983.2	2988.06	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So this a notion of a source , path , goal , trajector , possibly obstacles .
Bed009.A.dialogueact1052	2983.84	2984.11	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1053	2988.65	2990.9	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And the idea is this is another conceptual primitive .
Bed009.A.dialogueact1055	2992.79	2993.1	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1054	2992.66	3001.03	F	Professor	s^rt	+1	0	And that all sorts of things , particularly in the tourist domain , can be represented in terms of uh source , path and goal .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1056	3001.03	3004.97	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	So the idea would be could we build an analyser that would take an utterance
Bed009.F.dialogueact1057	3006.02	3006.91	F	Professor	s:s^fe^rt	-1	0	and say " Aha !
Bed009.F.dialogueact1058	3007.36	3010.8	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	th this utterance is talking about an attempt to reach a goal .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1059	3011.28	3012.11	F	Professor	s	-1	0	The goal is this ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact1060	3012.11	3015.57	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	the pers the , uh traveller is that ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact1061	3015.63	3015.9	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh
Bed009.F.dialogueact1062	3015.9	3017.75	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	the sor w where we are at now is is this ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact1063	3018.21	3020.16	F	Professor	s	-1	0	they 've mentioned possible obstacles , et cetera . "
Bed009.F.dialogueact1064	3020.83	3026.13	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So th the {disfmarker} and this is an {disfmarker} again attempt to get very wide coverage .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1065	3026.25	3038.28	F	Professor	s	+1	1	So if you can do this , then the notion would be that across a very large range of domains , you could use this deep conceptual basis as the interface .
Bed009.A.dialogueact1066	3028.72	3029.06	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.A.dialogueact1067	3035.91	3036.18	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1068	3038.76	3039.65	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And then ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact1069	3040.35	3041.17	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh
Bed009.F.dialogueact1070	3042.79	3051.59	F	Professor	s	-1	0	The processing of that , both on the input end , recognizing that certain words in a language talk about containers or goals , et cetera ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact1071	3052.51	3061.25	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and on the output end , given this kind of information , you can then uh make decisions about what actions to take .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1072	3062.76	3070.14	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Provides , they claim , a very powerful , general notion of deep semantics .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1073	3070.79	3071.65	F	Professor	s	-1	0	So that 's what we 're really doing .
Bed009.A.dialogueact1074	3072.29	3072.84	A	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1075	3074.7	3076.24	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	And
Bed009.F.dialogueact1076	3076.24	3077.55	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Nancy is going to {disfmarker}
Bed009.F.dialogueact1077	3077.98	3088.48	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Her talk is going to be not about using this in applications , but about modeling how children might learn this kind of uh deep semantic grammar .
Bed009.A.dialogueact1078	3085.11	3085.38	A	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.A.dialogueact1079	3086.07	3086.66	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yep , yep .
Bed009.A.dialogueact1080	3092.21	3098.09	A	PhD	qw	-1	0	And how do you envision um the {disfmarker} the um this deep semantic to be worked with .
Bed009.A.dialogueact1081	3098.09	3100.14	A	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	Would it be highly ambiguous if
Bed009.A.dialogueact1082	3100.14	3106.66	A	PhD	qy^bu^d	-1	0	and then there would be another module that takes that um highly underspecified deep semantic construction
Bed009.A.dialogueact1083	3106.66	3112.47	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	and map it onto the current context to find out what the person really was talking about in that context .
Bed009.A.dialogueact1085	3112.47	3114.48	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} or a {disfmarker}
Bed009.F.dialogueact1084	3112.42	3114.87	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Well that 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that 's where the belief - net comes in .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1086	3114.87	3116.03	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So th the idea is ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact1087	3116.19	3119.04	F	Professor	s	-1	0	let 's take this business about going to the Powder - Tower .
Bed009.A.dialogueact1088	3119.33	3119.57	A	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1089	3119.96	3124.72	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So part of what you 'll get out of this will be the fact tha w
Bed009.F.dialogueact1090	3124.86	3125.79	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	if it works right ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact1091	3126.12	3128.92	F	Professor	s	-1	0	OK , that this is an agent that wants to go to this place
Bed009.F.dialogueact1092	3128.92	3129.65	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and that 's their goal
Bed009.A.dialogueact1094	3130.15	3130.49	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1093	3130.08	3132.79	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and there will be additional situational information .
Bed009.A.dialogueact1095	3132.88	3133.38	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1096	3133.11	3133.87	F	Professor	s^f	-1	0	Uh , OK ,
Bed009.A.dialogueact1097	3133.62	3133.82	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	th
Bed009.F.dialogueact1098	3134.0	3135.42	F	Professor	s	-1	0	part of it comes from the ontology .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1099	3135.5	3136.82	F	Professor	s	-1	0	The tower is this kind of object .
Bed009.A.dialogueact1100	3136.12	3136.37	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.A.dialogueact1101	3136.92	3137.68	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah , OK .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1102	3137.11	3138.55	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Part of it comes from the user model .
Bed009.A.dialogueact1103	3139.03	3139.28	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1104	3139.61	3147.71	F	Professor	s	+1	0	And the idea of the belief - net is it combines the information from the dialogue which comes across in this general way ,
Bed009.A.dialogueact1105	3148.16	3148.41	A	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1106	3148.31	3156.06	F	Professor	s	-1	0	you know this is a {disfmarker} this is a goal seeking behavior , along with specific information from the ontology about the kinds of objects involved
Bed009.A.dialogueact1107	3150.73	3150.84	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah
Bed009.A.dialogueact1108	3155.48	3155.77	A	PhD	b	-1	0	OK ,
Bed009.A.dialogueact1109	3155.77	3155.85	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bed009.A.dialogueact1110	3156.02	3157.33	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	yep yep yep yep
Bed009.F.dialogueact1111	3156.06	3159.48	F	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	and about the situation about " Is it raining ? "
Bed009.F.dialogueact1112	3159.48	3159.69	F	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I don't know .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1113	3159.69	3160.33	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Whatever it is .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1114	3160.68	3163.27	F	Professor	s	-1	0	And so that 's the belief - net that we 've laid out .
Bed009.A.dialogueact1115	3163.68	3163.98	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1116	3164.65	3176.12	F	Professor	s	+1	0	And so th the coupling to the situation comes in this model from , at th at th at the belief - net , combining evidence from the dialogue with the ontology with the situation .
Bed009.A.dialogueact1117	3172.46	3172.62	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed009.D.dialogueact1118	3175.65	3175.87	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1119	3178.15	3180.06	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	But Nancy isn't gonna talk about that ,
Bed009.A.dialogueact1120	3179.94	3180.05	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bed009.A.dialogueact1122	3180.13	3180.37	A	PhD	b	-1	0	oh yeah ,
Bed009.A.dialogueact1123	3180.37	3180.64	A	PhD	b	-1	0	I see ,
Bed009.F.dialogueact1121	3180.06	3182.18	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	just about the um
Bed009.A.dialogueact1124	3180.64	3181.66	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah yeah , really .

Bed009.F.dialogueact1126	3185.99	3186.18	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	Right .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1127	3186.18	3187.27	F	Professor	s	-1	0	The {disfmarker} the construction grammar .
Bed009.B.dialogueact1128	3191.41	3192.21	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And she 's gonna start
Bed009.B.dialogueact1129	3192.46	3192.89	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	in a minute .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1130	3192.98	3193.24	F	Professor	s	-1	0	In a minute .
Bed009.D.dialogueact1131	3193.92	3195.02	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Ah , OK .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1132	3194.8	3195.05	F	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bed009.G.dialogueact1133	3196.67	3197.15	G	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	Is it i in ,
Bed009.G.dialogueact1134	3197.15	3199.4	G	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	then , your place , in five {disfmarker} five - A ?
Bed009.A.dialogueact1135	3201.59	3201.8	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Alright .
