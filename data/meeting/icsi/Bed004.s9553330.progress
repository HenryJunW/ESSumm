2	Bed004.s.9	The first Wizard test has been completed.
Bed004.D.dialogueact81	445.55	454.67	D	Grad	qy	-1	0	Should I go first , with the uh , um , data .
Bed004.D.dialogueact85	474.557	485.858	D	Grad	fh|s	+1	2	So . On Friday we had our wizard test data test and um {vocalsound} these are some of the results .
5	Bed004.s.10	Me003 has been working on developing the BayesNet.
Bed004.A.dialogueact309	1371.78	1378.05	A	Grad	s	+1	3	So , what I did for this {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} uh , a pedagogical belief - net
Bed004.A.dialogueact310	1378.05	1385.33	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because I was {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I took {disfmarker} I tried to conceptually do what you were talking about with the nodes that you could expand out {disfmarker}
Bed004.A.dialogueact332	1428.57	1431.65	A	Grad	s^rt	+1	0	So basically all I did was I took the last {pause} belief - net
Bed004.A.dialogueact334	1432.4	1439.7	A	Grad	s	+1	2	and I grouped things according to what {disfmarker} how I thought they would fit in to uh image schemas that would be related .
Bed004.A.dialogueact341	1450.89	1456.01	A	Grad	h|s	+1	1	Um , you know , we have {disfmarker} we have the concept of what their intention was , whether they were trying to tour or do business or whatever ,
