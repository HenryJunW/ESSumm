The meeting was taken up by discussion about a thesis proposal and a talk about to take place at EML.
The latter will present the work that is currently being done at ICSI including examples of inference of user intentions and of the recordings of the on-going data collection.
The talk will also outline the theoretical ( X-schemas , image schemas , Bayes-nets ) and neural background.
The thesis proposal , on the other hand , presents the idea of "construal" and makes claims as to how inferences are drawn in a probabilistic relational model by using information from the ontology , situation , user and discourse models.
It was advised that more emphasis should be put on the role of construal in the understanding of metaphor and metonymy.
Base constructions deal with the norm , while further general domain mechanisms determine how the constructions are invoked depending on the context.
Several potential examples of polysemy were discussed in detail: "walk/run into" , "on the bus" , "out of film" , "where is X?".
However , none of them was an example of lexical polysemy resolved by construal straightforward enough to include in the proposal; the tourist domain is not metaphor rich.
