A detailed diagram of the EVA belief-net was presented and some of the intermediate nodes and their properties were discussed in depth.
Some of the key features and properties are: "Go-there" , which is binary , and defined by the user , situation , ontology and discourse models; "timing" ( current/next tour ); "reason" ( business , sight-seeing , socialising ); "transport"; "length of tour"; "costs"; "entity" ( open , accessible ) etc.
The data collection that will provide relevant dialogues is moving along , with thirty subjects already lined up.
They will be given a reading task , which will include some german proper names , and a series of tasks from the tourist domain to choose from.
In order to get directions , they will then communicate with a computer system and a human operator , using a sketchy map as an aid.
A different set of data are already available from the SmartKom system and similar sources.
A preliminary study using this data has shown that a large number of syntactic and semantic constructions can be derived from a small sample.
