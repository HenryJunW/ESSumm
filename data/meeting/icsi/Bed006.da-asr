Bed006.G.dialogueact172	291.887	292.207	G	Grad	%-	-1	0	well he said 
Bed006.C.dialogueact173	296.33	304.0	C	Grad	s	+1	2	however there's always more people in and uh the fact uh uh that department and are just taking his class or anybody else success at the moment to much to reach out

Bed006.C.dialogueact352	707.56	720.35	C	Grad	s	+1	0	the question is just sort of how do we get the tasks and i had that they have an intention of doing something and have an need to ask the system for something without giving them sort of perky awarding of phrasing of the task because 
Bed006.E.dialogueact353	710.9	711.21	E	Grad	b	-1	0	i had that they have

Bed006.G.dialogueact364	737.962	740.502	G	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	yeah we we we were sort of get a protocol uh concerned so it's like uh enter versus view 
Bed006.C.dialogueact365	739.41	743.64	C	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	yeah we we we were sort of get a protocol of the primary into action right versus view

Bed006.C.dialogueact367	743.86	744.15	C	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	action right that's where the instructor

Bed006.C.dialogueact372	753.47	758.91	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	but first question for the subject is so they some things you know we thought the tourist can do is 
Bed006.C.dialogueact373	758.91	760.41	C	Grad	qy	-1	0	the tourist can do is uh anything that interests you

Bed006.C.dialogueact380	765.975	773.681	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	uh and then we can sort of this answer can say well uh then you you may want to find out what to get over here because this 
Bed006.G.dialogueact379	765.65	765.95	G	Grad	b	-1	0	uh and 
Bed006.C.dialogueact381	773.681	775.831	C	Grad	s	-1	0	over here because this is where the shopping the circus 
Bed006.G.dialogueact382	776.68	784.19	G	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	know sue the interaction primal giving hints about how specific or how whatever the the kind of question that there can to ask during actual session 
Bed006.C.dialogueact383	784.86	785.54	C	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	know and they're just sort of 
Bed006.C.dialogueact384	785.54	788.97	C	Grad	s:qw	-1	0	and they're just sort of okay what what what would you like to buy and 
Bed006.C.dialogueact385	788.97	793.341	C	Grad	s	-1	0	would you like to buy and then um okay there you want to buy uh whatever cookbooks talks okay and there there's 
Bed006.G.dialogueact386	789.361	789.671	G	Grad	b	-1	0	then um 
Bed006.C.dialogueact387	793.411	794.731	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	okay and there there's a store there so 
Bed006.E.dialogueact388	793.95	794.53	E	Grad	b	-1	0	okay and there there's a store there so 
Bed006.C.dialogueact389	795.041	797.691	C	Grad	s	-1	0	the task then for that person is spending all type to get there 
Bed006.C.dialogueact391	798.061	798.361	C	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right that's or what's

Bed006.C.dialogueact394	800.14	804.43	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and we know that the intention is to enter because we know that the person wants to buy coke so okay 
Bed006.G.dialogueact395	804.7	805.49	G	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	so okay that's what i mean to like those 
Bed006.G.dialogueact396	805.49	810.22	G	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	hopefully that's what i mean to like those tasks are all going to be um on in the u. s. about which of the three modes right okay so 
Bed006.C.dialogueact397	809.718	810.208	C	Grad	s^na	-1	0	hopefully modes right okay so 
Bed006.G.dialogueact398	810.35	810.88	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right okay so

Bed006.C.dialogueact661	1401.3	1406.71	C	Grad	s	+1	2	the idea is so imagine we have and i agree uh off scheme uh 
Bed006.C.dialogueact662	1407.21	1409.56	C	Grad	s	+1	1	such as the that goal 
Bed006.C.dialogueact663	1410.03	1413.27	C	Grad	s	+1	0	and then we have forced uh motion we have 
Bed006.C.dialogueact664	1413.74	1415.62	C	Grad	s	-1	0	we have cost action

Bed006.C.dialogueact670	1424.63	1429.78	C	Grad	s	+1	0	go and there's going to be a lot of stuff on the golden glove about that a can be and so forth 
Bed006.C.dialogueact671	1430.45	1432.3	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	what we think is

Bed006.C.dialogueact673	1435.89	1436.1	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	kind of about it so this is uh 
Bed006.C.dialogueact674	1436.43	1437.16	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	this is uh the fact 
Bed006.C.dialogueact675	1437.77	1443.93	C	Grad	s	-1	0	the fact that with cutting the sections chemo right now should not intended to be going to continue caught into sections can know

Bed006.C.dialogueact682	1459.91	1460.54	C	Grad	s^2	-1	0	so that's you know 
Bed006.E.dialogueact681	1459.54	1459.76	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	so that's

Bed006.C.dialogueact684	1462.12	1466.72	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and we'll have you know force motion and cost action actions 
Bed006.B.dialogueact685	1467.42	1472.4	B	Grad	s	+1	1	and then those actions can be in multiple categories at the same time if necessary so 
Bed006.C.dialogueact686	1472.77	1477.67	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so i push maybe and and both you know push uh in this and this force

Bed006.B.dialogueact706	1551.83	1552.88	B	Grad	s	-1	0	uh one question or when you 
Bed006.B.dialogueact707	1552.88	1556.34	B	Grad	qy	-1	0	one question or when you point at the screen is it your shadow that i'm supposed to look at okay yeah it's it's uh

Bed006.B.dialogueact715	1563.14	1568.66	B	Grad	s	+1	1	basically what that says is that there's an interface between what we are doing any action planner 
Bed006.E.dialogueact716	1563.91	1564.65	E	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	basically what that says is that there's 
Bed006.B.dialogueact717	1569.73	1579.25	B	Grad	s	+1	0	and right now the way the interfaces action go and then they have the what the person claimed the source of the person clinton's is the goal passed on and

Bed006.C.dialogueact721	1591.53	1601.37	C	Grad	s	-1	0	looks like now since it'll go action from it from an up tick name p. just fairy off the type church tune-up ticket part of tower of the type teller 
Bed006.C.dialogueact723	1603.05	1603.21	C	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	is uh uh what

Bed006.C.dialogueact828	1779.62	1781.03	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	with we know a lot about sources so we'll put on a that's okay 
Bed006.C.dialogueact829	1781.03	1782.54	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so we'll put on a that's a source but okay 
Bed006.G.dialogueact830	1781.4	1781.95	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	so we'll put on a that's okay 
Bed006.C.dialogueact831	1782.89	1788.35	C	Grad	s	-1	0	a source but it's independent whether reusing dseg scheme uh in an interview our approach motorized this is just 
Bed006.C.dialogueact833	1788.35	1788.54	C	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	motorized this is just 
Bed006.G.dialogueact832	1788.01	1788.4	G	Grad	b^rt	-1	0	motorized this is just 
Bed006.C.dialogueact834	1788.54	1791.64	C	Grad	s	-1	0	motorized this is just proper keys of the s. p. g. scheme uh 
Bed006.C.dialogueact835	1792.28	1797.52	C	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	we can talk about past being the fastest the quickest the nicest and so forth well 
Bed006.C.dialogueact836	1797.95	1801.11	C	Grad	s^cs^e	-1	0	so forth well in the trench actors would be it coming in there as well and then the 
Bed006.G.dialogueact837	1800.14	1800.7	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	coming in there as well 
Bed006.C.dialogueact838	1801.52	1803.03	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and then the same about goals okay so i guess the question 
Bed006.G.dialogueact839	1802.85	1803.21	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	same about goals okay so i guess the question 
Bed006.G.dialogueact840	1803.21	1808.2	G	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	so i guess the question is when you actually still ones out it'll be under action scheme uhuh those are 
Bed006.G.dialogueact841	1808.59	1809.2	G	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	those are 
Bed006.G.dialogueact842	1810.26	1812.8	G	Grad	s^bu.%-	-1	0	is going to be one of you'll take one of those four or 
Bed006.B.dialogueact843	1812.51	1812.83	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	four or 
Bed006.G.dialogueact844	1813.01	1816.76	G	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	right so the the the rest of the building do these this is just the layout of the possible things that could go play that role i got 
Bed006.B.dialogueact845	1815.32	1817.78	B	Grad	s^bk|s	+1	0	right so the the the rest of the building with the scheme uh and things that could go play that role i got uh 
Bed006.C.dialogueact846	1815.94	1816.25	C	Grad	qw^br	-1	0	right so the the the rest of the building things that could go play that role i got 
Bed006.G.dialogueact847	1816.76	1817.22	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	the rest of the building with the scheme uh and that role i got uh 
Bed006.G.dialogueact848	1817.29	1817.5	G	Grad	b	-1	0	with the scheme uh and uh 
Bed006.B.dialogueact849	1817.85	1825.32	B	Grad	s	+1	0	with the scheme uh and in what actual action is shows in is will be in that and the action came a section uh okay okay okay so one 
Bed006.G.dialogueact850	1819.66	1820.07	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	action is okay 
Bed006.G.dialogueact851	1821.44	1821.81	G	Grad	b	-1	0	okay 
Bed006.G.dialogueact852	1822.49	1822.97	G	Grad	fg	-1	0	shows in is 
Bed006.G.dialogueact853	1825.17	1826.7	G	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	okay so one question this is 
Bed006.G.dialogueact854	1826.7	1830.36	G	Grad	s	-1	0	question this is in this case it's all um clears her obvious but 
Bed006.G.dialogueact855	1830.66	1834.12	G	Grad	s	-1	0	but you can think of the interviewing approaches each having their roles right the i 
Bed006.G.dialogueact856	1834.23	1834.43	G	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right the i 
Bed006.G.dialogueact857	1834.43	1839.41	G	Grad	s	-1	0	right the i mean is is implicit that the person that's moving is doing entering viewing in approaching but 
Bed006.G.dialogueact858	1839.66	1842.92	G	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	but you know the usual thing is we a binding between so 
Bed006.G.dialogueact859	1843.11	1847.66	G	Grad	s	-1	0	the sort of like action specific girls and the more general source spot school this is the real story

Bed006.G.dialogueact876	1869.95	1872.43	G	Grad	s	-1	0	this action scheme there'll be a certain one that has his own structure and maybe 
Bed006.G.dialogueact877	1872.43	1876.82	G	Grad	s	+1	0	and maybe it has stuff about that specific to entering or viewing or approaching 
Bed006.G.dialogueact878	1877.17	1882.7	G	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	but those could include roles like the thing that you're viewing of thing that you're entering the thing that you're betraying 
Bed006.E.dialogueact881	1883.21	1886.33	E	Grad	s^bs	-1	0	a very specific romances view thing and heard thing this thing that we start think that think of interviewing approaches 
Bed006.G.dialogueact879	1882.9	1883.12	G	Grad	s	-1	0	a very specific that you're betraying this thing 
Bed006.G.dialogueact880	1883.12	1884.65	G	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	a very specific romances view this thing that we start 
Bed006.G.dialogueact882	1885.35	1887.72	G	Grad	s	-1	0	thing and heard thing think that think of interviewing approaches frames and they have 
Bed006.C.dialogueact885	1887.95	1888.21	C	Grad	b	-1	0	frames and they have frame specific parameters 
Bed006.E.dialogueact884	1887.82	1888.03	E	Grad	b	-1	0	frames and they have frame specific parameters 
Bed006.G.dialogueact883	1887.72	1890.06	G	Grad	s	-1	0	frames and they have frame specific parameters and and roles 
Bed006.C.dialogueact886	1889.01	1889.25	C	Grad	b	-1	0	and and roles 
Bed006.G.dialogueact887	1891.27	1894.85	G	Grad	s	+1	0	and you can also describe them in a general way outsource medical him and maybe 
Bed006.G.dialogueact888	1894.85	1901.29	G	Grad	qh	-1	0	outsource medical him and maybe there's other image came knows that you could you know add after this that you know how do they work in terms of you know a forced dynamics are they working for 
Bed006.C.dialogueact889	1896.65	1896.93	C	Grad	b	-1	0	that you could you know add 
Bed006.C.dialogueact891	1901.67	1902.6	C	Grad	b	-1	0	are they working for and other things it's all 
Bed006.G.dialogueact890	1901.29	1902.63	G	Grad	qh	-1	0	are they working for and other things it's all 
Bed006.G.dialogueact892	1902.86	1911.44	G	Grad	s	+1	0	and other things it's all of those have um they see these either specific france is a real sore more general franks with the roles that might have finding so 
Bed006.G.dialogueact893	1911.44	1916.74	G	Grad	qr	-1	0	finding so the question is are um how do we represent when things are linked in a certain way so 
Bed006.G.dialogueact894	1916.94	1919.81	G	Grad	s	-1	0	in a certain way so we you know for enter that there's container potentially involved and 
Bed006.C.dialogueact895	1919.63	1919.98	C	Grad	b	-1	0	involved and 
Bed006.G.dialogueact896	1919.81	1921.28	G	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	involved and it's not uh 
Bed006.G.dialogueact897	1921.97	1926.06	G	Grad	s	-1	0	uh i i don't know if you want to have in the same level as the action scheme that speech you can it's it somewhere in there 
Bed006.G.dialogueact898	1926.06	1928.93	G	Grad	s	+1	0	it's it somewhere in there that you need to represent that there's some kind of center and 
Bed006.G.dialogueact899	1928.93	1936.87	G	Grad	s	+1	0	some kind of center and the interior of it corresponds to some part of the source that's cool um you know go uh goal i guess in this case 
Bed006.C.dialogueact900	1936.75	1937.12	C	Grad	b	-1	0	i guess in this case too 
Bed006.G.dialogueact901	1937.21	1944.25	G	Grad	fh|qy	-1	0	too uh is there an easy way in dissertation to show when there's identity basically between things and i 
Bed006.C.dialogueact902	1943.46	1943.65	C	Grad	b	-1	0	between things 
Bed006.G.dialogueact903	1944.25	1946.41	G	Grad	s	-1	0	and i don't know that something we need to invent or you know just 
Bed006.G.dialogueact904	1946.41	1947.17	G	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	would wasn't there's invent or you know just 
Bed006.B.dialogueact905	1946.91	1946.98	B	Grad	%--	-1	0	invent or you know just 
Bed006.B.dialogueact906	1946.98	1950.02	B	Grad	qw^bu.%--	-1	0	would wasn't there's supposed to be a link in me i invent or you know just 
Bed006.F.dialogueact907	1947.81	1948.26	F	Grad	b	-1	0	would wasn't there's supposed to be a link 
Bed006.B.dialogueact908	1951.04	1952.14	B	Grad	s^bd	-1	0	don't know that's has question i was just doing it this 
Bed006.B.dialogueact909	1952.14	1953.74	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	i was just doing it this way we're talking sorry 
Bed006.B.dialogueact910	1953.74	1954.18	B	Grad	s^fa	-1	0	way we're talking sorry 
Bed006.G.dialogueact911	1955.09	1955.39	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	uh 
Bed006.B.dialogueact912	1955.62	1965.66	B	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	uh a link between the action team that appealed in these and they came up or the image came is that would link is which actions came we were supposed to use it we could 
Bed006.B.dialogueact913	1965.66	1966.17	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	were supposed to use it we could 
Bed006.C.dialogueact914	1965.79	1966.07	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	were supposed to use it we could 
Bed006.C.dialogueact915	1967.15	1971.79	C	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um but that's that's one one thing is that we can link up 
Bed006.C.dialogueact916	1972.53	1982.96	C	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	think also that um we can have one down as many as you want things from from this came up to these action um description of it 
Bed006.G.dialogueact917	1981.53	1981.79	G	Grad	b	-1	0	um 
Bed006.C.dialogueact918	1983.45	2003.15	C	Grad	s	-1	0	but the notion i got from nancy's idea was that we may find sort of concepts sewing rollins and and the action description of the actions enter frame up there that i when you talk about the real but actually i tend to close with the goal and i'll be it was something called scheme at and do 
Bed006.G.dialogueact919	2001.1	2001.66	G	Grad	b	-1	0	it was 
Bed006.G.dialogueact920	2002.27	2003.3	G	Grad	b	-1	0	something called scheme at and do 
Bed006.C.dialogueact921	2003.62	2006.6	C	Grad	s	-1	0	at and do we have means of stuff telling it within that yeah 
Bed006.C.dialogueact923	2007.01	2008.61	C	Grad	s	+1	0	and that's there's absolutely 
Bed006.G.dialogueact922	2006.96	2007.24	G	Grad	b	-1	0	within that yeah and that's there's absolutely 
Bed006.C.dialogueact925	2009.27	2013.96	C	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	do we we absolutely have those means or even part of the m. c. i opie okay uhhuh 
Bed006.G.dialogueact924	2008.79	2008.95	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed006.G.dialogueact926	2013.44	2013.79	G	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	opie okay uhhuh 
Bed006.G.dialogueact927	2013.79	2014.23	G	Grad	b	-1	0	opie meaning we okay uhhuh 
Bed006.C.dialogueact928	2014.57	2016.18	C	Grad	s	+1	1	meaning we can reference for me great that's 
Bed006.C.dialogueact929	2016.33	2016.89	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	for me great that's 
Bed006.G.dialogueact930	2016.34	2016.58	G	Grad	fg	-1	0	for me great that's 
Bed006.G.dialogueact931	2016.79	2019.05	G	Grad	s	-1	0	for me and um this referencing thing great that's exactly what 
Bed006.B.dialogueact932	2018.44	2018.8	B	Grad	b	-1	0	and um 
Bed006.B.dialogueact934	2018.8	2019.58	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	and um this referencing thing 
Bed006.C.dialogueact933	2018.45	2018.93	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bed006.C.dialogueact935	2019.21	2022.68	C	Grad	s	-1	0	this referencing thing however is of temporary nature because 
Bed006.C.dialogueact936	2022.68	2032.86	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	nature because sooner or later the w. three c. would be finished with their dicks path specification and then 
Bed006.C.dialogueact937	2032.86	2034.56	C	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	specification and then it's going to be even much nicer than we have 
Bed006.C.dialogueact938	2034.56	2041.13	C	Grad	s	-1	0	nicer than we have really means of pointing at and be you the sensation of one of our elements here and link it to 
Bed006.G.dialogueact939	2037.93	2038.38	G	Grad	b	-1	0	at and be you the sensation 
Bed006.C.dialogueact941	2041.5	2047.29	C	Grad	s	+1	1	and link it to another one and this not only within a document but also yeah documents okay 
Bed006.G.dialogueact940	2041.03	2041.37	G	Grad	b	-1	0	and link it to 
Bed006.E.dialogueact942	2047.29	2047.86	E	Grad	b	-1	0	okay 
Bed006.G.dialogueact943	2047.54	2047.89	G	Grad	b	-1	0	okay 
Bed006.C.dialogueact944	2048.3	2051.74	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and and all and of our very easy would you similar you know i happen 
Bed006.G.dialogueact945	2051.44	2055.21	G	Grad	qy	-1	0	you similar you know i happen to know how what what sooner or later means they practice 
Bed006.C.dialogueact946	2056.47	2056.71	C	Grad	s.%	-1	0	that's one 
Bed006.C.dialogueact948	2057.21	2058.02	C	Grad	s	-1	0	but as soon so it's 
Bed006.G.dialogueact947	2056.75	2057.54	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	that's one but as soon 
Bed006.G.dialogueact949	2057.54	2058.66	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	but as soon so it's 
Bed006.C.dialogueact950	2058.62	2060.57	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so it's it's this back it's there and it's going to 
Bed006.C.dialogueact951	2060.57	2064.3	C	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	it's there and it's going to be part of the and see other i p. a. p. i. by by the end of this year so this 
Bed006.C.dialogueact952	2064.71	2067.37	C	Grad	s	-1	0	year so this means we can start using it basic you know 
Bed006.C.dialogueact954	2068.57	2070.25	C	Grad	s	-1	0	but this is a texaco detailer so pointer way to 
Bed006.G.dialogueact953	2068.38	2068.72	G	Grad	b	-1	0	but this is a 
Bed006.G.dialogueact955	2069.68	2072.36	G	Grad	s	-1	0	really references from the roles texaco detailer so pointer way to really say pointers 
Bed006.B.dialogueact956	2071.18	2077.75	B	Grad	s	-1	0	really references from the roles in the scheme uh the bottom seems to the actual game is so uh i'm assuming really say pointers okay yeah 
Bed006.G.dialogueact957	2073.72	2074.06	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	in the scheme uh the bottom seems to the 
Bed006.G.dialogueact958	2076.29	2077.08	G	Grad	b	-1	0	so uh i'm assuming okay yeah 
Bed006.C.dialogueact959	2076.89	2077.16	C	Grad	b	-1	0	so uh i'm assuming okay yeah 
Bed006.C.dialogueact960	2078.18	2078.37	C	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah i mean personally 
Bed006.C.dialogueact962	2078.75	2093.7	C	Grad	s	+1	0	yeah i mean personally i'm looking even more forward to the day when we going to have x. forms which is is a form of notation lady that was you just say it u. c. s. p. g. action up there he's enter then the goalie type can never be a statue 
Bed006.G.dialogueact961	2078.65	2078.99	G	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah i mean personally 
Bed006.G.dialogueact963	2090.68	2091.16	G	Grad	b^rt	-1	0	then the goalie type 
Bed006.G.dialogueact964	2094.14	2094.38	G	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed006.E.dialogueact965	2094.71	2095.11	E	Grad	b	-1	0	so you have 
Bed006.G.dialogueact966	2095.46	2102.65	G	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	um you know this person's so you have constraints that are dependent on the actual a filler semester entry uhhuh 
Bed006.C.dialogueact967	2097.07	2097.93	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	on the

Bed006.C.dialogueact970	2101.43	2105.14	C	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um you know this person's not make sense in light of the central never t. how ever semester entry uhhuh 
Bed006.G.dialogueact971	2102.65	2102.85	G	Grad	b	-1	0	you know this person's semester entry uhhuh 
Bed006.C.dialogueact973	2105.91	2110.99	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	how ever it is uh you know some of these sort of things are imaginable 
Bed006.E.dialogueact972	2105.59	2105.98	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	how ever 
Bed006.G.dialogueact974	2109.54	2109.67	G	Grad	%	-1	0	of these sort of things 
Bed006.G.dialogueact975	2110.8	2111.22	G	Grad	b	-1	0	are imaginable where 
Bed006.C.dialogueact977	2112.0	2112.27	C	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	the gateway the argentina 
Bed006.F.dialogueact978	2112.1	2117.54	F	Grad	fg|qy	+1	0	so um like i did have some their scheme eyes for f. m. like porch motion the gateway the argentina 
Bed006.G.dialogueact976	2111.97	2113.05	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	so where the gateway the argentina 
Bed006.C.dialogueact980	2113.53	2113.79	C	Grad	b	-1	0	so 
Bed006.G.dialogueact979	2113.05	2113.32	G	Grad	s	-1	0	so 
Bed006.G.dialogueact981	2114.11	2114.25	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	um like 
Bed006.F.dialogueact982	2117.54	2119.43	F	Grad	s^e	+1	0	f. m. like porch motion and caused action stuff like that for s. 
Bed006.F.dialogueact983	2119.43	2120.48	F	Grad	s^e	+1	0	stuff like that for s. p. g. and 
Bed006.C.dialogueact984	2120.87	2121.04	C	Grad	s^aa	+1	0	p. g. and so like in 
Bed006.F.dialogueact985	2121.02	2126.89	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so like in are you able to enforce that you know if if it's if it's s. p. g. action then you have that scheme out if 
Bed006.F.dialogueact986	2126.89	2130.23	F	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	um we have absolutely no you have that scheme out if it's a forced washington you have get a scheme uh present and uh 
Bed006.C.dialogueact987	2129.44	2130.86	C	Grad	fh|s.%--	-1	0	um we have absolutely no present and uh 
Bed006.C.dialogueact988	2130.86	2131.19	C	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	have absolutely no have absolutely no uh 
Bed006.C.dialogueact989	2131.25	2133.31	C	Grad	s	-1	0	have absolutely no means of enforcing that 
Bed006.C.dialogueact990	2134.18	2142.22	C	Grad	s	+1	0	so it's would be considered about it if we have an s. p. g. action and true no it's p. g. scheme uh but a force action scheme 
Bed006.C.dialogueact991	2143.41	2143.87	C	Grad	s^am	-1	0	could happen which 
Bed006.G.dialogueact992	2143.51	2145.76	G	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	could happen which which is not bad because 
Bed006.G.dialogueact993	2145.76	2147.53	G	Grad	s^df.%--	-1	0	bad because i mean there's multiple multiples i mean that particular 
Bed006.G.dialogueact994	2147.53	2153.5	G	Grad	s^df	-1	0	uhhuh but maybe means read nothing to i mean that particular cases mall there there's a force side of of that verb as well 
Bed006.C.dialogueact995	2152.43	2152.62	C	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh but maybe that verb 
Bed006.C.dialogueact996	2152.85	2155.38	C	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	uhhuh but maybe means read nothing to say about the stuff that's cool what's that verb as well 
Bed006.F.dialogueact997	2154.71	2155.06	F	Grad	b.%	-1	0	say about the stuff that's cool what's 
Bed006.C.dialogueact998	2155.95	2159.86	C	Grad	s	-1	0	cool what's is also nice and i i for me in my mind it's 
Bed006.C.dialogueact999	2159.86	2167.04	C	Grad	s	+1	2	in my mind it's it's crucial really necessary is that we can have much of a scheme us in my action scheme us in parallel and 
Bed006.F.dialogueact1000	2167.29	2167.59	F	Grad	b.%	-1	0	and 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1001	2167.94	2171.76	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and then we started thinking about going through all bakery questions so when

Bed006.G.dialogueact1037	2227.77	2229.29	G	Grad	qy.%--	-1	0	thing to buy interesting would you say that the the like i mean 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1038	2229.77	2232.78	G	Grad	s	+1	0	like i mean could have plot structure and just are two independent things 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1039	2233.11	2234.72	G	Grad	s	+1	0	but there's also the sort of like causal also 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1040	2234.72	2240.05	G	Grad	s	+1	0	no of like causal also one is really facilitate any other and it's part of a compound action of some kind of structure 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1041	2239.34	2239.54	C	Grad	b	-1	0	of structure 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1042	2240.82	2245.94	C	Grad	s	-1	0	no it's technically possible that you can fit scheme not written scheme uh 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1044	2246.88	2247.95	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	and scheme wouldn't commit i think that's nicer 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1043	2246.8	2249.24	G	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	and scheme wouldn't commit i think that's nicer for a lot of reasons but might be a pain 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1045	2249.24	2250.2	G	Grad	s^bd	-1	0	but might be a pain so 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1046	2250.2	2250.88	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	so 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1047	2251.35	2251.89	C	Grad	h	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed006.C.dialogueact1048	2254.02	2256.06	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	for me it seems that uh 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1050	2257.67	2261.9	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	i mean they're truly times when you have two totally independent goals that they might express it once but in this case 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1049	2257.65	2261.16	G	Grad	s	-1	0	i mean they're truly times when you have two totally independent goals that they might express it once but in this case 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1051	2261.52	2266.88	G	Grad	s	-1	0	but in this case it's really like there's a purpose means that you know for achieving some other purpose 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1052	2267.19	2270.05	C	Grad	s	-1	0	well if i'm if i'm the recipient of such a message and i guess it's 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1053	2270.24	2272.82	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and i guess it's kind of cool weather going is a bakery and then 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1054	2272.82	2275.68	C	Grad	s	-1	0	is a bakery and then i get a commotion action which takes place in a bakery

Bed006.C.dialogueact1057	2277.28	2282.5	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and and and they they're obviously be identifies identified to be the same thing 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1056	2276.89	2277.2	G	Grad	b^rt	-1	0	and and and they 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1058	2283.33	2283.83	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah see 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1059	2284.03	2286.59	G	Grad	s	-1	0	that that bothers me that they're the same thing 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1060	2287.29	2288.24	C	Grad	s^ar|%--	-1	0	no no just the yeah 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1061	2288.24	2288.76	C	Grad	qy^bh	-1	0	the yeah 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1062	2289.23	2289.63	G	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah because 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1063	2289.76	2290.91	G	Grad	s^df	-1	0	yeah because they're two different things one 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1064	2290.91	2291.99	G	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	they're two different things one of which is you 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1065	2291.99	2295.59	G	Grad	s	-1	0	of which is you could think of one as a sub you know prove wannabe condition for the second 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1066	2295.81	2296.17	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	the second right yeah yeah so 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1067	2296.25	2296.46	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right yeah yeah so 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1068	2296.46	2296.9	G	Grad	b	-1	0	right yeah yeah so 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1069	2296.9	2297.68	G	Grad	fg	-1	0	right yeah yeah so so okay so there's 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1070	2297.84	2299.21	G	Grad	s	+1	0	so okay so there's like level little guy the other day so uh there's 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1071	2299.21	2304.63	G	Grad	s	-1	0	day so uh there's there's um a single event of which they are both apart and 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1072	2304.99	2310.2	G	Grad	s	-1	0	apart and then they're independently they they're events which have very different characters as far as source that's what's to when you identify 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1073	2309.24	2310.64	C	Grad	b	-1	0	as far as source that's what's to when you identify 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1074	2310.2	2314.75	G	Grad	s	-1	0	to when you identify source school and whatever there's going to be a desire or whatever eating hunger whatever 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1075	2314.75	2319.04	G	Grad	s	-1	0	eating hunger whatever other friends you have involved they have to match up and in nice ways too it 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1076	2319.47	2325.64	G	Grad	s	-1	0	too it seems like each of them has its own internal structure and mapping to these scheme is 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1077	2322.92	2323.19	C	Grad	b	-1	0	own internal structure and mapping 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1078	2326.09	2326.67	G	Grad	s^e.%--	-1	0	you know for of it but you know 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1079	2326.67	2329.26	G	Grad	s^bd	-1	0	you know for of it but you know that's just that's just me 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1081	2329.89	2334.88	C	Grad	s	+1	1	i think we got to hit a lot of interesting problems and me in it 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1080	2329.46	2330.74	G	Grad	%--	-1	0	me in 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1082	2334.93	2341.59	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and uh as i preface that this is the result of one week of argue about it 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1083	2339.96	2340.32	G	Grad	b	-1	0	of argue 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1084	2342.21	2343.08	G	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	and featuring you guys

Bed006.C.dialogueact1088	2343.84	2346.35	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um and so yeah i mean i i still i'm not entirely 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1087	2343.74	2343.93	G	Grad	b	-1	0	and 
Bed006.E.dialogueact1089	2345.89	2351.03	E	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	well it's not it's and so i'm yeah i mean i i still i'm not entirely sure that i really fully grasped the syntax of this you know one 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1091	2351.35	2354.34	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	well it's not it's not actually very actually it doesn't actually i'm it it could it occurs to me that i mean it you know one right worthy intended

Bed006.C.dialogueact1096	2356.77	2360.11	C	Grad	fg|s	+1	0	um well i should have we should have added and and not annex another example with some excellent of this uh 
Bed006.E.dialogueact1095	2356.56	2356.62	E	Grad	b	-1	0	um of this uh 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1097	2360.43	2361.61	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	with some excellent example yeah that would 
Bed006.E.dialogueact1098	2360.9	2361.43	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	with some excellent example yeah that would 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1099	2361.37	2363.29	G	Grad	s^aa|s^ba^na	-1	0	example and and this is on on on yeah that would be that would be nice 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1100	2362.4	2366.85	C	Grad	s	+1	1	and and this is on on on on on my list of things that's the next next week be that would be nice

Bed006.C.dialogueact1102	2367.22	2373.84	C	Grad	s	+1	1	is also a question of the workers this and this and and i i hire hierarchy and they do we 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1103	2370.44	2370.89	G	Grad	b	-1	0	and and i i hire 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1104	2371.65	2372.02	G	Grad	b	-1	0	hierarchy 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1105	2373.84	2377.7	C	Grad	qh^rt	-1	0	and they do we want this scheme that's just dum bum bum bum 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1106	2378.08	2386.78	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i mean it's if we can actually you know get it so that we can i don't want hot trends activate more than one scheme i i've remember already pretty good right 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1107	2385.14	2385.54	G	Grad	b	-1	0	i've remember already

Bed006.A.dialogueact1109	2388.54	2391.12	A	PhD	s	+1	0	what would it have to be careful but with uh thing because um 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1110	2391.12	2399.06	A	PhD	s	+1	0	because um i mean many actions i suppose some of the almost in so many other options if you go to bed early 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1111	2399.06	2403.84	A	PhD	s	-1	0	if you go to bed early you have a general intention off uh not being hungry maybe

Bed006.B.dialogueact1139	2453.86	2454.14	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	that like yeah or maybe i'm like the i mean like 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1141	2454.14	2454.33	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah the i mean like 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1140	2454.09	2454.85	G	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	yeah the i mean like 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1142	2455.16	2459.92	G	Grad	s^df	-1	0	but it's still the case that um you could you could override that default by giving extra permission which 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1143	2458.35	2458.91	C	Grad	b	-1	0	default by giving 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1144	2459.92	2465.87	G	Grad	s:s	-1	0	extra permission which is to me a reason why you would keep the inference of that separate from the knowledge of okay they really want to know if there's a big around here 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1145	2466.24	2466.46	C	Grad	b	-1	0	which is direct 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1146	2466.41	2467.07	G	Grad	s	-1	0	well they're they're there which is direct 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1147	2467.24	2476.55	C	Grad	s	-1	0	well they're they're there should never be a hard coded uh fucked up from the bakery question the the double scheme uh thing how uh 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1148	2475.72	2476.03	G	Grad	b	-1	0	uh thing how uh 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1149	2476.55	2477.33	C	Grad	%--	-1	0	thing how uh and as a matter of fact 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1150	2477.33	2482.52	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and as a matter of fact when i travelled with my friends we make these expected these kinds of appointments we yeah exactly

Bed006.A.dialogueact1163	2489.56	2492.27	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	i have a question about the slope of the s. p. g. action so damned 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1161	2489.31	2489.39	G	Grad	b	-1	0	i have a question 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1162	2489.45	2489.88	G	Grad	%--	-1	0	i have a question 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1164	2492.27	2498.84	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so damned interview approach they did and uh up but so it's in these particular action as the 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1165	2498.84	2501.57	A	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	particular action as the actual this guy and we have a choice over

Bed006.A.dialogueact1170	2509.1	2510.1	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	right so so i mean from right

Bed006.A.dialogueact1174	2510.25	2524.38	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so so i mean so please particular action that you may want to characterize you would have some the middle sloughs that define uh you know in some way what distractions what about you can be i've 
Bed006.E.dialogueact1173	2510.13	2510.3	E	Grad	b	-1	0	so so i mean 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1175	2524.52	2525.96	A	PhD	s	-1	0	you can be i've got a b. o. c. 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1176	2526.34	2532.05	A	PhD	qr^rt	-1	0	um so it is i'm so old judy was open could be between one and sixteen um

Bed006.A.dialogueact1178	2533.18	2534.19	A	PhD	s	-1	0	if if that's about it um 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1179	2534.64	2536.36	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	it um he uh 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1180	2537.12	2542.92	C	Grad	s	-1	0	well it sort of depends on on if you actually write down the the you then 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1181	2542.92	2546.02	C	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	the the you then you have to say it's either one of them like can 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1182	2546.86	2547.55	C	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	like can mean none 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1183	2548.51	2550.03	C	Grad	s	-1	0	like i mean any of them 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1184	2551.09	2557.92	C	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	however be uh it seems to be sensible to me you to view the mass mutually exclusive 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1185	2560.07	2560.71	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed006.C.dialogueact1186	2562.38	2563.26	C	Grad	s^am	-1	0	maybe even not gee do you mean within the 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1187	2562.57	2565.29	G	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	yeah maybe even not gee do you mean within the source that school actions this three 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1188	2563.91	2567.93	A	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah but he i i i i understand i not do you mean within the source that school actions this three 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1189	2565.31	2565.56	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah this three 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1190	2565.57	2565.97	G	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	yeah this three 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1191	2567.93	2568.07	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	i i understand i but and um how 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1192	2568.07	2568.3	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	but and um how 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1193	2568.24	2570.2	C	Grad	qh	-1	0	but no no and um how how racy and so that's 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1194	2570.2	2570.82	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	no no so that's 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1195	2570.7	2571.12	A	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	no no the i actually so that's 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1196	2571.12	2573.7	A	PhD	s	-1	0	the i actually my i think as you think about it um 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1197	2573.7	2574.67	A	PhD	fh|qy.%-	-1	0	about it um is okay here's 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1198	2574.67	2576.05	A	PhD	s	-1	0	is okay here's an s. p. g. action and and it has to 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1199	2576.05	2579.64	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and and it has to different um uh i aspects um 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1200	2579.74	2580.38	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	i aspects um because you got 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1201	2580.38	2584.43	A	PhD	s	-1	0	because you got to a beagle fuel ito approach it touch it 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1202	2585.2	2588.32	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	uh no you define i ionizer action going four section 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1204	2588.32	2595.0	A	PhD	s	-1	0	going uh uh and did you g. and that has to do with right it so it's i mean but even within four section of course motion 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1203	2588.29	2590.18	C	Grad	s	-1	0	going uh uh four section of course motion 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1205	2591.09	2591.28	C	Grad	b	-1	0	and did you g. and 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1206	2595.0	2598.36	A	PhD	s	-1	0	mean but even within this context but it different auction 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1207	2599.37	2607.68	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	and it's all action too would have that is variable possibilities of intel between what you would like to do 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1208	2608.81	2617.27	A	PhD	s	-1	0	in in a way similar up to i the interview approaching they want to send a little bit a little dictate uh let's see a dog that 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1210	2617.89	2618.71	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	see a dog that they good 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1209	2617.6	2618.16	B	Grad	fg	-1	0	see a dog that they good 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1211	2618.16	2618.92	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	they good 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1212	2619.64	2620.4	B	Grad	%--	-1	0	he uh it 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1213	2622.16	2622.92	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	these actions i 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1214	2622.92	2624.84	B	Grad	s^bd^no	-1	0	these actions i don't know if i'm an answer a question out of this but 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1215	2624.91	2627.69	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	a question out of this but the categories inside of action humans s. p. 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1216	2627.69	2629.37	B	Grad	s	-1	0	action humans s. p. g. action as a category all 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1217	2629.75	2629.87	B	Grad	%--	-1	0	all 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1218	2629.87	2637.13	B	Grad	s	-1	0	all the i think what we're supposed to thing here is the category of the actions and or even approached too because they have a 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1219	2637.13	2641.3	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because they have a related first ethical scheme in our course domain 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1220	2642.32	2649.37	B	Grad	s^df.%-	-1	0	oh so so it's sort of because being in at first i mean is going up to it and or actually going from one place to another to take a picture in this 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1221	2648.02	2648.26	A	PhD	b	-1	0	oh so this 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1222	2648.86	2653.38	A	PhD	s^bk|s^bu	-1	0	oh so so it's sort of somebody derived football much of it that is being pencil this 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1223	2654.93	2655.39	B	Grad	s^br^m.%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed006.B.dialogueact1224	2656.34	2657.6	B	Grad	s^no.%-	-1	0	i don't know that this is a cat and this is 
Bed006.E.dialogueact1225	2656.92	2659.25	E	Grad	s	-1	0	i don't know that this is a cat and this is a category structure here right action scheme 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1228	2659.62	2660.02	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	here right action scheme uh what are some 
Bed006.E.dialogueact1226	2659.25	2659.48	E	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	here right action scheme 
Bed006.E.dialogueact1227	2659.48	2660.3	E	Grad	s	-1	0	here right action scheme uh what are some 
Bed006.E.dialogueact1229	2660.57	2662.15	E	Grad	qh	+1	0	uh what are some types of action scheme as well one of the types of actions 
Bed006.E.dialogueact1230	2662.15	2664.98	E	Grad	s	+1	1	well one of the types of actions came as a source that school action 
Bed006.E.dialogueact1231	2665.46	2666.72	E	Grad	qw	+1	0	and what are some types of that and 
Bed006.E.dialogueact1232	2666.72	2668.95	E	Grad	s	+1	0	right types of that and and her uh viewing approach those 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1233	2667.85	2668.1	B	Grad	b	-1	0	right and her uh viewing approach those 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1234	2668.23	2668.66	C	Grad	b	-1	0	uh viewing approach those 
Bed006.E.dialogueact1235	2668.95	2670.48	E	Grad	s	-1	0	inside and enter there would uh viewing approach those are all sorts of school and 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1236	2670.14	2673.9	B	Grad	s	+1	1	inside and enter there would be roles they can be killed basically so and 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1237	2673.9	2681.85	B	Grad	s	+1	0	basically so if i had one to go from outside inside then you have the all the need needle we have is worth that goal set of roles 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1238	2682.4	2685.15	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so you start to be outside in pass at the door whatever right 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1239	2685.15	2685.41	B	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right 
Bed006.A.dialogueact1240	2685.84	2686.09	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1241	2687.44	2690.94	B	Grad	s	+1	2	so if you wanted to have a new type action you could anytime category 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1242	2691.64	2693.46	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	then this category but we put it or it may not 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1243	2693.46	2694.56	B	Grad	s^bd	-1	0	put it or it may not necessarily we put 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1244	2694.56	2699.66	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	necessarily we put i knew action name uh in the categories that and which it has be um 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1245	2699.66	2700.86	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	it has be um 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1246	2701.24	2703.2	B	Grad	s	-1	0	wet reactions that are related scheme is like a source

Bed006.E.dialogueact1252	2714.24	2717.08	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	even as a exactly he was uh that there could be a communication event action or something like that and you can rent 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1254	2716.43	2717.1	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	exactly he was uh that or something like that and you can rent 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1253	2716.36	2716.61	C	Grad	b	-1	0	exactly or something like that 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1256	2717.1	2719.05	B	Grad	s	-1	0	he was uh that uh that type and you can rent 
Bed006.E.dialogueact1255	2717.08	2718.06	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	he was uh that uh that type and you can rent 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1257	2720.04	2725.33	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and then later you know the the we have a communication of action where we define it down there is 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1258	2724.77	2725.11	G	Grad	b.%	-1	0	define it down there is 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1259	2727.41	2728.62	G	Grad	s^bu	+1	0	so there's a bit of redundancy right in 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1260	2728.62	2728.88	G	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	redundancy right in 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1261	2728.88	2733.21	G	Grad	s	-1	0	redundancy right in in which the things that go into a particular you have categories of the top under active scheme uh and the things that 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1262	2733.55	2741.6	G	Grad	s	-1	0	uh and the things that go into a category are um it's suppose to have a corresponding scheme a definition for that time so 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1263	2741.6	2744.62	G	Grad	qw	-1	0	time so i guess what's the function of having it up there too i mean 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1264	2744.94	2746.87	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	it up there too i mean i i guess i'm wondering whether you could just have outer 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1265	2746.87	2751.96	G	Grad	s	-1	0	you could just have outer actions gimme they're just sort of say whatever you know going to be interviewer approach or whatever number of things and 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1266	2751.79	2752.05	C	Grad	b	-1	0	or whatever number of things and pasa partly 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1267	2751.96	2756.67	G	Grad	s^df	-1	0	or whatever number of things and pasa partly because you need you know somewhere that those things fall into some categories and a maybe 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1268	2756.67	2759.99	G	Grad	s	-1	0	categories and a maybe multiple carry jersey you say which is the like a fool messy 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1269	2758.8	2758.97	C	Grad	b	-1	0	you say which is the 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1270	2760.34	2769.45	G	Grad	s	-1	0	right those one the things um but if it has if it's supposed to be categorized in category x. men the course scheme max will be among the structures that that follows it's like 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1271	2768.65	2769.06	B	Grad	b	-1	0	right those one the things the structures that that follows it's like 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1273	2769.34	2770.62	B	Grad	s	-1	0	those one the things you're the follows it's like okay

Bed006.C.dialogueact1278	2772.29	2778.1	C	Grad	s	-1	0	this is more this is probably the way that that that's the way the two more to it just to draw no i guess also for i didn't mean to

Bed006.C.dialogueact1283	2781.37	2784.68	C	Grad	s^ar|s^nd	-1	0	no because no no no uh we have not whereabouts either died seen the light soon

Bed006.B.dialogueact1287	2784.9	2793.12	B	Grad	s	-1	0	because doing it this way is in case there's extra structured it's any enter action that's not captured by these game is right either died do they go back and forth and i agree right right which is why i would think 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1286	2784.56	2786.01	G	Grad	s	-1	0	because doing it this way either died do they go back and forth and 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1288	2786.01	2786.4	G	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	doing it this way and 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1289	2787.19	2787.51	G	Grad	b	-1	0	is in case there's extra

Bed006.G.dialogueact1292	2792.29	2792.91	G	Grad	fg	-1	0	these game is right 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1293	2793.12	2793.42	B	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right which is why i would think 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1294	2793.12	2795.33	G	Grad	s	+1	0	right which is why i would think you would say enter and just say all the 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1295	2795.33	2797.77	G	Grad	s	+1	0	and just say all the things irrelevant specifically enter and 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1296	2797.97	2801.35	G	Grad	s	+1	0	enter and then the things that are abstract will be in the africans as well and that's why the findings 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1297	2801.35	2803.19	G	Grad	s	+1	0	right but as well and that's why the findings become useful 
Bed006.B.dialogueact1298	2803.34	2804.14	B	Grad	fg|%-	-1	0	right but right you like 
Bed006.E.dialogueact1299	2804.56	2807.3	E	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	right you like so you're saying you can practically turned the structure inside out or something or um

Bed006.G.dialogueact1325	2845.44	2848.54	G	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	sounds like a paper i've read roles which will probably be richer and fuller and have other stuff in there

Bed006.E.dialogueact1359	2910.94	2913.78	E	Grad	s	-1	0	one of to do and enter and then you're more interested in knowing what the parent categories are that 
Bed006.E.dialogueact1360	2914.41	2914.67	E	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right so that 
Bed006.E.dialogueact1361	2914.67	2921.24	E	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	i think i'd i'm not sure right so that the um the uh sort of representation you were just talking about seems more relevant i kind of think you have to do

Bed006.G.dialogueact1666	3453.75	3454.86	G	Grad	s	-1	0	always think about binding 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1667	3455.88	3458.12	C	Grad	s	-1	0	well the the the binding is technically no problem but it's it 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1668	3458.12	3470.57	C	Grad	s	+1	0	but it's it for me it seems to be conception be important that we find out if we can just if if if they're things in there that are so forth of a general nature we should just 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1669	3470.57	3471.79	C	Grad	s^cs	+1	0	nature we should just tell them out and put 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1671	3471.79	3473.21	C	Grad	s^cs^e	+1	0	tell them out and put them where the scheme i saw there's things 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1670	3471.75	3472.27	G	Grad	b	-1	0	tell them out and put them where the scheme i saw 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1672	3473.61	3480.31	C	Grad	s^cs^rt	-1	0	there's things that you know our intention specific they we should put them up somewhere so 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1674	3481.14	3481.7	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	in general 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1673	3480.97	3485.36	G	Grad	s	+1	0	that's so in general be findings across both intentions in the actions so 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1675	3484.53	3484.66	C	Grad	b	-1	0	intentions in the actions 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1677	3485.9	3486.56	C	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	that's wonderful so yeah 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1676	3485.62	3486.2	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	that's wonderful so yeah 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1678	3486.88	3487.15	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	wonderful yeah so it's generates 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1679	3487.23	3489.47	G	Grad	s	-1	0	so it's generates general across all these things like i mean i 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1681	3489.64	3489.92	C	Grad	b	-1	0	these things like i mean i 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1680	3489.47	3494.85	G	Grad	s	-1	0	these things like i mean i think shuster was that you know finding is like jill cognitive uh process so 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1682	3494.85	3496.09	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	process so um so i don't 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1683	3496.41	3496.67	C	Grad	b	-1	0	so i don't 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1684	3496.72	3498.67	G	Grad	s	-1	0	so i don't think ill be isolated to one or the two but you can 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1685	3498.67	3501.36	G	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	or the two but you can definitely figure out where it sometimes 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1686	3501.67	3502.87	G	Grad	fh|s.%--	-1	0	it sometimes think the hmong it's 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1687	3503.01	3503.8	G	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	actually i'm not sure i would 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1688	3503.8	3512.07	G	Grad	s	-1	0	actually i'm not sure i would it be curious to see how separate the intention part in the action are in the system like i know the the whole thing 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1689	3512.31	3515.23	G	Grad	s	-1	0	like i know the the whole thing is like in tension ladders or something like that right so 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1690	3514.82	3515.15	C	Grad	b	-1	0	ladders or something like that right so 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1691	3515.23	3515.49	G	Grad	qy^d^g	-1	0	that right so

Bed006.G.dialogueact1693	3523.8	3525.66	G	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	intention it still it still mainly into the hypothesis and then that's

Bed006.G.dialogueact1696	3525.66	3528.95	G	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	hypothesis and then that's just one way describe the action part of it okay 
Bed006.C.dialogueact1697	3528.38	3528.61	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	action part of it okay 
Bed006.G.dialogueact1698	3528.95	3529.26	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	say a action part of it okay
