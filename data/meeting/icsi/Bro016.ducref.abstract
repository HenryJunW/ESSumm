Although the members of ICSI's Meeting Recorder Group at Berkeley had little progress to report , there were still a number of issues relating to their work to discuss.
These included making plans for upcoming experiments , clarifying definitions , and approaches which may or may not be against the rules of the Aurora project , alongside alternatives that would not be.
There was also debate about the necessary continuation of a group report.
Plans were also made with regard to a visitor from research partner OGI
