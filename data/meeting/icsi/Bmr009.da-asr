Bmr009.C.dialogueact16	20.008	23.828	C	Professor	z	-1	0	fact uh my my brother's uh turned logical psychologist and he 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact17	23.828	33.442	C	Professor	z	-1	0	psychologist and he he uh came within and uh a a body h. tests which to get sound is are only three measurements that are good enough statistical pictures of all the rest of it and one 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact18	33.91	37.438	C	Professor	z	-1	0	rest of it and one of them is is the distance that she told told of that yeah get onto paper that hey it 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact19	35.816	40.551	D	PhD	z	-1	0	real life by the way so we got a good intro here that she told told of that yeah get onto paper that hey it

Bmr009.C.dialogueact29	45.357	45.947	C	Professor	z	-1	0	you want it's okay 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact31	46.096	46.346	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay so 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact33	46.596	51.17	A	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	okay so this time the forum discussion should be very short right it also 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact32	46.181	46.821	D	PhD	z	-1	0	okay so 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact30	45.811	46.831	E	PhD	z	-1	0	you want okay so it's okay 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact34	51.17	51.47	A	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right it also 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact35	51.707	52.967	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	right it also should be later 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact36	53.49	53.69	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay because 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact37	53.721	56.051	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	okay good point because jane uh it's not here yet and 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact38	56.173	56.513	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	good point and 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact39	57.01	58.79	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that should be most interested in that 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact40	59.42	62.24	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh spread at least involved in signal processing stuff so maybe we can 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact41	62.24	63.87	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so maybe we can just just uh i don't 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact42	63.87	65.58	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	just just uh i don't think we should go through an elaborate thing 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact43	66.251	73.986	C	Professor	s	+1	1	but um uh jose and i were just talking about this speech energy thing did you really 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact44	72.621	72.741	E	PhD	s^2.%--	-1	0	speech energy did you really 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact46	74.446	75.176	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and i uh we can talk about the service 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact45	73.949	74.149	E	PhD	b	-1	0	thing and i uh 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact47	75.176	76.236	C	Professor	s	-1	0	we can talk about the service but i think you know 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact48	76.236	77.896	C	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	but i think you know the the if 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact49	77.896	81.69	C	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	the the if i can you know my my my speaking for you for that um uh right now 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact50	81.69	85.24	C	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	uh right now he's not really showing any kind of uh distinction but um we discussed a couple 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact51	85.24	88.51	C	Professor	s^rt	+1	0	um we discussed a couple of possible things that uh you can look at um 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact52	89.067	92.347	C	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	and uh one is that uh this is all in all again or g. and like energies 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact53	92.347	97.004	C	Professor	s	+1	0	g. and like energies basically compressing the distances uh between things um another 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact54	97.395	102.788	C	Professor	s	+1	1	um another that he needs to play with the the different uh um pepperell size is use 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact55	102.788	105.698	C	Professor	s	+1	1	size is use he's taking everything over two hundred twelve seconds 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact56	106.31	111.03	C	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	uh and uh he's going to vary that number and also look at moving windows as we discussed before 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact57	111.774	124.77	C	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	and uh and the other thing is that the it doing the striking if i mean and variance in me uh divided by the same deviation unlocked the main may not be right thing to do 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact59	125.24	125.57	A	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	and then we just 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact58	125.145	125.385	E	PhD	s^t3	-1	0	and then we just 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact61	125.87	126.52	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and then we just started 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact60	125.385	125.535	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and then we just 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact62	127.34	128.27	A	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	did you take that might there but the long term means like 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact63	127.482	128.752	D	PhD	qy^bu^rt	+1	0	did you take that might there but the long term means like 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact64	128.992	129.892	D	PhD	s^e.%--	-1	0	there term means like over 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact65	130.032	131.942	D	PhD	qy^d	-1	0	um means of west 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact68	132.243	132.723	A	Grad	s^ft	-1	0	it between that all the frames the conversation 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact66	131.992	133.292	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	um it between that we know means of west all the frames the conversation or the 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact67	132.012	133.582	D	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	it between that we know all the frames the conversation or the 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact70	133.966	134.196	C	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	we know that between neither or the things that 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact69	133.582	134.502	D	PhD	qrr^d.%--	-1	0	we know that between neither or the things that 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact71	134.196	134.676	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	that between neither things that 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact72	134.676	135.096	C	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	that between neither it's it between the pauses things that 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact74	135.096	137.826	C	Professor	s	+1	0	it's it between the pauses uh for some segment and 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact73	134.708	134.888	E	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	that between neither things that 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact75	135.586	135.976	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	it's it between the pauses 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact76	137.826	141.696	C	Professor	s	+1	1	some segment and so he is he's he's making the constraint has to be at least hundred dollars seconds 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact77	138.16	138.41	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so he is he's he's 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact78	142.319	143.059	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and see take that and then he's he's 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact79	143.059	145.909	C	Professor	s	+1	0	and then he's he's uh measuring up to frame level still 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact80	145.909	147.477	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	up to frame level still frame level of what and then 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact81	146.962	147.362	D	PhD	b	-1	0	frame level of what and then 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact82	147.557	150.207	C	Professor	s	+1	0	of what and then and then just a normal i think that larger amount um 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact83	150.91	158.05	C	Professor	s^rt	+1	1	um and the one thing he's money i was when he he looked at a bunch of examples in logged i mean it is actually pretty hard to see the change in you can sort of 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact84	158.17	166.318	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	in you can sort of see that because it was it was just putting on a board that certain of log x. plus block access to log of x. plus a lot of too and it's just you know it yeah maybe it's not long 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact85	160.887	161.077	E	PhD	b	-1	0	it was just putting on a board that 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact86	163.864	165.324	D	PhD	fg|s^cs	-1	0	plus block access to log of x. plus a lot of too yeah maybe it's not long 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact87	165.356	165.516	E	PhD	b	-1	0	x. plus a lot of too 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact88	165.516	165.866	E	PhD	b	-1	0	x. plus a lot of too 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact89	166.318	169.318	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and it's just you know it it diminishes the effect of having two of them 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact90	169.532	169.972	E	PhD	x	-1	0	of them 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact92	170.268	170.898	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	but could you do like a c. 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact91	170.057	172.147	D	PhD	qy	-1	0	but could you do like a c. d. f. there instead i mean we don't know that the 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact93	172.147	175.163	D	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	yes right so so what i was suggesting i mean we don't know that the distribution here is normally so just some kind of simple 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact94	174.5	174.93	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yes right so normally 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact95	174.93	177.24	C	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	yes right so so what i was suggesting to him is that actually p. d. s. normally so just some kind of simple 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact96	175.163	176.403	D	PhD	s^cs.%-	-1	0	so what i was suggesting to him is so just some kind of simple 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact97	177.32	178.15	C	Professor	s^bc	+1	0	that actually p. d. s. but you know 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact98	178.45	179.93	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but you know but either way yeah 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact99	178.92	179.29	D	PhD	s^bk^m	-1	0	but you know but either way yeah 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact100	179.93	180.13	C	Professor	b	-1	0	but either way yeah yeah 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact103	180.765	184.3	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	yeah he uh yeah but i think something like that weren't sort of dated 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact101	180.331	180.571	D	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact102	180.388	180.668	E	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact104	181.709	183.539	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	he uh something like that weren't sort of dated 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact105	184.3	199.911	C	Professor	s^bk|s^arp.%--	+1	0	yeah but i think also i think a good first indicator is when the the the researcher looks at examples of the data and cannot see a change in how big the the signal is when the two seats and 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact106	199.143	202.345	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	when the two seats and that's a problem right there so i think you should 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact107	199.911	201.991	C	Professor	s	-1	0	when the two seats and that's a problem right there so 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact108	202.091	203.701	C	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	i think you should at least be able doing 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact109	202.105	202.385	D	PhD	b	-1	0	i think you should 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact110	203.946	206.446	C	Professor	s^cs:s	-1	0	at least be able doing casual looking and get the sense hate or something there and then you can play 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact111	206.446	207.826	C	Professor	s	-1	0	there and then you can play around with the measures 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact114	208.325	210.365	C	Professor	s^df	+1	1	and when he's looking like i mean it's not really releasing so and he's 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact112	208.094	208.424	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and when he's looking like 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact113	208.142	208.502	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and when he's looking like 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact115	210.365	210.745	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	so and he's 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact116	210.745	212.695	C	Professor	s^df^rt	+1	1	so and he's looking in state energy he is 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact117	213.3	214.36	C	Professor	s	+1	0	that's a good place to start 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact118	214.548	214.818	E	PhD	b	-1	0	start 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact119	215.06	217.13	C	Professor	fh|s^tc	-1	0	um so i was i was the discussion we just had um the 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact120	217.35	218.531	C	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	um the other thing actually 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact121	218.91	220.94	C	Professor	s	-1	0	other thing actually you can have a question for adam in this 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact122	221.399	235.014	C	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	uh when you get the sampling uh over the speech segments or or sampling over the the individual candle handle start through the of the two equalization did you do it over just the entire everything on my channels he didn't try to find speech 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact123	221.411	221.671	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	uh when you get the 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact124	235.014	236.444	C	Professor	qy^d	-1	0	no i just he didn't try to find speech 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact125	236.582	239.442	A	Grad	s^ar|s	-1	0	no i just took over the entire is an entire channel um 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact126	239.952	242.032	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um sample ten minutes randomly right okay so then 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact127	242.35	242.86	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	right okay so then 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact128	242.86	247.71	C	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	right okay so then that means that someone who didn't speak very much would be largely represented by silence 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact129	246.787	247.037	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	largely represented by silence 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact130	248.17	249.64	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and someone who is who would be so the normalization 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact131	249.64	253.49	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	yeah this was quite quick and would be so the normalization factor probably is is is 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact132	252.929	256.229	A	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	yeah this was quite quick and dirty and it was just for listening for listening is is 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact133	253.512	253.832	E	PhD	b	-1	0	this was quite quick and is 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact134	254.388	254.618	C	Professor	b	-1	0	dirty and it was just 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact136	256.659	258.379	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	for listening it seems to work really well 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact135	256.516	256.806	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	for listening 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact137	256.771	257.021	E	PhD	s^bk^rt	-1	0	for listening it seems to work really 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact138	258.502	258.712	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	well 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact139	258.837	259.027	E	PhD	b	-1	0	well 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact140	259.649	259.809	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact141	259.706	259.866	C	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact142	260.405	261.015	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but it's not but that's right so

Bmr009.C.dialogueact213	375.815	376.765	C	Professor	s	-1	0	okay yeah so she she's right that's you know like if if it 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact214	375.978	378.278	E	PhD	s	-1	0	okay yeah so she she's right that's a well might be just good to know what it looks you know like if if it didn't it before when

Bmr009.C.dialogueact217	379.542	379.812	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah that's 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact219	379.812	383.346	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah that's that's uh because i've mentioned scatter plots before but she's right i mean even before 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact218	379.682	379.892	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	yeah that's 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact220	379.871	380.131	E	PhD	qw^br	-1	0	yeah that's that's uh 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact221	383.346	389.825	C	Professor	s	-1	0	right i mean even before you get to scatter plus just looking at a single feature looking at the distribution is a good thing to do 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact222	386.83	387.04	E	PhD	b	-1	0	feature looking at 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact223	390.45	393.97	E	PhD	s	-1	0	because if they combine these simple sweet people's is that i mean touched 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact224	394.42	401.77	E	PhD	s	-1	0	i i i i mean they they just got to protest on buying and said and they mm to culmination 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact225	402.118	404.928	C	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	yeah but but what she's saying is which is right is what in a strange thing called of energy um 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact226	402.17	406.61	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah but but what she's saying is which is right is what i mean let's start with that before in a strange thing called of energy um today 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact227	405.903	406.743	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i mean let's start with that before today 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact228	406.743	421.47	C	Professor	s	+1	0	let's start with that before get complicated if that was the most basically thing which is we're arguing if you take energy uh if you look at the energy that when too we were speaking at the same time usually they'll be more energy than when one right 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact230	421.47	421.73	C	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	one right 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact229	421.442	421.672	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	one right 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact231	422.056	423.236	C	Professor	s^e	+1	0	that's that's sort of hypothesis and the firstly look 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact232	422.339	422.849	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	that's that's sort of hypothesis 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact233	423.236	426.229	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and the firstly look at that uh i said she's actually right is that you would just 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact234	426.229	429.226	C	Professor	s	+1	0	right is that you would just take a look at the distribution of those two things much as you 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact236	429.671	430.911	C	Professor	s	-1	0	much as you plotted in here 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact235	429.219	429.419	E	PhD	b	-1	0	much as you 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact237	431.33	433.38	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah but just but just just uh do it well 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact238	431.42	431.59	E	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah but just but 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact239	433.95	434.8	C	Professor	s	-1	0	do it well in this case you three of the 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact240	434.8	436.24	C	Professor	s	-1	0	in this case you three of the silence and that's that's fine so 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact241	435.623	435.853	E	PhD	b	-1	0	silence and that's that's fine 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact242	436.34	439.056	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so uh i was three colors appreciates or whatever just just look at this distribution 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact243	439.056	440.676	C	Professor	s	-1	0	just just look at this distribution 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact244	439.489	439.669	E	PhD	b	-1	0	just just look at this distribution 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact245	441.112	449.373	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and then given that as a basic can see if that gets improved you know or or or worsened by looking at regular energy looking at like energy who are is proposing 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact246	449.373	452.763	C	Professor	s^cs^rt	-1	0	who are is proposing and maybe it's you know it's harder to see with a like energy 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact248	453.56	459.52	C	Professor	fh|qh^rt	-1	0	um and uh also these different organizations just a particular choice normalization make it better but 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact247	453.336	453.476	E	PhD	b	-1	0	um 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact249	460.007	464.834	C	Professor	s	+1	0	i had maybe made it too complicated by suggesting early on that you look at scatter plots because 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact250	464.834	467.254	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	at scatter plots because that's looking at the distribution in two dimensions let's start 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact251	467.758	470.56	C	Professor	s^co	+1	0	let's start off just in one was this feature i 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact252	467.788	468.178	E	PhD	b	-1	0	let's start off just in one 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact253	469.279	469.609	E	PhD	b	-1	0	was 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact255	471.06	474.13	C	Professor	s	-1	0	think that's probably the most basic thing for anything very complicated 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact254	471.052	471.402	E	PhD	b	-1	0	think that's probably the most basic 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact257	474.805	482.615	C	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	and then we we i think we're agreed that pitch related things are are are going to be uh a really likely candidate to help um 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact256	474.5	474.85	D	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr009.E.dialogueact258	474.839	475.009	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and then we we i 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact259	476.869	477.379	E	PhD	b	-1	0	think we're agreed that pitch related things 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact260	481.816	482.446	E	PhD	b	-1	0	to help um 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact261	483.028	499.162	C	Professor	s	+1	1	but since uh your intuition from looking at some of the data is that when you looked at the regular energy that it did in fact usually go up when two people were talking that's you know you should be able to come up with a measure which will match your intuition and she's 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact262	483.351	483.721	E	PhD	b	-1	0	but since 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact263	492.328	492.668	E	PhD	b.x	-1	0	when 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact264	492.945	493.195	E	PhD	b	-1	0	when two people were talking 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact265	494.468	494.988	E	PhD	b	-1	0	that's 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact266	499.8	510.17	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	and she's right that uh that having a having having this table with a whole bunch of things with the same deviation the various of it it's it's it's harder to interpret and just looking at the same kind of picture it's cool up 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact267	501.395	501.665	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	having a having

Bmr009.E.dialogueact270	508.565	525.133	E	PhD	s	-1	0	at the same kind of picture it's cool up too it i found the team they can day and nieces fight and said earlier and sort of things they do how finish because okay i don't we say hi to with energy

Bmr009.A.dialogueact291	562.091	566.876	A	Grad	s	+1	0	i was just going to say that that right now we're just exploring the other thing is that 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact292	562.18	563.12	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i the other thing is that 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact293	563.41	563.74	D	PhD	s^fa	-1	0	i 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact294	563.89	564.12	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	i was just going to say that 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact296	567.526	572.176	A	Grad	s	+1	0	where you would imagine eventually that you feed all of these features into some discriminated system and 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact295	567.452	567.642	E	PhD	b	-1	0	where you would imagine 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact297	572.324	572.624	C	Professor	b	-1	0	and 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact299	573.09	580.18	A	Grad	s	+1	0	so even if if one of the teachers does a good job but one type of overlap another feature might do a good job with another type of overlap right i mean the 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact298	573.003	573.273	E	PhD	b	-1	0	so even if if 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact300	577.449	577.799	E	PhD	b	-1	0	type of overlap another 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact301	579.072	579.382	E	PhD	b	-1	0	with another type of overlap 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact303	580.128	587.679	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	right i mean the the reason i said that scattered features is i used to do this a lot when we had thirteen or fifteen or twenty features to look at 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact302	579.836	580.636	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	with another type of overlap right i mean the 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact304	588.76	594.74	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because something is a good feature uh by itself you don't really know how to behave in combination and so it's 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact305	594.74	600.466	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	combination and so it's nice to have as many as many together at the same time as possible and it's reasonable visual form their school graphic 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact306	600.466	604.915	C	Professor	s	-1	0	form their school graphic things people have sometimes put together three or four and some funny funny way 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact307	605.237	612.323	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but it's true that you should do any of that unless you know that the individual ones at least have have some uh oh well especially for normalized 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact308	610.91	611.25	E	PhD	b	-1	0	have have some uh well especially 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact309	611.633	613.553	D	PhD	s	-1	0	some uh oh well especially for normalized and i mean 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact311	613.742	613.992	C	Professor	b	-1	0	and i mean 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact310	613.553	619.34	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	and i mean it's really important to pick normalization that matches the distribution for that teacher and 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact312	618.7	619.07	C	Professor	b	-1	0	for that teacher and 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact313	619.908	626.899	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and it may not be the same for all the types of overlaps or the windows may not be 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact314	627.879	637.152	D	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah actually i was wondering right now all over the speech from the whole meeting and you're trying to find points of overlap but we don't really know which 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact315	637.152	639.992	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but we don't really know which speakers overlapping with which speaker 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact317	640.297	640.597	C	Professor	s^aa^m	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact316	639.992	640.232	D	PhD	qy^d^g	-1	0	with which speaker 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact319	641.037	648.6	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	i mean another way would just be to take the speech from jesse morgan unjust jean and then just there overlap 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact318	640.631	640.841	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact320	648.81	649.96	D	PhD	s	-1	0	overlap but by hand

Bmr009.D.dialogueact322	651.18	653.58	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	and looking at you know if you can detect something that way because if we 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact323	653.58	657.57	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	no prayer that way because if we can't do it that way there's no good way that we're going to be able to do it that

Bmr009.D.dialogueact325	657.57	666.194	D	PhD	s	-1	0	able to do it that there might be something helpful and cleaner about looking at just individuals and plus i think 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact326	665.968	666.128	E	PhD	b	-1	0	plus i think 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact327	666.6	670.541	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	plus i think it has more elegant them the 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact328	667.662	668.062	C	Professor	b	-1	0	it has more elegant 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact329	670.631	673.421	D	PhD	s	-1	0	them the right model will be easier but 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact330	673.9	680.883	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but i don't know if you go through and you find adam because he has a lot of overlaps and some other speaker who also has enough speech unjust 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact331	676.071	676.221	E	PhD	b	-1	0	adam because 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact332	680.883	686.264	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	enough speech unjust three cases of adam the other person and overlaps maybe

Bmr009.D.dialogueact335	687.65	691.2	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and just look at the distribution maybe there is a clear pattern but we just can't 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact336	689.384	689.664	E	PhD	b	-1	0	there is a clear 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact338	691.2	696.97	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but we just can't see it because there's too many combinations of of people

Bmr009.A.dialogueact372	738.97	742.13	A	Grad	s	-1	0	well but but i think that's what i was saying about different types of overlapped okay situation we don't have that but there 
Bmr009.B.dialogueact373	739.186	739.536	B	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	but okay

Bmr009.E.dialogueact425	836.068	841.675	E	PhD	s	+1	0	it just seems like come and we true before that to we have to it could pretty issue in this situation up and dropping

Bmr009.C.dialogueact431	863.661	870.051	C	Professor	s	-1	0	distinct and i would imagine there should be some you know there should be the distribution is should be somewhat separated uh

Bmr009.C.dialogueact503	990.095	999.914	C	Professor	s	-1	0	sure look at it more and more finely but uh uh i think that this often happens you do fairly complicated things and then you stand back and realize have done something simple so 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact504	999.914	1011.7	C	Professor	s	+1	0	simple so uh if you generated something like that just for the energy and see and then uh as uh as the says to make have uh a smaller more coherent groups to look at that would be another interesting thing later 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact505	1007.64	1008.05	E	PhD	b	-1	0	uh a smaller more coherent 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact507	1012.2	1018.46	C	Professor	s^rt	+1	1	and then that should give us some indication that we know she gives some indication of whether there's anything to be achieved from energy at all

Bmr009.B.dialogueact557	1114.54	1118.61	B	Postdoc	s	+1	0	but that in itself is not informative without knowing what types of overlap they're involved in so 
Bmr009.B.dialogueact558	1118.61	1122.42	B	Postdoc	s	+1	2	involved in so i was planning to do a tax on any of types are like service to that so that would be great that would be really

Bmr009.B.dialogueact562	1122.87	1127.23	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	to that so but you know it's like you sounds like you also have um something in that direction is is it that would be really great we have nothing 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact561	1122.42	1123.38	D	PhD	s^ba^r	-1	0	to that so but you know it's like that would be really great

Bmr009.B.dialogueact564	1127.23	1127.86	B	Postdoc	qy.%-	-1	0	is is it we have nothing 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact565	1127.43	1128.52	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	is is it we have nothing you know basically 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact566	1128.52	1131.37	D	PhD	s	-1	0	you know basically we got his environment setup he's he's a

Bmr009.D.dialogueact568	1133.85	1140.63	D	PhD	s^df^rt	-1	0	you know so it's mostly that if we had to label it ourselves we we would or we'd have to get started but if 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact569	1140.63	1143.29	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	get started but if it it would be much better if you can do it you'd be much better 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact570	1143.29	1145.13	D	PhD	s	-1	0	do it you'd be much better at doing it also because you 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact571	1145.13	1150.94	D	PhD	s	-1	0	because you know i i'm not i don't have a good feel for how they should be sorted out and

Bmr009.D.dialogueact583	1162.21	1164.2	D	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah be interesting i think that's a research effort in and of itself because you can read the literature

Bmr009.D.dialogueact680	1382.1	1385.8	D	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	yeah it depends how different your normalization is as you slide your window across i mean that's

Bmr009.B.dialogueact1007	1851.03	1851.71	B	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	roughly so if 
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1008	1851.81	1856.43	B	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	we i think roughly so if you could say you know ten years in the east coast five years in the west coast or something 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1009	1854.16	1860.49	A	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	we i think we don't want to get that level of detail at this form i think that's the right in the east coast five years in the west coast or something 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1010	1860.49	1862.16	A	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	this form i think that's the right if we want to follow up

Bmr009.D.dialogueact1015	1871.55	1877.83	D	PhD	s	-1	0	the problem is that for some things it's really clear and usually listen to it you can tell right away if it's a new yorker boston accent but new 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1016	1877.84	1879.17	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	accent but new york and boston are too like if they have

Bmr009.D.dialogueact1018	1880.67	1884.2	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and my c. but new england has a bunch of very different alex and 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1019	1884.2	1884.48	D	PhD	%--	-1	0	and 
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1020	1885.18	1885.49	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	and 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1021	1885.54	1889.56	D	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah so i picked these regions because we talked and so does um so do other places 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1022	1888.15	1890.78	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	yeah so i picked these regions because we talked about payment and those so do other places right and so 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1024	1890.78	1891.93	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	about payment and those are right from tenet right and so these

Bmr009.D.dialogueact1025	1890.88	1897.96	D	PhD	s	-1	0	about payment and those are right from tenet right and so these would be satisfying like a speech research community if we released the database 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1026	1892.78	1893.01	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	would be satisfying like 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1027	1898.17	1905.19	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but as to whether subjects know where they're from i'm not sure because i know that they had to fill this out for switchboard's is i almost

Bmr009.A.dialogueact1309	2307.19	2308.87	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because because of the problems we're talking about what

Bmr009.A.dialogueact1564	2643.33	2644.66	A	Grad	s^aap^df	-1	0	mean yes we could do that you could you 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1565	2644.66	2646.92	A	Grad	s	-1	0	we could do that you could you can write we just see 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1567	2647.54	2649.65	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and try to do it that way but i just don't think it let's 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact1566	2647.3	2647.55	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	and try to do 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1568	2650.03	2654.08	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	try with bands and if that isn't enough we can do it otherwise i think it is because when 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1569	2653.2	2653.29	D	PhD	b	-1	0	we can do it otherwise 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1570	2654.08	2657.55	A	Grad	s|s^df	-1	0	i think it is because when i was playing with it the mixed signal has it all in there 
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1571	2658.54	2663.94	A	Grad	s	+1	0	and so it's really it's not too bad to find places in this industry where things are happening

Bmr009.A.dialogueact1575	2664.43	2665.59	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so i don't think it'll be bad it's also also case 
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1573	2664.33	2671.24	B	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	so i don't think it'll be bad it's also also case that that that this multi wave thing is proposed to be so damn propose 
Bmr009.E.dialogueact1574	2664.42	2664.96	E	PhD	b.%	-1	0	so i don't think it's also 
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1576	2671.32	2673.96	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so damn propose it to the transcriber central people 
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1577	2674.43	2675.79	B	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and it's likely that uh son 
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1578	2675.94	2677.87	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that uh son and they responded favorably looks 
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1579	2677.87	2680.01	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	favorably looks so it will be incorporated in the future version they said that the only reason 
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1580	2677.98	2678.35	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	favorably looks so it will be incorporated 
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1581	2680.26	2686.41	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	they said that the only reason i hadn't had the multi the parallel uh stream one before it was simply that they hadn't had time to do it 
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1582	2687.16	2691.3	B	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	and uh so it's likely that this this may be entered into the china's central they may well not

Bmr009.A.dialogueact1585	2691.56	2691.96	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	they may well not 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact1584	2691.5	2693.42	C	Professor	s	-1	0	well that's that's they may well not have had much demand 
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1586	2693.71	2694.85	B	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	well that's that's that's true too 
Bmr009.C.dialogueact1587	2694.58	2694.99	C	Professor	b	-1	0	that's true too 
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1588	2695.14	2696.76	B	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	this is uh usually so you mean they could they could do it
