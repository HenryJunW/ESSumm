Bed002.E.dialogueact0	5.79	6.2	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I guess .
Bed002.A.dialogueact1	6.393	7.043	A	Grad	s	-1	0	OK , we 're on .
Bed002.A.dialogueact2	10.383	13.723	A	Grad	s^cs^rt	-1	0	So just make sure that th your wireless mike is on , if you 're wearing a wireless .
Bed002.E.dialogueact3	12.822	13.472	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Check one .
Bed002.E.dialogueact4	13.822	14.542	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Check one .
Bed002.A.dialogueact5	18.289	22.839	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And you should be able to see which one {disfmarker} which one you 're on by , uh , watching the little bars change .
Bed002.B.dialogueact6	23.925	24.855	B	Grad	qw	-1	0	So , which is my bar ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact7	24.855	25.185	B	Grad	%--	-1	0	Mah !
Bed002.B.dialogueact8	25.421	27.211	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Number one .
Bed002.A.dialogueact9	26.417	26.557	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bed002.E.dialogueact10	27.711	27.941	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Sibilance .
Bed002.E.dialogueact11	27.941	29.261	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Sibilance .
Bed002.A.dialogueact12	31.379	35.529	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So , actually , if you guys wanna go ahead and read digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright .
Bed002.E.dialogueact13	35.493	37.013	E	Grad	qy	-1	0	Are we supposed to read digits at the same time ?
Bed002.A.dialogueact14	37.281	37.461	A	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bed002.A.dialogueact16	38.242	38.452	A	Grad	s^ar^r	-1	0	No .
Bed002.E.dialogueact15	37.84	38.18	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bed002.A.dialogueact17	38.552	39.332	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	Each individually .
Bed002.A.dialogueact18	39.612	41.292	A	Grad	s	-1	0	We 're talking about doing all at the same time
Bed002.A.dialogueact19	41.292	46.928	A	Grad	s	-1	0	but I think cognitively that would be really difficult . {vocalsound} To try to read them while everyone else is .
Bed002.E.dialogueact20	46.327	47.957	E	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Everyone would need extreme focus .
Bed002.A.dialogueact21	48.2	53.13	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on .
Bed002.C.dialogueact22	50.26	50.75	C	Professor	s^t3	-1	0	Other way .
Bed002.C.dialogueact23	52.894	56.664	C	Professor	s	-1	0	We m We may wind up with ver We {disfmarker} we may need versions of all this garbage .
Bed002.B.dialogueact24	57.194	58.074	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	For our stuff .
Bed002.B.dialogueact26	58.074	58.204	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.C.dialogueact25	58.07	58.26	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.A.dialogueact27	58.903	62.003	A	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Um . So the first thing you 'd wanna do is just say which transcript you 're on .
Bed002.C.dialogueact28	59.76	59.86	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.A.dialogueact29	62.003	62.353	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bed002.A.dialogueact30	62.653	63.593	A	Grad	s	-1	0	You can see the transcript ?
Bed002.A.dialogueact31	63.713	66.443	A	Grad	s	-1	0	There 's two large number strings on the digits ?
Bed002.A.dialogueact32	66.443	68.423	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So you would just read that one .
Bed002.A.dialogueact33	68.423	71.973	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines .
Bed002.A.dialogueact34	72.444	76.584	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins .
Bed002.A.dialogueact35	76.584	79.404	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And I 'll give {disfmarker} I 'll read the digit strings first , so can see how that goes .
Bed002.A.dialogueact36	81.2	81.62	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bed002.A.dialogueact37	88.19	91.91	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Again , I 'm not sure how much I should talk about {pause} stuff before everyone 's here .
Bed002.C.dialogueact38	93.44	93.71	C	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed002.C.dialogueact39	93.71	95.02	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , we have one more coming .
Bed002.A.dialogueact40	95.206	95.406	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.A.dialogueact41	96.029	97.489	A	Grad	qh^cs	-1	0	Well , why don't I go ahead and read digit strings
Bed002.A.dialogueact42	97.489	98.449	A	Grad	s^cs^e	-1	0	and then we can go on from there .
Bed002.C.dialogueact43	141.465	141.735	C	Professor	z	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.C.dialogueact44	141.735	143.085	C	Professor	z	-1	0	Well , we can start doing it .
Bed002.A.dialogueact45	326.454	326.674	A	Grad	s^ft	-1	0	Thanks .
Bed002.A.dialogueact46	327.422	329.512	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So , uh , just also a note on wearing the microphones .
Bed002.A.dialogueact47	329.512	331.692	A	Grad	s	-1	0	All of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly ,
Bed002.A.dialogueact48	331.692	334.382	A	Grad	s	-1	0	but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth ,
Bed002.A.dialogueact49	334.802	335.902	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and then , at the corner .
Bed002.A.dialogueact50	336.403	338.343	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	And that 's so that you minimize breath sounds ,
Bed002.A.dialogueact51	339.019	341.049	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	so that when you 're breathing , you don't breathe into the mike .
Bed002.A.dialogueact52	341.637	341.967	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bed002.A.dialogueact53	343.292	343.992	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Yeah , that 's good .
Bed002.A.dialogueact54	344.634	345.294	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	And uh {disfmarker}
Bed002.A.dialogueact55	346.941	351.238	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So , everyone needs to fill out , only once , the speaker form and the consent form .
Bed002.A.dialogueact56	351.957	353.137	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	And the short form {disfmarker}
Bed002.A.dialogueact57	353.647	355.007	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , you should read the consent form ,
Bed002.A.dialogueact58	355.007	360.179	A	Grad	s	-1	0	but uh , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts .
Bed002.A.dialogueact59	360.584	373.834	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So , if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public , which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them , uh , you 'll be given an opportunity by email , uh , to bleep out any portions you don't like .
Bed002.A.dialogueact60	374.534	374.954	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bed002.A.dialogueact61	375.934	378.934	A	Grad	s	-1	0	On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can .
Bed002.A.dialogueact62	379.224	381.034	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	If you 're not exactly sure about the region ,
Bed002.A.dialogueact63	381.424	382.884	A	Grad	s^bd^df	-1	0	we 're not exactly sure either .
Bed002.A.dialogueact64	382.884	384.404	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So , don't worry too much about it .
Bed002.A.dialogueact65	384.464	385.594	A	Grad	s	-1	0	The {disfmarker} It 's just self rating .
Bed002.A.dialogueact66	386.41	386.83	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bed002.A.dialogueact67	388.883	389.813	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And I think that 's about it .
Bed002.A.dialogueact68	390.889	394.329	A	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	I mean , should I {disfmarker} Do you want me to talk at all about why we 're doing this and what this project is ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact69	393.731	395.141	C	Professor	h|s^aa	-1	0	Um , yeah .
Bed002.A.dialogueact70	394.329	394.509	A	Grad	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact71	395.141	396.541	C	Professor	s^ar|s	-1	0	No . There was {disfmarker} there was {disfmarker} Let 's see .
Bed002.C.dialogueact73	396.811	397.071	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	Oh {disfmarker}
Bed002.E.dialogueact72	396.68	397.97	E	Grad	qy	-1	0	Does Nancy know that we 're meeting in here ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact75	398.77	399.43	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	I sent an email .
Bed002.C.dialogueact74	398.723	401.363	C	Professor	s^na	-1	0	She got an emai she was notified .
Bed002.E.dialogueact76	400.321	400.931	E	Grad	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	Oh yeah , she got an e
Bed002.E.dialogueact77	400.931	401.681	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bed002.C.dialogueact78	401.673	404.343	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Whether she knows {vocalsound} is another question .
Bed002.C.dialogueact79	404.743	405.653	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bed002.C.dialogueact80	407.102	409.492	C	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	So are the people going to be identified by name ?
Bed002.A.dialogueact81	410.177	413.267	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , what we 're gonna {disfmarker} we 'll anonymize it in the transcript .
Bed002.A.dialogueact83	413.925	414.995	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	Um , but not in the audio .
Bed002.C.dialogueact82	413.442	413.822	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.A.dialogueact86	415.981	416.521	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	So the
Bed002.C.dialogueact84	415.601	415.911	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.C.dialogueact85	415.911	422.151	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So , then in terms of people worrying about , uh , excising things from the transcript , it 's unlikely .
Bed002.C.dialogueact87	422.811	424.531	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Since it {disfmarker} it does isn't attributed .
Bed002.C.dialogueact88	425.387	425.767	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , I see ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact89	425.767	427.487	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	but the a but the {disfmarker} but the {disfmarker}
Bed002.A.dialogueact90	426.978	431.858	A	Grad	s^aa|s:qw	-1	0	Right , so if I said , " Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? " , we 're not gonna go through and cancel out the " Jerry "s .
Bed002.C.dialogueact91	428.714	429.124	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.C.dialogueact92	431.627	431.957	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Sure .
Bed002.A.dialogueact93	432.669	438.599	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Um , so we will go through and , in the speaker ID tags there 'll be , you know , M - one O seven , M - one O eight .
Bed002.C.dialogueact94	437.368	437.788	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.A.dialogueact96	439.088	440.168	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um , but uh ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact95	438.847	439.057	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.A.dialogueact97	441.443	442.953	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	um , it w uh ,
Bed002.A.dialogueact98	442.953	448.573	A	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I don't know a good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data .
Bed002.C.dialogueact99	444.462	444.672	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.C.dialogueact100	448.649	448.949	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.C.dialogueact101	449.059	450.059	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	No , I {disfmarker} I wasn't complaining ,
Bed002.A.dialogueact103	450.244	450.444	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yep .
Bed002.C.dialogueact102	450.059	450.989	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	I just wanted to understand .
Bed002.A.dialogueact104	451.276	451.486	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.C.dialogueact105	451.816	452.156	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.B.dialogueact106	452.371	454.691	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	Well , we can make up aliases for each of us .
Bed002.A.dialogueact107	455.308	456.838	A	Grad	fg|s^na	-1	0	Yeah , I mean , whatever you wanna do is fine ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact108	455.693	456.043	C	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.F.dialogueact109	455.922	456.092	F	Grad	b.%	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.A.dialogueact110	456.838	457.588	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	but we find that {disfmarker}
Bed002.A.dialogueact111	457.588	459.608	A	Grad	s	-1	0	We want the meeting to be as natural as possible .
Bed002.A.dialogueact113	460.057	461.637	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	So , we 're trying to do real meetings .
Bed002.C.dialogueact112	459.805	460.145	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.A.dialogueact114	462.046	463.676	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And so we don't wanna have to do aliases
Bed002.C.dialogueact115	462.049	462.389	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.A.dialogueact116	463.676	466.156	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and we don't want people to be editing what they say .
Bed002.B.dialogueact117	464.985	465.275	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.A.dialogueact119	466.651	471.841	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So I think that it 's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft .
Bed002.C.dialogueact118	466.223	466.453	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.B.dialogueact120	471.178	471.728	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.A.dialogueact121	472.001	472.191	A	Grad	s^f	-1	0	You know ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact122	472.42	472.65	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.C.dialogueact123	474.028	476.268	C	Professor	fg|qh^cs^tc.%--	-1	0	Um , OK . So why don't you tell us briefly
Bed002.A.dialogueact125	476.73	476.98	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.A.dialogueact126	476.98	477.52	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	So th
Bed002.C.dialogueact124	476.648	478.508	C	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	your {disfmarker} give {disfmarker} give your e normal schpiel .
Bed002.A.dialogueact127	478.763	481.253	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Um . So this is {disfmarker} The project is called Meeting Recorder
Bed002.A.dialogueact128	481.253	483.193	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and there are lots of different aspects of the project .
Bed002.A.dialogueact129	483.373	487.163	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Um . So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future .
Bed002.A.dialogueact130	487.473	488.503	A	Grad	s	-1	0	This is a mock - up of one .
Bed002.A.dialogueact131	488.503	491.103	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Yes , we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood .
Bed002.A.dialogueact132	491.912	496.526	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	Um . {comment} The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting ,
Bed002.A.dialogueact133	496.916	497.716	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and record it ,
Bed002.A.dialogueact134	497.716	500.426	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on , on the meeting .
Bed002.A.dialogueact135	500.646	502.106	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So that 's my particular interest ,
Bed002.A.dialogueact136	502.106	505.436	A	Grad	s	-1	0	is a portable device to do m uh , information retrieval on meetings .
Bed002.A.dialogueact137	505.786	508.496	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Other people are interested in other aspects of meetings .
Bed002.A.dialogueact138	508.966	512.306	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Um . So the first step on that , in any of these , is to collect some data .
Bed002.A.dialogueact139	512.926	517.706	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And so what we wanted is a room that 's instrumented with both the table top microphones ,
Bed002.A.dialogueact140	517.706	520.196	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes ,
Bed002.A.dialogueact141	520.566	522.066	A	Grad	s	-1	0	as well as the close talking mikes .
Bed002.A.dialogueact142	522.624	525.694	A	Grad	s	-1	0	What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth ,
Bed002.A.dialogueact143	526.174	528.074	A	Grad	s	-1	0	gives us , um , high quality audio ,
Bed002.A.dialogueact144	528.404	532.484	A	Grad	s	-1	0	um , especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus .
Bed002.A.dialogueact145	532.484	538.304	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So , for people who are more interested in language , we didn't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available .
Bed002.A.dialogueact146	538.892	542.772	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And then also , um , it 's a very , very hard task in terms of speech recognition .
Bed002.A.dialogueact147	543.321	548.131	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Um . And so , uh , on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results .
Bed002.A.dialogueact148	548.46	552.2	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two .
Bed002.A.dialogueact149	552.37	556.68	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	So that 's why we 're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time .
Bed002.A.dialogueact150	557.3	560.97	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And then , all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously
Bed002.A.dialogueact151	560.97	565.49	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	so that you can also do things like , um , beam - forming on all the microphones
Bed002.A.dialogueact152	565.49	566.62	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and do research like that .
Bed002.A.dialogueact153	567.252	573.282	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Our intention is to release this data to the public , um , probably through f through a body like the LDC .
Bed002.A.dialogueact154	573.752	576.622	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And , uh , just make it as a generally available corpus .
Bed002.A.dialogueact155	577.422	580.698	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	Um . {vocalsound} There 's other work going on in meeting recording .
Bed002.A.dialogueact156	580.698	582.368	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So , we 're {disfmarker} we 're working with SRI ,
Bed002.A.dialogueact157	582.638	583.478	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	with UW ,
Bed002.A.dialogueact158	583.827	586.627	A	Grad	h|s^e	-1	0	Um . NIST has started an effort which will include video .
Bed002.A.dialogueact159	586.727	588.287	A	Grad	s	-1	0	We 're not including video , obviously .
Bed002.A.dialogueact160	589.266	592.816	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And uh {disfmarker} and then also , um , a small amount of assistance from IBM .
Bed002.A.dialogueact161	593.316	594.046	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	Is also involved .
Bed002.A.dialogueact162	595.9	600.14	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Um . Oh , and the digit strings , this is just a more constrained task .
Bed002.A.dialogueact163	600.49	608.83	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Um . So because the general environment is so challenging , we decided to {disfmarker} to do at least one set of digit strings
Bed002.A.dialogueact164	609.19	610.37	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	to give ourselves something easier .
Bed002.A.dialogueact165	610.37	613.81	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And it 's exactly the same digit strings as in TI - digits ,
Bed002.A.dialogueact166	613.81	616.338	A	Grad	s	-1	0	which is a common connected digits corpus .
Bed002.A.dialogueact167	616.338	618.858	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So we 'll have some , um , comparison to be able to be made .
Bed002.C.dialogueact168	620.85	621.11	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.A.dialogueact169	621.506	622.046	A	Grad	qo^rt^t^tc	-1	0	Anything else ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact170	622.106	622.276	C	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bed002.A.dialogueact171	623.04	626.16	A	Grad	s^bk|s^co	-1	0	OK , so when the l last person comes in , just have them wear a wireless .
Bed002.A.dialogueact172	626.16	627.21	A	Grad	s	-1	0	It should be on already .
Bed002.A.dialogueact173	627.737	628.177	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bed002.A.dialogueact174	628.527	629.277	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Either one of those .
Bed002.A.dialogueact175	629.277	632.547	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And uh , read the digit strings and {disfmarker} and fill out the forms .
Bed002.A.dialogueact176	632.697	634.547	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So , the most important form is the consent form ,
Bed002.A.dialogueact177	634.547	637.567	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so just be s be sure everyone signs that , if they consent .
Bed002.B.dialogueact178	637.619	639.789	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I 'm sure it 's pretty usual for meetings that people come late ,
Bed002.A.dialogueact180	640.187	640.427	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.B.dialogueact179	639.789	641.499	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so you will have to leave what you set .
Bed002.A.dialogueact181	641.392	641.652	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.A.dialogueact182	642.23	643.36	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And uh , just give me a call ,
Bed002.A.dialogueact183	643.51	645.15	A	Grad	s	-1	0	which , my number 's up there when your meeting is over .
Bed002.C.dialogueact184	643.802	644.042	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yep .
Bed002.A.dialogueact185	646.32	647.88	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} I 'm going to leave the mike here
Bed002.A.dialogueact186	647.88	650.87	A	Grad	s	-1	0	but it 's n {nonvocalsound} Uh , but I 'm not gonna be on
Bed002.A.dialogueact187	650.87	652.02	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so don't have them use this one .
Bed002.A.dialogueact188	652.86	653.61	A	Grad	s	-1	0	It 'll just be sitting here .
Bed002.B.dialogueact189	657.237	657.637	B	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	Input ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact190	658.29	658.42	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.B.dialogueact191	658.53	658.83	B	Grad	s	-1	0	There we go .
Bed002.C.dialogueact192	659.876	664.05	C	Professor	s	-1	0	By the way , Adam , we will be using the , uh , screen as well .
Bed002.B.dialogueact193	662.518	662.688	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bed002.C.dialogueact194	664.05	664.7	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So , you know .
Bed002.C.dialogueact195	668.802	669.412	C	Professor	s^ba^fe	-1	0	Wow !
Bed002.C.dialogueact196	671.279	671.809	C	Professor	s^t^tc	-1	0	Organization .
Bed002.C.dialogueact197	672.029	676.319	C	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	So you guys who got email about this {pause} oh f uh , Friday or something about what we 're up to .
Bed002.E.dialogueact198	677.387	677.657	E	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bed002.F.dialogueact199	677.737	677.957	F	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bed002.B.dialogueact200	681.63	682.12	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	I got it .
Bed002.E.dialogueact201	683.953	685.413	E	Grad	qw^rt	-1	0	What was the nature of the email ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact202	685.92	692.787	C	Professor	s	+1	1	Oh , this was about {pause} um , inferring intentions from features in context , and the words ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact203	692.997	696.317	C	Professor	s^e.%-	+1	1	like " s go to see " , or " visit " , or some
Bed002.B.dialogueact204	695.75	697.07	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	Wel - we I {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact205	697.179	697.589	C	Professor	qy^bu^d	-1	0	You didn't get it ?
Bed002.E.dialogueact206	698.281	698.961	E	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	I don't think I did .
Bed002.C.dialogueact207	700.121	701.601	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I guess these g have got better filters .
Bed002.C.dialogueact208	701.601	702.641	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Cuz I sent it to everybody .
Bed002.C.dialogueact209	703.181	704.031	C	Professor	s	-1	0	You just blew it off .
Bed002.E.dialogueact210	703.229	703.449	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Ah .
Bed002.C.dialogueact211	704.031	704.381	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.B.dialogueact212	706.02	706.74	B	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's really simple though .
Bed002.B.dialogueact213	706.74	707.82	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So this is the idea .
Bed002.B.dialogueact214	708.476	709.116	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bed002.B.dialogueact215	710.79	723.941	B	Grad	s	-1	0	We could pursue , um , if we thought it 's {disfmarker} it 's worth it but , uh , I think we {disfmarker} we will agree on that , um , to come up with a {disfmarker} with a sort of very , very first crude prototype ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact216	724.251	727.421	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and do some implementation work , and do some {disfmarker} some research , and some modeling .
Bed002.B.dialogueact217	728.001	731.0	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So the idea is if you want to go somewhere ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact218	732.358	733.818	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	um , and
Bed002.B.dialogueact219	734.43	737.49	B	Grad	s^co.%--	-1	0	focus on that object down {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact220	737.62	738.8	B	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	Oh , I can actually walk with this .
Bed002.B.dialogueact221	738.8	739.22	B	Grad	s^ba^t1	-1	0	This is nice .
Bed002.B.dialogueact222	739.721	740.101	B	Grad	s^co	-1	0	down here .
Bed002.B.dialogueact223	740.72	741.62	B	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's the Powder - Tower .
Bed002.B.dialogueact224	742.81	751.79	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Now , um , {vocalsound} we found in our , uh , data and from experiments , that there 's three things you can do .
Bed002.B.dialogueact225	753.77	759.1	B	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	Um , you can walk this way , and come really , really close to it .
Bed002.B.dialogueact226	759.67	760.27	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	And touch it .
Bed002.B.dialogueact227	761.722	763.892	B	Grad	s	-1	0	But you cannot enter or do anything else .
Bed002.B.dialogueact228	763.892	767.282	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Unless you 're interested in rock climbing , it won't do you no good standing there .
Bed002.B.dialogueact229	767.282	768.442	B	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's just a dark alley .
Bed002.B.dialogueact230	768.442	769.342	B	Grad	s	-1	0	But you can touch it .
Bed002.B.dialogueact231	770.112	774.632	B	Grad	s	-1	0	If you want to actually go up or into the tower , you have to go this way ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact232	774.752	777.062	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and then through some buildings and up some stairs and so forth .
Bed002.B.dialogueact233	777.862	789.846	B	Grad	s	-1	0	If you actually want to see the tower , and that 's what actually most people want to do , is just have a good look of it , take a picture for the family , {comment} you have to go this way , and go up here .
Bed002.B.dialogueact234	790.416	794.916	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And there you have a vre really view {disfmarker} It exploded , the {disfmarker} during the Thirty
Bed002.B.dialogueact235	795.266	796.476	B	Grad	s	-1	0	years - war . Really uh , interesting sight .
Bed002.B.dialogueact237	797.456	802.466	B	Grad	fh|s^rt	-1	0	And um , these uh {disfmarker} these lines are , um , paths ,
Bed002.E.dialogueact236	797.115	797.355	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed002.B.dialogueact238	802.466	803.736	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	or so That 's ab er , i
Bed002.B.dialogueact239	803.736	806.506	B	Grad	s	+1	1	the street network of our geographic information system .
Bed002.B.dialogueact240	807.066	810.48	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And you can tell that we deliberately cut out this part .
Bed002.B.dialogueact241	810.87	815.04	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Because otherwise we couldn't get our GIS system to take {disfmarker} to lead people this way .
Bed002.B.dialogueact242	815.49	818.55	B	Grad	s	+1	1	It would always use the closest point to the object ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact243	818.55	821.4	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and then the tourists would be faced , you know , in front of a wall ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact244	821.86	823.43	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but it would do them absolutely no good .
Bed002.B.dialogueact245	824.32	830.38	B	Grad	s	+1	2	So , {vocalsound} what we found interesting is , first of all , intentions differ .
Bed002.B.dialogueact246	831.525	833.985	B	Grad	s	+1	2	Maybe you want to enter a building .
Bed002.B.dialogueact247	834.955	836.235	B	Grad	s	+1	2	Maybe you want to see it ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact248	836.465	837.325	B	Grad	s	+1	0	take a picture of it .
Bed002.B.dialogueact249	838.243	841.883	B	Grad	s	+1	2	Or maybe you actually want to come as close as possible to the building .
Bed002.B.dialogueact250	842.223	843.913	B	Grad	s	-1	0	For whatever reason that may be .
Bed002.E.dialogueact251	843.351	844.381	E	Grad	qw	-1	0	What 's it {disfmarker} what 's it made out of ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact252	845.69	847.43	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	Um , r red limestone .
Bed002.E.dialogueact253	850.179	851.309	E	Grad	s	-1	0	So maybe you would wanna touch it .
Bed002.B.dialogueact254	851.93	854.05	B	Grad	s^aa|s^m^na	-1	0	Yeah , maybe you would want to touch it .
Bed002.B.dialogueact255	854.05	854.34	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bed002.B.dialogueact256	855.86	862.61	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	Okay , I {disfmarker} This , um {disfmarker} These intentions , we {disfmarker} w w we could , if we want to , call it the {disfmarker} the Vista mode ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact257	863.49	865.92	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	where we just want to {disfmarker} eh {disfmarker} s get the overview or look at it ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact258	866.68	867.42	B	Grad	s	-1	0	the Enter mode ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact259	868.06	869.95	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and the , well , Tango mode .
Bed002.B.dialogueact260	869.95	871.76	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I always come up with {disfmarker} with silly names .
Bed002.B.dialogueact261	872.04	874.8	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So this " Tango " means , literally translated , " to touch " .
Bed002.B.dialogueact262	875.78	883.8	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So {disfmarker} But sometimes the {disfmarker} the Tango mode is really relevant in the {disfmarker} in the sense that , um , if you want to , uh {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact263	886.1	895.612	B	Grad	s.%--	+1	2	If you don't have the intention of entering your building , but you know that something is really close to it , and you just want to approach it , or get to that building .
Bed002.B.dialogueact264	895.992	900.352	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Consider , for example , the Post Office in Chicago , a building so large that it has its own zip code .
Bed002.B.dialogueact265	901.122	905.222	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So the entrance could be miles away from the closest point .
Bed002.B.dialogueact266	906.022	909.543	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So sometimes it m m m makes sense maybe to d to distinguish there .
Bed002.B.dialogueact267	910.503	915.84	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So , um , I 've looked , uh , through twenty some {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact268	915.84	917.85	B	Grad	s^bd^df	-1	0	Uh , I didn't look through all the data .
Bed002.B.dialogueact269	918.38	928.53	B	Grad	s	-1	0	um , and there {disfmarker} there 's uh , a lot more different ways in people {disfmarker} uh , the ways people phrase how to g get {disfmarker} if they want to get to a certain place .
Bed002.B.dialogueact270	929.21	933.26	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And sometimes here it 's b it 's a little bit more obvious {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact271	934.07	938.109	B	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	Um . {vocalsound} Maybe I should go back a couple of steps
Bed002.B.dialogueact272	938.109	939.099	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	and go through the {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact273	938.174	939.344	C	Professor	s^bk|s^co	-1	0	No , OK come in , sit down .
Bed002.C.dialogueact274	939.344	940.844	C	Professor	s^co	-1	0	If you grab yourself a microphone .
Bed002.B.dialogueact275	943.39	945.67	B	Grad	s	-1	0	You need to sign some stuff and read some digits .
Bed002.C.dialogueact276	944.684	946.294	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , you can sign afterwards .
Bed002.B.dialogueact277	946.373	946.833	B	Grad	s	-1	0	O or later .
Bed002.E.dialogueact278	946.868	948.578	E	Grad	s	-1	0	You have to al also have to read some digits .
Bed002.C.dialogueact279	948.89	949.44	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Afterwards .
Bed002.D.dialogueact280	948.97	949.97	D	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	OK . {comment} OK . Afterwards is fine .
Bed002.B.dialogueact281	959.73	960.59	B	Grad	s	-1	0	They are uncomfortable .
Bed002.B.dialogueact282	962.6	963.76	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.D.dialogueact283	963.361	963.911	D	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	Really small ?
Bed002.D.dialogueact284	964.131	964.951	D	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	OK . I see .
Bed002.D.dialogueact285	965.971	966.231	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.B.dialogueact286	968.035	968.155	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .

Bed002.B.dialogueact288	970.263	971.523	B	Grad	fg|s^t^tc	-1	0	OK , but that was our idea .
Bed002.C.dialogueact289	970.327	973.087	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it it also has to be switched on , Nance .
Bed002.B.dialogueact290	971.523	971.773	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	Is {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact292	973.85	974.15	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker}
Bed002.E.dialogueact291	973.663	974.863	E	Grad	s^ar|s^nd	-1	0	No , that one 's already on , I thought he said .
Bed002.C.dialogueact293	974.365	974.775	C	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	It 's on ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact294	974.775	975.345	C	Professor	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	OK , good .
Bed002.D.dialogueact296	975.269	975.839	D	Grad	s^bk|s^na	-1	0	OK . It 's on .
Bed002.E.dialogueact295	975.263	975.433	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.B.dialogueact297	976.923	978.163	B	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	OK . That was the idea .
Bed002.B.dialogueact298	978.543	983.253	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	Um , people , when they w when they want to go to a building , sometimes they just want to look at it .
Bed002.B.dialogueact299	983.82	985.0	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	Sometimes they want to enter it .
Bed002.B.dialogueact300	985.17	986.89	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And sometimes they want to get really close to it .
Bed002.B.dialogueact301	988.54	989.58	B	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's something we found .
Bed002.B.dialogueact302	989.9	990.72	B	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's just a truism .
Bed002.B.dialogueact303	991.15	997.24	B	Grad	s	+1	0	And the places where you will lead them for these intentions are sometimes ex in incredibly different .
Bed002.B.dialogueact304	997.24	1002.67	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I gave an example where the point where you end up if you want to look at it is completely different from where {disfmarker} if you want to enter it .
Bed002.B.dialogueact305	1003.31	1011.14	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	So , this is sort of how people may , uh {disfmarker} may phrase those requests to a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a mock - up system at least that 's the way they did it .
Bed002.B.dialogueact306	1011.97	1016.02	B	Grad	s:qw	+1	0	And we get tons of {disfmarker} of these " how do I get to " , " I want to go to " ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact307	1016.02	1019.29	B	Grad	s:s	-1	0	but also , " give me directions to " , and " I would like to see " .
Bed002.B.dialogueact308	1020.03	1026.5	B	Grad	fh|s.%--	-1	0	And um , what we can sort of do , if we look closer a closer at the {disfmarker} the data {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact309	1026.5	1027.32	B	Grad	s	-1	0	That was the wrong one .
Bed002.B.dialogueact310	1028.61	1032.34	B	Grad	s	+1	1	um , we can look at some factors that may make a difference .
Bed002.B.dialogueact311	1032.48	1032.99	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	First of all ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact312	1033.58	1034.81	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	very important ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact313	1034.85	1037.6	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and um , that {disfmarker} I 've completely forgot that when we talked .
Bed002.B.dialogueact314	1037.88	1040.58	B	Grad	s:qw	+1	1	This is of course a crucial factor , " what type of object is it ? "
Bed002.B.dialogueact315	1041.69	1044.91	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So , some buildings you just don't want to take pictures of .
Bed002.B.dialogueact316	1045.81	1046.66	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	Or very rarely .
Bed002.B.dialogueact317	1047.27	1048.85	B	Grad	s	-1	0	But you usually want to enter them .
Bed002.B.dialogueact318	1050.11	1052.43	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Some objects are more picturesque ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact319	1053.08	1055.14	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and you {disfmarker} more f more highly photographed .
Bed002.B.dialogueact320	1055.64	1061.81	B	Grad	s	+1	1	Then of course the {disfmarker} the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants .
Bed002.B.dialogueact321	1062.53	1071.48	B	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	Um . Sometimes I found in the {disfmarker} Uh , looking at the data , in a superficial way , I found some s sort of modifiers that {disfmarker} that m may also give us a hint ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact322	1071.48	1073.41	B	Grad	fh|s:s	-1	0	um , " I 'm trying to get to "
Bed002.B.dialogueact323	1074.1	1074.17	B	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Nuh ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact324	1074.17	1075.27	B	Grad	s:s	-1	0	" I need to get to " .
Bed002.B.dialogueact325	1075.44	1081.79	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Sort of hints to the fact that you 're not really sightseeing and {disfmarker} and just f there for pleasure and so forth and so on .
Bed002.B.dialogueact326	1082.3	1086.9	B	Grad	s	+1	1	And this leads us straight to the context which also should be considered .
Bed002.B.dialogueact327	1087.13	1093.23	B	Grad	s	-1	0	That whatever it is you 're doing at the moment may also inter influence the interpretation of {disfmarker} of a phrase .
Bed002.B.dialogueact328	1093.91	1095.75	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So , this is , uh , really
Bed002.B.dialogueact329	1095.75	1096.73	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	uh , uh , uh {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact330	1097.22	1098.82	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	My suggestion is really simple .
Bed002.B.dialogueact331	1099.62	1101.61	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	We start with , um {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact332	1102.35	1104.7	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Now , Let me , uh , say one more thing .
Bed002.B.dialogueact333	1105.2	1111.11	B	Grad	s	+1	1	What we do know , is that the parser we use in the SmartKom system will never differentiate between any of these .
Bed002.B.dialogueact334	1111.54	1117.18	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So , basically all of these things will result in the same XML M - three - L structure .
Bed002.B.dialogueact335	1118.06	1119.74	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	Sort of action " go " ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact336	1119.95	1121.04	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and then an object .
Bed002.D.dialogueact337	1120.63	1121.19	D	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.B.dialogueact338	1121.48	1121.59	B	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact339	1121.59	1122.51	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and a source .
Bed002.B.dialogueact340	1123.06	1128.46	B	Grad	s	+1	1	So it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's way too crude to d capture those differences in intentions .
Bed002.B.dialogueact341	1129.2	1130.25	B	Grad	s^rt:s^fe	-1	0	So , I thought , " Mmm !
Bed002.B.dialogueact342	1130.25	1135.45	B	Grad	s	+1	2	Maybe for a deep understanding task , that 's a nice sort of playground or first little thing . "
Bed002.B.dialogueact343	1135.9	1137.93	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	Where we can start it and n sort of look {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact344	1137.99	1141.16	B	Grad	s	+1	0	" OK , we need , we gonna get those M - three - L structures .
Bed002.B.dialogueact345	1141.53	1143.71	B	Grad	s	-1	0	The crude , undifferentiated parse .
Bed002.B.dialogueact346	1144.35	1145.55	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	Interpreted input .
Bed002.B.dialogueact347	1146.72	1155.29	B	Grad	s	-1	0	We may need additional part of speech , or maybe just some information on the verb , and modifiers , auxiliaries .
Bed002.B.dialogueact348	1155.86	1156.3	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	We 'll see .
Bed002.B.dialogueact349	1157.03	1161.24	B	Grad	s^cc^rt	+1	1	And I will try to {disfmarker} to sort of come up with a list of factors that we need to get out of there ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact350	1161.87	1165.62	B	Grad	s	+1	0	and maybe we want to get a g switch for the context .
Bed002.B.dialogueact351	1165.96	1170.36	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So this is not something which we can actually monitor , {vocalsound} now ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact352	1170.97	1172.46	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but just is something we can set .
Bed002.B.dialogueact353	1173.79	1180.88	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And then you can all imagine sort of a {disfmarker} a constrained satisfaction program , depending on {disfmarker} on what , um , comes out .
Bed002.B.dialogueact354	1181.3	1184.38	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	We want to have an {disfmarker} a structure resulting
Bed002.B.dialogueact355	1184.86	1197.62	B	Grad	s	+1	1	if we feed it through a belief - net or {disfmarker} or something along those lines . We 'd get an inferred intention , we {disfmarker} we produce a structure that differentiates between the Vista , the Enter , and the , um , Tango mode .
Bed002.B.dialogueact356	1198.14	1201.1	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Which I think we maybe want to ignore .
Bed002.B.dialogueact357	1201.2	1203.04	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	But . That 's my idea .
Bed002.B.dialogueact358	1203.22	1204.02	B	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's up for discussion .
Bed002.B.dialogueact359	1204.62	1205.86	B	Grad	s	-1	0	We can change all of it ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact360	1205.86	1206.79	B	Grad	s	-1	0	any bit of it .
Bed002.B.dialogueact361	1208.69	1209.31	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Throw it all away .
Bed002.F.dialogueact362	1211.57	1213.05	F	Grad	s	-1	0	Now @ @ this email that you sent , actually .
Bed002.C.dialogueact363	1213.1	1213.35	C	Professor	qw^br	-1	0	What ?
Bed002.F.dialogueact364	1213.45	1214.3	F	Grad	s	-1	0	Now I remember the email .
Bed002.C.dialogueact365	1214.77	1215.11	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.E.dialogueact366	1216.17	1216.44	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Huh .
Bed002.E.dialogueact367	1216.69	1220.29	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Still , I have no recollection whatsoever of the email .
Bed002.E.dialogueact368	1220.29	1221.4	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I 'll have to go back and check .
Bed002.C.dialogueact369	1221.8	1222.44	C	Professor	s^ba^bd	-1	0	Not important .
Bed002.C.dialogueact370	1223.64	1230.63	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So , what is important is that we understand what the proposed task is .
Bed002.C.dialogueact371	1231.98	1235.74	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And , the {disfmarker} the i uh , Robert and I talked about this some on Friday .
Bed002.C.dialogueact372	1236.84	1239.73	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	And we think it 's well - formed .
Bed002.C.dialogueact373	1240.27	1248.84	C	Professor	s	+1	2	So we think it 's a well - formed , uh , starter task for this , uh , deeper understanding in the tourist domain .
Bed002.F.dialogueact374	1252.95	1255.27	F	Grad	qw	-1	0	So , where exactly is the , uh , deeper understanding being done ?
Bed002.F.dialogueact375	1255.27	1257.1	F	Grad	qy	-1	0	Like I mean , s is it before the Bayes - net ?
Bed002.F.dialogueact376	1257.1	1257.67	F	Grad	qy.%--	-1	0	Is it , uh {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact377	1257.76	1260.26	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , it 's the {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's always all of it .
Bed002.C.dialogueact378	1260.49	1264.29	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So , in general it 's always going to be , the answer is , everywhere .
Bed002.C.dialogueact379	1264.95	1269.66	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh , so the notion is that , uh , this isn't real deep .
Bed002.C.dialogueact380	1270.05	1276.99	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But it 's deep enough that you can distinguish between these th three quite different kinds of , uh , going to see some tourist thing .
Bed002.C.dialogueact381	1277.94	1281.62	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And , so that 's {disfmarker} that 's the quote " deep " that we 're trying to get at .
Bed002.C.dialogueact382	1282.05	1290.09	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And , Robert 's point is that the current front - end doesn't give you any way to {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact383	1290.42	1294.81	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Not only doesn't it do it , but it also doesn't give you enough information to do it .
Bed002.C.dialogueact384	1294.81	1304.45	C	Professor	s	-1	0	It isn't like , if you just took what the front - end gives you , and used some clever inference algorithm on it , you would be able to figure out which of these is going on .
Bed002.C.dialogueact385	1305.19	1306.64	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So , uh ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact386	1306.64	1309.35	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and this is {disfmarker} Bu - I in general it 's gonna be true of any kind of deep understanding ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact387	1309.35	1310.64	C	Professor	s	+1	2	there 's gonna be contextual things ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact388	1310.64	1311.84	C	Professor	s	+1	2	there 're gonna be linguistic things ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact389	1311.84	1313.14	C	Professor	s	+1	2	there 're gonna be discourse things ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact390	1313.95	1315.55	C	Professor	s	+1	0	and they gotta be combined .
Bed002.C.dialogueact391	1316.54	1320.38	C	Professor	s	+1	1	And , my idea on how to combine them is with a belief - net ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact392	1320.38	1323.77	C	Professor	s^bd^df	-1	0	although it may turn out that t some totally different thing is gonna work better .
Bed002.C.dialogueact393	1324.18	1330.95	C	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Um , the idea would be that {vocalsound} you , uh , take your {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact394	1334.74	1335.72	C	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	You 're editing your slide ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact395	1335.98	1338.51	B	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah . As i a sort of , as I get ideas ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact396	1338.67	1339.39	B	Grad	%--	-1	0	uh w uh .
Bed002.C.dialogueact397	1339.07	1339.39	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bed002.B.dialogueact398	1341.97	1343.84	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	So , discourse {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I thought about that .
Bed002.B.dialogueact399	1343.84	1345.99	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Of course that needs to sort of go in there .
Bed002.C.dialogueact400	1345.42	1345.86	C	Professor	s^bk|s^fa	-1	0	Oh . I 'm sorry .
Bed002.C.dialogueact401	1345.86	1348.62	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	OK . So . This is minutes {disfmarker} taking minutes as we go ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact402	1348.62	1350.71	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	in his {disfmarker} in his own way .
Bed002.B.dialogueact403	1349.24	1349.4	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bed002.C.dialogueact404	1351.35	1352.62	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Um , but the p the {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact405	1352.62	1359.59	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Anyway . So the thing is , {vocalsound} i uh , d naively speaking , you 've {disfmarker} you 've got a {disfmarker} for this little task , a belief - net ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact406	1359.88	1365.7	C	Professor	s	+1	1	which is going to have as output , the conditional pr probability of one of three things ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact407	1365.7	1371.39	C	Professor	s:s	-1	0	that the person wants to {disfmarker} uh , to View it , to Enter it , or to Tango with it .
Bed002.C.dialogueact408	1373.03	1374.14	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bed002.C.dialogueact409	1374.84	1377.95	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So that {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the output of the belief - net is pretty well formed .
Bed002.C.dialogueact410	1378.75	1384.04	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And , then the inputs are going to be these kinds of things .
Bed002.C.dialogueact411	1385.37	1386.89	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And , then the question is {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact412	1387.14	1387.78	C	Professor	s	+1	0	there are two questions {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact413	1387.78	1390.81	C	Professor	qh	+1	2	is , uh , one , where do you get this i {comment} information from ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact414	1390.81	1392.34	C	Professor	qh	+1	1	and two , what 's the structure of the belief - net ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact415	1392.55	1396.82	C	Professor	qh^e	+1	0	So what are the conditional probabilities of this , that , and the other , given these things ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact416	1397.29	1399.73	C	Professor	s	+1	1	And you probably need intermediate nodes .
Bed002.C.dialogueact417	1399.73	1400.88	C	Professor	s^no	+1	0	I {disfmarker} we don't know what they are yet .
Bed002.C.dialogueact418	1401.95	1409.01	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So it may well be that , uh , for example , that , uh , knowing whether {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact419	1409.34	1417.31	C	Professor	s	+1	1	Oh , another thing you want is some information abou I think , about the time of day .
Bed002.C.dialogueact420	1417.61	1419.49	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Now , they may wanna call that part of context .
Bed002.B.dialogueact422	1420.1	1420.72	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.C.dialogueact421	1419.84	1421.3	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But the time of day matters a lot .
Bed002.C.dialogueact423	1422.43	1427.88	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	And , if things are obviously closed , then , you {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact424	1427.74	1428.7	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	People won't want to enter it .
Bed002.C.dialogueact425	1428.46	1429.94	C	Professor	s^m^na	-1	0	Pe - people don't wanna enter them .
Bed002.C.dialogueact426	1430.5	1440.84	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And , if it 's not obvious , you may want to actually uh , point out to people that it 's closed {disfmarker} you know , what they 're g going to is closed and they don't have the option of entering it .
Bed002.B.dialogueact427	1431.66	1432.24	B	Grad	%--	-1	0	s b
Bed002.C.dialogueact428	1442.0	1451.95	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So another thing that can come up , and will come up as soon as you get serious about this is , that another option of course is to have a {disfmarker} more of a dialogue .
Bed002.C.dialogueact429	1452.76	1454.37	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So if someone says something you could ask them .
Bed002.E.dialogueact430	1454.88	1455.14	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.C.dialogueact431	1455.39	1455.67	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.C.dialogueact432	1456.1	1458.64	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} Now , one thing you could do is always ask them ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact433	1458.64	1459.39	C	Professor	s^bd^df	-1	0	but that 's boring .
Bed002.C.dialogueact434	1460.09	1463.29	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And it also w it also be a pain for the person using it .
Bed002.C.dialogueact435	1463.62	1468.34	C	Professor	s	+1	1	So one thing you could do is build a little system that , said , " whenever you got a question like that I 've got one of three answers .
Bed002.C.dialogueact436	1468.34	1469.45	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Ask them which one you want . "
Bed002.C.dialogueact437	1470.81	1471.02	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.C.dialogueact438	1471.23	1474.49	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But that 's , um , not what we 're gonna do .
Bed002.B.dialogueact439	1474.81	1478.31	B	Grad	s	-1	0	But maybe that 's a false state of the system , that it 's too close to call .
Bed002.C.dialogueact440	1478.56	1478.87	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Oh yeah .
Bed002.C.dialogueact441	1479.11	1482.06	C	Professor	s	+1	0	You want the {disfmarker} you want the ability to a You want the ability to ask ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact442	1482.06	1486.5	C	Professor	s	+1	0	but what you don't wanna do is onl build a system that always asks every time ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact443	1486.5	1487.13	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and i
Bed002.C.dialogueact444	1487.42	1489.23	C	Professor	s^df	+1	0	That 's not getting at the scientific problem ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact446	1489.31	1489.8	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.C.dialogueact445	1489.23	1490.23	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and it 's {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact447	1490.58	1494.06	C	Professor	s	-1	0	In general you 're {disfmarker} you know , it 's gonna be much more complex than that .
Bed002.C.dialogueact448	1494.6	1497.52	C	Professor	s	-1	0	a This is purposely a really simple case .
Bed002.B.dialogueact449	1497.78	1497.95	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.C.dialogueact450	1498.04	1499.68	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So , uh {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact451	1499.68	1499.89	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.B.dialogueact452	1500.18	1502.32	B	Grad	s^tc	-1	0	I have one more point to {disfmarker} to Bhaskara 's question .
Bed002.B.dialogueact453	1502.76	1512.18	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Um , I think also the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the deep understanding part of it is {disfmarker} is going to be in there to the extent that we um , want it in terms of our modeling .
Bed002.B.dialogueact454	1512.18	1515.42	B	Grad	s	-1	0	We can start , you know , basic from human beings ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact455	1515.42	1516.01	B	Grad	s	-1	0	model that ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact456	1516.01	1516.91	B	Grad	s	-1	0	its motions ,

Bed002.B.dialogueact458	1518.26	1519.61	B	Grad	s	-1	0	we can mem model all of that
Bed002.B.dialogueact459	1519.61	1525.12	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and then compose whatever inferences o we make out of these really conceptual primitives .
Bed002.B.dialogueact460	1525.52	1528.83	B	Grad	s	-1	0	That will be extremely deep in the {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in my understanding .
Bed002.C.dialogueact461	1527.88	1539.84	C	Professor	fg|qh	+1	0	Yeah . S so {disfmarker} so the way that might come up , if you wanna {disfmarker} Suppose you wanted to do that , you might say , " Um , as an intermediate step in your belief - net , is there a Source - Path - Goal schema involved ? "
Bed002.C.dialogueact462	1540.57	1540.92	C	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	OK ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact463	1541.21	1546.0	C	Professor	qh	+1	0	And if so , uh , is there a focus on the goal ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact464	1546.48	1547.86	C	Professor	qh	-1	0	Or is there a focus on the path ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact465	1547.86	1548.35	C	Professor	s	-1	0	or something .
Bed002.C.dialogueact466	1548.72	1555.23	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And that could be , uh , one of the conditiona
Bed002.C.dialogueact467	1555.23	1559.51	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you know , th the {disfmarker} In some piece of the belief - net , that could be the {disfmarker} the appropriate thing to enter .
Bed002.F.dialogueact468	1560.14	1561.98	F	Grad	qw	-1	0	So , where would we extract that information from ?
Bed002.F.dialogueact469	1561.98	1562.68	F	Grad	s^bu^e^rt	-1	0	From the M - three - L ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact470	1563.31	1563.97	C	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bed002.C.dialogueact471	1564.41	1565.89	C	Professor	s^ar^r|s^df.%--	-1	0	No . See , the M - three - L is not gonna give th
Bed002.C.dialogueact472	1565.89	1568.88	C	Professor	s	+1	1	What he was saying is , the M - three - L does not have any of that .
Bed002.C.dialogueact473	1569.11	1573.66	C	Professor	s:s	-1	0	All it has is some really crude stuff saying , " A person wants to go to a place . "
Bed002.F.dialogueact474	1569.19	1569.48	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.E.dialogueact475	1573.85	1575.94	E	Grad	s^bu	+1	0	The M - three - L is the old SmartKom output ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact476	1576.19	1576.4	C	Professor	s^aa	+1	0	Right .
Bed002.C.dialogueact478	1576.88	1580.27	C	Professor	s	-1	0	M - three well , M - three - L itself refers to Multimedia Mark - up Language .
Bed002.E.dialogueact477	1576.46	1576.65	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.E.dialogueact479	1578.6	1579.54	E	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's just a language .
Bed002.E.dialogueact480	1579.54	1580.09	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right , yeah .
Bed002.C.dialogueact481	1580.45	1586.19	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	So we have th w we we we have to have a better w way of referring to {disfmarker}

Bed002.C.dialogueact483	1586.75	1586.91	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .

Bed002.C.dialogueact489	1592.0	1592.58	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.B.dialogueact490	1592.7	1595.52	B	Grad	s	-1	0	o th No , actually , intention lattices is what we 're gonna get .
Bed002.C.dialogueact491	1595.08	1596.71	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Is - i but they c they call it intention lattice ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact492	1596.71	1598.19	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	but tha

Bed002.C.dialogueact494	1598.25	1598.55	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	Anyway .
Bed002.B.dialogueact495	1599.5	1601.05	B	Grad	s	-1	0	They call it intention hypotheses .
Bed002.C.dialogueact496	1601.28	1601.48	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.C.dialogueact497	1601.99	1609.17	C	Professor	s	+1	1	So , th they 're gonna give us some cr uh {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} We can assume that y you get this crude information .
Bed002.C.dialogueact498	1610.41	1611.03	C	Professor	s^e	+1	0	About intention ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact499	1611.03	1613.57	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and that 's all they 're going to provide .
Bed002.C.dialogueact500	1614.72	1616.71	C	Professor	s	+1	0	And they don't give you the kind of object ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact501	1616.71	1619.46	C	Professor	s	-1	0	they don't give you any discourse history ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact502	1619.46	1621.55	C	Professor	s	-1	0	if you want to keep that you have to keep it somewhere else .
Bed002.B.dialogueact503	1624.18	1624.74	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , they keep it .
Bed002.B.dialogueact504	1624.74	1625.82	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	We have to request it .
Bed002.C.dialogueact505	1626.67	1626.9	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.B.dialogueact506	1627.21	1627.39	B	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Nuh ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact507	1627.63	1628.54	B	Grad	s	-1	0	But it 's not in there .
Bed002.C.dialogueact508	1627.76	1629.97	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , they {disfmarker} they kee they keep it by their lights .
Bed002.B.dialogueact510	1630.11	1631.19	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed002.C.dialogueact509	1629.97	1633.32	C	Professor	s	-1	0	It may {disfmarker} it may or may not be what {disfmarker} what we want .
Bed002.B.dialogueact511	1631.95	1632.37	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	Yeah , or i
Bed002.C.dialogueact512	1633.32	1633.44	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.E.dialogueact513	1634.66	1645.88	E	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	So , if someone says , " I wanna touch the side of the Powder - Tower " , that would {disfmarker} basically , we need to pop up Tango mode and the {disfmarker} and the directions ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact514	1645.39	1647.59	C	Professor	s^na|s^aa	-1	0	If i if {disfmarker} Yeah , if it got as simple as that , yeah .
Bed002.E.dialogueact515	1647.55	1647.89	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.C.dialogueact516	1648.08	1648.55	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	But it wouldn't .
Bed002.E.dialogueact517	1648.71	1649.0	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.E.dialogueact518	1651.3	1652.46	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	But that doesn't necessarily {disfmarker}
Bed002.E.dialogueact519	1653.62	1659.1	E	Grad	s^bu|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	But we 'd have to infer a Source - Path - Goal to some degree for touching the side , right ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact520	1659.53	1664.41	B	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Well {disfmarker} Uh , th the there is a p a point there if I understand you . Correct ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact521	1664.95	1665.51	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact522	1666.7	1671.92	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because um , sometimes people just say things {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact523	1672.33	1673.79	B	Grad	s	-1	0	This you find very often .

Bed002.E.dialogueact530	1688.52	1689.8	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	And the parser would output {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact531	1691.06	1693.48	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , that 's a {disfmarker} a question mark .

Bed002.B.dialogueact535	1698.74	1701.59	B	Grad	s	+1	2	That 's way beyond their scope , is {disfmarker} of interpreting that .

Bed002.B.dialogueact537	1702.49	1703.12	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	But um ,

Bed002.B.dialogueact542	1715.62	1715.93	B	Grad	s^f^rt	-1	0	you know ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact543	1716.08	1717.72	B	Grad	s	-1	0	somebody else has to do that job later .
Bed002.C.dialogueact545	1718.14	1718.54	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.E.dialogueact544	1718.04	1720.3	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I 'm just trying to figure out what the SmartKom system would output ,
Bed002.E.dialogueact546	1720.94	1722.21	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	depending on these things .
Bed002.B.dialogueact547	1723.2	1725.7	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Um , it will probably tell you how far away it is ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact548	1725.7	1727.63	B	Grad	s	-1	0	at least that 's {disfmarker} That 's even what Deep Map does .
Bed002.B.dialogueact549	1727.63	1729.02	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	It tells you how far away it is ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact550	1729.02	1730.78	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and shows it to you on a map .
Bed002.B.dialogueact551	1733.5	1740.92	B	Grad	s^df	+1	1	Because i we can not differentiate , at the moment , between , you know , the intention of wanting to go there or the intention of just know wanting to know where {disfmarker} where it is .
Bed002.D.dialogueact552	1742.9	1745.13	D	Grad	s|qy^d^g	-1	0	People no might not be able to infer that either , right ?
Bed002.D.dialogueact553	1745.13	1751.22	D	Grad	s:qw	-1	0	Like the fact {disfmarker} Like , I could imagine if someone came up to me and asked , " Where 's the city hall ? " , I might say , g ar " Are you trying to get there ? "
Bed002.D.dialogueact554	1751.22	1761.77	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Because how I describe um , t its location {disfmarker} uh , p probably depend on whether I think I should give them , you know , directions now , or say , you know , whatever , " It 's half a mile away " or something like that .
Bed002.B.dialogueact555	1754.8	1755.16	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .

Bed002.D.dialogueact566	1771.03	1771.31	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.D.dialogueact568	1774.37	1774.63	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.B.dialogueact569	1775.29	1778.93	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So th They have done some interesting experiments on that in Hamburg as well .
Bed002.D.dialogueact570	1777.56	1777.78	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.B.dialogueact572	1778.93	1779.24	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bed002.D.dialogueact571	1778.57	1778.76	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.C.dialogueact573	1780.83	1781.17	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact574	1783.5	1785.36	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i Go {disfmarker} go back to the {disfmarker} the uh , th
Bed002.B.dialogueact576	1785.93	1788.67	B	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	So I w this is {disfmarker} " onto " is {disfmarker} is knowledge about buildings ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact575	1785.51	1786.02	C	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah , that slide .
Bed002.B.dialogueact577	1788.67	1789.85	B	Grad	s	-1	0	their opening times ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact578	1790.36	1795.0	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and then t coupled with time of day , um , this should {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact579	1795.0	1795.56	B	Grad	s^f	-1	0	You know .
Bed002.D.dialogueact580	1795.85	1800.01	D	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	So that context was like , um , their presumed purpose context ,
Bed002.D.dialogueact581	1800.01	1801.79	D	Grad	s	-1	0	i like business or travel ,
Bed002.D.dialogueact582	1801.98	1806.28	D	Grad	s^e	-1	0	as well as the utterance context , like , " I 'm now standing at this place at this time " .
Bed002.C.dialogueact583	1805.55	1812.36	C	Professor	fg|s	+1	0	Yeah , well I think we ought to d a As we have all along , d We {disfmarker} we 've been distu distinguishing between situational context ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact584	1812.36	1813.66	C	Professor	s	+1	0	which is what you have as context ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact585	1813.92	1815.15	C	Professor	s	+1	0	and discourse context ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact586	1814.91	1816.29	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.C.dialogueact587	1815.15	1816.07	C	Professor	s	-1	0	which you have as DH ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact589	1816.4	1816.63	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Nuh .
Bed002.C.dialogueact588	1816.07	1817.13	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I don't know what the H means .

Bed002.B.dialogueact594	1819.5	1819.81	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.C.dialogueact592	1819.1	1819.44	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.C.dialogueact593	1819.44	1819.79	C	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	Whatever .
Bed002.C.dialogueact595	1820.25	1822.08	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	So we can work out terminology later .
Bed002.B.dialogueact596	1821.91	1822.12	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yep .
Bed002.C.dialogueact597	1822.4	1824.0	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So , they 're {disfmarker} they 're quite distinct .
Bed002.C.dialogueact598	1825.2	1825.93	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	I mean , you need them both ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact599	1825.93	1826.92	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but they 're quite distinct .
Bed002.C.dialogueact600	1827.51	1835.87	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And , so what we were talking about doing , a a as a first shot , is not doing any of the linguistics .
Bed002.C.dialogueact601	1838.17	1842.31	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Except to find out what seems to be {pause} useful .
Bed002.C.dialogueact602	1842.91	1848.04	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the reason the belief - net is in blue , is the notion would be {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact603	1848.15	1850.29	C	Professor	s^bd^df	-1	0	Uh , this may be a bad dis bad idea ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact604	1850.29	1861.27	C	Professor	s^rt	+1	1	but the idea is to take as a first goal , see if we could actually build a belief - net that would make this three way distinction uh , in a plausible way ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact605	1861.27	1861.88	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	given
Bed002.C.dialogueact606	1862.33	1864.18	C	Professor	s	+1	2	these {disfmarker} We have all these transcripts
Bed002.C.dialogueact607	1864.28	1870.79	C	Professor	s	+1	1	and we 're able to , by hand , extract the features to put in the belief - net .
Bed002.C.dialogueact608	1870.79	1871.57	C	Professor	s:s^bk	-1	0	Saying , " Aha !
Bed002.C.dialogueact609	1871.57	1881.85	C	Professor	s^e:s	+1	1	here 're the things which , if you get them out of {disfmarker} out of the language and discourse , and put them into the belief - net , it would tell you which of these three uh , intentions is most likely . "
Bed002.C.dialogueact610	1883.13	1892.38	C	Professor	s	+1	0	And if {disfmarker} to actually do that , build it , um {disfmarker} you know , run it {disfmarker} y y run it on the data where you hand - transcribe the parameters .
Bed002.C.dialogueact611	1892.92	1894.05	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And see how that goes .
Bed002.C.dialogueact612	1894.63	1900.85	C	Professor	s	+1	3	If that goes well , then we can start worrying about how we would extract them .
Bed002.C.dialogueact613	1901.24	1903.0	C	Professor	qh	-1	0	So {disfmarker} where would you get this information ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact614	1903.62	1906.98	C	Professor	s	+1	0	And , expand it to {disfmarker} to other things like this .
Bed002.C.dialogueact615	1907.8	1912.14	C	Professor	s	+1	1	But if we can't do that , then we 're in trouble .
Bed002.C.dialogueact616	1912.76	1915.19	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean th th i i if you can't do this task ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact617	1916.23	1917.63	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact618	1918.21	1919.48	B	Grad	s^2^cs	-1	0	We need a different , uh , engine .
Bed002.B.dialogueact620	1919.84	1920.49	B	Grad	s^bsc	-1	0	Machine , I mean .
Bed002.C.dialogueact619	1919.56	1920.49	C	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	Uh , uh , yeah , or something .
Bed002.C.dialogueact621	1920.49	1925.75	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Well it {disfmarker} i I if it {disfmarker} if it 's the belief - nets , we we 'll switch to you know , logic or some terrible thing ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact622	1925.75	1927.57	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but I don't think that 's gonna be the case .
Bed002.C.dialogueact623	1927.57	1937.42	C	Professor	s	+1	1	I think that , uh , if we can get the information , a belief - net is a perfectly good way of doing the inferential combination of it .
Bed002.C.dialogueact624	1939.4	1943.83	C	Professor	qh	+1	1	The real issue is , do what are the factors involved in determining this ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact625	1946.25	1946.78	C	Professor	s^no^rt	-1	0	And I don't know .
Bed002.B.dialogueact626	1948.85	1949.44	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed002.B.dialogueact627	1951.23	1952.99	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	But , only w

Bed002.C.dialogueact630	1953.84	1954.28	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So , I know .
Bed002.C.dialogueact631	1954.28	1956.89	C	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Uh , uh , is it clear what 's going on here ?
Bed002.F.dialogueact632	1960.54	1960.69	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bed002.D.dialogueact633	1965.5	1966.4	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Um , I missed the beginning ,

Bed002.D.dialogueact635	1967.73	1968.04	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	I guess {disfmarker}
Bed002.D.dialogueact636	1968.4	1969.45	D	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	could you back to the slide ,

Bed002.D.dialogueact638	1970.89	1972.63	D	Grad	qy^bu.%--	-1	0	So , is it that it 's , um {disfmarker}
Bed002.D.dialogueact639	1974.89	1979.88	D	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	These are all factors that uh , a These are the ones that you said that we are going to ignore now ?
Bed002.D.dialogueact640	1979.88	1982.17	D	Grad	qrr	-1	0	or that we want to {vocalsound} take into account ?
Bed002.D.dialogueact641	1982.17	1983.6	D	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	You were saying n
Bed002.C.dialogueact642	1983.48	1984.21	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Take them into account .

Bed002.D.dialogueact643	1984.2	1985.57	D	Grad	s	-1	0	Take the {disfmarker} the linguistic factors too .
Bed002.D.dialogueact645	1985.94	1987.4	D	Grad	s^bk|s^2	-1	0	Oh , how to extract these features .
Bed002.C.dialogueact646	1986.86	1987.65	C	Professor	s^m^na	-1	0	how to extract them .
Bed002.C.dialogueact648	1987.85	1989.78	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So , f let 's find out which ones we need first ,
Bed002.D.dialogueact647	1987.45	1987.68	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.D.dialogueact649	1988.6	1988.91	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Got it .
Bed002.C.dialogueact652	1991.58	1991.79	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	and {disfmarker}

Bed002.C.dialogueact659	1998.16	2000.58	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Let 's go back to th Let 's go back to the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the slide of data .

Bed002.B.dialogueact661	2001.94	2002.19	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bed002.D.dialogueact660	2001.87	2004.15	D	Grad	qy.%--	-1	0	Like do we know from the data wh which {disfmarker}
Bed002.D.dialogueact662	2004.29	2004.71	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.D.dialogueact663	2004.71	2005.03	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact664	2005.23	2006.29	B	Grad	s^nd	+1	1	Not from that data .
Bed002.B.dialogueact665	2006.87	2015.93	B	Grad	s	+1	2	But , um , since we are designing a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} an , compared to this , even bigger data collection effort , {comment} um , we will definitely take care to put it in there ,
Bed002.D.dialogueact666	2008.92	2009.03	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .

Bed002.C.dialogueact670	2017.6	2017.76	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.B.dialogueact671	2019.22	2023.48	B	Grad	s	-1	0	to see whether we can , then , get sort of empirically validated data .
Bed002.D.dialogueact672	2019.33	2019.66	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.B.dialogueact673	2024.07	2026.49	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	Um , from this , we can sometimes , you know {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact674	2026.49	2029.55	B	Grad	qh^df	-1	0	an and that 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} but that {disfmarker} isn't that what we need for a belief - net anyhow ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact675	2029.55	2029.91	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	is sort of {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact676	2030.46	2034.14	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	s sometimes when people want to just see it , they phrase it more like this ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact678	2034.28	2038.03	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	But it doesn't exclude anybody from phrasing it totally differently , even if they still {disfmarker}
Bed002.D.dialogueact677	2034.21	2034.53	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.D.dialogueact679	2036.9	2037.17	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.B.dialogueact681	2038.09	2038.27	B	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	you know ?
Bed002.D.dialogueact680	2037.82	2038.09	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.B.dialogueact682	2038.76	2041.9	B	Grad	s	-1	0	But then other factors may come into play that change the outcome of their belief - net .
Bed002.B.dialogueact684	2042.74	2044.63	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So , um , this is exactly what {disfmarker}
Bed002.D.dialogueact683	2042.36	2042.55	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.B.dialogueact685	2044.63	2046.22	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Because y you can never be sure .
Bed002.B.dialogueact686	2046.22	2055.71	B	Grad	s:s	+1	0	And I 'm sure even i the most , sort of , deliberate data collection experiment will never give you data that say , " Well , if it 's phrased like that , the intention is this . "
Bed002.D.dialogueact687	2047.44	2047.72	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Sure .
Bed002.B.dialogueact688	2055.71	2056.96	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	You know , because then , uh , you {disfmarker}

Bed002.D.dialogueact691	2061.41	2064.01	D	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	Where you have {disfmarker} where your , uh , current goal is to {disfmarker}

Bed002.D.dialogueact696	2065.17	2065.84	D	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	So that 's what you want ?

Bed002.D.dialogueact699	2066.07	2066.86	D	Grad	s	-1	0	So you will know .

Bed002.D.dialogueact704	2071.78	2076.3	D	Grad	s	-1	0	I guess , it 's just knowing the intention from the experimental subject .

Bed002.C.dialogueact712	2088.09	2094.68	C	Professor	s	-1	0	except that we may want to push that effort to get information we need .
Bed002.C.dialogueact713	2095.1	2098.62	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So our job {vocalsound} is to figure out how to solve these problems .
Bed002.C.dialogueact714	2099.17	2107.76	C	Professor	s	-1	0	If it turns out that we need data of a certain sort , then the sort of data collection branch can be , uh , asked to do that .
Bed002.C.dialogueact715	2108.62	2117.49	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And one of the reasons why we 're recording the meeting for these guys is cuz we want their help when we d we start doing uh , recording of subjects .
Bed002.C.dialogueact716	2119.69	2120.82	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	So , yeah {disfmarker} y you 're absolutely right , though .
Bed002.C.dialogueact717	2120.82	2121.98	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	No , you {disfmarker} you will not have ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact718	2121.98	2123.21	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and there it is ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact719	2123.21	2124.14	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	and , uh {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact720	2125.99	2127.12	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But you know , y y
Bed002.C.dialogueact721	2127.12	2127.97	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	the , um {disfmarker}
Bed002.D.dialogueact722	2134.9	2137.99	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	And I think the other concern that has come up before , too , is if it 's {disfmarker}
Bed002.D.dialogueact723	2138.72	2139.16	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bed002.D.dialogueact724	2139.55	2142.85	D	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I don't know if this was collected {disfmarker} what situation this data was collected in .
Bed002.D.dialogueact725	2142.85	2144.75	D	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Was it {disfmarker} is it the one that you showed in your talk ?
Bed002.D.dialogueact726	2145.29	2145.78	D	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	Like people {disfmarker}

Bed002.D.dialogueact728	2146.37	2146.52	D	Grad	%--	-1	0	But
Bed002.D.dialogueact730	2146.52	2146.82	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.D.dialogueact731	2146.96	2152.6	D	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	So was this , like , someone actually mobile , like {disfmarker} s using a device ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact732	2153.2	2153.64	B	Grad	h	-1	0	Uh ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact733	2154.31	2155.55	B	Grad	s^ar|%--	-1	0	N no , no not {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact734	2155.69	2156.67	B	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	i it was mobile
Bed002.B.dialogueact735	2156.67	2159.06	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but not {disfmarker} not with a w a real wizard system .
Bed002.B.dialogueact736	2159.06	2160.41	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So there were never answers .
Bed002.D.dialogueact737	2159.57	2160.04	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bed002.D.dialogueact738	2160.94	2161.99	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK . OK .
Bed002.D.dialogueact739	2162.15	2162.77	D	Grad	qy.%--	-1	0	But , is it {disfmarker}
Bed002.D.dialogueact740	2163.14	2166.54	D	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I guess I don't know {disfmarker} The situation of {disfmarker} of collecting th the data
Bed002.D.dialogueact741	2166.54	2170.72	D	Grad	s^e	-1	0	of , like {disfmarker} Here you could imagine them being {disfmarker} walking around the city . as like one situation .
Bed002.D.dialogueact742	2170.72	2177.59	D	Grad	s	-1	0	And then you have all sorts of other c situational context factors that would influence w how to interpret , like you said , the scope and things like that .
Bed002.B.dialogueact743	2176.24	2176.86	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.D.dialogueact744	2178.23	2179.47	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	If they 're doing it in a {disfmarker}
Bed002.D.dialogueact745	2179.57	2181.7	D	Grad	s	-1	0	you know , " I 'm sitting here with a map and asking questions " ,
Bed002.D.dialogueact746	2181.94	2183.94	D	Grad	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I would imagine that the data would be really different .
Bed002.D.dialogueact747	2184.58	2185.9	D	Grad	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Um , so it 's just {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact748	2187.01	2187.27	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.B.dialogueact749	2188.47	2194.4	B	Grad	s^df	+1	1	But {disfmarker} It was never th th the goal of that data collection to {disfmarker} to serve for sat for such a purpose .
Bed002.B.dialogueact750	2194.4	2198.53	B	Grad	s	+1	1	So that 's why for example the tasks were not differentiated by intentionality ,
Bed002.D.dialogueact751	2195.01	2195.49	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.B.dialogueact752	2198.53	2200.08	B	Grad	s	-1	0	there was n there was no label ,
Bed002.D.dialogueact753	2199.61	2199.96	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.B.dialogueact755	2200.17	2202.32	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	you know , intention A , intention B , intention C .
Bed002.D.dialogueact754	2199.96	2200.19	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.B.dialogueact756	2202.6	2203.69	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	Or task A , B , C .
Bed002.B.dialogueact757	2204.18	2204.66	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um
Bed002.B.dialogueact758	2206.27	2208.57	B	Grad	s	+1	0	I 'm sure we can produce some if we need it ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact760	2208.83	2211.48	B	Grad	s	+1	0	um , that {disfmarker} that will help us along those lines .
Bed002.D.dialogueact759	2208.61	2209.28	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.B.dialogueact761	2211.53	2214.75	B	Grad	s	-1	0	But , you know , you gotta leave something for other people to model .
Bed002.B.dialogueact762	2214.95	2224.28	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So , to {disfmarker} Finding out what , you know , situational con what the contextual factors of the situation really are , you know is an interesting s interesting thing .
Bed002.D.dialogueact763	2215.93	2216.46	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.D.dialogueact764	2224.74	2225.3	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.B.dialogueact765	2226.24	2235.18	B	Grad	s	+1	1	u u Sort of I 'm , at the moment , curious and I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} s w want to approach it from the end where we can s sort of start with this toy system that we can play around with ,
Bed002.D.dialogueact766	2234.58	2234.91	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.B.dialogueact767	2235.74	2239.56	B	Grad	s	+1	0	so that we get a clearer notion of what input we need for that ,
Bed002.D.dialogueact768	2238.59	2238.98	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.B.dialogueact769	2240.06	2241.41	B	Grad	s	-1	0	what suffices and what doesn't .
Bed002.B.dialogueact770	2241.83	2244.93	B	Grad	s	+1	1	And then we can start worrying about where to get this input ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact771	2244.93	2247.23	B	Grad	qh	-1	0	what {disfmarker} what do we need , you know {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact772	2247.65	2253.62	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	Ultimately once we are all experts in changing that parser , for example , maybe , there 's just a couple three things we need to do
Bed002.B.dialogueact773	2253.62	2259.9	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and then we get more whatever , part of speech and more construction - type - like stuff out of it .
Bed002.D.dialogueact774	2254.14	2254.66	D	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.D.dialogueact775	2258.05	2258.86	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed002.B.dialogueact776	2262.2	2264.82	B	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's a m pragmatic approach , uh , at the moment .
Bed002.E.dialogueact777	2266.55	2267.98	E	Grad	qw	+1	0	How exactly does the data collection work ?
Bed002.E.dialogueact778	2268.17	2269.02	E	Grad	qy^e	-1	0	Do they have a map ,
Bed002.E.dialogueact779	2269.02	2271.35	E	Grad	s^bu^e	-1	0	and then you give them a scenario of some sort ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact780	2272.62	2272.91	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.B.dialogueact781	2274.11	2275.41	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Imagine you 're the {disfmarker} the subject .
Bed002.B.dialogueact782	2275.41	2276.2	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	You 're gonna be in here ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact783	2276.92	2277.51	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and somebody {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact784	2277.54	2287.1	B	Grad	s	+1	0	And {disfmarker} and you see , uh , either th the three - D model , or uh , a QuickTime animation of standing u in a square in Heidelberg .
Bed002.B.dialogueact785	2287.55	2288.59	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So you actually see that .
Bed002.B.dialogueact786	2289.43	2291.39	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um . The uh ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact787	2291.9	2295.12	B	Grad	s	-1	0	um , first thing is you have to read a text about Heidelberg .
Bed002.B.dialogueact788	2295.51	2303.6	B	Grad	s	+1	0	So , just off a textbook , uh , tourist guide , to familiarize , uh , yourself with that sort of odd - sounding German street names , like Fischergasse and so forth .
Bed002.B.dialogueact789	2304.31	2305.42	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So that 's part one .
Bed002.B.dialogueact790	2305.42	2312.98	B	Grad	s	+1	0	Part two is , you 're told that this huge new , wonderful computer system exists , that can y tell you everything you want to know ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact791	2313.82	2315.09	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and it understands you completely .
Bed002.B.dialogueact792	2315.76	2316.91	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And so you 're gonna pick up that phone ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact793	2316.91	2317.5	B	Grad	s	-1	0	dial a number ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact794	2317.5	2320.0	B	Grad	s	+1	0	and you get a certain amount of tasks that you have to solve .
Bed002.B.dialogueact795	2320.48	2323.35	B	Grad	s	+1	0	First you have to know {disfmarker} find out how to get to that place ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact796	2323.54	2326.45	B	Grad	s	-1	0	maybe with the intention of buying stamps in there .
Bed002.B.dialogueact797	2326.96	2331.08	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Maybe {disfmarker} So , the next task is to get to a certain place and take a picture for your grandchild .
Bed002.B.dialogueact798	2331.99	2335.79	B	Grad	s	-1	0	The third one is to get information on the history of an object .
Bed002.B.dialogueact799	2336.76	2337.34	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	The fourth one {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact800	2337.45	2339.09	B	Grad	s	+1	0	And then the g system breaks down .
Bed002.B.dialogueact801	2340.37	2340.89	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	It crashes ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact803	2341.93	2342.19	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bed002.D.dialogueact802	2341.56	2342.43	D	Grad	qy^bu^d	-1	0	a At the third ?
Bed002.D.dialogueact804	2342.53	2342.98	D	Grad	s^e	-1	0	Right then ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact805	2343.16	2344.64	B	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	After the third task .
Bed002.D.dialogueact806	2343.5	2343.89	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.B.dialogueact807	2345.16	2345.62	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	And then {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact808	2346.08	2346.78	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Or after the fourth .
Bed002.B.dialogueact809	2346.78	2348.34	B	Grad	s^co	-1	0	Some find {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} Forget that for now .
Bed002.B.dialogueact810	2348.69	2353.48	B	Grad	s^rt	+1	0	And then , a human operator comes on , and {disfmarker} and exp apologizes that the system has crashed ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact811	2353.93	2356.05	B	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	but , you know , urges you to continue , you know ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact812	2356.64	2357.81	B	Grad	s	-1	0	now with a human operator .
Bed002.B.dialogueact813	2358.25	2361.16	B	Grad	s	+1	0	And so , you have basically the same tasks again ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact814	2361.16	2362.48	B	Grad	s	+1	0	just with different objects ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact815	2363.19	2364.01	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and you go through it again ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact816	2364.01	2364.54	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and that was it .
Bed002.B.dialogueact817	2366.19	2368.19	B	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Oh , and one {disfmarker} one little bit {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact818	2368.64	2374.33	B	Grad	s	-1	0	w And uh , the computer you are {disfmarker} you are being told the computer system knows exactly where you are , via GPS .
Bed002.B.dialogueact819	2374.82	2379.45	B	Grad	s	-1	0	When the human operator comes on , um , that person does not know .
Bed002.B.dialogueact820	2379.5	2381.18	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	So the GPS is crashed as well .
Bed002.B.dialogueact821	2381.79	2383.56	B	Grad	s:qw	-1	0	So the person first has to ask you " Where are you ? " .
Bed002.B.dialogueact822	2384.56	2389.27	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And so you have to do some {disfmarker} s tell the person sort of where you are , depending on what you see there .
Bed002.B.dialogueact823	2389.96	2393.61	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	Um , this is a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a bit that I d I don't think we {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact824	2393.61	2394.67	B	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Did we discuss that bit ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact825	2395.17	2396.96	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Uh , I just sort of squeezed that in now .
Bed002.B.dialogueact826	2397.32	2401.15	B	Grad	s	-1	0	But it 's something , uh , that would provide some very interesting data for some people I know .

Bed002.D.dialogueact828	2403.71	2410.21	D	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	So , in the display you can {disfmarker} Oh , you said that you cou you might have a display that shows , like , the {disfmarker}

Bed002.B.dialogueact830	2410.07	2412.87	B	Grad	s	-1	0	a Additionally , y you have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a sort of a map type display .

Bed002.B.dialogueact852	2432.68	2434.66	B	Grad	s	-1	0	We can show it walks to , you know .
Bed002.B.dialogueact853	2434.66	2436.28	B	Grad	s	-1	0	We can have movies of walking ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact854	2436.28	2439.44	B	Grad	s	-1	0	you walking through {disfmarker} through Heidelberg , and u ultimately arriving there .

Bed002.B.dialogueact856	2439.87	2440.87	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Maybe we wanna do that .
Bed002.B.dialogueact857	2441.01	2441.07	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.D.dialogueact858	2442.01	2445.56	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Uh , I was just trying to figure out how {disfmarker} how ambitious the system is .
Bed002.B.dialogueact859	2444.38	2445.9	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	The map was sort of intended to {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact860	2446.79	2448.52	B	Grad	s	-1	0	You want to go to that place .
Bed002.B.dialogueact862	2448.75	2449.87	B	Grad	s	-1	0	You know , and it 's sort of there .
Bed002.D.dialogueact861	2448.44	2448.79	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.B.dialogueact863	2449.99	2451.63	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	And you see the label of the name {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact864	2452.11	2454.8	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So we get those names , pronunciation stuff , and so forth ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact866	2454.8	2455.72	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and we can change that .
Bed002.D.dialogueact865	2454.43	2455.07	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .

Bed002.D.dialogueact870	2465.36	2467.25	D	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	So , do you have to respond ?
Bed002.D.dialogueact871	2467.25	2467.85	D	Grad	qrr.%--	-1	0	or does your {disfmarker}
Bed002.D.dialogueact872	2468.09	2470.57	D	Grad	qw	-1	0	Uh , what are you ste what are you supposed to be telling the system ?
Bed002.D.dialogueact873	2471.08	2471.3	D	Grad	%--	-1	0	Like , w
Bed002.D.dialogueact874	2472.61	2473.69	D	Grad	qh^bu^rt	-1	0	what you 're doing now ?

Bed002.D.dialogueact878	2476.63	2480.79	D	Grad	s^bk|s	+1	0	OK , so it 's just like , " Let 's figure out what they would say under the circumstances " .
Bed002.B.dialogueact879	2479.85	2481.57	B	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah , and {disfmarker} and we will record both sides .

Bed002.B.dialogueact883	2483.89	2487.71	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	I mean , in both cases it 's gonna be a human , in the computer , and in the operator case .
Bed002.D.dialogueact882	2483.69	2484.02	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bed002.B.dialogueact884	2488.32	2491.24	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And we will re there will be some dialogue , you know ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact885	2491.38	2492.92	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So , you first have to do this , and that ,

Bed002.B.dialogueact890	2496.13	2501.12	B	Grad	s	-1	0	We can ins instruct the , uh , wizard in how expressive and talkative he should be .
Bed002.B.dialogueact891	2501.81	2502.59	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	But um ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact892	2503.53	2506.36	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	maybe the {disfmarker} maybe what you 're suggesting {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact893	2506.36	2515.5	B	Grad	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	Is what you 're suggesting that it might be too poor , the data , if we sort of limit it to this ping pong one t uh , task results in a question and then there 's an answer and that 's the end of the task ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact894	2515.76	2518.02	B	Grad	s^bu^e	-1	0	You wanna m have it more {disfmarker} more steps , sort of ?

Bed002.C.dialogueact928	2571.35	2571.56	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.C.dialogueact929	2571.86	2576.91	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	So , anyway , she 's looking for some more part time work w while she 's waiting actually for graduate school .
Bed002.C.dialogueact930	2577.24	2577.97	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And she 'll be in touch .
Bed002.C.dialogueact931	2577.97	2581.85	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So we may have someone , uh , to do this ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact932	2582.0	2585.83	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and she 's got you know , some background in {disfmarker} in all this stuff .
Bed002.C.dialogueact933	2585.9	2587.19	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And is a linguist st
Bed002.C.dialogueact934	2587.19	2587.49	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	and , so
Bed002.C.dialogueact935	2587.86	2597.65	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	So . {vocalsound} That 's {disfmarker} So , Nancy , we 'll have an At some point we 'll have another discussion on exactly wha t t you know , how that 's gonna go .
Bed002.D.dialogueact936	2592.3	2592.86	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.C.dialogueact937	2598.32	2608.77	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And um , Jane , but also , uh , Liz have offered to help us do this , uh , data collection and design and stuff .
Bed002.D.dialogueact938	2604.27	2604.73	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.D.dialogueact939	2605.94	2606.79	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed002.C.dialogueact940	2609.68	2613.12	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So , when we get to that we 'll have some people doing it that know what they 're doing .
Bed002.D.dialogueact941	2609.99	2610.29	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.D.dialogueact942	2614.43	2626.23	D	Grad	s^df	+1	0	I guess the reason I was asking about the sort of the de the details of this kind of thing is that , um , it 's one thing to collect data for , I don't know , speech recognition or various other tasks that have pretty c clear correct answers ,
Bed002.D.dialogueact943	2626.23	2630.54	D	Grad	s	+1	0	but with intention {vocalsound} um , obviously , as you point out , there 's a lot of di other factors
Bed002.D.dialogueact944	2630.54	2639.59	D	Grad	s	+1	0	and {disfmarker} I 'm not really sure , um , how {disfmarker} how {disfmarker} e the question of how to make it a t appropriate toy version of that {disfmarker} Um , it 's ju it 's just hard .
Bed002.D.dialogueact945	2639.59	2641.18	D	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	So , I mean , obviously it 's a {disfmarker}
Bed002.E.dialogueact946	2640.24	2641.78	E	Grad	fg|s^na	-1	0	Yeah , uh , actually I guess that was my question .
Bed002.E.dialogueact947	2641.78	2644.52	E	Grad	qy	-1	0	Is the intention implicit in the scenario that 's given ?
Bed002.E.dialogueact948	2645.34	2647.88	E	Grad	qy.%-	-1	0	Like , do the {disfmarker}
Bed002.D.dialogueact949	2647.62	2649.77	D	Grad	s^na.%-	-1	0	It is , if they have these tasks that they 're supposed to {disfmarker}
Bed002.E.dialogueact950	2649.91	2652.86	E	Grad	s^aa|s^df^no	-1	0	Yeah , I just wasn't sure to what level of detail the task was .
Bed002.D.dialogueact951	2651.47	2652.46	D	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	to {disfmarker} to give {disfmarker}

Bed002.E.dialogueact958	2655.78	2656.08	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.C.dialogueact959	2656.44	2658.0	C	Professor	s	+1	1	So , we that 's part of what we 'll have to figure out .

Bed002.C.dialogueact962	2659.96	2661.33	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	But , uh ,

Bed002.C.dialogueact963	2662.04	2677.2	C	Professor	s^t^tc	+1	0	the {disfmarker} The problem that I was tr gonna try to focus on today was , let 's suppose by magic you could collect dialogues in which , one way or the other , you were able to , uh , figure out both the intention ,

Bed002.C.dialogueact968	2685.97	2690.51	C	Professor	qh	+1	3	The issue is , can we find a way to , basically , featurize it
Bed002.C.dialogueact969	2690.91	2706.28	C	Professor	s	+1	1	so that we get some discrete number of features so that , uh , when we know the values to all those features , or as many as possible , we can w come up with the best estimate of which of the , in this case three little intentions , are most likely .

Bed002.E.dialogueact992	2745.75	2747.38	E	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	See , I would have thought it was more of a waltz .
Bed002.B.dialogueact994	2749.03	2749.18	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	S
Bed002.B.dialogueact995	2749.18	2749.8	B	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	To " Waltz " it ?
Bed002.D.dialogueact996	2750.78	2752.38	D	Grad	s^aa|qh^e	-1	0	Yeah , like , how close are you gonna be ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact997	2752.41	2752.52	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	Well .
Bed002.D.dialogueact998	2752.57	2753.99	D	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Like , {vocalsound} Tango 's really close .
Bed002.E.dialogueact999	2752.66	2753.64	E	Grad	s^aa|s^df.%-	-1	0	Yeah , cuz a tango {disfmarker}
Bed002.E.dialogueact1000	2753.92	2754.1	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1001	2755.39	2755.96	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	Well , anyway .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1003	2756.18	2756.59	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bed002.F.dialogueact1002	2756.16	2756.39	F	Grad	%-	-1	0	All these
Bed002.F.dialogueact1004	2757.13	2761.97	F	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	So , like , the question is how what features can {disfmarker} like , do you wanna try to extract from , say , the parse or whatever ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact1005	2761.95	2762.2	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.F.dialogueact1006	2762.07	2767.89	F	Grad	s^e.%--	-1	0	Like , the presence of a word or the presence of a certain uh , stem , or {disfmarker} certain construction or whatever .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1007	2765.72	2766.1	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1008	2767.7	2769.79	C	Professor	qh	+1	0	Is there a construction , or the kind of object ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1009	2769.79	2777.52	C	Professor	s^e	+1	0	or w uh , anything else that 's in the si It 's either in the {disfmarker} in the s the discourse itself or in the context .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1010	2778.09	2785.71	C	Professor	s	+1	1	So if it turns out that , whatever it is , you want to know whether the person 's uh , a tourist or not , OK ? that becomes a feature .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1011	2785.85	2788.52	C	Professor	s	+1	0	Now , how you determine that is another issue .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1012	2788.52	2800.72	C	Professor	s:s	-1	0	But fo for the current problem , it would just be , " OK , if you can be sure that it 's a tourist , versus a businessman , versus a native , " or something , uh , that would give you a lot of discriminatory power
Bed002.C.dialogueact1013	2800.72	2803.07	C	Professor	s:s^fe	-1	0	and then just have a little section in your belief - net that said , " pppt ! "
Bed002.C.dialogueact1014	2803.54	2805.16	C	Professor	s	+1	0	Though sin f in the short run , you 'd set them ,
Bed002.F.dialogueact1015	2805.81	2806.41	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1016	2806.58	2808.11	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and see ho how it worked ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1017	2808.11	2818.03	C	Professor	s	+1	3	and then in the longer run , you would figure out how you could derive them . From previous discourse or w any anything else you knew .
Bed002.F.dialogueact1018	2815.3	2815.62	F	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.F.dialogueact1019	2829.61	2831.41	F	Grad	qw	-1	0	So , how should {disfmarker} What 's the uh , plan ?
Bed002.F.dialogueact1020	2831.45	2833.71	F	Grad	qw^e.%-	-1	0	Like , how should we go about figuring out these {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact1021	2832.91	2834.52	C	Professor	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	OK . So , first of all is ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1022	2834.63	2840.32	C	Professor	fh|qy	+1	0	uh , do e either of you guys , you got a favorite belief - net that you 've , you know , played with ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact1023	2840.32	2842.02	C	Professor	s^e	+1	1	JavaBayes or something ?
Bed002.F.dialogueact1024	2842.4	2842.61	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bed002.F.dialogueact1025	2844.24	2844.82	F	Grad	s^ar|s^nd	-1	0	No , not really .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1026	2845.52	2845.78	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1027	2845.93	2847.13	C	Professor	fg|s^co	-1	0	Well , anyway . f Get one .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1028	2847.82	2852.77	C	Professor	s^bk|s	+1	1	OK ? So {disfmarker} y so one of th one of the things we wanna do is actually , uh , pick a package ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1029	2853.23	2854.13	C	Professor	s	-1	0	doesn't matter which one ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1030	2854.77	2857.23	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh , presumably one that 's got good interactive abilities ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1031	2857.23	2858.7	C	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	cuz a lot of what we 're gonna be d
Bed002.C.dialogueact1032	2859.05	2863.58	C	Professor	s	+1	1	You know , we don't need the one that 'll solve massive , uh , belief - nets quickly .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1033	2863.58	2863.89	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	d w
Bed002.C.dialogueact1034	2863.96	2866.87	C	Professor	s	-1	0	These are not gonna get big in {disfmarker} in the foreseeable future .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1035	2867.25	2872.9	C	Professor	s	+1	1	But we do want one in which it 's easy to interact with and , uh , modify .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1036	2874.08	2880.7	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Because i that 's {disfmarker} A lot of what it 's gonna be , is , um , playing with this .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1037	2881.09	2887.41	C	Professor	s	+1	1	And probably one in which it 's easy to have , um , what amounts to transcript files .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1038	2887.53	2889.58	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So that if {disfmarker} if we have all these cases {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact1039	2890.47	2890.71	C	Professor	s^f	-1	0	OK ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact1040	2890.71	2892.89	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So we make up cases that have these features ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1041	2893.48	2896.61	C	Professor	s.%--:s	-1	0	OK , and then you 'd like to be able to say , " OK , here 's a bunch of cases " {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact1042	2896.84	2899.4	C	Professor	s	-1	0	There 're even ones tha that you can do learning
Bed002.C.dialogueact1043	2900.1	2902.63	C	Professor	s	-1	0	OK ? So you have all their cases and {disfmarker} and their results
Bed002.C.dialogueact1044	2902.63	2907.37	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and you have a {disfmarker} algorithms to go through and run around trying to set the {disfmarker} the probabilities for you .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1045	2908.23	2909.57	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1046	2910.25	2911.64	C	Professor	s	-1	0	probably that 's not worth it .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1047	2912.41	2919.14	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	I mean , my guess is we aren't gonna have enough data that 's good enough to make the {disfmarker} these data fitting ones worth it ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1048	2919.14	2919.62	C	Professor	s^df^no	-1	0	but I don't know .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1049	2920.26	2925.88	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So I would say you guy the first task for you two guys is to um , pick a package .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1050	2926.83	2928.56	C	Professor	s	-1	0	OK , and you wanna it s You know , the standard things
Bed002.C.dialogueact1051	2928.56	2929.71	C	Professor	s^e.%--	+1	1	you want it stable , you want it {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact1052	2929.71	2929.77	C	Professor	%	-1	0	yeah , @ @ .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1053	2931.36	2942.45	C	Professor	s	+1	1	And , as soon as we have one , we can start trying to , uh , make a first cut at what 's going on .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1054	2933.76	2934.66	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	An - Nuh .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1055	2942.84	2944.38	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But it {disfmarker} what I like about it is it 's very concrete .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1056	2944.68	2946.73	C	Professor	s	+1	1	OK ? We {disfmarker} we have a {disfmarker} we know what the outcomes are gonna be ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1057	2947.19	2949.75	C	Professor	s	+1	1	and we have some {disfmarker} some data that 's loose ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1058	2949.75	2951.08	C	Professor	s	+1	0	we can use our own intuition ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1059	2952.05	2954.15	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and see how hard it is ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1060	2954.66	2957.86	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and , importantly , what intermediate nodes we think we need .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1061	2958.45	2969.57	C	Professor	s	+1	0	So it {disfmarker} if it turns out that just , thinking about the problem , you come up with things you really need to {disfmarker} You know , this is the kind of thing that is , you know , an intermediate little piece in your belief - net . That 'd be really interesting .
Bed002.E.dialogueact1062	2969.65	2970.02	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1063	2972.93	2981.58	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And it {disfmarker} and it may serve as a platform for a person , maybe me , or whoever , who is interested in doing some linguistic analysis .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1064	2981.58	2984.79	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , w we have the For - FrameNet group here ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1065	2985.15	2988.58	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and we can see what they have found out about those concepts already ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1066	2989.21	2990.91	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	that are contained in the data ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1067	2991.65	2994.9	B	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um , you know , to come up with a nice little set of features
Bed002.B.dialogueact1068	2994.9	2998.49	B	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and um , maybe even means of s uh , extracting them .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1069	2999.1	3005.05	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and that altogether could also be {disfmarker} uh , become a nice paper that 's going to be published somewhere , if we sit down and write it .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1070	3006.01	3007.2	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	And um {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact1071	3007.77	3011.37	B	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	When you said JavaBayes belief - net you were talking about ones that run on coffee ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact1072	3011.37	3013.96	B	Grad	qrr	-1	0	or that are in the program language Java ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact1073	3013.13	3019.08	C	Professor	s^ar|s	-1	0	No , th It turns out that there is a , uh {disfmarker} The new end of Java libraries .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1074	3019.43	3021.22	C	Professor	s	-1	0	OK , and it turns out one called
Bed002.B.dialogueact1076	3021.4	3021.64	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1077	3021.72	3021.88	B	Grad	b	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1075	3021.38	3024.56	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Which is one that fair {disfmarker} people around here use a fair amount .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1078	3024.95	3026.35	C	Professor	s^no.%--	-1	0	I have no idea whether that 's {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact1079	3026.89	3027.44	C	Professor	%	-1	0	
Bed002.C.dialogueact1080	3027.48	3036.8	C	Professor	s	-1	0	The obvious advantage of that is that you can then , relatively easily , get all the other Java packages for GUIs or whatever else you might want to do .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1081	3035.68	3036.11	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1082	3037.12	3041.45	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So that i that 's I think why a lot of people doing research use that .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1083	3042.34	3043.12	C	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	But it may not be {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact1084	3043.12	3045.4	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I have no idea whether that 's the best choice
Bed002.C.dialogueact1085	3045.4	3052.86	C	Professor	s	+1	1	an and there 're plenty of people around , students in the department who , you know , live and breathe Bayes - nets .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1086	3053.01	3054.27	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So , uh ,
Bed002.D.dialogueact1087	3054.73	3057.92	D	Grad	s	-1	0	There 's the m tool kit that um , Kevin Murphy has developed ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1088	3057.46	3057.67	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1089	3058.37	3058.78	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	It 's OK .
Bed002.D.dialogueact1090	3058.4	3059.91	D	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	which might be useful too .
Bed002.F.dialogueact1091	3059.05	3059.32	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1092	3059.89	3063.01	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So , yeah , Kevin would be a good person to start with .
Bed002.D.dialogueact1093	3059.91	3061.78	D	Grad	s	-1	0	And it 's available Matlab code .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1094	3063.31	3064.03	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Nancy knows him well .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1095	3064.03	3065.82	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I don't know I don't know whether you guys have met Kevin yet or not ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1096	3065.75	3065.96	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1097	3065.93	3066.59	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	but , uh {disfmarker}
Bed002.F.dialogueact1098	3066.08	3066.55	F	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yeah , I know him .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1099	3066.99	3067.4	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	But i
Bed002.B.dialogueact1101	3067.4	3071.5	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	But since we all probably are pretty sure that , um , the {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact1100	3067.27	3067.4	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1102	3072.15	3077.63	B	Grad	s	+1	1	For example , this th th the dialogue history is {disfmarker} is um , producing XML documents .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1103	3077.63	3079.1	B	Grad	s	-1	0	M - three - L of course is XML .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1104	3079.45	3089.21	B	Grad	s.x	+1	1	And the ontology that um , uh the student is {disfmarker} is constructing for me back in {disfmarker} in EML is in OIL and that 's also in XML .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1105	3089.66	3095.29	B	Grad	s.x	+1	1	And so that 's where a lot of knowledge about bakeries , about hotels , about castles and stuff is gonna come from .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1106	3093.25	3093.84	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1107	3094.79	3095.0	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1108	3095.87	3102.14	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Um , so , if it has that IO capability and if it 's a Java package , it will definitely be able {disfmarker} We can couple .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1109	3100.8	3100.87	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1110	3101.29	3105.83	C	Professor	fg|s	+1	1	So , yeah , we 're sort of {nonvocalsound} committed to XML as the kind of , uh , interchange .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1111	3106.3	3108.15	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But that 's , you know , not a big deal .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1112	3107.68	3108.04	B	Grad	qh^df	-1	0	Who isn't ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1113	3108.32	3108.39	B	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	nuh ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact1114	3108.58	3115.66	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So , in terms of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} interchanging in and out of any module we build , It 'll be XML .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1115	3115.85	3120.51	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And if you 're going off to queries to the ontology , for example , you 'll have to deal with its interface .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1116	3122.07	3123.37	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But that 's {disfmarker} that 's fine
Bed002.C.dialogueact1117	3123.37	3124.75	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	an and um ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1118	3125.36	3132.04	C	Professor	s	-1	0	all of these things have been built with much bigger projects than this in mind .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1119	3132.04	3134.23	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So they {disfmarker} they have worked very hard .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1120	3134.24	3136.94	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	It 's kind of blackboards and multi - wave blackboards
Bed002.C.dialogueact1121	3136.93	3139.32	C	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	and ways of interchanging and registering your
Bed002.C.dialogueact1122	3139.32	3139.9	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	a And so forth .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1123	3140.23	3140.59	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	So ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1124	3142.66	3145.87	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that I don't think is even worth us worrying about just yet .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1125	3146.74	3159.98	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean if we can get the core of the thing to work , in a way that we 're comfortable with , then we ca we can get in and out of it with , uh , XML , um , little descriptors .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1126	3160.64	3161.01	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	I believe .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1128	3161.22	3161.36	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1129	3161.5	3170.86	B	Grad	fg|s^rt	-1	0	Yeah . Yeah , I like , for example , the {disfmarker} what you said about the getting input from {disfmarker} from just files about where you h where you have the data , have specified the features and so forth .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1127	3161.01	3161.66	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	I don't {disfmarker} I don't see {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact1130	3171.25	3174.26	B	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's , of course , easy also to do with , you know , XML .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1131	3173.68	3176.58	C	Professor	s^na|s^aa	-1	0	Uh , you could have an X {disfmarker} yeah , you could make and XML format for that . Sure .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1132	3178.0	3178.26	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	So r
Bed002.C.dialogueact1133	3178.0	3178.49	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	That {disfmarker} that {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact1134	3179.37	3180.66	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1135	3181.04	3184.61	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you know , feature value XML format is probably as good a way as any .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1136	3186.7	3195.53	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So it 's als Yeah , I guess it 's also worth , um , while you 're poking around , poke around for XML packages that um , do things you 'd like .
Bed002.F.dialogueact1137	3196.32	3198.31	F	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Doesn't {disfmarker} does SmartKom system have such packages ?

Bed002.C.dialogueact1139	3198.48	3198.82	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Sure .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1140	3199.0	3201.39	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	The {disfmarker} the lib M - three - L library does that .

Bed002.C.dialogueact1141	3201.81	3204.16	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And the question is , d you c you {disfmarker} you 'll have to l We 'll have to l
Bed002.C.dialogueact1143	3204.24	3206.44	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	That should be {disfmarker} ay We should be able to look at that {disfmarker}

Bed002.B.dialogueact1147	3210.67	3224.13	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	What I {disfmarker} What sort of came to my mind i is {disfmarker} was the notion of an idea that if {disfmarker} if there are l nets that can actually lear try to set their own , um , probability factors based on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on input {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact1148	3213.68	3214.22	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1149	3224.67	3225.74	B	Grad	s	-1	0	which is in file format ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1150	3226.45	3233.76	B	Grad	s	+1	0	if we , um , get really w wild on this , we may actually want to use some {disfmarker} some corpora that other people made
Bed002.B.dialogueact1151	3233.76	3240.1	B	Grad	s.%--	+1	0	and , for example , if {disfmarker} if they are in {disfmarker} in MATE , then we get X M L documents with discourse annotations , t
Bed002.B.dialogueact1153	3240.1	3242.78	B	Grad	s	-1	0	you know , t from the discourse act down to the phonetic level .
Bed002.F.dialogueact1152	3240.04	3240.85	F	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1154	3243.38	3246.69	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Um , Michael has a project where {disfmarker} you know , recognizing discourse acts
Bed002.B.dialogueact1155	3246.69	3247.71	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and he does it all in MATE ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1156	3247.71	3250.28	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and so they 're actually annotating data and data and data .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1157	3250.66	3263.48	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	So if we w if we think it 's worth it one of these days , not {disfmarker} not with this first prototype but maybe with a second , and we have the possibility of {disfmarker} of taking input that 's generated elsewhere and learn from that , that 'd be nice .
Bed002.F.dialogueact1158	3257.61	3257.95	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1159	3263.07	3265.6	C	Professor	s^na|s^nd	+1	0	It 'd be nice , but {disfmarker} but I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I do I don't wanna count on it .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1160	3266.39	3271.08	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	I mean , you can't {disfmarker} you can't run your project based on the speculation that {disfmarker} that the data will come ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1161	3269.7	3271.08	B	Grad	s^ar|s.%-	-1	0	No , no , uh , just for {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact1162	3271.08	3273.52	C	Professor	s^df^e	-1	0	and you don't have to actually design the nets .

Bed002.B.dialogueact1164	3275.31	3278.5	B	Grad	s^df.%-	-1	0	Just a back door that {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think we should devote m
Bed002.C.dialogueact1165	3277.29	3277.65	C	Professor	s^am	-1	0	Could happen .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1166	3277.87	3286.08	C	Professor	fg|s	+1	0	Yeah . So in terms of {disfmarker} of the , um {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} what the SmartKom gives us for M - three - L packages , it could be that they 're fine , or it could be eeh .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1167	3286.14	3287.9	C	Professor	s	-1	0	You don't {disfmarker} You know , you don't really like it .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1168	3288.48	3292.42	C	Professor	s	+1	0	So we 're not {disfmarker} we 're not abs we 're not required to use their packages .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1169	3292.42	3296.46	C	Professor	s.x	+1	0	We are required at the end to give them stuff in their format ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1170	3296.46	3296.82	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but hey .
Bed002.F.dialogueact1171	3297.57	3297.73	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .

Bed002.C.dialogueact1182	3330.19	3333.61	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and tell us what it is , and give us a pointer so we can play with it or something .
Bed002.F.dialogueact1183	3333.85	3334.07	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Sure .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1184	3334.76	3343.07	C	Professor	s	+1	1	And , then as soon as we have it , I think we should start trying to populate it for this problem .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1185	3343.55	3345.7	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Make a first cut at , you know , what 's going on ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1186	3346.31	3353.73	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and probably the ea easiest way to do that is some on - line way .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1187	3353.93	3356.05	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , you can f figure out whether you wanna make it a web site
Bed002.C.dialogueact1188	3356.05	3357.04	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	or {disfmarker} You know , how

Bed002.B.dialogueact1191	3359.73	3361.81	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	I was actually more joking . With the two or three days .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1193	3362.04	3364.28	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	So this was {disfmarker} was a usual jo

Bed002.C.dialogueact1196	3367.68	3367.9	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1197	3368.84	3378.38	B	Grad	s^cs.x	-1	0	But um , maybe it might be interesting if {disfmarker} if the two of you can agree on who 's gonna be the speaker next Monday , to tell us something about the net you picked ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1198	3378.71	3380.27	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and what it does , and how it does that .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1199	3379.77	3381.38	C	Professor	s^aap^cs.x	-1	0	Well , y Well , or both of them speak .

Bed002.B.dialogueact1202	3381.83	3383.25	B	Grad	s^aa|s^cs	-1	0	Yeah , or you can split it up .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1201	3381.38	3381.81	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	We don't care .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1203	3383.78	3384.4	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	So , y
Bed002.F.dialogueact1204	3384.05	3384.34	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1205	3384.89	3391.31	B	Grad	s.x	-1	0	So that will be sort of the assignment for next week , is to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} for slides and whatever net you picked
Bed002.B.dialogueact1206	3391.31	3393.44	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and what it can do and {disfmarker} and how far you 've gotten .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1207	3393.58	3393.65	B	Grad	x	-1	0	Pppt !
Bed002.C.dialogueact1208	3393.8	3400.34	C	Professor	s^aap^cs	+1	1	Well , I 'd like to also , though , uh , ha have a first cut at what the belief - net looks like .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1209	3400.93	3402.27	C	Professor	s^e	+1	0	Even if it 's really crude .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1210	3403.0	3403.42	C	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	OK ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact1211	3403.51	3405.43	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	So , you know , here a here are {disfmarker}
Bed002.E.dialogueact1212	3404.76	3406.79	E	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	So we 're supposed to @ @ about features and whatnot ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1214	3406.91	3407.62	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right . Yeah .
Bed002.E.dialogueact1213	3406.79	3406.96	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bed002.F.dialogueact1215	3407.08	3407.38	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1216	3410.27	3413.43	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And , as I said , what I 'd like to do is ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1217	3413.43	3420.49	C	Professor	s:s	-1	0	I mean , what would be really great is you bring it in {disfmarker} If {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if we could , uh , in the meeting , say , you know , " Here 's the package ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1218	3420.49	3421.83	C	Professor	s:s	-1	0	here 's the current one we have , "
Bed002.C.dialogueact1219	3422.58	3425.31	C	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	uh , you know , " What other ideas do you have ? "
Bed002.C.dialogueact1220	3426.73	3431.44	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and then we can think about this idea of making up the data file .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1221	3432.43	3432.87	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	Of ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1222	3433.31	3435.86	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh , you know , get a {disfmarker} t a p tentative format for it ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1223	3435.86	3441.29	C	Professor	s	-1	0	let 's say XML , that says , l you know , " These are the various scenarios we 've experienced . "
Bed002.C.dialogueact1224	3441.99	3442.88	C	Professor	s.x	-1	0	We can just add to that
Bed002.C.dialogueact1225	3442.88	3444.9	C	Professor	s.x	-1	0	and there 'll be this {disfmarker} this file of them
Bed002.C.dialogueact1226	3444.9	3453.07	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and when you think you 've got a better belief - net , You just run it against this , um {disfmarker} this data file .
Bed002.F.dialogueact1227	3454.54	3457.84	F	Grad	s^bu	+1	1	So we 'll be like , hand , uh , doing all the probabilities .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1229	3458.7	3460.0	C	Professor	s^aa|s	+1	0	Oh , yeah , unt until we know more .
Bed002.F.dialogueact1228	3458.61	3458.91	F	Grad	s^bk.%	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.E.dialogueact1230	3463.59	3468.96	E	Grad	qw	-1	0	And what 's the relation to this with {disfmarker} Changing the table so that the system works in English ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact1231	3468.26	3468.53	B	Grad	fg	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1232	3469.02	3473.93	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So this is {disfmarker} Whi - while you were doing this , I received two lovely emails .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1233	3473.97	3478.03	B	Grad	s	-1	0	The {disfmarker} the full NT and the full Linux version are there .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1234	3478.73	3480.2	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	I 've downloaded them both ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1235	3481.19	3484.2	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and I started to unpack the Linux one {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact1236	3484.2	3485.19	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Uh , the NT one worked fine .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1237	3485.31	3486.83	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and I started unta pack the Linux one ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1238	3486.83	3488.51	B	Grad	s	-1	0	it told me that I can't really unpack it
Bed002.B.dialogueact1239	3488.51	3490.49	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because it contains a future date .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1240	3490.98	3492.67	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So this is the time difference between Germany .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1241	3492.67	3496.63	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	I had to wait until one o ' clock this afternoon before I was able to unpack it .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1242	3497.3	3503.26	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	Now , um {disfmarker} Then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on Swede and on this machine .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1243	3504.59	3506.57	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And so that we have it .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1244	3507.01	3517.55	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	And then um {disfmarker} Hopefully that {disfmarker} hoping that my urgent message will now come through to Ralph and Tilman that it will send some more documentation along ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1245	3518.26	3519.88	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	we {disfmarker} I control p
Bed002.B.dialogueact1246	3520.12	3521.78	B	Grad	s	+1	0	Maybe that 's what I will do next Monday
Bed002.B.dialogueact1247	3521.78	3524.65	B	Grad	s^e	+1	1	is show the state and show the system and show that .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1248	3523.4	3523.65	C	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1249	3525.1	3531.23	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah . So the answer , Johno , is that these are , at the moment , separate .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1250	3532.2	3546.42	C	Professor	s	+1	1	Uh , what one hopes is that when we understand how the analyzer works , we can both worry about converting it to English and worry about how it could ex extract the parameters we need for the belief - net .
Bed002.E.dialogueact1251	3546.9	3548.45	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I guess my question was more about time frame .
Bed002.E.dialogueact1252	3548.45	3550.36	E	Grad	s	-1	0	So we 're gonna do belief - nets this week ,
Bed002.E.dialogueact1253	3550.36	3550.64	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	and then {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact1254	3550.92	3551.68	C	Professor	s^bk|s^no	-1	0	Oh , yeah . I don't know .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1255	3551.68	3558.0	C	Professor	s	+1	0	n None of this is i n Neither of these projects has got a real tight time - line ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1256	3558.23	3560.8	C	Professor	s	+1	0	in the sense that over the next month there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a deliverable .
Bed002.E.dialogueact1257	3561.35	3561.56	E	Grad	b	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1258	3561.94	3562.13	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1259	3562.13	3565.27	C	Professor	s	-1	0	S so uh , it 's opportu in that sense it 's opportunistic .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1260	3565.74	3575.34	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	If {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} you know , if we don't get any information for these guys f for several weeks then we aren't gonna sit around , you know , wasting time , trying to do the problem or guess what they {disfmarker}
Bed002.C.dialogueact1261	3575.56	3575.98	C	Professor	s	-1	0	You know , just pppt !
Bed002.C.dialogueact1262	3576.43	3577.51	C	Professor	s	-1	0	go on and do other things .
Bed002.E.dialogueact1263	3579.17	3579.33	E	Grad	b	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1264	3580.38	3594.59	B	Grad	fg|s	+1	0	Yeah , but uh {disfmarker} but the uh {disfmarker} This point is really {disfmarker} I think very , very valid that ultimately we hope that {disfmarker} that both will merge into a harmonious and , um , wonderful , um , state
Bed002.B.dialogueact1265	3594.59	3607.55	B	Grad	s:s	+1	0	where we can not only do the bare necessities , IE , changing the table so it does exactly in English what it does in German , but also that we can sort of have the system where we can say , " OK , this is what it usually does ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1266	3607.88	3610.15	B	Grad	s	+1	0	and now we add this little thing to it " ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1267	3610.5	3610.71	B	Grad	s^f	-1	0	you know ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact1268	3610.71	3611.16	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	whatever ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1269	3611.7	3613.88	B	Grad	s	+1	0	Johno 's and Bhaskara 's great belief - net ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1270	3614.26	3615.45	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and we plug it in ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1271	3615.77	3617.47	B	Grad	s.%--	+1	0	and then for these certain tasks ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1272	3617.47	3621.79	B	Grad	s	+1	0	and we know that navigational tasks are gonna be a core domain of the new system ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1273	3622.13	3623.94	B	Grad	s	+1	1	it all {disfmarker} all of a sudden it does much better .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1274	3624.35	3624.42	B	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Nuh ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact1275	3624.42	3627.53	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Because it can produce better answers ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1276	3627.65	3629.64	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	tell the person , as I s showed you on this map ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1277	3630.15	3634.64	B	Grad	s	-1	0	n you know , produce either you know , a red line that goes to the Vista point
Bed002.B.dialogueact1278	3634.64	3636.44	B	Grad	s	-1	0	or a red line that goes to the Tango point
Bed002.B.dialogueact1279	3636.44	3637.71	B	Grad	s	-1	0	or red line that goes to the door ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1280	3638.35	3639.04	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	which would be great .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1281	3640.29	3647.46	B	Grad	s	+1	0	So not only can you show that you know something sensible but ultimately , if you produce a system like this , it takes the person where it wants to go .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1282	3648.51	3653.08	B	Grad	s	+1	0	Rather than taking him always to the geometric center of a building ,
Bed002.F.dialogueact1283	3652.24	3653.3	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1284	3653.2	3654.12	B	Grad	s	-1	0	which is what they do now .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1285	3656.59	3658.28	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And we even had to take out a bit .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1286	3658.34	3659.36	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Nancy , you missed that part .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1287	3659.79	3662.11	B	Grad	s	-1	0	We had to take out a bit of the road work .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1288	3662.57	3666.18	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So that it doesn't take you to the wall {vocalsound} every time .
Bed002.D.dialogueact1289	3665.98	3666.32	D	Grad	qy^bh	-1	0	Oh , really ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact1290	3666.67	3668.48	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	So . Um {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact1291	3670.88	3673.41	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So this was actually an actual problem that we encountered ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1292	3673.72	3674.84	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	which nobody have {disfmarker} has {disfmarker}
Bed002.B.dialogueact1293	3675.26	3677.73	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because car navigation systems don't really care .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1294	3677.89	3679.76	B	Grad	s	-1	0	You know , they get you to the beginning of the street ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1295	3680.21	3681.79	B	Grad	s	-1	0	some now do the house number .
Bed002.D.dialogueact1296	3680.31	3681.08	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1298	3682.73	3684.22	B	Grad	s	-1	0	But even that is problematic .
Bed002.D.dialogueact1297	3682.6	3683.3	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1299	3684.22	3687.3	B	Grad	s^rt.%--	-1	0	If you go d If you wanna drive to the SAP in Waldorf ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1300	3687.52	3689.1	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I 'm sure the same is true of Microsoft ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1301	3689.53	3691.83	B	Grad	s	-1	0	it takes you to the {disfmarker} the address ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1302	3692.09	3693.61	B	Grad	s^rt.%--	-1	0	whatever , street number blah - blah - blah ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1303	3694.17	3696.29	B	Grad	s	-1	0	you are miles away from the entrance .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1304	3696.44	3696.63	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1305	3697.01	3700.77	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Because the s postal address is maybe a mailbox somewhere .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1307	3701.51	3701.65	B	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Nuh ?
Bed002.D.dialogueact1306	3701.05	3701.49	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1308	3702.2	3704.55	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but the entrance where you actually wanna go is somewhere completely different .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1309	3706.68	3708.8	B	Grad	s	-1	0	So unless you 're a mail person you really don't wanna go there .
Bed002.D.dialogueact1310	3709.15	3709.37	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Right , yeah .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1311	3711.24	3711.8	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Probably not then ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1312	3711.8	3713.62	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	cuz y you probably can't drop the mail there anyway .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1313	3714.04	3715.46	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Probably neither {disfmarker} e not even that .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1314	3714.64	3714.86	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1315	3723.33	3723.55	C	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	Clear ?
Bed002.F.dialogueact1316	3724.11	3724.9	F	Grad	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	OK . Sounds good .
Bed002.E.dialogueact1317	3732.8	3734.95	E	Grad	s^tc	-1	0	The Powder - Tower is made of red limestone .
Bed002.D.dialogueact1318	3736.09	3736.79	D	Grad	s	-1	0	I was wondering .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1320	3737.29	3738.15	B	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Do you wanna see a picture ?
Bed002.D.dialogueact1319	3736.98	3737.34	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.D.dialogueact1321	3738.72	3739.14	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Sure !
Bed002.E.dialogueact1322	3738.82	3739.15	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Sure !
Bed002.B.dialogueact1323	3740.34	3741.4	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Have to reboot for that though .
Bed002.D.dialogueact1324	3740.77	3741.14	D	Grad	%--	-1	0	Um .
Bed002.D.dialogueact1325	3742.17	3750.08	D	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	So , you two , who 'll be working on this , li are {disfmarker} are you gl will you be doing {disfmarker} Well , I mean are you supposed to just do it by thinking about the situation ?
Bed002.D.dialogueact1326	3750.08	3751.59	D	Grad	qy^e	-1	0	Can you use the sample data ?
Bed002.C.dialogueact1328	3752.0	3753.08	C	Professor	s^na	-1	0	Of course they use the sample data .
Bed002.D.dialogueact1327	3751.94	3752.44	D	Grad	qy.%-	-1	0	Is it like {disfmarker}
Bed002.D.dialogueact1329	3752.57	3754.28	D	Grad	s^bk|qy.%--	-1	0	Yeah , I mean , ho is there more than {disfmarker}
Bed002.D.dialogueact1330	3755.03	3759.18	D	Grad	qy	-1	0	Is there a lot s of sample data that is beyond what you {disfmarker} what you have there ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact1331	3756.94	3758.29	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	There {disfmarker} there 's more than I showed ,
Bed002.B.dialogueact1332	3758.29	3764.55	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	but um , um , I think this is sort of um , in part my job to look at that
Bed002.B.dialogueact1333	3764.55	3768.4	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and to see whether there are features in there that can be extracted ,
Bed002.D.dialogueact1334	3767.2	3767.56	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1335	3768.4	3777.17	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and to come up with some features that are not you know , empirically based on {disfmarker} on a real experiment or on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on reality
Bed002.D.dialogueact1336	3768.46	3768.75	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed002.D.dialogueact1337	3774.14	3774.56	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1338	3777.17	3780.45	B	Grad	s:s^fe	-1	0	but sort of on your intuition of you know , " Aha !
Bed002.B.dialogueact1341	3781.18	3782.4	B	Grad	s	-1	0	This is maybe a sign for that ,

Bed002.B.dialogueact1346	3794.84	3795.58	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Talk features .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1347	3797.59	3797.7	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yep .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1348	3802.44	3803.94	C	Professor	fg|s^t^tc	-1	0	OK . We can end the meeting
Bed002.C.dialogueact1349	3803.94	3805.25	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and call Adam ,
Bed002.C.dialogueact1350	3805.25	3808.09	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and then we wanna s look at some filthy pictures of Heidelberg .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1351	3809.88	3810.99	C	Professor	s	-1	0	We can do that as well .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1353	3812.19	3816.05	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Well they had {disfmarker} they used the ammunition {disfmarker} They stored the ammunition in that tower .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1352	3812.13	3812.67	C	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Uh , is that OK ?
Bed002.B.dialogueact1355	3816.83	3821.3	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And that 's why , when it was hit by uh , a cannon ball , it exploded .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1354	3816.6	3817.15	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Alright .
Bed002.C.dialogueact1357	3820.59	3820.62	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Oh .

Bed002.E.dialogueact1359	3825.46	3826.93	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	That 's why they call it the Powder - Tower .
Bed002.B.dialogueact1360	3827.31	3827.99	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Ahh .
Bed002.E.dialogueact1361	3827.5	3827.88	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed002.E.dialogueact1362	3827.88	3830.6	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	I first thought it had something to do with the material
Bed002.E.dialogueact1363	3830.6	3831.73	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	that it {disfmarker} w that 's why I asked .
