Bro027.B.dialogueact24	47.19	49.02	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	it's interesting i mean basically we're dealing 
Bro027.B.dialogueact25	49.02	51.61	B	Professor	s	+1	1	i mean basically we're dealing of her reverberations 
Bro027.B.dialogueact26	52.34	56.67	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	and um we deal with pure reverberations technique choosing works really really well 
Bro027.B.dialogueact27	57.12	61.56	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um when they have reverberations here uh we measure the signature issue on it's uh 
Bro027.B.dialogueact28	61.56	63.35	B	Professor	s	-1	0	issue on it's uh about nine t. v.

Bro027.A.dialogueact36	71.3	71.87	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	it's ninety

Bro027.B.dialogueact39	74.42	77.97	B	Professor	s	+1	1	and actually of the question which maybe relevancy or stuff too 
Bro027.B.dialogueact40	78.48	88.44	B	Professor	s	+1	1	um i know that when you figured out the filters that we're using for the mel scale there were some experimentation that went on that that uh that oh gee i 
Bro027.B.dialogueact41	89.68	90.2	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact42	91.453	108.801	B	Professor	s	+1	1	but one of the differences that we found between the two systems that we were using the the over i c. cases system baseline system and the system that we were the the other system using yeah this our system is that c. s. i. system had maybe uh um hundred hurts high pass 
Bro027.B.dialogueact44	109.878	112.448	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and they uh u. cave was like twenty sixty four 
Bro027.D.dialogueact43	109.418	109.628	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bro027.D.dialogueact45	111.575	112.575	D	PhD	s^2	-1	0	u. cave was like twenty sixty four

Bro027.B.dialogueact48	114.37	115.23	B	Professor	qy^bu^d^m	-1	0	sixty four uh yeah if you're using 
Bro027.B.dialogueact50	115.53	115.85	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh yeah if you're using 
Bro027.D.dialogueact49	115.2	115.37	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	uh yeah if you're using 
Bro027.D.dialogueact51	115.53	116.97	D	PhD	s	-1	0	uh is that yeah if you're using the baseline 
Bro027.B.dialogueact52	116.82	118.18	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	is that the defense censor the baseline no 
Bro027.D.dialogueact53	118.97	119.27	D	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	no the edge 
Bro027.D.dialogueact54	119.27	119.85	D	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	the edge 
Bro027.B.dialogueact55	120.3	121.82	B	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	yeah it just really sixty four some 
Bro027.D.dialogueact56	121.07	121.37	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	sixty four some 
Bro027.B.dialogueact58	121.82	125.083	B	Professor	s	-1	0	sixty four some reason uh they thought it was funny but so the accent there would be some that um 
Bro027.D.dialogueact57	121.674	122.717	D	PhD	%	-1	0	sixty four some reason uh 
Bro027.D.dialogueact59	123.93	127.19	D	PhD	s	-1	0	they thought it was funny but so the accent there would be some that um like hundred 
Bro027.B.dialogueact60	125.083	125.353	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	but be some that um 
Bro027.D.dialogueact61	127.19	131.942	D	PhD	s	-1	0	a hundred hundred and maybe like four it's 
Bro027.B.dialogueact62	133.23	137.08	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	but you know for instance how far down there would be at twenty or 
Bro027.B.dialogueact63	138.94	141.48	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	what how much rejection would there be twenty hurts say like twenty six 
Bro027.D.dialogueact64	141.026	141.856	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	say twenty six 
Bro027.B.dialogueact65	142.6	142.91	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact66	142.91	144.6	B	Professor	qy	-1	0	the idea of what the curve looks like 
Bro027.D.dialogueact67	145.78	147.18	D	PhD	s	-1	0	current it's frequency 
Bro027.D.dialogueact68	150.49	152.42	D	PhD	s|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	oh it's it's you you go to try different fit 
Bro027.D.dialogueact69	152.47	152.89	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	try different fit 
Bro027.C.dialogueact70	153.91	157.25	C	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	yeah i did this tension the first encourage at sixty four so sixty four so anything 
Bro027.D.dialogueact71	156.38	157.47	D	PhD	s^bk^m	-1	0	at sixty four so sixty four so anything 
Bro027.C.dialogueact72	157.25	157.69	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	so four so anything 
Bro027.D.dialogueact73	157.47	159.24	D	PhD	s	-1	0	it's actually so four so anything that's interesting what is you know 
Bro027.C.dialogueact74	158.88	159.5	C	PhD	b	-1	0	it's actually that's interesting what is you know 
Bro027.B.dialogueact75	159.51	160.9	B	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	it's actually set to zero know 
Bro027.B.dialogueact76	160.9	162.46	B	Professor	qw^rt	-1	0	set to zero kind of filters that 
Bro027.C.dialogueact78	161.56	161.92	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	kind of filters 
Bro027.D.dialogueact77	161.092	161.352	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	kind of filters 
Bro027.B.dialogueact79	163.11	164.45	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	is all from from this is the sister bank 
Bro027.C.dialogueact80	163.443	163.603	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	is all from 
Bro027.C.dialogueact81	164.238	167.968	C	PhD	s	-1	0	from oh see uh she really set it to zero manifestation this is the sister bank in the frequency domain that's starts at successful yeah yeah 
Bro027.B.dialogueact82	165.73	168.97	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	oh see uh she really set it to zero manifestation in the frequency domain that's starts at successful yeah yeah so it's it's a debate on 
Bro027.D.dialogueact83	166.879	167.249	D	PhD	b	-1	0	uh she really set it to zero manifestation domain that's starts at successful yeah yeah 
Bro027.C.dialogueact85	167.968	168.158	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	set it to zero manifestation at successful yeah so it's it's a debate on 
Bro027.D.dialogueact84	167.849	168.129	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	set it to zero manifestation at successful yeah so it's it's a debate on 
Bro027.D.dialogueact86	168.129	170.419	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so it's it's a debate on the ball spectrum 
Bro027.D.dialogueact87	171.079	171.899	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	triangular waiting 
Bro027.B.dialogueact88	172.44	172.72	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact89	172.83	173.28	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact90	174.94	175.42	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	um okay 
Bro027.B.dialogueact91	176.01	176.36	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	so that's 
Bro027.B.dialogueact92	176.54	178.54	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so that's that's still difference and they've thought i thing but but 
Bro027.B.dialogueact93	178.54	179.17	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	thought i thing but but 
Bro027.B.dialogueact94	179.82	180.36	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact95	181.33	184.49	B	Professor	s	+1	1	still it's possible that we're getting in some more noise 
Bro027.B.dialogueact96	185.4	191.1	B	Professor	qy^rt	+1	1	so i wonder is but they're they're experimentation with uh six runway that filter or something 
Bro027.B.dialogueact97	191.47	192.07	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.D.dialogueact98	193.253	194.513	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	uh throwing the first

Bro027.C.dialogueact104	203.57	204.03	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and that's always 
Bro027.D.dialogueact105	204.013	207.823	D	PhD	s	-1	0	that's always was and using sixty four hoods 
Bro027.B.dialogueact106	208.36	208.62	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right but the question 
Bro027.B.dialogueact107	208.62	214.32	B	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	right but the question is whether sixty four hurts is is uh too 
Bro027.D.dialogueact108	215.7	215.86	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah i mean 
Bro027.D.dialogueact109	215.86	217.37	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	yeah i mean make it a hundred of them 
Bro027.B.dialogueact110	217.67	217.88	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	of them 
Bro027.D.dialogueact111	218.04	223.35	D	PhD	s	-1	0	on what i i think i've tried hunter and it was more or less the same with like he was

Bro027.D.dialogueact113	224.453	226.663	D	PhD	s	-1	0	to say on the same uh speech that cause i don't know 
Bro027.D.dialogueact114	226.663	226.953	D	PhD	s	-1	0	cause i don't know 
Bro027.B.dialogueact115	228.92	230.79	B	Professor	fg|s^nd	-1	0	um it was on the fish that car

Bro027.B.dialogueact124	248.967	249.147	B	Professor	b	-1	0	i be 
Bro027.B.dialogueact125	249.407	251.127	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	i be something look at some time because what 
Bro027.B.dialogueact126	251.127	258.987	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because what um he was looking at was you performance in this room 
Bro027.D.dialogueact127	254.334	254.844	D	PhD	b	-1	0	he 
Bro027.B.dialogueact128	260.507	261.537	B	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	would that be more like 
Bro027.B.dialogueact129	262.817	264.647	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but you think that the more like speech that car i 
Bro027.B.dialogueact130	264.937	265.507	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	that car i guess in terms of the 
Bro027.B.dialogueact131	265.507	266.577	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	guess in terms of the noise 
Bro027.B.dialogueact132	267.257	272.037	B	Professor	s	-1	0	this be set cars more uh sort of roughly stationery a lot 
Bro027.B.dialogueact134	272.167	275.507	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and yeah digits maybe it's not so much 
Bro027.D.dialogueact133	271.693	271.963	D	PhD	b	-1	0	a lot 
Bro027.C.dialogueact135	273.182	273.502	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and yeah digits maybe

Bro027.B.dialogueact140	277.57	278.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	okay well maybe it's not a big deal 
Bro027.B.dialogueact141	279.85	280.48	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact142	281.48	282.97	B	Professor	s	-1	0	anyway this is something we wondered about 
Bro027.B.dialogueact143	283.49	284.39	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but um uh certainly 
Bro027.B.dialogueact144	284.63	290.0	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh certainly a lot of the noise uh is uh hundred hertz uh the signature 
Bro027.B.dialogueact145	290.0	295.57	B	Professor	s	-1	0	the signature issue you know looks a better if you if you have filter it from this room 
Bro027.D.dialogueact146	290.473	290.843	D	PhD	b	-1	0	the signature 
Bro027.B.dialogueact147	296.4	297.33	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but um but it's still pretty 
Bro027.B.dialogueact148	297.53	298.53	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but it's still pretty high to even even 
Bro027.B.dialogueact149	298.53	301.16	B	Professor	s	-1	0	high to even even hunter and stuff it's it's still fairly nice signature is 
Bro027.B.dialogueact151	301.16	304.58	B	Professor	s	-1	0	signature is is is actually still pretty bad 
Bro027.C.dialogueact150	301.101	301.541	C	PhD	b	-1	0	signature is 
Bro027.A.dialogueact152	305.851	306.131	A	PhD	qy^bh	-1	0	so um 
Bro027.B.dialogueact153	306.352	307.122	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so um i mean the main 
Bro027.B.dialogueact154	307.642	309.842	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	so that's some that i mean the main there's uh 
Bro027.A.dialogueact155	309.36	311.88	A	PhD	s^bu|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	so that's some that some of the far field ones all right there's uh yeah 
Bro027.A.dialogueact158	312.22	312.42	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah that's a far feel 
Bro027.B.dialogueact156	311.93	312.1	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	ones all right yeah yeah that's a far feel 
Bro027.B.dialogueact157	312.16	312.94	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	yeah that's a far feel 
Bro027.B.dialogueact159	313.14	314.35	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	so what yeah have they felt pretty good 
Bro027.A.dialogueact160	314.74	317.29	A	PhD	qw	-1	0	so what what is uh what's causing that good 
Bro027.B.dialogueact161	318.3	320.99	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well we got uh uh video projector in here 
Bro027.B.dialogueact162	321.25	321.69	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh and 
Bro027.B.dialogueact163	321.69	325.7	B	Professor	fh|s^e	-1	0	uh and uh which we keep on during every every session a record which 
Bro027.A.dialogueact164	324.71	324.92	A	PhD	b	-1	0	every session 
Bro027.B.dialogueact165	325.7	327.69	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	a record which i i we were aware of but but 
Bro027.A.dialogueact167	328.056	328.446	A	PhD	b	-1	0	we thought it was 
Bro027.B.dialogueact166	327.78	329.71	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	were aware of but but we thought it was a bad thing i mean 
Bro027.A.dialogueact169	330.1	330.33	A	PhD	b	-1	0	that's uh i star 
Bro027.B.dialogueact168	329.71	331.57	B	Professor	s	-1	0	a bad thing i mean that's uh i star search 
Bro027.B.dialogueact170	332.13	335.37	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh and there's also of the uh uh air conditioning 
Bro027.A.dialogueact171	335.857	336.177	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact172	336.84	340.67	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	pretty low frequency kind of things but 
Bro027.A.dialogueact173	340.654	341.144	A	PhD	b	-1	0	kind of things but but uh 
Bro027.B.dialogueact174	340.71	341.77	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	kind of things but but uh 
Bro027.B.dialogueact175	342.55	344.86	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so those are those are major components i think 
Bro027.A.dialogueact176	344.955	345.235	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i think for 
Bro027.B.dialogueact177	345.5	347.33	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	for the stationary kind of so 
Bro027.A.dialogueact178	347.68	348.26	A	PhD	b	-1	0	so um 
Bro027.B.dialogueact179	348.5	349.18	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro027.B.dialogueact180	350.04	350.91	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but um 
Bro027.B.dialogueact181	351.18	351.66	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	it uh i guess 
Bro027.B.dialogueact182	351.66	353.49	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it uh i guess it maybe i said this last week too but it it it 
Bro027.B.dialogueact183	353.49	357.28	B	Professor	s	-1	0	week too but it it it really became apparent to us that we need to to take account of noise 
Bro027.B.dialogueact184	357.56	358.04	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so i think 
Bro027.B.dialogueact185	358.66	370.77	B	Professor	s	+1	1	when so i think when when he gets done with a screaming study i think i things are going to do is to take this uh uh nice uh processing stuff synthesize some speech right 
Bro027.A.dialogueact187	371.07	371.93	A	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	are just pretty names 
Bro027.B.dialogueact186	370.77	371.26	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	when are just pretty names speech right 
Bro027.B.dialogueact188	372.83	377.14	B	Professor	h|s	-1	0	oh um i sink in about uh less in two weeks 
Bro027.A.dialogueact189	377.363	377.553	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh

Bro027.B.dialogueact194	384.843	386.413	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh my name be sooner uh 
Bro027.B.dialogueact195	386.503	388.113	B	Professor	fh|qy^d^rt^t1	-1	0	uh ceases sixteen seventeen 
Bro027.B.dialogueact196	388.113	388.743	B	Professor	qy^d^t1	-1	0	seventeen 
Bro027.B.dialogueact197	389.653	390.913	B	Professor	s^bk|s^no.%--	-1	0	yeah i don't know if it's before it might 
Bro027.B.dialogueact198	390.913	391.893	B	Professor	s	-1	0	know if it's before it might even be a week 
Bro027.A.dialogueact199	392.49	392.91	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	so 
Bro027.B.dialogueact200	392.513	393.543	B	Professor	s^r	-1	0	so huh i i guess week week and a half 
Bro027.A.dialogueact201	393.21	393.45	A	PhD	b	-1	0	huh i i guess week week and a half 
Bro027.A.dialogueact203	393.62	396.26	A	PhD	s	-1	0	huh i i guess that they were going to do it sometime during the semester but they'll do it week week and a half 
Bro027.B.dialogueact202	393.543	394.053	B	Professor	s	-1	0	huh i i guess that they were going to do week week and a half 
Bro027.A.dialogueact204	396.26	397.81	A	PhD	s^bu|qy^d^g	-1	0	but they'll do it anytime they seem to be 
Bro027.B.dialogueact205	397.29	398.04	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	anytime they seem to be well this semester actually 
Bro027.B.dialogueact206	398.04	399.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well this semester actually starting out 
Bro027.A.dialogueact207	400.45	401.02	A	PhD	qh^rt	-1	0	is it already asbestos late 
Bro027.B.dialogueact208	401.07	401.37	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	asbestos late 
Bro027.B.dialogueact209	401.37	403.35	B	Professor	s^df^na	-1	0	asbestos late late august the start here 
Bro027.A.dialogueact210	404.05	404.89	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	so 
Bro027.B.dialogueact211	405.0	406.86	B	Professor	s	-1	0	they do it right at the beginning of the semester 
Bro027.A.dialogueact212	406.992	407.272	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	of the semester 
Bro027.B.dialogueact213	408.867	409.167	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact214	410.8	411.37	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	so uh yeah i mean that 
Bro027.B.dialogueact215	411.37	411.63	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	uh yeah i mean that 
Bro027.B.dialogueact216	411.63	413.2	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh yeah i mean that that was sort of fun i mean the 
Bro027.B.dialogueact217	413.2	413.48	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	i mean the 
Bro027.B.dialogueact218	413.95	423.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean the overall results seem to be first place in in in the case of either um artificial reverberations or a modest sized training set 
Bro027.B.dialogueact219	424.41	428.44	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh either way uh uh it helped a lot 
Bro027.B.dialogueact220	429.18	438.09	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and but if you had uh really be training set uh recognize or uh system that was capable of taking advantage of really large drinks that so that 
Bro027.B.dialogueact221	438.67	446.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so that one thing that they c. k. is that it has as we're using the configuration sure using is is being done by the terms of or or we have 
Bro027.B.dialogueact222	446.03	448.96	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we have oh is premieres just said is they are so 
Bro027.B.dialogueact223	448.96	455.84	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	just said is they are so even if we had a hundred times as much data we wouldn't go out to you know ten or a hundred times i snake out or anything so 
Bro027.B.dialogueact224	455.84	456.16	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	or anything so um 
Bro027.B.dialogueact225	456.76	461.63	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um it's kind of hard to take advantage of of big chunks of data 
Bro027.B.dialogueact228	462.22	465.75	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh where's the other one does sort of expand as you have more training did it doesn't 
Bro027.C.dialogueact226	461.914	462.564	C	PhD	b	-1	0	of data uh where's the other 
Bro027.D.dialogueact227	462.091	462.531	D	PhD	b	-1	0	uh where's the other 
Bro027.B.dialogueact229	465.75	467.12	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	more training did it doesn't automatically actually 
Bro027.B.dialogueact230	467.75	468.45	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact231	468.45	468.99	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact232	469.82	470.35	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	that 
Bro027.B.dialogueact233	470.83	473.04	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that one really benefited from the larger set and was also diverse 
Bro027.B.dialogueact234	473.04	476.12	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	and was also diverse that was different noises and so forth uh so 
Bro027.B.dialogueact235	476.12	478.03	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh so um 
Bro027.B.dialogueact236	479.475	481.035	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	that uh that seemed to be so if you have that 
Bro027.B.dialogueact237	481.035	504.045	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so if you have that that better recognize they can that can build up more parameters and if you um have the natural room which in this case has a pretty bad signal noise ratio then in that case um the right thing to do is just to use speaker adaptation this acoustic uh processing but i think 
Bro027.B.dialogueact238	504.535	513.045	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but i think that that would not be true if we did some explicit nice processing as well as uh accomplished what kind of things are doing 
Bro027.C.dialogueact239	510.914	511.174	C	PhD	b	-1	0	well as uh accomplished 
Bro027.B.dialogueact240	514.205	514.525	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro027.A.dialogueact253	547.27	549.95	A	PhD	s	+1	1	there were two things uh that they have to download 
Bro027.A.dialogueact254	550.5	553.3	A	PhD	s	-1	0	one was the uh i guess software and another 
Bro027.A.dialogueact255	553.74	558.2	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and another was it was a um like a sample sample run so i downloaded 
Bro027.A.dialogueact256	558.69	561.6	A	PhD	s	+1	1	so i downloaded the software compiled all of that and okay 
Bro027.A.dialogueact257	561.67	563.31	A	PhD	s	+1	1	all of that and compiled fine no problem okay oh okay 
Bro027.D.dialogueact258	562.076	562.276	D	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	compiled fine 
Bro027.A.dialogueact260	563.39	563.98	A	PhD	s	-1	0	no problem oh okay

Bro027.A.dialogueact310	644.583	646.59	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and so they've picked the values okay and others yeah i think that could be out i think 
Bro027.D.dialogueact311	645.6	646.43	D	PhD	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	the values okay yeah i think that could be out i think 
Bro027.A.dialogueact313	646.72	647.18	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay okay for that could be out i think about is from 
Bro027.D.dialogueact312	646.43	648.12	D	PhD	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	okay okay for that could be out i think about is from

Bro027.B.dialogueact315	647.608	649.888	B	Professor	qw^d	-1	0	okay for what tests that about is from 
Bro027.D.dialogueact316	650.73	656.78	D	PhD	h|s	-1	0	uh the one that they have report that he's uh in east graduation west region 
Bro027.B.dialogueact317	657.283	659.843	B	Professor	s^bu|qy^d^g	-1	0	but that has nothing to do with we're testing on or you know not so 
Bro027.C.dialogueact319	659.244	659.514	C	PhD	b	-1	0	on or not so 
Bro027.D.dialogueact318	658.78	659.08	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	nothing to do with we're testing on or you know not so

Bro027.D.dialogueact323	661.98	671.497	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so that actually trying to uh fix that those values using that clean uh it's paining fired off and uh what's she it just i 
Bro027.D.dialogueact324	671.587	671.947	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	it just i 
Bro027.D.dialogueact325	671.947	672.817	D	PhD	s^bsc	-1	0	it just i mean i don't know 
Bro027.D.dialogueact326	673.567	675.007	D	PhD	s	-1	0	i don't know how is it being subset and they wonder tainted and 
Bro027.B.dialogueact328	675.17	675.87	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and they wonder tainted and 
Bro027.D.dialogueact327	675.007	675.837	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and they wonder tainted and 
Bro027.D.dialogueact329	675.837	678.147	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so there's said they're setting and they wonder tainted and then this they went into medicine 
Bro027.B.dialogueact330	677.871	679.851	B	Professor	qy^d	-1	0	so there's said they're setting it based on that went into medicine yeah

Bro027.B.dialogueact332	680.99	681.22	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay so now we may 
Bro027.B.dialogueact333	681.22	691.204	B	Professor	s	+1	1	so now we may come back to situation where we may be looking for a modification of the features to account for the fact that we can't modifies parameters but um 
Bro027.A.dialogueact334	689.39	689.6	A	PhD	b	-1	0	that we can't modifies 
Bro027.B.dialogueact335	691.254	692.054	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but um uh 
Bro027.D.dialogueact336	691.409	691.929	D	PhD	b	-1	0	but um 
Bro027.B.dialogueact337	692.904	693.444	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh but it's 
Bro027.B.dialogueact338	693.524	698.394	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	yeah okay but it's still worth i think just it's you know just chatting with joke about the issue 
Bro027.A.dialogueact339	698.66	698.85	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah okay issue 
Bro027.A.dialogueact340	699.0	699.31	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	do you think

Bro027.B.dialogueact647	1259.37	1268.04	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	i mean if it's too if if it's uh if it's two fifty then we can keep it elsewhere it is appreciated off funny if it's two hundred 
Bro027.B.dialogueact648	1268.04	1274.19	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	so how if it's two hundred we stuff funny we could we could uh needed by moving the delta 
Bro027.A.dialogueact649	1274.66	1278.23	A	PhD	qw	+1	1	so how do you know that what you have is too much if they're still deciding oh we don't 
Bro027.B.dialogueact650	1278.57	1279.24	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	oh we don't but it's just i mean

Bro027.B.dialogueact652	1279.82	1286.3	B	Professor	s^df	+1	1	oh okay but it's just i mean main thing is that since we got burned last time and not by not worrying about it very much we're just staying conscious of it 
Bro027.A.dialogueact653	1284.56	1284.8	A	PhD	b	-1	0	it very much we're 
Bro027.A.dialogueact654	1286.67	1287.38	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay i see of it and so 
Bro027.A.dialogueact655	1287.38	1287.79	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i see and so 
Bro027.B.dialogueact656	1287.83	1288.16	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	i see and so i mean if if if 
Bro027.B.dialogueact657	1288.16	1295.06	B	Professor	s:s^co	+1	1	i mean if if if the week before we have to be done someone says well you have to have fifty millisecond plus they have now it would be pretty fast around here so 
Bro027.B.dialogueact658	1295.06	1295.37	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro027.A.dialogueact659	1296.07	1296.77	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	uh

Bro027.B.dialogueact663	1308.57	1309.41	B	Professor	s	-1	0	he added a bit on i guess because 
Bro027.B.dialogueact665	1309.41	1318.08	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	on i guess because before we were we were had able to have the noise uh stuff uh and e. l. d. a. being terrible and now he's 
Bro027.C.dialogueact664	1309.19	1309.75	C	PhD	b	-1	0	on i guess because 
Bro027.B.dialogueact666	1318.25	1320.71	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	and now he's he's requirement to be done first 
Bro027.C.dialogueact667	1321.25	1328.15	C	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	right well see so the tennis but and i think the main thing maybe east uh caning in the speech we steaks for timmy musicals 
Bro027.B.dialogueact668	1327.67	1327.86	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right well

Bro027.C.dialogueact898	1726.1	1726.74	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	um 
Bro027.D.dialogueact899	1726.54	1726.65	D	PhD	b	-1	0	um 
Bro027.C.dialogueact900	1727.7	1731.7	C	PhD	s^df	+1	1	i see yeah that makes sense i wanted to do something very similar to the proposing as a first first try 
Bro027.D.dialogueact901	1727.72	1727.85	D	PhD	b	-1	0	i wanted 
Bro027.A.dialogueact902	1729.64	1729.99	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i see similar to the proposing 
Bro027.B.dialogueact903	1730.55	1730.74	B	Professor	b	-1	0	as a first 
Bro027.A.dialogueact904	1731.07	1731.33	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah that makes sense first try 
Bro027.A.dialogueact905	1731.57	1732.15	A	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah that makes sense first try but we have to 
Bro027.C.dialogueact906	1732.18	1734.15	C	PhD	s	+1	1	but we have to for sure we have to go down because they make 
Bro027.C.dialogueact907	1734.15	1736.44	C	PhD	s^df	+1	1	because they make the snow sixty features 
Bro027.B.dialogueact909	1736.64	1736.82	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.C.dialogueact908	1736.44	1736.83	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.C.dialogueact910	1738.44	1739.17	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.C.dialogueact911	1739.17	1743.65	C	PhD	s	+1	1	find a way to decree and then her features 
Bro027.C.dialogueact912	1744.44	1744.89	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.A.dialogueact913	1745.29	1752.05	A	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	so it seems funny that um you couldn't quite understand everything but that adding features 
Bro027.A.dialogueact914	1753.46	1756.66	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i guess it i guess if you're keeping the back and fixed 
Bro027.A.dialogueact915	1757.29	1757.93	A	PhD	s^am	-1	0	maybe that's it 
Bro027.A.dialogueact916	1758.14	1762.83	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because it seems like just adding information shouldn't get worse results but i guess 
Bro027.A.dialogueact917	1762.83	1766.82	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	results but i guess if you're keeping the number of calcium fixed and the recognize it and 
Bro027.B.dialogueact918	1768.57	1769.26	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	well yeah but i mean just in 
Bro027.C.dialogueact919	1768.58	1769.33	C	PhD	b.%	-1	0	well yeah but i mean just in 
Bro027.B.dialogueact920	1769.26	1772.19	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah but i mean just in general adding information suppose 
Bro027.B.dialogueact921	1772.86	1777.44	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	suppose information you added uh was really terrible feature and all that burning was nice 
Bro027.A.dialogueact922	1777.75	1777.97	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact923	1780.22	1780.59	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right so 
Bro027.B.dialogueact924	1780.59	1782.37	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	right so so um 
Bro027.B.dialogueact925	1783.58	1787.05	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	or or suppose it wasn't completely terrible but it was completely 
Bro027.B.dialogueact926	1787.46	1790.87	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but it was completely equivalent to another one teacher that you had 
Bro027.B.dialogueact927	1791.42	1792.37	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	accepted was noisy 
Bro027.A.dialogueact928	1792.83	1793.18	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	right in that 
Bro027.B.dialogueact929	1793.45	1793.79	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right in that 
Bro027.B.dialogueact930	1793.79	1796.56	B	Professor	s	-1	0	right in that case you wouldn't necessarily expect it to be better at all 
Bro027.A.dialogueact931	1797.05	1798.94	A	PhD	s^bk|s^ng	-1	0	oh yeah i was in a silly things should be better 
Bro027.A.dialogueact932	1799.3	1803.91	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i'm just surprised that you're getting fifteen percent relative worse on that what i'm it it's worse 
Bro027.B.dialogueact933	1799.33	1799.94	B	Professor	b	-1	0	i'm just surprised 
Bro027.C.dialogueact934	1800.65	1801.43	C	PhD	s	-1	0	that you're getting fifteen percent relative it it's worse 
Bro027.B.dialogueact935	1803.8	1805.36	B	Professor	s^2	-1	0	on that what on the highly mismatch yeah i'm a highly mismatch condition so highly 
Bro027.A.dialogueact936	1804.37	1805.69	A	PhD	s^e^m^na	-1	0	on the highly mismatch yeah a highly mismatch condition so highly 
Bro027.C.dialogueact937	1804.8	1806.3	C	PhD	%	-1	0	on the highly mismatch yeah a highly mismatch condition so highly mismatch condition 
Bro027.A.dialogueact938	1805.69	1805.86	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	mismatch yeah so highly 
Bro027.B.dialogueact939	1805.77	1810.65	B	Professor	s	-1	0	mismatch yeah so highly mismatch condition means that in fact the training is a bad assed and if you're just 
Bro027.C.dialogueact940	1810.9	1811.17	C	PhD	b	-1	0	just so having 
Bro027.B.dialogueact941	1811.47	1820.35	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so having having uh a a greater number of teachers if they aren't maybe there any features that you use certainly can can easily uh make things worse 
Bro027.B.dialogueact942	1822.3	1822.73	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	me right if you have 
Bro027.B.dialogueact943	1822.73	1833.34	B	Professor	s	-1	0	me right if you have if you have uh lots of lots of data and you have ten year year your training is representative of your chest and getting more source of information should just tell 
Bro027.B.dialogueact944	1833.58	1837.81	B	Professor	s	-1	0	tell doesn't necessarily work that way 
Bro027.A.dialogueact945	1836.81	1837.02	A	PhD	b	-1	0	doesn't necessarily work that way 
Bro027.C.dialogueact946	1837.83	1838.15	C	PhD	b	-1	0	work that way 
Bro027.B.dialogueact947	1839.51	1840.27	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	so i wonder um 
Bro027.B.dialogueact948	1840.73	1841.45	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro027.B.dialogueact949	1844.94	1848.15	B	Professor	qw	+1	1	well what's your what's your thought about what to do next with um i don't know 
Bro027.C.dialogueact950	1847.65	1848.75	C	PhD	h	-1	0	to do next with um i don't know 
Bro027.C.dialogueact951	1848.75	1849.06	C	PhD	s^no	-1	0	i don't know i'm surprised 
Bro027.C.dialogueact952	1849.06	1850.03	C	PhD	s	+1	1	i'm surprised goes 
Bro027.C.dialogueact953	1850.03	1858.4	C	PhD	s^df	+1	1	goes expected in your on that too that's more when it's more mismatch mismatched to the case for them so 
Bro027.B.dialogueact954	1858.69	1859.44	B	Professor	b	-1	0	them so was there painting 
Bro027.D.dialogueact955	1858.99	1862.21	D	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	them so was there painting said same as a submitted proposal or 
Bro027.D.dialogueact956	1862.52	1864.27	D	PhD	%	-1	0	yeah it's the same train excessively or geez 
Bro027.C.dialogueact957	1863.29	1864.51	C	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	yeah it's the same train excessively geez 
Bro027.C.dialogueact958	1864.51	1873.01	C	PhD	s^e^na^rt	-1	0	excessively teammate with the th it's 
Bro027.D.dialogueact959	1864.76	1865.01	D	PhD	b	-1	0	excessively teammate with 
Bro027.B.dialogueact960	1869.56	1870.3	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro027.B.dialogueact962	1876.21	1881.91	B	Professor	s	+1	1	well we might each uh we may have to experiment with uh better training sense 
Bro027.B.dialogueact963	1882.41	1882.73	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	yeah 
Bro027.B.dialogueact965	1883.19	1883.58	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	but i the other thing 
Bro027.C.dialogueact964	1883.01	1883.33	C	PhD	b	-1	0	but i the other thing 
Bro027.B.dialogueact966	1883.58	1891.97	B	Professor	s	+1	1	but i the other thing is i mean before you found that was the best configuration but you might have to retest those things now that we have different the rest of just different right 
Bro027.B.dialogueact967	1891.97	1892.38	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	rest of just different right so 
Bro027.B.dialogueact968	1892.38	1892.94	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro027.B.dialogueact969	1893.1	1893.46	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact970	1894.75	1895.75	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact971	1896.75	1902.3	B	Professor	qw	+1	2	for instance what's the effective just putting they're all night on without the uh other other path 
Bro027.C.dialogueact972	1902.78	1903.43	C	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact973	1904.43	1906.42	B	Professor	s	+1	2	i mean you know what that straight features do that because you this 
Bro027.C.dialogueact974	1904.5	1904.63	C	PhD	b	-1	0	i mean you 
Bro027.B.dialogueact975	1906.42	1907.36	B	Professor	s	-1	0	do that because you this you know 
Bro027.B.dialogueact977	1907.9	1909.37	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you know and it doesn't combination 
Bro027.C.dialogueact976	1907.53	1907.8	C	PhD	b	-1	0	you know 
Bro027.B.dialogueact978	1910.22	1911.33	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	what if necessarily know it 
Bro027.A.dialogueact979	1911.94	1912.76	A	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	what if you get the it 
Bro027.A.dialogueact980	1913.43	1919.04	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	would it make sense to do the kale t. on the full set of combined futures instead of just 
Bro027.A.dialogueact981	1919.35	1920.53	A	PhD	s^e.%--	-1	0	instead of just on the yeah 
Bro027.C.dialogueact982	1920.85	1921.1	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	on the yeah i i guess um 
Bro027.C.dialogueact983	1921.21	1922.01	C	PhD	s^na	-1	0	i i guess um 
Bro027.C.dialogueact984	1922.01	1922.73	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.C.dialogueact985	1923.55	1929.84	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	the reason they did these crazy is that it's a very pretty tested different things like that 
Bro027.C.dialogueact986	1930.41	1937.85	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	oh i see so i think two kids be ending just because before from that torque having a global 
Bro027.A.dialogueact987	1937.42	1937.85	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh i see 
Bro027.C.dialogueact988	1938.58	1939.12	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.A.dialogueact989	1940.17	1942.03	A	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	so you tried to global failty before and it didn't really 
Bro027.C.dialogueact990	1940.54	1940.75	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	so you tried to global 
Bro027.A.dialogueact992	1942.03	1942.81	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and it didn't really 
Bro027.C.dialogueact991	1941.85	1942.12	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	failty before and it didn't really 
Bro027.C.dialogueact993	1942.12	1943.44	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	and it didn't really i yeah the difference 
Bro027.C.dialogueact994	1943.44	1943.8	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	i yeah the difference 
Bro027.A.dialogueact996	1944.05	1944.35	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	see is between 
Bro027.C.dialogueact995	1943.9	1947.59	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	i see yeah the difference is between these configuration we're not huge but 
Bro027.C.dialogueact997	1947.59	1954.25	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	huge but because marginally better configuration 
Bro027.A.dialogueact998	1953.47	1953.72	A	PhD	b	-1	0	configuration 
Bro027.A.dialogueact999	1954.25	1954.49	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact1000	1955.51	1957.79	B	Professor	fg|s^cs	-1	0	but yeah that's i was another thing to try 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1001	1955.52	1955.76	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	but yeah that's 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1002	1958.09	1959.65	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	since things are things are different 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1003	1958.98	1959.28	C	PhD	b	-1	0	since things are things are different 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1004	1959.28	1959.51	C	PhD	b	-1	0	are different 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1005	1960.04	1960.91	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and i guess if the 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1006	1961.54	1962.33	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	these are all so all these seventy 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1007	1962.33	1969.46	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	so all these seventy three features are going into um he uh fisherman 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1008	1970.23	1970.39	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1009	1970.89	1975.22	B	Professor	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	and is are are there any deltas being computer does that of them 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1010	1977.04	1978.29	C	PhD	s^na	-1	0	if the street features yeah 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1012	1979.18	1980.29	B	Professor	s^bu.%-	-1	0	so but and and just uh 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1011	1979.11	1979.32	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	so 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1013	1980.14	1981.64	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	but and and just uh 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1014	1982.31	1985.26	C	PhD	s	-1	0	them teacher summer used it there so 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1015	1984.26	1984.6	B	Professor	s^2	-1	0	used it 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1016	1985.26	1985.49	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	there so 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1017	1987.0	1993.29	C	PhD	s^bk|s^cs	-1	0	yeah maybe we can at some context from these teachers and since then dating michener's work 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1018	1990.86	1991.16	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	and since then dating 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1019	1991.16	1991.69	B	Professor	%	-1	0	then dating 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1020	1993.62	1993.96	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1021	1994.39	1997.15	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but the other thing i was thinking was um 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1022	1997.14	1997.73	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1023	1999.61	2001.39	B	Professor	s	-1	0	no i lost track of what i was thinking 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1024	2001.64	2001.8	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	thinking 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1025	2002.73	2003.51	A	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	what would be you 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1026	2003.89	2007.3	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	be you said there's a limit of sixty features or something what's 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1027	2007.43	2007.77	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	what's 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1028	2008.08	2015.25	A	PhD	qw	-1	0	the relation between that limit and they um forty eight uh forty eight hundred it's per second 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1029	2009.4	2009.64	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	that limit and 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1030	2009.83	2011.15	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that limit and they um forty eight uh 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1031	2015.82	2018.19	C	PhD	h|s	-1	0	so i i don't understand not no relation if the 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1032	2016.48	2017.26	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so i not no relation 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1033	2017.72	2019.02	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so i i don't understand because it not no relation if the fourth t. a. 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1034	2018.19	2024.73	C	PhD	s	-1	0	i don't understand because it i mean if you're only using if the fourth t. a. hundred bases for transmission of some features 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1035	2019.02	2019.38	A	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	because it fourth t. a. 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1036	2021.03	2021.95	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	if you're only using hundred bases 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1037	2025.26	2031.34	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and charity eats at those cause make like fifteen that's true 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1038	2032.21	2038.36	B	Professor	s	-1	0	the issue was that um this is supposed to be a standard that's then going to be fed to somebody is recognizes somewhere which might 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1039	2038.73	2044.38	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	which might be uh it it might be concerned how many parameters are use used and so forth and so 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1040	2044.38	2045.05	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and so uh 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1041	2045.63	2046.15	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh they felt they want 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1042	2046.15	2047.9	B	Professor	s	+1	1	they felt they want to set a limit 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1043	2048.09	2049.07	B	Professor	s	+1	1	so they chose sixty 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1044	2050.17	2052.23	B	Professor	s	-1	0	some people want to use hundreds of friend enters and and that 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1045	2052.23	2054.48	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uhhuh and and that bothered some other people and 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1047	2054.83	2055.09	A	PhD	b	-1	0	uhhuh people and so it just shows 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1046	2054.48	2055.42	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uhhuh people and so it just shows 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1048	2055.53	2056.26	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so it just shows that i i i think it's 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1049	2056.26	2058.07	B	Professor	s^ba	+1	1	that i i i think it's kind of arbitrary too 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1050	2058.88	2060.96	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but that's that's kind was chosen i 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1051	2060.96	2062.01	B	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	kind was chosen i i remember i was going to say was going to say 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1052	2062.01	2070.4	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	was going to say is that um maybe he with the noise rule uh these things are now more correlated 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1053	2071.33	2077.38	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	so you have two sets of things that are kind of on correlated uh within themselves but 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1054	2077.91	2079.87	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but they're pretty correlated with one another 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1055	2080.11	2080.5	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1056	2080.71	2081.99	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1057	2082.59	2086.8	B	Professor	s	-1	0	they're being fed into these uh variants only got stands and so forth and 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1058	2086.8	2087.8	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so forth and and uh 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1059	2087.13	2087.66	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and uh 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1060	2088.47	2095.86	B	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	so maybe it would be better idea now than it was before to uh have a one guilty over everything 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1062	2097.29	2098.63	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	to be carly yeah she 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1061	2097.15	2097.71	C	PhD	b	-1	0	to be carly 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1063	2098.39	2098.88	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah she 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1064	2099.72	2099.89	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact1065	2099.89	2100.36	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.D.dialogueact1066	2101.25	2104.0	D	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	it's or the action i wasn't attending said they make 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1067	2104.7	2109.6	C	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	it's uh ranging from zero two getting 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1068	2111.22	2111.38	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	from zero 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1070	2111.84	2113.7	C	PhD	s^r	-1	0	from zero to

Bro027.B.dialogueact1072	2116.3	2122.98	B	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	so we found this this uh this macro microphone data and so forth that we're using for these other experiments be pretty good 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1073	2121.0	2121.51	C	PhD	b	-1	0	for these other experiments 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1074	2123.09	2129.74	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so that's if you exclude other alternatives i might be another way started looking is is just improving the training set i mean 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1075	2127.57	2128.21	C	PhD	b	-1	0	looking is is just improving the 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1076	2129.94	2138.52	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	training set i mean we were getting uh lot's recognition 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1077	2139.77	2152.02	B	Professor	s	-1	0	course you do have the problem that we're not able to increase the number of guys fans to match anything so we're only improving 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1078	2152.03	2154.79	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so we're only improving the training or feature set but 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1079	2154.78	2157.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so you're saying feature set but that's still probably something 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1080	2157.75	2161.3	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	so you're saying add the maximum data to the training of mineral that that it something yeah that's the only place we can train 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1081	2160.79	2161.01	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	that that it yeah that's the only place we can train 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1082	2161.01	2162.15	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	yeah that's the only place we can train we can't any other 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1084	2162.16	2162.54	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah we can't any other 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1083	2162.15	2165.08	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	yeah we can't any other stuff with anything other than a standard amount so 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1085	2163.74	2164.1	A	PhD	b	-1	0	stuff with anything other than a standard amount 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1086	2165.08	2165.41	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1087	2166.04	2166.43	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact1088	2167.43	2168.13	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	what what was the train on again 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1089	2168.14	2169.25	A	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	what what was the train on again the one these 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1090	2169.6	2170.32	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	the one these it's to me 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1091	2170.25	2171.94	C	PhD	s	-1	0	it's to me 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1092	2171.32	2171.62	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact1094	2173.56	2173.77	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.C.dialogueact1093	2173.36	2175.42	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	rather small 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1096	2177.23	2178.26	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	bigger than that but uh 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1095	2177.11	2177.56	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	bigger than that but 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1097	2179.59	2182.56	C	PhD	h|s	-1	0	uh it's uh five hundred hidden units 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1098	2183.31	2183.82	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact1099	2184.84	2187.14	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	and again you do experiments back then where you made it bigger and and that was that 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1100	2187.14	2189.76	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	and and that was that was sort of the special point much less 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1101	2189.76	2191.1	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	special point much less than that was worse and 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1102	2189.88	2190.16	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	special point much less than that was worse 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1103	2191.1	2191.24	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	and 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1104	2191.19	2191.35	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1105	2191.9	2193.11	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and one that was much better 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1106	2200.66	2200.99	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.C.dialogueact1108	2203.19	2203.78	C	PhD	b	-1	0	so is it 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1107	2203.1	2214.97	D	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	so is it is it though the performance bigger addition and anaheim and i miss my just something to do with uh uh cleaning up they do that is done on the commit offending noise 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1109	2203.63	2204.46	C	PhD	%	-1	0	so is it is it though the performance 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1110	2214.97	2215.62	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	offending noise so 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1111	2216.67	2218.56	D	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	it's all the noises are from like the idea it's right 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1113	2218.84	2219.04	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	idea it's right 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1112	2218.56	2218.81	D	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	idea it's right

Bro027.C.dialogueact1117	2224.54	2225.95	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	but it it's like the high mismatch of the 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1116	2224.16	2226.95	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but it it's like the high mismatch of the speech that got 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1118	2227.4	2236.43	D	PhD	s	-1	0	after cleaning up maybe having more noise than the uh the training said if they made us fifteen or you go the my skin 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1119	2236.27	2237.05	C	PhD	b	-1	0	skin well 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1120	2237.87	2240.16	D	PhD	s	-1	0	well you you'd know how to any compensation you just panic strictly strictly 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1121	2240.16	2241.43	D	PhD	s	-1	0	you just panic strictly strictly 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1122	2242.0	2242.21	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	they got like 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1123	2242.59	2247.34	D	PhD	s	-1	0	they got like all these different renditions office in the actually in their training so definite right 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1124	2245.27	2245.61	C	PhD	b	-1	0	actually in 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1125	2247.69	2248.12	C	PhD	b	-1	0	right after gaining up and you have 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1126	2247.91	2250.84	D	PhD	s^bu|qy^d^g	-1	0	right after gaining up and you have no a different set of it and it's right 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1127	2251.34	2251.96	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	for that anything 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1128	2251.42	2252.59	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	for that anything new right 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1129	2252.8	2253.41	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	new right 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1130	2253.34	2253.73	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.D.dialogueact1131	2254.41	2258.93	D	PhD	qy	-1	0	something was amiss my that's created off of training like the high me so much 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1132	2261.34	2268.39	C	PhD	qy^bu^d.%--	-1	0	you mean that and uh morals noisy but they're onto some speech car might be a lot more noisy then of 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1133	2267.05	2267.87	D	PhD	b	-1	0	a lot more noisy 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1134	2268.47	2269.42	D	PhD	%--	-1	0	then of that i mean that's a not 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1135	2269.42	2272.85	D	PhD	s	-1	0	oh so right so that i mean that's a not after the noise coming to show the speech that go 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1136	2271.88	2272.32	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	oh so right so coming to show the speech that go 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1137	2272.32	2272.96	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	so right so that go 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1138	2272.96	2277.93	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so right so the training business journal that is being trained with nice compensated stuff maybe that go 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1139	2273.21	2274.09	C	PhD	s^am	-1	0	the training business journal that is being trained maybe 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1140	2274.51	2275.96	D	PhD	%	-1	0	that is being trained with nice compensated 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1141	2275.95	2276.27	D	PhD	b	-1	0	with nice compensated 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1142	2276.99	2277.19	C	PhD	b	-1	0	stuff 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1143	2277.33	2277.46	C	PhD	b	-1	0	stuff 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1145	2278.24	2279.25	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	which makes sense 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1144	2278.21	2278.49	D	PhD	b	-1	0	which makes sense 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1146	2280.43	2289.89	B	Professor	fh|s^bs	-1	0	but uh you're saying you yeah the noisier ones are still going to be even after nice compensation still going to be pretty nicely 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1147	2284.52	2284.82	D	PhD	b	-1	0	are still going to 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1148	2288.66	2289.49	C	PhD	b	-1	0	still going to be pretty nicely 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1149	2290.42	2296.89	D	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	yes or no dawson us common issue it immunity seeing a different set of s. enough and that goes originally that entertaining said off to make it doesn't 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1150	2296.89	2299.03	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	off to make it doesn't that they may do us you know do something so 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1151	2297.45	2297.76	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	that they may do us 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1152	2299.62	2300.03	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	so then they solid 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1153	2299.89	2302.65	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	so then they solid that's not engine off the 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1154	2302.19	2302.56	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	engine off the 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1155	2302.65	2304.76	D	PhD	s	-1	0	engine off the cleaning up it's a different set of enough 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1156	2305.19	2305.42	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	nice 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1157	2305.63	2311.66	D	PhD	s	-1	0	right but the nice and i may not be like come coloring the whole set off it's as that you're getting into speech that got 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1158	2311.38	2311.74	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	right but the got 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1159	2311.74	2315.44	B	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	right but the speech that car the that you're seeing is also reduced annoyed nice the got yeah yeah 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1162	2315.72	2316.92	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	annoyed nice the nice compensation yeah yeah yeah yeah it 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1161	2315.38	2315.7	C	PhD	b	-1	0	annoyed nice the yeah yeah 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1160	2315.25	2316.47	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	annoyed nice the nice compensation yeah yeah yeah yeah it 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1163	2316.7	2317.32	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	nice compensation yeah yeah it is but 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1164	2317.71	2321.32	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	is but something that could be some an issues

Bro027.D.dialogueact1177	2342.17	2343.55	D	PhD	%	-1	0	right i mean you say is a mismatch 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1178	2342.99	2343.37	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right i mean you say is a mismatch 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1179	2343.37	2348.38	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean you say is a mismatch in noise that wasn't there before but if

Bro027.B.dialogueact1330	2698.35	2714.4	B	Professor	s	+1	1	but it's funny i had their hand uh it's a somewhere in between what you're seeing now and and and that what you have with just the pure features then maybe there is some problem of uh of the uh combination of these things correlation between them somehow if 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1331	2713.57	2714.11	C	PhD	b	-1	0	between them somehow if 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1332	2715.01	2724.36	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	it really is than that is hurting you at the moment then i think the issue is to focus on and uh improving uh 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1333	2724.61	2724.78	C	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact1335	2725.51	2725.97	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro027.B.dialogueact1336	2727.59	2728.93	B	Professor	qw.%--	-1	0	so what's the overall so i mean 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1337	2728.93	2730.47	B	Professor	s	-1	0	overall so i mean you have done all the experiments but he said 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1338	2730.47	2738.76	B	Professor	qy^bu^d	-1	0	but he said it was somewhat better say five percent better for the first two conditions and fifteen percent worse for the other one 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1339	2739.55	2742.22	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but it's but of course that one's waited lower so i wonder what the 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1340	2740.08	2740.84	C	PhD	b	-1	0	of course that one's 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1341	2741.36	2741.77	C	PhD	b	-1	0	waited lower 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1342	2742.22	2744.16	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so i wonder what the net effect is i 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1343	2744.89	2749.17	C	PhD	s	-1	0	i i. e. i think it's you plus one or two percent 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1344	2750.6	2751.42	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	it's not that bad but 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1345	2751.42	2757.03	C	PhD	s	-1	0	bad but it's just like two percent gratitude worse must be ditka and to 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1346	2757.64	2758.7	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	and to take it but i 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1347	2758.7	2759.57	C	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	take it but i 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1348	2761.58	2763.18	D	PhD	s	-1	0	well hello all relative debussy better even if it is fifteen 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1349	2763.18	2765.19	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	even if it is fifteen doesn't was because the fifteen 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1350	2765.32	2772.32	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because the fifteen in this is doing like twenty five wanted to fly week 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1351	2770.8	2771.09	B	Professor	b	-1	0	five wanted to fly week

Bro027.B.dialogueact1355	2777.45	2780.66	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so the so the worst it could be if the others were exactly is for they're like 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1356	2779.22	2779.77	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	the others were exactly is they're like 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1358	2781.36	2785.02	B	Professor	fh|s.%-	-1	0	and and uh in sex and see others are much better so this phone so either get 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1357	2780.98	2782.09	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	for and and uh so this phone 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1359	2784.21	2784.43	D	PhD	%	-1	0	are much better 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1360	2785.28	2788.17	D	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah it's so either get cancelled our only like almost the same sentiment 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1362	2788.76	2789.13	B	Professor	fh.%	-1	0	yeah it's that's sentiment 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1361	2788.55	2790.99	C	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah it's that's sexy worse sentiment 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1363	2788.83	2789.41	D	PhD	s^2	-1	0	yeah it's that's sentiment 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1364	2789.92	2790.01	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	that's sexy worse 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1365	2791.09	2791.58	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah um 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1366	2792.08	2793.75	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it should be pretty close to cancel that 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1367	2793.88	2794.23	D	PhD	b	-1	0	to cancel that 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1369	2795.06	2796.4	A	PhD	s	-1	0	you know i've been wondering about something in be 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1368	2794.62	2794.91	C	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.A.dialogueact1370	2796.52	2803.6	A	PhD	s	+1	1	in be um a lot of the um uh five systems um recently have been using l. d. a. 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1371	2804.12	2811.32	A	PhD	s	+1	1	and and they um they run l. d. a. on the features right before they train the models so there's that 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1372	2811.53	2815.54	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	so there's that the old days is right there before the h. m. m. so 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1373	2811.8	2812.13	D	PhD	b	-1	0	so there's that the old days 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1374	2815.96	2817.8	A	PhD	s	-1	0	m. m. so you guys are using all day but it 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1375	2817.8	2820.69	A	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	are using all day but it seems like it's pretty far back in the process 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1376	2821.23	2824.24	D	PhD	s^ng	+1	1	uh do the n. b. is different from day that you're you know are there any that 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1377	2824.46	2831.42	D	PhD	s^df	+1	1	yeah are there any that you saying it's like you take a block off reaches like nine frames or something and then do an idiot on it and then they'd 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1378	2828.51	2828.72	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah like nine frames 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1379	2829.96	2830.29	A	PhD	b	-1	0	or something and then do an idiot 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1380	2831.53	2835.22	D	PhD	s^df	+1	1	yeah you on it and then they'd use the diamond shouted either something like twenty four hour something that and then faded 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1381	2835.49	2837.15	A	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	yeah you you you can't i mean it's you know you're just and then faded h. m. m. 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1382	2835.58	2836.62	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	yeah you you you can't and then faded h. m. m. 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1383	2837.15	2839.4	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	i mean it's you know you're just basically you're shifting yeah so this like it do whatever 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1384	2838.27	2840.71	D	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	basically you're shifting the feature space yeah so this like it do whatever should i 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1385	2839.85	2841.25	A	PhD	s	-1	0	you're shifting the feature space yeah do whatever should i to do that but i'm 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1386	2841.31	2841.61	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah to do that but i'm 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1387	2841.35	2842.56	D	PhD	s^r	+1	1	yeah to do that but i'm not sure time and 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1388	2842.96	2845.63	D	PhD	s	+1	1	not sure time and that would be a that we have applying is only in time frequency 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1389	2845.63	2846.45	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	in time frequency 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1390	2847.58	2848.49	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	i tossed frequency so it's like 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1391	2848.64	2850.46	D	PhD	s	+1	1	so it's like more like a fitting in time rather than 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1392	2850.62	2853.39	D	PhD	s^e.%-	-1	0	oh okay so what it what about in time rather than doing it 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1393	2851.25	2852.15	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay so doing it 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1394	2852.87	2857.08	A	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	so what it what about um what it i mean i don't know if this is doing it 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1395	2857.21	2858.87	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	i mean i don't know if this is a good idea or not but what 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1396	2858.87	2867.44	A	PhD	qw	+1	1	a good idea or not but what if you put ran the other kind of l. d. a. uh on your features right before they go into h. m. m. 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1397	2862.97	2863.4	D	PhD	%	-1	0	uh on your features 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1398	2868.2	2868.32	C	PhD	b	-1	0	mm yeah k. 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1399	2868.65	2869.63	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	mm yeah k. think 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1400	2868.85	2869.6	D	PhD	%	-1	0	mm yeah k. think 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1401	2870.2	2870.43	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	whether what we 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1402	2870.72	2874.27	C	PhD	s	-1	0	whether what we do we do and and these if something like that except that it's 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1403	2874.33	2875.69	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	except that it's nothing there but 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1404	2875.84	2880.11	C	PhD	s	+1	1	yeah right it's it's the right to so yeah so sort of like nothing there but it's it's like a numbing are discriminating and that is but 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1405	2876.6	2876.88	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah it's 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1406	2878.42	2878.74	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	right it's it's a numbing are discriminating 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1407	2878.74	2879.36	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	right it's it's the right to so a numbing are discriminating and that is 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1408	2879.36	2879.6	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	the right to so and that is 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1409	2879.6	2880.09	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	the right to so yeah so sort of like and that is but 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1411	2880.17	2881.32	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah so sort of like the tandem but 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1410	2880.11	2880.35	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	yeah so sort of like but 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1412	2881.49	2885.15	A	PhD	s	+1	1	the tandem stuff it's kind of like non linearly yeah it's 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1413	2883.18	2883.47	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah it's 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1414	2883.85	2884.35	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	non linearly yeah it's

Bro027.A.dialogueact1420	2887.44	2893.3	A	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	but i mean but the other features that you have um the the non tandem ones yeah no 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1419	2887.16	2887.7	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	but i mean 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1421	2891.43	2891.7	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	the the non 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1422	2892.51	2893.03	C	PhD	s	-1	0	tandem ones yeah no 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1423	2893.03	2894.2	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah letting the propose underwear 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1424	2894.33	2897.81	C	PhD	s	+1	1	yeah letting the propose underwear transformed using appreciate that 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1425	2897.81	2897.94	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	appreciate that 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1426	2898.75	2899.04	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	uhhuh it might be that andy 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1427	2899.34	2901.94	C	PhD	s	+1	1	the the argument it might be that andy 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1428	2901.33	2903.86	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	the the argument is kind of and and 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1429	2903.86	2905.18	B	Professor	s	-1	0	of and and it's not like we really know but the argument anyway 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1430	2905.24	2910.38	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but the argument anyway is that um uh we always have to probably just if 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1431	2910.38	2911.73	B	Professor	s	-1	0	to probably just if things are good l. d. 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1432	2911.73	2913.68	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	things are good l. d. a. now and that's their grit 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1433	2913.92	2914.21	A	PhD	b	-1	0	their grit uh they're good because 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1434	2914.43	2921.01	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	uh they're good because you you you learn just distinguish between these categories that you want to because it's english in between antique it 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1435	2921.62	2922.83	B	Professor	s	-1	0	antique it doesn't do that p. 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1436	2922.83	2931.74	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	right doesn't do that p. c. p. c. a. order p. c. a. throws away pieces that are uh maybe not not going to be helpful just because they're small 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1437	2931.87	2932.15	A	PhD	b	-1	0	right but 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1438	2933.05	2937.11	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh the problem is training sets are perfect in testing sent to different so you you 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1439	2937.57	2946.78	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so you you you face the potential problem with scanners and stuff you know they're in their own that's that you are training to discriminate between categories and one space but which 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1440	2946.82	2949.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uhhuh one space but which are really going to be getting is is something else 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1441	2949.53	2949.86	A	PhD	b	-1	0	uhhuh else 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1442	2950.13	2959.12	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so uh stuff runs idea was uh let's feed um both that's just coming if we trained thing and something that's not 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1443	2961.36	2964.41	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	so you have good set of features everybody's work really hard to make and 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1444	2964.71	2965.07	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and then uh you 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1445	2964.99	2967.95	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	and then uh you you just really train it 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1446	2968.12	2971.27	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	uhhuh but you also picks passive it doesn't have that in putting those in 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1447	2970.56	2970.88	A	PhD	b	-1	0	uhhuh it doesn't have 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1448	2971.27	2972.56	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	that in putting those in together 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1449	2973.02	2974.04	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and that that seems so it's kind of like 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1450	2974.04	2983.99	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so it's kind of like a combination of the uh what uh down has been calling feature you know feature combination versus poster combination or something it's 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1451	2983.99	2987.05	B	Professor	s	-1	0	or something it's it's you know you have this or a combination but then you get the features 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1452	2987.05	2991.38	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but then you get the features in that news this feature combination with these these are the things and that 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1453	2991.79	3001.11	B	Professor	s	-1	0	things and that seemed at least in the last fun that she was saying he he when he only did this come into this stuff they actually was was didn't help at all in this particular case there was enough of a difference 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1454	2997.48	2997.76	A	PhD	b	-1	0	they 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1455	3001.11	3004.44	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	there was enough of a difference i guess between the testing training but 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1456	3004.91	3006.25	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but by having both their the fact is some 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1457	3006.38	3009.7	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uhhuh the fact is some other time this kind of stuff is going to help you 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1458	3010.09	3010.59	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and some 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1459	3010.47	3012.14	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and some of the times going to her chin by combining to information 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1461	3012.4	3012.74	A	PhD	b	-1	0	by combining to information 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1460	3012.14	3015.38	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	so you wouldn't necessarily by combining to information sources this you know 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1462	3015.12	3022.38	A	PhD	s^bu.%-	-1	0	so you wouldn't necessarily than want to do l. d. a. on the non tandem teachers because now you're doing something to them that i think that's counter 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1463	3020.32	3020.94	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	now you're doing 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1464	3022.53	3024.31	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	that yeah right i think that's counter to that idea now again 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1465	3024.02	3024.43	A	PhD	b	-1	0	right now again 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1467	3024.61	3024.97	A	PhD	b	-1	0	right now again 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1466	3024.31	3026.44	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	right now again it's we're just trying these different things we don't really know 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1468	3026.44	3027.98	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	things we don't really know what's going to work best but 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1469	3027.98	3032.23	B	Professor	s^df^na	-1	0	right what's going to work best but if that's the hypothesis at least be counter to that hypothesis to do that um 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1470	3032.47	3032.8	A	PhD	b	-1	0	right um 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1471	3033.04	3033.4	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and in 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1472	3033.48	3041.32	B	Professor	s	-1	0	right yeah and in principle you would think that the narrow map would too better at the discriminatory then you know the 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1473	3040.12	3040.41	A	PhD	b	-1	0	right then you know the 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1474	3041.64	3041.98	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1476	3042.55	3043.1	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	well yeah exactly so maybe that 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1475	3042.24	3043.29	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	well yeah exactly so maybe that 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1477	3043.3	3043.61	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah exactly that 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1478	3043.61	3044.03	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah exactly i mean we uh that 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1479	3044.03	3049.14	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean we uh we were getting ready to do the tandem uh stuff for the home five system and 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1480	3049.67	3051.72	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	and um under and i talked about it and 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1481	3051.77	3058.59	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	about it and the idea of the thought was well uh yeah but it you know dinner and that should be better but 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1482	3058.99	3067.55	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	be better but we should at least have uh a number you know just to show that we did try to l. b. a. in places in or all that so that we can 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1483	3067.55	3070.12	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	in or all that so that we can you know show a clear path you know that you have 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1484	3067.75	3068.14	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	in or all that so that we can you know 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1485	3070.12	3071.51	A	PhD	s	-1	0	you know that you have a about it then you know they'll be 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1486	3071.51	3072.26	A	PhD	s	-1	0	a about it then you know they'll be a then you have or all that 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1487	3072.26	3073.04	A	PhD	s	-1	0	a then you have or all that you can see 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1488	3073.04	3074.75	A	PhD	s	-1	0	you can see theoretically so 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1489	3074.83	3075.0	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	theoretically so i was just wondering 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1490	3075.48	3076.45	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i was just wondering i i well i think that's 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1491	3076.59	3076.9	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	i i well i think that's 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1492	3076.6	3077.68	B	Professor	s^ba^na	-1	0	i i well i think that's a good idea 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1493	3077.76	3078.37	A	PhD	b	-1	0	a good idea did did you do 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1494	3078.38	3079.24	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	i know that's did did you do that it 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1496	3079.6	3079.99	A	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	i know that's that it 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1495	3079.24	3080.33	B	Professor	qrr.%-	-1	0	i know that's what that's what we're going that it 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1497	3079.99	3081.53	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	i know that's what that's what we're going to do next as soon as i finish that it 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1498	3081.53	3082.68	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	to do next as soon as i finish this other yeah 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1500	3083.15	3083.46	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1499	3082.66	3082.87	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	this other yeah 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1501	3083.78	3084.16	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah no that's a good idea 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1502	3084.16	3085.41	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	no that's a good idea 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1503	3085.63	3086.24	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.A.dialogueact1505	3087.18	3087.98	A	PhD	s	-1	0	we just want to show i 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1504	3087.08	3087.36	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	we just want to show i 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1506	3087.98	3089.64	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	we just want to show i mean it everybody believes it but oh it's 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1507	3088.49	3088.8	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	mean it everybody oh it's 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1508	3088.8	3089.16	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	mean it everybody believes it but oh it's 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1509	3089.64	3090.72	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	believes it but no nobody mine eight nine 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1510	3090.03	3090.37	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	no nobody mine eight nine 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1511	3090.37	3091.63	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah no nobody mine eight nine be true i mean it's 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1513	3091.86	3092.15	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah be true i mean it's it's it's 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1512	3091.63	3093.89	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	yeah be true i mean it's it's it's it's it's a good idea i mean 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1514	3093.89	3111.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah it's it's a good idea i mean one of the things that always disturb me uh in uh the resurgence of their own that's that happened in the eighties is that um a lot of people because they're on that's pretty easy day to use a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without uh looking it all into the linear uh versions of them and 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1515	3104.28	3104.65	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah a 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1516	3109.91	3110.41	A	PhD	b	-1	0	the linear uh versions of them 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1518	3111.42	3111.71	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1517	3111.21	3115.31	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and uh people are doing a friend that's but not looking in the air filters and you know i mean 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1519	3115.31	3116.06	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and you know i mean uh so i 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1520	3116.89	3119.18	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah and everybody's putting out uh so i think yeah that's like good idea to try it 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1521	3119.1	3119.21	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and everybody's putting out 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1522	3119.21	3121.26	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	and everybody's putting out on their systems now and so 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1523	3121.26	3122.14	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	now and so that's what made me 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1524	3122.31	3124.76	A	PhD	s	-1	0	that's what made me wonder about this this well you're putting in their systems 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1525	3124.05	3126.35	B	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	this this well you're putting in their systems off and on for ten years but but 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1526	3124.8	3124.93	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	this this well you're putting in their systems 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1527	3126.35	3127.59	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	you know what i mean it's but but but uh 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1528	3127.59	3130.58	A	PhD	s^bk|s^df^ng	-1	0	you know what i mean it's it's it's like in the hum five evaluations you know and you read but uh 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1529	3130.58	3135.33	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	you know and you read the system descriptions and everybody's got you know l. t. a. on their teachers and now they all have god i see 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1530	3132.02	3133.09	B	Professor	s^2	-1	0	and everybody's got you know they all have god i see 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1531	3133.74	3134.54	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	got you know l. t. a. on their teachers i see 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1532	3135.33	3135.73	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1533	3135.83	3136.16	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1534	3136.42	3136.81	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.C.dialogueact1535	3137.59	3139.84	C	PhD	s	-1	0	it's the transformation are making them 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1536	3140.08	3144.46	C	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah so it's different yeah exactly but they're trained in the same as a sign on h. m. m. r. 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1537	3143.13	3144.37	A	PhD	s^bk|s^nd	-1	0	yeah so it's different yeah exactly as a sign on h. m. m. r. 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1538	3144.43	3144.94	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah exactly m. r. 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1539	3144.94	3145.3	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah exactly because they don't have these m. r. 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1540	3145.3	3148.77	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because they don't have these you know mismatch is that that you guys have so 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1541	3146.67	3147.24	C	PhD	b	-1	0	you know mismatch is that 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1542	3148.77	3151.94	A	PhD	s	-1	0	that you guys have so that's why i was wondering if maybe it's not even a good idea i 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1543	3151.06	3151.31	C	PhD	b	-1	0	not even a good idea i 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1544	3151.94	3152.49	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	not even a good idea i don't know 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1545	3152.57	3153.92	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	don't know enough about it but 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1546	3152.85	3153.13	C	PhD	b	-1	0	don't know enough about it but 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1547	3153.92	3155.28	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	enough about it but i mean part 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1548	3155.67	3156.68	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i mean part of why i think 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1549	3156.68	3175.14	B	Professor	s^bu|qy^d^g	-1	0	of why i think part of what you were getting into the kale t. you were describing me one point that you wanted to know getting good or talking features was combining that they're different temper all ranges was the key thing was happening or where there was this kind of thing right so you were just trying 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1550	3175.14	3176.07	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so you were just trying think you i 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1551	3176.13	3176.91	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	think you i 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1552	3176.91	3179.33	B	Professor	s	-1	0	think you i mean this is it doesn't have the l. d. a. aspect but as far as 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1553	3179.33	3184.94	B	Professor	s^bu|qy^d^g	-1	0	but as far as uh or sacrificing transformation you were trying that 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1554	3184.18	3184.4	C	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact1556	3185.26	3185.71	B	Professor	s	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro027.D.dialogueact1563	3197.66	3200.79	D	PhD	s^tc	-1	0	you know i mean exploding about a little created art you really to work 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1564	3201.06	3207.91	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	with like escalate into using it's an honoring energy uh after the cleaning up 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1565	3208.81	3211.13	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so what i've been trying was um 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1566	3212.26	3212.69	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1567	3213.32	3223.29	D	PhD	s	-1	0	for the uh for the nice compensation because thank do find if feature based on the today show for the and just said it's peaked off cooking and before being so that 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1568	3223.64	3228.37	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so that if if that like pretty close to one which means it's speech and it is 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1569	3228.37	3232.97	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and it is but it's close to see it just that it's like and i said they'll probably do value 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1570	3233.71	3237.85	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so this thing uh but ford by and then have been binds 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1571	3238.3	3240.65	D	PhD	s	-1	0	separating them differently frequented binding 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1572	3240.65	3243.86	D	PhD	s	-1	0	frequented binding that i think separate division money to in trying to combine them 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1573	3244.63	3245.02	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh uh 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1574	3245.78	3249.58	D	PhD	s	-1	0	uh i run is being like it doesn't have to be concealed newer you're if it if it and 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1575	3249.06	3249.49	B	Professor	b	-1	0	if it and 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1576	3249.58	3255.31	D	PhD	s	-1	0	if it and uh it gave me like uh one point one more than one put into major improvements over fifty two 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1577	3255.31	3258.42	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	over fifty two point six adventure fifty four point eight so it's like 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1578	3258.54	3261.35	D	PhD	s	-1	0	eight so it's like on this like you more them plus an and just like 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1579	3259.9	3260.5	B	Professor	b	-1	0	on this like you more them plus an

Bro027.D.dialogueact1696	3492.6	3493.74	D	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	because most of it is sat 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1697	3493.74	3497.33	D	PhD	s	-1	0	of it is sat then you have drop some silence they're upset sentencing we haven't up 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1698	3496.33	3496.73	B	Professor	b	-1	0	they're upset sentencing 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1699	3497.39	3498.79	D	PhD	s	-1	0	we haven't up tennis instead 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1700	3499.83	3500.59	C	PhD	s^na	-1	0	us to not yeah yeah 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1701	3500.72	3500.93	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	to not yeah yeah

Bro027.C.dialogueact1705	3502.14	3502.53	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	the mm biggest 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1704	3502.1	3504.94	D	PhD	s	-1	0	the mm biggest classification would be the speed inside and 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1706	3507.67	3515.63	D	PhD	s	+1	1	so by having audition snows feature would say if this is beaten and this is non speech and it certainly has seen someone seem nice conditions within your own it

Bro027.A.dialogueact1708	3516.95	3519.91	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	what do you do you have that feature available for d. testing 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1709	3520.51	3523.25	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but i mean we have yet spending to be eighty to the back and feature to the 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1710	3523.56	3524.43	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and feature to the back in because they're talking 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1711	3524.43	3527.55	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	oh i see back in because they're talking at the back enough and everything all the features that can do that so 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1712	3527.24	3528.16	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh i see i see can do that so so then you 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1713	3527.86	3528.09	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	oh i see i see can do that so so then you 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1714	3528.56	3528.98	A	PhD	s^bk^r	-1	0	i see so then you 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1715	3528.66	3529.32	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i see so then you that that that is coming 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1716	3529.32	3532.58	D	PhD	s	-1	0	okay that that that is coming from a seven eight nearly it on some of the eighty 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1717	3532.69	3533.04	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay okay of the eighty we just 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1718	3533.21	3533.63	A	PhD	s^bk^r	-1	0	okay we just 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1719	3533.53	3536.21	D	PhD	s^e.%-	-1	0	okay so you're saying feed that also we just we just suddenly getting a 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1720	3535.98	3538.78	A	PhD	s^bu	+1	1	so you're saying feed that also into the no i yeah getting a bit yeah so it it's actually discriminating 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1721	3537.24	3537.42	D	PhD	%	-1	0	into bit yeah so 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1722	3537.91	3540.14	D	PhD	s	+1	1	into the no i yeah yeah bit yeah so it it's actually discriminating information 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1723	3538.95	3539.3	A	PhD	b	-1	0	the no i yeah yeah it it's actually discriminating information 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1724	3539.47	3539.83	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah information 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1725	3540.85	3541.14	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so that 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1726	3541.72	3542.02	D	PhD	%--	-1	0	you could feed so that 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1727	3542.65	3544.18	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	you could feed into the their own that the others keep 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1728	3544.18	3560.83	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	the others keep could do is just um modified b. uh output probabilities of the of the uh girl that tendon there on that based on the fact that you have a silence from

Bro027.C.dialogueact1731	3563.16	3563.68	C	PhD	b	-1	0	so you 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1732	3563.87	3567.75	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	so you have an independent estimate or of what the silence probability is 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1733	3568.36	3571.26	B	Professor	s^cs^df	-1	0	and you could multiply the two things and me normalize 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1735	3572.2	3572.87	C	PhD	b	-1	0	uh i mean you have to 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1734	3572.2	3576.83	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh i mean you have to i'm commentary part deal with that uh 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1736	3576.92	3581.36	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	deal with that uh i mean go backwards from what the non linear airy would yeah would be but but through through the self from 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1737	3578.0	3580.18	D	PhD	s^t1	-1	0	go backwards from what the non linear airy would yeah would through through the self from

Bro027.B.dialogueact1747	3590.33	3593.96	B	Professor	s	-1	0	this way i mean you you have this time okay system with houses thousand parameters 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1748	3594.1	3594.33	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and you can tell that 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1749	3594.31	3596.52	B	Professor	s:s^co	-1	0	and you can tell that uh learn this thing you 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1750	3596.52	3598.38	B	Professor	s:s^fe	-1	0	thing you can say it's silence go away 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1751	3598.38	3598.86	B	Professor	s:s^co^fe	-1	0	silence go away 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1752	3600.07	3600.33	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	i mean 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1753	3600.95	3601.28	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	i mean it doesn't i 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1754	3601.28	3601.62	B	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	it doesn't i 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1755	3601.97	3604.13	B	Professor	s	-1	0	what what if you it doesn't i think i think the second one sounds a lot more direct uh 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1756	3603.53	3603.84	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	what sounds a lot more direct 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1757	3604.07	3605.0	A	PhD	qw^cs.%--	-1	0	what if you right so what if uh 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1758	3604.5	3604.91	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	what if you uh 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1759	3605.28	3605.59	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right so what if 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1760	3605.59	3611.01	A	PhD	qw^cs	-1	0	right so what if you then uh since you know this what if you only use all that on the speech portion 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1761	3613.11	3613.86	B	Professor	h	-1	0	well well uh that's like 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1762	3613.35	3614.42	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	well i guess that's the same that's well uh that's like 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1763	3613.97	3614.87	A	PhD	s	-1	0	well i guess that's the same that's well uh that's like 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1764	3614.99	3615.99	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i guess that's the same that's similar yeah i mean you have to 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1765	3615.15	3615.33	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	similar yeah i mean you have to 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1766	3615.33	3617.19	B	Professor	s	-1	0	similar i mean i mean trained yeah i mean you have to actually write continuously but it's 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1768	3617.4	3619.55	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i mean i mean trained and that only on but it's 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1767	3617.19	3617.64	B	Professor	s.%	-1	0	i mean i mean trained but it's 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1769	3620.17	3620.45	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	well no you want to train 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1770	3620.45	3622.94	B	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	well no you want to train it on on the non speech also because 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1771	3622.94	3624.87	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	non speech also because that's part of what you're learning and it 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1772	3625.17	3628.77	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	i mean if you're going to if you're going to multiply to to to generate that it's has just english between 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1773	3625.87	3626.4	D	PhD	s^t1	-1	0	to to to generate that it's 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1774	3627.25	3637.6	A	PhD	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	i mean if you're going to if you're going to multiply up and then that by this other decision uh would then you don't care about whether it makes that distinction right has just english between we have but this other 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1775	3637.36	3637.56	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right we have but this other 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1776	3637.57	3639.01	B	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	right we have but this other thing is in perfect so 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1777	3639.76	3640.19	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so the bringing some 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1778	3640.02	3642.66	B	Professor	s	-1	0	right okay that's a good the bringing some information from that so 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1779	3641.35	3642.03	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right okay that's a good information from that so 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1780	3642.03	3642.53	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	that's a good so 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1781	3642.67	3643.36	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	that's a good point so 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1782	3644.25	3644.63	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1783	3645.07	3650.44	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	now the only thing that that bothers me about all this is that i i i the the fact it's 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1784	3650.44	3653.71	B	Professor	s	+1	1	it's sort of bothersome that you're getting more deletion 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1785	3654.15	3654.44	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.C.dialogueact1786	3655.13	3655.41	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	so 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1787	3655.98	3657.51	C	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	so i might maybe look at 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1788	3658.65	3666.33	C	PhD	qy.%--	+1	1	is it due to the fact that um probably the kid assignments idea put something that focus 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1789	3667.56	3668.0	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	it's too high too 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1790	3668.44	3669.2	B	Professor	s^2	-1	0	it's too high too too i uh

Bro027.B.dialogueact1793	3670.79	3671.04	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah so maybe so if it's the kids the 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1794	3671.04	3671.52	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	so maybe so if it's the kids the 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1796	3671.52	3671.86	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	so maybe so if it's the kids the 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1795	3671.09	3675.6	C	PhD	qy^bu^d.%-	-1	0	so maybe so if it's the kids the thing you think in my yeah like something @reject@ you'd never be yeah 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1797	3674.24	3675.21	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	yeah like something @reject@ you'd never be yeah 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1798	3675.88	3676.13	B	Professor	b	-1	0	@reject@ yeah it it they would do it's 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1800	3675.96	3676.24	C	PhD	b	-1	0	@reject@ yeah it it they would do it's 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1799	3675.9	3676.04	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	@reject@ yeah it it they would do it's 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1801	3676.04	3681.1	D	PhD	s	-1	0	it it they would do it's too high in this and like everything is more like uh like probably 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1802	3682.01	3682.39	B	Professor	b	-1	0	like 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1803	3682.719	3684.543	C	PhD	x	-1	0	not any uh like it's hard to you doing any distinction 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1804	3682.84	3686.81	D	PhD	s	-1	0	not any uh yeah like it's hard to you doing any distinction between speech and on speech or 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1805	3684.95	3685.43	C	PhD	b	-1	0	any uh yeah doing any distinction between speech 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1806	3686.87	3688.54	D	PhD	s^bsc	-1	0	and on speech or mean different him pluses

Bro027.A.dialogueact1810	3692.19	3692.59	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah for 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1811	3692.59	3693.46	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah for the uh 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1812	3693.46	3695.34	A	PhD	s	-1	0	the uh but if you could do this but 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1813	3695.83	3707.95	A	PhD	qy	-1	0	this but if you look at b. um innocent high mismatch the output of the net on the high mismatch case and just look at you know the distribution versus the the other ones do you see more peaks or something 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1814	3704.36	3704.77	C	PhD	b	-1	0	versus the 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1815	3709.58	3712.26	C	PhD	s^na	-1	0	yeah yeah for instance yeah and trippy creepiest uh you know but 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1816	3712.13	3712.58	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah yeah for instance but 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1818	3712.58	3713.37	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	yeah yeah for instance but 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1817	3712.26	3712.39	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	yeah yeah for instance but 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1819	3714.7	3715.53	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	but it's it seems that there's eating at 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1820	3714.75	3721.44	C	PhD	s	-1	0	but it's it seems that there's eating at twelve doesn't but he doesn't drop uh too many friends because get 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1821	3721.44	3723.6	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	friends because get the number education it's reasonable 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1822	3724.09	3727.92	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but it's just when we had that and then find that might be then 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1823	3729.02	3729.2	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	another promise you don't 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1824	3729.2	3736.54	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	another promise you don't want to take i guess wait for the output of the v. a. d. before you can put something into the other system can sell shoot 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1825	3729.46	3730.34	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	another promise you don't want to take i guess 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1826	3736.54	3738.74	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	system can sell shoot up the latency a lot right 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1827	3738.74	3739.07	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	a lot right my missing something 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1828	3739.18	3740.31	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	my missing something

Bro027.B.dialogueact1833	3744.1	3744.34	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	so that's maybe 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1834	3744.47	3746.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so that's maybe a problem with what i was saying but 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1835	3746.51	3746.69	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	saying but 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1836	3747.45	3749.01	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	but if you were but uh i guess 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1837	3749.76	3753.71	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but if you were going to put it in as a means have it by the time you get to the tandem that right 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1838	3753.71	3753.99	A	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	tandem that right 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1839	3754.93	3755.32	D	PhD	h	-1	0	um but 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1840	3755.88	3758.16	D	PhD	h|s^ng	-1	0	but we would don't have haven't actually because it's it doesn't high 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1842	3758.38	3758.94	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	because it's it doesn't high 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1841	3758.16	3759.76	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because it's it doesn't high rate angie to 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1844	3760.06	3760.86	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	uh me as a 
Bro027.D.dialogueact1843	3759.94	3760.66	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	uh rate angie to me as a 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1845	3761.17	3761.53	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.A.dialogueact1846	3762.2	3762.5	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay it's kind 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1847	3762.6	3763.44	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	okay it's kind of done and i mean some of the things 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1848	3763.44	3765.8	B	Professor	s	-1	0	of done and i mean some of the things are non parallel but 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1849	3765.86	3769.69	B	Professor	s	-1	0	non parallel but it be in parallel with with attendant that 
Bro027.A.dialogueact1850	3769.96	3770.23	A	PhD	b	-1	0	attendant that 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1851	3771.1	3771.51	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact1852	3773.21	3774.76	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so maybe if that doesn't work 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1853	3775.02	3775.53	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1854	3775.87	3778.49	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	um that'd be to see if that was the problem anyway 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1855	3779.44	3786.38	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and and and and i guess another alternative would be to take the feature that you're feeding into the d. d. and feeding it into the other one as well 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1856	3779.64	3779.85	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and and and 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1858	3787.25	3789.15	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and then maybe we just learn learn it better 
Bro027.C.dialogueact1857	3787.0	3787.63	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and then maybe we just learn 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1859	3791.2	3791.51	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro027.B.dialogueact1860	3792.14	3792.53	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	that's yeah that's interesting 
Bro027.B.dialogueact1861	3792.53	3806.03	B	Professor	s^bk|s^cs	-1	0	that's yeah that's interesting thing to try to see what's going on is that in the highly mismatch condition it's um causing deletion this by having this silence probability up
