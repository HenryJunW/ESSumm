Bro019.C.dialogueact15	26.134	29.444	C	Professor	z	-1	0	okay but they weren't so close that they got quite the the really good not that they 
Bro019.A.dialogueact16	29.25	29.61	A	PhD	z	-1	0	okay not that they 
Bro019.C.dialogueact17	29.914	30.704	C	Professor	z	-1	0	okay not that they mean they didn't moments

Bro019.C.dialogueact21	36.024	39.434	C	Professor	z	-1	0	on the other hand they're not so close that they got rid of all the interference so it was 
Bro019.C.dialogueact23	39.434	42.194	C	Professor	z	-1	0	so it was not didn't seem to be a good point to them and then if 
Bro019.C.dialogueact24	42.654	46.404	C	Professor	z	-1	0	them and then if you only had to have one like in some ways you can target the palace good choice precisely because 
Bro019.C.dialogueact25	46.404	47.874	C	Professor	z	-1	0	choice precisely because it's in the middle 
Bro019.A.dialogueact26	48.31	48.86	A	PhD	z	-1	0	there's 
Bro019.C.dialogueact27	49.0	52.63	C	Professor	z	-1	0	uh some kinds of junk that you get with these things that you don't get will tell a little

Bro019.C.dialogueact29	57.12	57.3	C	Professor	z	-1	0	but 
Bro019.C.dialogueact30	58.183	64.043	C	Professor	z	-1	0	given the choice we there seem to be very strong opinions for uh 
Bro019.A.dialogueact32	66.66	68.33	A	PhD	z	-1	0	is mike nobodies oh you're might

Bro019.C.dialogueact73	120.35	123.21	C	Professor	s^t	-1	0	so one thing is to talk about a kick off meaning 
Bro019.C.dialogueact74	124.11	124.63	C	Professor	s^am^e	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro019.C.dialogueact75	125.734	126.474	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh and 
Bro019.C.dialogueact76	126.564	140.826	C	Professor	s^t	+1	1	and then just uh i guess um progress reports individually and then uh plans for or wherever go between now and then 
Bro019.C.dialogueact77	141.55	142.11	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	i 
Bro019.F.dialogueact78	143.08	147.73	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	could say a few words about um some of the uh compute stuff that's happening around here so 
Bro019.F.dialogueact79	147.91	149.05	F	PhD	s^df	+1	1	around here so the people in the group now 
Bro019.C.dialogueact80	149.56	149.95	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro019.C.dialogueact81	151.425	151.875	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro019.C.dialogueact82	153.06	153.79	C	Professor	qw^co	-1	0	you start with that 
Bro019.C.dialogueact83	154.04	155.5	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	that's we um 
Bro019.F.dialogueact84	154.15	154.4	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	that's 
Bro019.C.dialogueact86	155.5	155.75	C	Professor	b	-1	0	we um 
Bro019.F.dialogueact85	155.44	156.15	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	we um so we 
Bro019.F.dialogueact87	156.55	163.736	F	PhD	s	+1	1	so we just put in an order for about twelve new machines uh to use as sort of a computer farm 
Bro019.F.dialogueact88	164.106	165.086	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	and um uh we ordered 
Bro019.F.dialogueact89	165.731	167.711	F	PhD	s	-1	0	uh we ordered uh send like one hundred and 
Bro019.F.dialogueact90	167.961	168.821	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	hundred and um 
Bro019.F.dialogueact91	169.43	171.72	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i'm not sure exactly how long it'll take for those to come and but 
Bro019.F.dialogueact92	171.96	174.34	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	to come and but uh in addition we're running so the 
Bro019.F.dialogueact93	174.829	178.949	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so the plan for using these is uh we're running p. making customs here and 
Bro019.F.dialogueact94	178.949	182.629	F	PhD	s	+1	1	here and andreas sort of caught in that all uh sick stepping up to speed 
Bro019.F.dialogueact95	183.058	190.27	F	PhD	s	+1	1	and he's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um run things using he making customs you don't actually have 
Bro019.F.dialogueact96	190.27	193.13	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	you don't actually have to right p. makes trips and things like that the simplest 
Bro019.F.dialogueact97	193.579	194.299	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	the simplest thing i can send an e. mail 
Bro019.F.dialogueact98	194.299	195.509	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	2	thing i can send an e. mail around or maybe 
Bro019.F.dialogueact99	195.509	198.169	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	2	around or maybe i should do i think you on the website about it or something um 
Bro019.F.dialogueact100	198.679	199.069	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	how about um there's 
Bro019.C.dialogueact102	199.88	201.47	C	Professor	qw^cs	+1	2	how about an e. mail points to the i think you have to have there's a yeah yeah 
Bro019.F.dialogueact101	199.749	200.149	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	how about an e. mail points to the there's a 
Bro019.C.dialogueact104	201.47	201.92	C	Professor	qy^f	-1	0	i think you have to have yeah yeah 
Bro019.F.dialogueact103	201.4	201.96	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	i think you have to have yeah yeah 
Bro019.C.dialogueact105	201.92	202.46	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i think you have to have yeah yeah yeah 
Bro019.C.dialogueact106	202.85	203.07	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah uh there's 
Bro019.F.dialogueact107	203.587	207.137	F	PhD	s	-1	0	uh there's a command uh that you can use called run command run bash command 
Bro019.F.dialogueact108	207.307	208.377	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	run bash command run hyphen command 
Bro019.F.dialogueact109	208.497	209.247	F	PhD	s^bsc^e	-1	0	run hyphen command and 
Bro019.F.dialogueact110	209.754	219.714	F	PhD	s	+1	1	and if you say that and then some job that you want to execute uh it will find the fastest currently available machine and export your job to that machine 
Bro019.F.dialogueact111	220.234	221.634	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	and uh and it there and will duplicate 
Bro019.F.dialogueact112	221.634	223.124	F	PhD	s	-1	0	it there and will duplicate your environment so 
Bro019.F.dialogueact113	223.124	223.534	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro019.F.dialogueact114	224.51	227.49	F	PhD	s	-1	0	you can try this as a simple test with uh the ls commands you can say 
Bro019.F.dialogueact115	227.55	229.61	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	commands you can say run dash command a l. s. 
Bro019.F.dialogueact116	230.123	238.173	F	PhD	fh|s^e	-1	0	and um it'll actually export that ls command to some machine in the institute and um do an ls on your current directory soaks 
Bro019.F.dialogueact117	238.633	241.613	F	PhD	s^bs	-1	0	soaks substitute ls for whatever command you want to run and 
Bro019.F.dialogueact118	241.753	245.583	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	to run and um and that's a simple way to get started using using this 
Bro019.F.dialogueact119	246.152	252.5	F	PhD	s	+1	1	and so assuming we get all the new machines up um then we'll have lots more compete to use now that 
Bro019.F.dialogueact120	252.82	260.032	F	PhD	s	-1	0	to use now that one of the nice things is that uh each machine it's part of d. p. making customs network has attributes associated with it uh after 
Bro019.F.dialogueact121	260.422	263.442	F	PhD	fh|s^e	-1	0	uh after beats like how much memory the machine has what it speed 
Bro019.F.dialogueact122	263.442	264.282	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	what it speed is what it operating system 
Bro019.F.dialogueact123	264.282	265.332	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	is what it operating system and when 
Bro019.F.dialogueact124	265.732	270.632	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and when you use something like run command you canned specified those attributes four year program for example 
Bro019.F.dialogueact125	270.632	275.589	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	year program for example if you only want your thing to run under linux you can give it the linux attribute and then 
Bro019.F.dialogueact126	275.589	279.449	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	attribute and then it will find that fastest available linux machine and run it on that so 
Bro019.F.dialogueact127	279.599	279.849	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	that so 
Bro019.F.dialogueact128	280.199	282.689	F	PhD	s	-1	0	you can control where your jobs go as it extends all 
Bro019.F.dialogueact129	282.929	284.489	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	as it extends all the way down to an individual machine each machine 
Bro019.F.dialogueact130	284.489	287.559	F	PhD	s	-1	0	machine each machine has actually which is the name of it self so you 
Bro019.F.dialogueact131	287.669	289.989	F	PhD	s	-1	0	self so you can give that as an actor but not only around that 
Bro019.F.dialogueact132	290.604	296.024	F	PhD	s	-1	0	if there's already a job running on some machine and you're trying to select your job will get queued up and then when 
Bro019.F.dialogueact133	296.561	300.851	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and then when that resource that machine becomes available your job lit exported there 
Bro019.F.dialogueact134	301.331	301.621	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro019.F.dialogueact135	302.52	303.72	F	PhD	s	+1	1	there's a lot of nice features to it and that kind 
Bro019.F.dialogueact136	303.72	306.27	F	PhD	s	+1	1	nice features to it and that kind of helps to balance the load of the machines and uh 
Bro019.F.dialogueact137	306.27	306.61	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	and uh 
Bro019.F.dialogueact138	307.032	309.272	F	PhD	s	-1	0	right now andreas and i've been the main one using it in where 
Bro019.F.dialogueact139	309.272	310.322	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	it in where uh d. s. or i 
Bro019.F.dialogueact140	310.322	314.672	F	PhD	s	-1	0	says uh d. s. or i recognize or has all this p. make custom stuff built into it so 
Bro019.C.dialogueact142	314.84	318.32	C	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	says i understand your you he's using all the machines and you're using on a machine yes this enough into it so yeah exactly 
Bro019.F.dialogueact141	314.672	315.082	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	says i understand your you into it so 
Bro019.C.dialogueact144	318.46	319.6	C	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	yes this enough exactly

Bro019.F.dialogueact148	326.022	328.272	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i fired off uh training job and i fired off a 
Bro019.F.dialogueact149	328.272	329.952	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and i fired off a recognition job and 
Bro019.F.dialogueact150	329.952	335.742	F	PhD	s:qy	-1	0	recognition job and i get to the email about midnight from my thing uh are you running too training simultaneously uses 
Bro019.F.dialogueact151	335.822	338.042	F	PhD	s:s	-1	0	uses it my my my my jobs are not getting right so i had 
Bro019.F.dialogueact152	338.642	340.022	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so i had to back off a little bit but soon as 
Bro019.F.dialogueact153	340.022	340.222	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	but soon as 
Bro019.F.dialogueact154	340.832	345.052	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but soon as we get the more machines than uh then we'll have more computer available so 
Bro019.F.dialogueact155	345.172	345.512	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro019.F.dialogueact156	346.322	346.662	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	um that's just a 
Bro019.F.dialogueact157	346.662	348.892	F	PhD	s	-1	0	um that's just a quick update uh what we've got 
Bro019.F.dialogueact159	349.372	349.542	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	um i've 
Bro019.G.dialogueact158	349.37	353.02	G	Grad	fg|s^rt	-1	0	um i've have a question about thee uh paralyze ish and so 
Bro019.F.dialogueact160	353.238	353.548	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so 
Bro019.G.dialogueact161	353.37	357.08	G	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	so um let's say like a thousand little little jobs to do um 
Bro019.F.dialogueact162	357.29	357.54	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	um 
Bro019.G.dialogueact163	357.46	359.45	G	Grad	fh|qw	-1	0	um how do i do it with run command 
Bro019.G.dialogueact164	359.59	360.23	G	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	you could write a script 
Bro019.F.dialogueact165	360.4	365.75	F	PhD	s	-1	0	you could write a script uh which called run command on each subject right a thousand times 
Bro019.G.dialogueact166	361.72	362.22	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	uh which 
Bro019.G.dialogueact167	364.29	365.29	G	Grad	qy^2^d	-1	0	on each subject right a thousand times 
Bro019.F.dialogueact168	365.75	365.97	F	PhD	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	subject right 
Bro019.F.dialogueact170	366.17	368.527	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	but you probably want to be careful with that because 
Bro019.G.dialogueact169	366.16	366.4	G	Grad	b	-1	0	but you probably 
Bro019.F.dialogueact171	368.527	371.897	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	with that because um you don't want to saturate the network 
Bro019.F.dialogueact172	372.257	372.767	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bro019.F.dialogueact173	373.297	374.597	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bro019.F.dialogueact174	375.84	381.7	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	you know you should you should probably not run more than say ten jobs yourself at any one time 
Bro019.F.dialogueact175	382.09	384.52	F	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	uh just because then it would keep other people it's too much file transfer 
Bro019.G.dialogueact176	383.69	383.88	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	it would keep other it's too 
Bro019.G.dialogueact177	383.88	385.59	G	Grad	s	-1	0	it would keep other people well it's not it's too much file transfer and so 
Bro019.F.dialogueact178	385.52	392.28	F	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	well it's not that so much as that you know uh with if everybody ran fifty jobs it once then it would just bring everything to a halt and you know people and so 
Bro019.F.dialogueact179	392.28	393.98	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and you know people jobs get delayed so 
Bro019.F.dialogueact180	393.98	395.99	F	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	jobs get delayed so it's sort of a sharing thing 
Bro019.F.dialogueact182	396.53	396.84	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro019.G.dialogueact181	396.27	396.49	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	um 
Bro019.F.dialogueact183	396.89	401.43	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	um just try to limit it to some stuff sometimes some number around ten jobs at a time um 
Bro019.F.dialogueact184	401.83	402.2	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	a time um so if you had a script 
Bro019.F.dialogueact185	402.48	412.57	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	so if you had a script for example i had a thousand things that needed to run um you'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were going to use run command uh to only have ten of those going at a time and 
Bro019.F.dialogueact186	412.82	415.6	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	a time and uh then when one of those finishing fire off another one

Bro019.F.dialogueact206	439.85	441.16	F	PhD	s^tc.%--	-1	0	but uh you can also if you have that level 
Bro019.F.dialogueact207	441.16	450.04	F	PhD	s	-1	0	if you have that level of sterilization um and you don't want to have to worry about writing the logic in munich pearl script to take care of that you can use um he make and just the pavement 
Bro019.G.dialogueact208	449.877	450.807	G	Grad	s^2	-1	0	um he make and just the pavement 
Bro019.F.dialogueact209	450.786	458.056	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and he knew basically writing make files that uh you know your final job depends on these one thousand things and when you run the pavement 
Bro019.G.dialogueact210	450.807	451.367	G	Grad	%	-1	0	and he knew basically writing the pavement 
Bro019.G.dialogueact211	457.029	457.759	G	Grad	b	-1	0	thousand things 
Bro019.F.dialogueact212	458.376	465.41	F	PhD	s^cs^rt	-1	0	and when you run p. make uh on your make file you can give it the dash capital jay and and number and that number represents 
Bro019.G.dialogueact213	464.17	464.83	G	Grad	b	-1	0	and and 
Bro019.F.dialogueact214	465.41	468.75	F	PhD	s	-1	0	number and that number represents how many uh machines to at once and 
Bro019.F.dialogueact216	468.93	471.03	F	PhD	s	-1	0	at once and then will make sure that it never goes above that 
Bro019.G.dialogueact215	468.787	469.047	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	at once and then will make sure that it 
Bro019.F.dialogueact219	471.761	472.101	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro019.G.dialogueact217	471.284	471.484	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro019.F.dialogueact220	474.38	475.66	F	PhD	s	-1	0	that's i can get some documentation 
Bro019.D.dialogueact221	474.98	477.05	D	PhD	s	-1	0	that's going to take a cute i mean oh i can get some documentation 
Bro019.D.dialogueact222	477.05	479.98	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	i mean oh the chips are running 
Bro019.D.dialogueact223	479.98	482.68	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	running if you launched any jobs they're own running 
Bro019.D.dialogueact225	483.755	484.235	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	it depends if you run command 
Bro019.F.dialogueact224	483.267	484.027	F	PhD	s^am	-1	0	it depends if you run command 
Bro019.F.dialogueact226	484.027	489.897	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	if you run command that i mentioned before is doesn't know about other things that you might be running 
Bro019.D.dialogueact227	485.627	485.927	D	PhD	b	-1	0	that i mentioned 
Bro019.F.dialogueact228	490.272	495.292	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	so you would be possible to run a hundred run jobs at once and 
Bro019.D.dialogueact229	494.73	495.02	D	PhD	b	-1	0	at once and 
Bro019.F.dialogueact230	495.552	497.292	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	and they wouldn't know about each other but if 
Bro019.F.dialogueact231	497.775	502.475	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	other but if you use p. make then it knows about all the jobs that it has to run 
Bro019.D.dialogueact232	503.14	503.63	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and it can control 
Bro019.F.dialogueact233	503.36	506.51	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	syringe man and it can control uh how many run simultaneously 
Bro019.C.dialogueact234	506.63	508.33	C	Professor	qy^bu^d|qrr.%--	-1	0	syringe man doesn't use key maker you it uses 
Bro019.F.dialogueact235	508.75	510.52	F	PhD	s	-1	0	you it uses export underlying lee but 
Bro019.F.dialogueact236	510.78	511.88	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	lee but if you 
Bro019.F.dialogueact237	511.88	514.48	F	PhD	s	-1	0	if you if it's meant to be run one job at the time so you 
Bro019.F.dialogueact238	514.73	516.72	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	time so you could fire off a thousand of those and 
Bro019.F.dialogueact239	516.96	520.55	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	of those and it doesn't know any one of those doesn't know about the other ones that are running 
Bro019.C.dialogueact240	521.5	523.47	C	Professor	qw	-1	0	so why would one use that rather than teaming well if 
Bro019.F.dialogueact241	523.76	524.68	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	teaming well if you have um 
Bro019.F.dialogueact242	524.68	525.27	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	you have um 
Bro019.F.dialogueact243	526.13	529.1	F	PhD	s	-1	0	like for example uh if you didn't want to write a you make script in you just had a 
Bro019.F.dialogueact244	529.1	534.69	F	PhD	s	-1	0	in you just had a uh an h. t. k. training job that you know is going to take uh six hours to run 
Bro019.F.dialogueact245	535.337	538.987	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and somebody is using uh the machine you typically use 
Bro019.F.dialogueact246	539.127	541.357	F	PhD	s	-1	0	you can say run command in your h. t. k. thing and it'll find 
Bro019.F.dialogueact247	541.357	543.387	F	PhD	s	-1	0	thing and it'll find another machine the fastest 
Bro019.F.dialogueact248	543.517	545.477	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	the fastest currently available machine and and run 
Bro019.F.dialogueact249	545.477	546.627	F	PhD	s	-1	0	that machine and and run your job there 
Bro019.C.dialogueact250	546.99	549.2	C	Professor	qy	-1	0	that doesn't have the same sort of behaviors teammate which is that you know your job there 
Bro019.C.dialogueact251	549.2	553.08	C	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	which is that you know if you rent something it's a machine they come in and hit a key then it yes 
Bro019.F.dialogueact252	553.51	553.88	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yes 
Bro019.F.dialogueact253	554.09	554.26	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah there are 
Bro019.F.dialogueact254	554.61	555.73	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah there are um right 
Bro019.F.dialogueact255	555.92	556.14	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	um right so some of the machines 
Bro019.F.dialogueact256	556.36	561.55	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so some of the machines at the end to to to um have this attribute called no we've effect 
Bro019.F.dialogueact257	562.11	570.15	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and if you specify that in in one of your attribute lines then it'll go to a machine which your job won't be evicted from but 
Bro019.C.dialogueact258	566.555	566.935	C	Professor	b	-1	0	lines then 
Bro019.F.dialogueact259	570.8	578.186	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but the machines that don't have that attribute if the job gets fired up on that which could be somebodies desktop machine and and they were at lunch they come back from lunch 
Bro019.C.dialogueact260	577.72	578.49	C	Professor	b	-1	0	and and they were at lunch they come back from lunch 
Bro019.F.dialogueact261	578.186	587.528	F	PhD	s	-1	0	they come back from lunch and they start typing on the console then your machine will get evicted your job get evicted from their machine and be re started on another machine automatically so 
Bro019.F.dialogueact262	588.032	589.782	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which can cause you to lose time right if 
Bro019.F.dialogueact263	589.782	589.972	F	PhD	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	you to lose time right if 
Bro019.F.dialogueact264	589.972	592.962	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	you to lose time right if you had a two hour job and they got halfway through and 
Bro019.F.dialogueact265	592.962	595.032	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	got halfway through and then somebody came back to their machine i got evicted so if you don't 
Bro019.F.dialogueact266	595.032	602.663	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	so if you don't want your job to run on a machine were could be evicted then you give it minus that after being you know knowing that and 
Bro019.F.dialogueact267	602.983	604.963	F	PhD	s	-1	0	knowing that and it'll pick a machine that can't be evicted from 
Bro019.F.dialogueact268	605.333	605.423	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro019.C.dialogueact269	606.77	608.04	C	Professor	fg|qw.%--	-1	0	um what what about i remember it always used 
Bro019.C.dialogueact270	608.04	618.69	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i remember it always used to be an issue maybe it's not anymore is that if you if something required if you're machine required somebody hitting a key in our to evict things around and see could work 
Bro019.C.dialogueact272	619.311	620.791	C	Professor	qw^d^rt	-1	0	but if you you're logged into it from home 
Bro019.F.dialogueact271	618.886	619.186	F	PhD	b	-1	0	could work but if you you're logged into

Bro019.F.dialogueact276	627.484	629.474	F	PhD	s	-1	0	uh seems like countries did something for that 
Bro019.C.dialogueact278	629.722	630.052	C	Professor	b	-1	0	okay for that 
Bro019.F.dialogueact279	630.064	630.504	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	okay 
Bro019.C.dialogueact280	630.858	631.078	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay we can't connections but 
Bro019.C.dialogueact281	631.078	632.188	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	we can't connections but yeah i don't know whether

Bro019.F.dialogueact285	637.608	642.7	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	you probably wouldn't ordinarily though you're right y. so maybe if you echoed something that uh does does console or something

Bro019.C.dialogueact548	1182.96	1186.54	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah yeah speech right and so one difference is that i guess you were taking spector 
Bro019.A.dialogueact549	1186.34	1186.84	A	PhD	s^2	-1	0	speech spector 
Bro019.B.dialogueact550	1186.83	1187.06	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	speech spector yeah 
Bro019.D.dialogueact551	1187.79	1188.03	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah but they get it's 
Bro019.D.dialogueact552	1188.03	1190.17	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but they get it's exactly the same thing because um 
Bro019.D.dialogueact553	1190.17	1197.04	D	PhD	s^bu^df	-1	0	yeah the capture because um it it's and said they just page beaner fencer and then compute guessing features right 
Bro019.A.dialogueact555	1197.27	1197.52	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah the capture 
Bro019.A.dialogueact557	1197.52	1200.8	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	yeah the capture the different is like that maybe a slight difference and then they 
Bro019.D.dialogueact554	1197.04	1197.31	D	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	yeah the capture 
Bro019.D.dialogueact556	1197.31	1197.38	D	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	yeah the capture 
Bro019.A.dialogueact558	1201.21	1206.19	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	go they use exactly the baseline system for converting the kept someone to how the speech i mean if 
Bro019.A.dialogueact560	1206.84	1211.0	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean if you you're using all their own accord i mean back back would be the only difference in and this in a of different 
Bro019.D.dialogueact559	1206.77	1207.11	D	PhD	b	-1	0	i mean if you you're using all their own 
Bro019.A.dialogueact561	1211.0	1212.41	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and this in a of different 
Bro019.D.dialogueact562	1211.47	1211.97	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and this in a of different 
Bro019.A.dialogueact563	1213.1	1213.19	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	but you got some 
Bro019.C.dialogueact564	1213.42	1215.09	C	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	but you got some sort of different result some kind of understand 
Bro019.C.dialogueact565	1215.09	1216.22	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	some kind of understand 
Bro019.C.dialogueact566	1216.39	1216.58	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro019.C.dialogueact568	1218.02	1218.67	C	Professor	%	-1	0	i think we should uh 
Bro019.D.dialogueact567	1217.86	1221.29	D	PhD	s^bk|s^cs	-1	0	yeah i think we should uh uh a table we told the reason because i don't know 
Bro019.D.dialogueact569	1221.29	1225.0	D	PhD	s^df^no	-1	0	okay because i don't know i it and it's like you know it's are you or anything else 
Bro019.D.dialogueact570	1225.12	1225.26	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	okay

Bro019.A.dialogueact634	1342.68	1343.0	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay mainly maybe because 
Bro019.D.dialogueact635	1343.57	1345.2	D	PhD	s^df^rt	-1	0	maybe because if other changes um 
Bro019.A.dialogueact636	1345.4	1345.72	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	um 
Bro019.D.dialogueact637	1345.92	1346.72	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	um well 
Bro019.D.dialogueact638	1346.94	1349.64	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	well there some some minor changes

Bro019.A.dialogueact640	1351.1	1351.63	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and right 
Bro019.D.dialogueact641	1351.78	1362.92	D	PhD	s	+1	1	and right now if we look at the results it's um always better to mm it seems always better than fronts to come from to imagine i miss match 
Bro019.D.dialogueact642	1364.16	1367.23	D	PhD	s	+1	1	and it's just like he works for well matched

Bro019.D.dialogueact643	1369.34	1370.01	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	but is not 
Bro019.D.dialogueact645	1370.31	1371.75	D	PhD	s	+1	1	but is not significant but 
Bro019.D.dialogueact646	1371.92	1374.27	D	PhD	s	-1	0	significant but the problem is that it's not significant but if you 
Bro019.D.dialogueact647	1374.27	1380.99	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but if you but they deemed um uh a spreadsheet it's get worse

Bro019.D.dialogueact652	1388.78	1390.98	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and significantly better for h. m. 
Bro019.D.dialogueact653	1392.59	1392.93	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh but 
Bro019.D.dialogueact654	1392.93	1393.45	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh but but 
Bro019.D.dialogueact655	1394.94	1396.28	D	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	i don't think it's your fault it's important because 
Bro019.D.dialogueact656	1396.28	1398.92	D	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	because when they would change their me tricky 
Bro019.D.dialogueact657	1399.3	1399.67	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bro019.D.dialogueact658	1400.33	1409.62	D	PhD	s^df^rt	-1	0	and mainly because if it when you you're perfect um same dropping in base i system you can improve a lot h. m. and and and 
Bro019.A.dialogueact659	1410.29	1410.44	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	so 
Bro019.D.dialogueact660	1410.62	1411.17	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro019.D.dialogueact661	1412.34	1414.86	D	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	um i guess what's going to happen 
Bro019.D.dialogueact662	1417.5	1418.52	D	PhD	s^no	-1	0	i don't know what happened but 
Bro019.D.dialogueact663	1418.52	1423.99	D	PhD	s	-1	0	because the u. n. improvement r. h. happened but the different contribution i think the different descents it'd be more evenly 
Bro019.A.dialogueact664	1422.2	1428.25	A	PhD	s	-1	0	because the u. n. improvement r. h. m. and and i'm and also gore down significantly in the spreadsheet so but descents it'd be more evenly 
Bro019.A.dialogueact665	1428.25	1428.57	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so but 
Bro019.A.dialogueact666	1428.9	1432.0	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so but the the vet unmatched miss too i mean the better 
Bro019.D.dialogueact667	1430.06	1430.57	D	PhD	b	-1	0	the vet 
Bro019.A.dialogueact668	1432.46	1437.36	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean the better match maybe the one you just used affected by adding the and find information

Bro019.B.dialogueact1195	2539.44	2549.5	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and eve i. e. then he used internet what um use didn't t. defeat it they're just as i worse 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1196	2547.78	2548.09	A	PhD	b	-1	0	it they're just as i 
Bro019.B.dialogueact1197	2551.89	2553.5	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	but 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1199	2555.04	2557.22	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i i i really wonder though i mean we've had discussions 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1198	2554.76	2555.35	D	PhD	b	-1	0	i i i 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1200	2557.22	2558.99	C	Professor	s	+1	1	i mean we've had discussions before and 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1201	2558.99	2578.8	C	Professor	s	+1	1	before and and one of the things that struck me was that uh about this line of thought that was particular interesting to me was that we um whenever you condense things uh in in irreversible way um you throw away some information 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1202	2579.46	2583.11	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and that's mostly views uh is a good thing the way we use it because we want 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1203	2583.16	2590.41	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because we want to suppress things that will cause very ability for uh particular uh fanatic in its 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1204	2591.34	2591.82	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1205	2592.35	2593.75	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but you do throw something away 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1206	2594.55	2599.51	C	Professor	s:qy	+1	1	and so the question is uh can we figure out if there's something with right away that we shouldn't 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1207	2600.62	2601.56	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	and um so 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1208	2601.56	2602.07	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um so when they were 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1209	2602.68	2609.59	C	Professor	s:s^bk	+1	1	when they were looking at the difference between the filter bank and the fifty that was going into the filter bank i was thinking oh okay so the picking 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1210	2609.59	2610.74	C	Professor	s:s	+1	1	oh okay so the picking on something 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1211	2611.23	2615.79	C	Professor	s:s	+1	1	they're looking on it says figure out noise of her voice voice property whatever's that's 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1212	2615.79	2616.71	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	whatever's that's that's interesting maybe that 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1213	2616.71	2620.79	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that's interesting maybe that helps to drive to the thought process of coming up to features 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1214	2621.11	2626.06	C	Professor	s:qy	+1	1	prefer make sure interesting thing was well but it's they're just something in that difference which is useful sonata 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1215	2626.66	2632.94	C	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	sonata way of doing it maybe would be just to take yeah fifty uh power spectrum feed into and they're on the 
Bro019.B.dialogueact1217	2635.28	2635.58	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	and use it you know 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1216	2635.15	2638.4	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and use it you know in combination or alone or whatever with with what targets 
Bro019.F.dialogueact1218	2638.15	2639.21	F	PhD	qw^d^rt	-1	0	with with what targets 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1219	2640.24	2641.99	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	shouldn't watch this like uh no 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1220	2641.36	2642.21	C	Professor	h|s^ar	-1	0	this like oh or anything uh no 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1221	2642.3	2642.46	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh or anything 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1222	2642.46	2643.09	A	PhD	s	-1	0	oh or anything know that just the same 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1223	2643.38	2643.52	C	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	know that just the same 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1224	2643.52	2647.44	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	oh know that just the same same way we're using in the same way they were using the filter bank phones 
Bro019.F.dialogueact1225	2646.24	2646.62	F	PhD	s^2	-1	0	same way they were using the filter phones 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1226	2647.81	2648.27	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay bank exactly 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1228	2649.0	2650.76	C	Professor	s	-1	0	the same way so to me i mean 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1227	2648.7	2649.08	D	PhD	b	-1	0	okay exactly the same way 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1229	2650.76	2653.68	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	so to me i mean the filter bank is good for all the reasons we say it's good 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1230	2654.06	2654.69	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but it's different 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1231	2655.15	2660.35	C	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	and you know maybe if it's used in combination woke and at something that we're missing 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1233	2661.65	2680.76	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and maybe you know using course you know kelpie or uh adding probabilities i mean all all those different ways that we can find ways that we would let the essentially but in their own network determine what is it that's useful 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1232	2661.48	2661.97	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and maybe 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1234	2679.89	2680.2	D	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro019.A.dialogueact1236	2681.55	2681.85	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah but 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1235	2681.45	2685.41	D	PhD	s^bk|s^ng	-1	0	well yeah but there's so much very addicting and uh bars but 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1237	2685.94	2690.72	C	Professor	s	-1	0	well that's probably why eat it would be likely to work as well by itself 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1239	2691.24	2692.83	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but it might help in combination 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1238	2691.04	2691.64	D	PhD	b	-1	0	but it might help in 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1240	2692.93	2693.56	D	PhD	b	-1	0	combination but i i 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1241	2693.69	2694.88	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but i i i have to tell you i can 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1242	2694.88	2696.12	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i have to tell you i can remember the conference but uh he 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1243	2696.12	2701.97	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but uh he it's about ten years ago i remember going to one of the speech conferences and 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1244	2701.97	2703.3	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	speech conferences and and uh i 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1245	2704.05	2713.25	C	Professor	s	-1	0	saw within very short distance of one another couple different posters that showed about the wonders of some auditory inspired friend and or something and a couple of posters 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1246	2713.25	2718.47	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and a couple of posters away with somebody who compared one to uh just putting in their fifteen fifty 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1247	2718.47	2719.92	C	Professor	s	-1	0	fifteen fifty just slightly better 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1249	2720.83	2724.01	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so i mean that it it's true there's lots of very ability but again we have these wonderful 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1248	2720.44	2720.7	D	PhD	b	-1	0	so 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1250	2724.01	2731.96	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but again we have these wonderful statistical mechanisms for quantifying that uh that very ability and you know doing something reasonable with it so 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1251	2729.26	2729.8	D	PhD	b	-1	0	that very ability 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1252	2732.02	2732.5	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro019.C.dialogueact1253	2733.18	2733.83	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro019.C.dialogueact1254	2734.4	2735.09	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro019.C.dialogueact1255	2736.28	2743.83	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it's it's the same you know a argument gone both ways about um you know we have these data driven filters you know the a 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1256	2744.35	2752.8	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and the other hand it's data driven means it's driven by things that have lots of very ability and they're necessarily not necessarily going to be the same in training and test 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1257	2753.44	2756.53	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	so in some ways it's good to have data driven things in some ways it's 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1258	2756.53	2758.43	C	Professor	s	-1	0	things in some ways it's bad to have data driven thing so 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1259	2758.43	2758.78	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	thing so 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1260	2759.26	2759.72	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	yeah did part of folk were 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1261	2759.26	2763.65	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah did part of folk were discovering is ways to combine things are data driven then or not 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1262	2764.17	2764.33	A	PhD	b	-1	0	uh 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1263	2765.08	2770.24	C	Professor	s	-1	0	say we just the thought that that if we if we had that maybe it's just a baseline uh 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1264	2770.97	2773.85	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	uh which would show as well what are we really getting out of the filters 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1265	2774.12	2775.22	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	or maybe probably not by 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1266	2775.58	2776.53	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	probably not by itself or in combination 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1267	2776.53	2777.79	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	itself or in combination 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1269	2778.44	2779.01	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh you know maybe there's something 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1268	2778.29	2779.53	D	PhD	b	-1	0	uh you know maybe there's something 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1270	2779.16	2781.17	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you know maybe there's something to be gained from it and but 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1271	2781.24	2782.2	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it and but uh 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1272	2783.37	2785.73	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but you know you only work is for short time maybe 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1273	2785.73	2791.72	C	Professor	s	-1	0	for short time maybe in a year or two you would do actually come up with the right set of things to extract from this information 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1274	2792.12	2795.16	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but maybe their own that nature them's configured up quicker than you 
Bro019.B.dialogueact1275	2796.4	2796.74	B	PhD	s^am	-1	0	so 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1276	2796.59	2796.84	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro019.B.dialogueact1278	2797.41	2797.53	B	PhD	s^bk	+1	1	just 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1277	2797.11	2797.97	C	Professor	s^df	+1	1	just 
Bro019.B.dialogueact1279	2797.82	2799.9	B	PhD	s^cc	+1	1	and we tried to this just 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1280	2800.6	2800.82	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro019.A.dialogueact1281	2802.11	2817.97	A	PhD	s	-1	0	select one one um one thing to like what before we started using as the eighty in this i don't know so uh what we did was like i i guess most of you know a board is hiding his addiction is speech patterns beat the catch them intending that you know and that 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1282	2817.02	2817.35	C	Professor	b	-1	0	that you know and that 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1283	2818.87	2820.05	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i just just about any feature and that seems to 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1284	2820.05	2825.5	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and that seems to be and really hard on the speech that kind of lot of nice but not much 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1285	2825.5	2826.85	A	PhD	s	-1	0	nice but not much on the idea it's so 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1286	2826.85	2832.3	A	PhD	s	-1	0	on the idea it's so i i think i decent feature produced discriminating speaking on was having 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1287	2833.62	2833.88	A	PhD	s	-1	0	what i'm 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1288	2833.68	2834.55	D	PhD	qw^br^rt	-1	0	yeah be actually what i'm sorry 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1289	2834.68	2837.52	A	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah be actually i did i decent binary feature the gibson just the basically sorry 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1290	2837.52	2838.3	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	gibson just the basically 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1291	2838.54	2838.7	D	PhD	qy^bh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro019.B.dialogueact1292	2839.35	2840.59	B	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah yeah you get it so 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1293	2840.26	2840.47	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah yeah 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1294	2841.01	2841.23	A	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	like in in 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1295	2841.23	2844.66	A	PhD	s	-1	0	like in in they gave us the idea that you didn't actually do is anything because 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1296	2844.8	2847.61	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	is anything because there wasn't any anything to discriminate between speech and to the 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1297	2845.93	2846.31	D	PhD	b	-1	0	there wasn't any anything to discriminate 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1298	2847.61	2848.35	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	between speech and to the shark bites 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1300	2848.35	2853.24	A	PhD	s	-1	0	shark bites you down in was like they go to the huge improvement on it doesn't but in a christian 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1299	2848.0	2848.31	D	PhD	b	-1	0	shark bites 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1301	2849.02	2849.17	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	you down in was like 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1302	2852.64	2852.9	D	PhD	b	-1	0	improvement on it doesn't 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1303	2853.47	2858.53	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but in a christian she's enlarged within speech can be get some teachers 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1304	2859.15	2862.16	D	PhD	qy	-1	0	okay oh europe dripping information that can might be useful didn't speech and it 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1306	2862.31	2862.55	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay and it 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1305	2862.16	2866.13	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	okay that should get more and it maybe to distinguish between vice on and invite sounds 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1307	2863.17	2863.53	A	PhD	b	-1	0	maybe to distinguish between

Bro019.G.dialogueact1374	2952.82	2956.67	G	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	to really talk about i can i can just uh um share a little bit senior 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1375	2956.92	2959.8	G	Grad	s^df	+1	2	little bit senior hasn't hasn't heard about uh what i've been doing 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1376	2958.76	2959.04	C	Professor	b	-1	0	about uh what i've been doing 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1377	2960.24	2960.54	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1378	2961.18	2961.63	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1379	2962.8	2966.85	G	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um until justice ties getting prepared to take this qualifier exam 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1380	2967.03	2974.86	G	Grad	s^df	+1	2	so basically that's just um trying to propose um uh your necks you're you're following years of your p. h. d. we're trying 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1381	2974.86	2979.52	G	Grad	s^df	+1	2	your p. h. d. we're trying to trying to find a project to to define and and to work on so 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1382	2979.89	2988.45	G	Grad	s	+1	2	work on so i've been uh looking into um doing something about what uh speech recognition using acoustic e. events so 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1383	2988.93	2989.32	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1384	2989.8	2993.59	G	Grad	s	-1	0	um the idea is you have all these these different events for example 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1385	2993.59	2994.96	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	events for example voicing 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1386	2995.07	2995.85	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	salad e. r. 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1387	2995.85	2996.75	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	salad e. r. coloring you 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1388	2997.02	2997.76	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	know burst hurt 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1389	2997.87	2999.65	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	know burst hurt noise uh vacation that kind 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1390	2999.65	3000.49	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	vacation that kind of stuff um 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1391	3000.89	3007.41	G	Grad	s	+1	2	of stuff um building robust um primary detectors for these acoustic events and 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1392	3007.87	3012.73	G	Grad	s	+1	2	and using the outputs of these robust detectors to do speech recognition 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1393	3013.63	3014.07	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	um and 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1394	3014.65	3034.26	G	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and um these these primary detectors um will be um inspired by you know multi band techniques um doing things um similar to larry sauce work on uh graphical models to to detect these these uh acoustic advanced and 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1395	3035.0	3038.93	G	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um so i i've been i've been thinking about that 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1396	3039.2	3046.22	G	Grad	s	-1	0	and some of the issues that i've been running into our um exactly what what kind of acoustic events i need what 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1397	3046.52	3054.18	G	Grad	s	-1	0	what um what acoustic events will provide a a good enough coverage to in order to do the later recognition steps and 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1398	3054.65	3062.71	G	Grad	s	-1	0	and also um once they decide asset of acoustic events um how how do like how i get labels training 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1399	3062.71	3065.52	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	labels training data for for these acoustic events and 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1400	3065.92	3072.06	G	Grad	s	-1	0	events and then later on down the line i can start playing with uh the models themselves the primary detectors 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1401	3072.06	3073.56	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	the primary detectors um 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1402	3073.91	3074.38	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	um so 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1403	3074.85	3075.21	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1404	3075.89	3092.62	G	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um i kind of see like after after building the primary detectors i see um myself taking the outputs and feeding them and sort of tandem style into into um gosh mixtures h. and then back and um and doing recognition 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1405	3092.89	3093.21	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro019.G.dialogueact1406	3094.06	3097.85	G	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	so that's that's just generally oh what i've been looking at 
Bro019.A.dialogueact1407	3097.38	3097.55	A	PhD	b	-1	0	i've been looking at 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1408	3098.31	3098.88	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1409	3099.09	3105.95	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but by the way um the voice and voice version of that francis could i read into what power and was yeah yeah 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1410	3100.19	3100.39	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	the yeah 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1411	3106.06	3106.43	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1412	3106.55	3106.79	D	PhD	b	-1	0	so 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1413	3107.31	3111.97	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you know um if you them all tube and approach was helpful is is i think it is 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1414	3111.97	3113.92	C	Professor	s	-1	0	is i think it is seems to be helpful for determining place and 
Bro019.G.dialogueact1415	3112.07	3112.41	G	Grad	b	-1	0	seems to be helpful

Bro019.C.dialogueact1503	3254.81	3257.23	C	Professor	qy^rt	+1	1	you know mentions that that something with talking about here

Bro019.E.dialogueact1505	3257.75	3258.03	E	Grad	h	-1	0	here it's 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1506	3258.86	3259.27	E	Grad	%--	-1	0	it's well um 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1507	3259.43	3261.99	E	Grad	s^ng	+1	1	well um uh i don't think it directly relates um 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1508	3261.99	3266.11	E	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	relates um well so i was helping of speech researcher named pierre does that any and he's into 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1509	3266.11	3274.98	E	Grad	s	+1	1	and he's into he wanted to um look at um how people respond to format changes i think um 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1510	3274.98	3275.5	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	i think um so 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1511	3275.84	3280.36	E	Grad	s	+1	1	so weak key created a lot of synthetic audio files of alta vile transitions and 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1512	3280.98	3285.32	E	Grad	s	+1	1	and then he wanted to have sex with acoustic um spectrum 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1513	3286.92	3293.26	E	Grad	s	+1	1	and he wanted to look at um how the energy is moving overtime in that spectrum and compare 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1514	3293.26	3295.84	E	Grad	s	+1	1	and compare that to the to the listener tests 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1515	3296.45	3297.28	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um so 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1516	3297.73	3300.93	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so i gave him appeal peace spectrum and 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1517	3300.93	3305.38	E	Grad	s	-1	0	spectrum and to um he would he want to track the peak so he could look at how they're moving so i 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1518	3305.38	3311.73	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so i took beyond um p. l. p. l. p. c. coefficients and um i found the rich this is something 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1519	3311.73	3313.42	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	found the rich this is something that stefan suggested i found

Bro019.C.dialogueact1595	3452.13	3453.91	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because was just question aquinas nation 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1596	3454.71	3456.24	C	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	uh we were just can't story it was we were doing 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1597	3456.24	3459.74	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it was we were doing it's stored speech uh conversation but 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1598	3459.15	3459.44	D	PhD	b	-1	0	conversation but 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1599	3459.74	3461.59	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	conversation but but uh in your case 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1600	3462.57	3463.77	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	acadian 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1601	3463.71	3466.85	D	PhD	s	-1	0	acadian speaks but it's informants positions but 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1602	3466.85	3470.05	D	PhD	s	-1	0	positions but they are nowhere in energy and went down to some of that 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1603	3466.89	3468.09	E	Grad	s^na	-1	0	positions but they are nowhere to some of that 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1604	3468.09	3468.3	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	nowhere 
Bro019.D.dialogueact1605	3470.05	3472.2	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and went down if this is synthetic 
Bro019.F.dialogueact1606	3472.29	3475.64	F	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	if this is synthetic speech can't you just get informants directly i mean 
Bro019.F.dialogueact1607	3475.91	3477.26	F	PhD	qw	-1	0	it was directly i mean how was the speech created 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1608	3477.87	3479.43	E	Grad	s	-1	0	it was created from a synthesizer and 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1609	3479.93	3480.78	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um well 
Bro019.F.dialogueact1610	3480.99	3482.29	F	PhD	s^bu|qy^g^rt	-1	0	um well informants and that's what 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1611	3483.5	3484.58	C	Professor	s^am	-1	0	that that they might may have better maybe didn't i did that this 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1612	3483.62	3484.55	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	that that they might may have better maybe didn't i did that this 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1613	3484.58	3486.36	C	Professor	qy^bu^df	-1	0	may have better maybe didn't have control of it or something that this and in fact we we 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1614	3486.29	3491.92	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and in fact we we we could get um foreman frequencies out of the synthesizer as well 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1615	3492.27	3493.17	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	um um 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1616	3493.75	3505.27	E	Grad	s	-1	0	well one thing that the um l. p. c. approach will hopefully get me in addition um it's i i might be able to find the the battle it's of these comps as well i'm stefan 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1617	3505.59	3510.19	E	Grad	s	-1	0	i'm stefan suggested looking at each comp express but like i said the second order i. r. filter um 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1618	3509.38	3509.59	C	Professor	b	-1	0	i. r. filter 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1619	3510.74	3511.13	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	um but i don't 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1620	3511.56	3517.67	E	Grad	s	-1	0	but i don't think it's it's a really good reason not to um get the foreman frequencies from the synthesizer instead except 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1621	3517.67	3521.38	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	instead except that you don't have the psycho acoustic modeling and 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1622	3522.26	3522.33	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah so the actual 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1623	3522.33	3523.09	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah so the actual so you're not getting the actual 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1624	3523.09	3526.2	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so you're not getting the actual foreman spur say you're getting the 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1625	3526.2	3528.53	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	you're getting the again you getting sort of the 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1626	3529.32	3529.78	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro019.D.dialogueact1627	3530.38	3530.67	D	PhD	b.x	-1	0	you 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1628	3531.02	3535.19	C	Professor	s	-1	0	getting something that is is uh if a strong affected by the deal p. model and so it's more cycle 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1629	3535.19	3536.56	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and so it's more cycle cause successful oh 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1630	3536.56	3538.88	C	Professor	s	-1	0	cause successful is it's it's sort of it's sort of a different thing oh i see that's sort 
Bro019.F.dialogueact1631	3536.81	3537.11	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	cause successful is it's it's sort of it's sort oh i see 
Bro019.F.dialogueact1632	3537.11	3537.55	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	is it's it's sort of it's sort i see 
Bro019.F.dialogueact1633	3538.73	3539.71	F	PhD	s	-1	0	of a different thing but yeah that's sort of the point 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1634	3539.68	3540.22	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	but yeah it ordinarily of the point 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1635	3540.22	3545.88	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it ordinarily informed synthesizers the band with this as well as the band informant centers are 
Bro019.F.dialogueact1636	3543.21	3543.5	F	PhD	b	-1	0	this as well as the 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1637	3546.19	3548.88	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean that's somewhere in the synthesizer that was put in 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1638	3549.13	3550.53	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	his and so too but but 
Bro019.E.dialogueact1639	3549.2	3549.48	E	Grad	b	-1	0	his and 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1640	3550.53	3551.21	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	so too but but yeah you you each complex 
Bro019.C.dialogueact1641	3551.21	3554.26	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah you you each complex paris essentially a second order section which has
