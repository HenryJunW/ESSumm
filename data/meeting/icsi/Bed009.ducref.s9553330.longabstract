The ICSI group working on a tourism dialogue manager met with visitors from the group behind the software they are using.
The basic aim of the meeting was to discuss the development of the tool , and explain the groups application of it.
The system is to be used to create , and deliver route plans , but will need to be able to come back and ask for further information.
They discussed with their visitors where this application fits into the original system.
They also discussed where the system was going , and arranged another meeting to discuss at greater length.
Me010 has reservation about the system developers approach to dialogue planning , and mn015 will take those concerns to a higher level.
Mn048 will investigate if changing the name of the "action planner" is possible.
The name of the dialogue planner , "action planner" makes discussion confusing for the group since they also require and action planner.
The visitors are helping to set up a working version of their software , and aim to have fully working version ready for the end of the week.
