The is only a diagrammatic view of how the decision tree for the EVA task looks like.
A lot of the details have been glossed over: the user model can potentially comprise a huge number of factors; a planning "go-there" node needs input from several other areas of the net; there are intricate interactions between discourse and the situation model.
Similarly , what discourse properties are of importance and how they influence EVA probabilities is still a mystery.
On a more general note , there is also the question of whether the net should be updated continuously or only when it is needed.
No final decision was taken as to the rules of computation applying in the belief-net.
The more interesting solutions would ideally require training data , and it is still debatable whether the current collection would be appropriate for this particular task.
In any case , how different architectures can be implemented in JavaBayes and what modifications would be necessary for the purposes of this project also need to be investigated.
