As the data collection is about to start , a call for the recruitment of subjects is going to be sent out.
The main pool of subjects is going to be the student community in the institute.
Along with the "wizard" , who is going to be an integral part of the experiments , another person needs to be hired as the instructor for the tasks involved in them.
Meetings were rescheduled and are now going to take place on Fridays.
For the next meeting , there is going to be a presentation of the modifications in the parser module of the basic system.
Additionally , the proposed XML model will be put to the test with concrete data.
Similarly , such examples will clarify issues relating to the binding and redundancy of features with common characteristics amongst the shcemas ( eg "Container" for Enter and "Goal" for SPG ).
