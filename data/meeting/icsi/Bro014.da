Bro014.A.dialogueact19	22.619	23.199	A	PhD	qw^t3.%--	-1	0	What 's wrong with {disfmarker} ?
Bro014.B.dialogueact20	29.377	30.107	B	Professor	s	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.B.dialogueact21	30.207	31.307	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's April fifth .

Bro014.C.dialogueact23	40.891	41.611	C	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Is he gonna come here ?
Bro014.B.dialogueact24	42.274	42.674	B	Professor	h	-1	0	Uh .
Bro014.B.dialogueact25	43.214	44.014	B	Professor	s^j^na	-1	0	Well , we 'll drag him here .
Bro014.B.dialogueact26	44.074	44.494	B	Professor	s^j	-1	0	I know where he is .
Bro014.C.dialogueact27	45.402	47.262	C	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	So when you said " in town " , you mean {pause} Oregon .
Bro014.B.dialogueact28	46.97	49.84	B	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	U u u u uh , I meant , you know , this end of the world ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact30	49.84	51.93	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah , {vocalsound} is really what I meant ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact29	49.823	49.923	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bro014.E.dialogueact31	50.244	51.654	E	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	Doo , doo - doo .
Bro014.B.dialogueact32	52.05	53.11	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	uh , cuz he 's been in Europe .
Bro014.E.dialogueact33	53.703	54.103	E	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	Doo - doo .
Bro014.B.dialogueact34	54.4	54.72	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro014.C.dialogueact35	65.201	67.901	C	PhD	s	+1	2	I have something just fairly brief to report on .
Bro014.B.dialogueact36	68.08	68.33	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact37	68.79	76.607	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	Um , I did some {pause} experim uh , uh , just a few more experiments before I had to , {vocalsound} uh , go away for the w well , that week .
Bro014.B.dialogueact38	69.55	69.76	B	Professor	s^ba^fe	-1	0	Great !
Bro014.C.dialogueact39	77.177	78.317	C	PhD	qy	-1	0	Was it last week or whenever ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact40	78.792	79.382	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact41	79.912	84.002	C	PhD	s	+1	1	so what I was started playing with was the {disfmarker} th again , this is the HTK back - end .
Bro014.C.dialogueact42	84.442	85.632	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	And , um ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact43	86.644	95.81	C	PhD	s	+1	1	I was curious because the way that they train up the models , {vocalsound} they go through about four sort of rounds of {disfmarker} of training .
Bro014.C.dialogueact44	96.31	101.462	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	And in the first round they do {disfmarker} uh , I think it 's three iterations ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact45	101.872	108.192	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and for the last three rounds e e they do seven iterations of re - estimation in each of those three .
Bro014.C.dialogueact46	109.023	109.983	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	And so ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact47	110.623	115.653	C	PhD	s	+1	1	you know , that 's part of what takes so long to train the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the back - end for this .
Bro014.B.dialogueact48	115.586	115.916	B	Professor	s^fa	-1	0	I 'm sorry ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact49	115.916	116.726	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I didn't quite get that .
Bro014.B.dialogueact50	116.726	118.406	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	There 's {disfmarker} there 's four and there 's seven
Bro014.B.dialogueact51	118.406	118.636	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact52	118.636	119.156	B	Professor	s^fa	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I 'm sorry .
Bro014.C.dialogueact53	118.797	119.157	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.C.dialogueact54	119.307	119.627	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact55	119.627	120.707	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	maybe I should write it on the board .
Bro014.C.dialogueact56	120.707	123.687	C	PhD	s	-1	0	So , {vocalsound} there 's four rounds of training .
Bro014.C.dialogueact57	124.187	124.687	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact58	125.917	128.057	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I g I g I guess you could say iterations .
Bro014.C.dialogueact59	128.612	131.452	C	PhD	s	+1	1	The first one is three , then seven , seven , and seven .
Bro014.C.dialogueact60	131.948	138.598	C	PhD	s^e	+1	1	And what these numbers refer to is the number of times that the , uh , HMM re - estimation is run .
Bro014.C.dialogueact61	138.888	140.658	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	It 's this program called H E
Bro014.B.dialogueact62	141.987	148.047	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	But in HTK , what 's the difference between , uh , a {disfmarker} an inner loop and an outer loop in these iterations ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact63	147.695	147.965	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.C.dialogueact64	148.385	155.982	C	PhD	s	-1	0	So what happens is , um , at each one of these points , you increase the number of Gaussians in the model .
Bro014.B.dialogueact65	152.533	152.863	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact66	156.57	157.31	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , right !
Bro014.B.dialogueact67	157.31	159.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	This was the mix up stuff .
Bro014.C.dialogueact68	158.438	158.718	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.C.dialogueact69	158.968	159.458	C	PhD	s^m^na	-1	0	The mix up .
Bro014.B.dialogueact71	160.15	160.56	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	That 's right .
Bro014.C.dialogueact70	159.718	159.928	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro014.B.dialogueact72	160.56	161.14	B	Professor	s^t1	-1	0	I remember now .
Bro014.C.dialogueact73	160.772	171.822	C	PhD	s	-1	0	And so , in the final one here , you end up with , uh {disfmarker} for all of the {disfmarker} the digit words , you end up with , uh , three {pause} mixtures per state ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact74	172.328	172.648	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.C.dialogueact75	173.77	175.07	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	eh , in the final {pause} thing .
Bro014.C.dialogueact76	175.528	180.038	C	PhD	s	-1	0	So I had done some experiments where I was {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I want to play with the number of mixtures .
Bro014.B.dialogueact77	180.13	180.53	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact78	180.398	181.188	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	But , um ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact80	182.301	188.931	C	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	uh , I wanted to first test to see if we actually need to do {pause} this many iterations early on .
Bro014.E.dialogueact79	182.085	182.425	E	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	Uh , one , two ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact81	188.483	189.023	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact82	189.431	190.271	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	And so ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact83	191.114	200.374	C	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	um , I {disfmarker} I ran a couple of experiments where I {vocalsound} reduced that to l to be three , two , two , {vocalsound} uh , five , I think ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact84	200.374	202.734	C	PhD	s	+1	1	and I got almost the exact same results .
Bro014.B.dialogueact86	203.329	203.739	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact85	203.232	205.212	C	PhD	s	+1	2	And {disfmarker} but it runs much much faster .
Bro014.C.dialogueact87	205.782	206.892	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	So , um ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact88	207.352	213.042	C	PhD	s	+1	2	I {disfmarker} I think m {pause} it only took something like , uh , three or four hours to do the full training ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact89	213.4	214.31	B	Professor	qw^d.%--	-1	0	As opposed to {disfmarker} ?
Bro014.F.dialogueact90	213.465	213.615	F	PhD	s^ba.x	-1	0	Good .
Bro014.C.dialogueact91	214.225	217.275	C	PhD	qw^rt	+1	2	as opposed to wh what , sixteen hours or something like that ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact93	218.055	221.505	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	I mean , it takes {disfmarker} you have to do an overnight basically , the way it is set up now .
Bro014.F.dialogueact92	217.83	218.66	F	PhD	s^na	-1	0	Yeah . It depends .
Bro014.A.dialogueact94	218.912	220.312	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact95	219.4	219.9	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact96	222.006	222.366	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact97	222.952	223.292	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact98	223.652	228.842	C	PhD	s	+1	1	even we don't do anything else , doing something like this could allow us to turn experiments around a lot faster .
Bro014.B.dialogueact99	229.013	231.773	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	And then when you have your final thing , do a full one , so it 's {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact100	230.439	232.739	C	PhD	s	+1	1	And when you have your final thing , we go back to this .
Bro014.F.dialogueact101	232.39	232.59	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.C.dialogueact102	233.304	234.224	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	So , um ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact103	234.494	236.214	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and it 's a real simple change to make .
Bro014.C.dialogueact104	236.524	239.614	C	PhD	s^e	+1	1	I mean , it 's like one little text file you edit and change those numbers ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact105	240.168	241.388	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and you don't do anything else .
Bro014.F.dialogueact106	240.755	241.165	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Oh , this is a {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact108	241.574	242.064	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact107	241.488	242.328	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	And then you just run .
Bro014.F.dialogueact109	241.591	242.081	F	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.C.dialogueact110	242.818	244.308	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	So it 's a very simple change to make
Bro014.C.dialogueact111	244.308	245.868	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	and it doesn't seem to hurt all that much .
Bro014.A.dialogueact112	246.265	249.575	A	PhD	qy^bu^d.%--	-1	0	So you {disfmarker} you run with three , two , two , five ? That 's a
Bro014.C.dialogueact113	246.268	246.538	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So I {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact114	248.97	251.18	C	PhD	h|s^no	-1	0	Uh , I {disfmarker} I have to look to see what the exact numbers were .
Bro014.A.dialogueact115	250.269	250.759	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.C.dialogueact116	251.18	253.7	C	PhD	s^na	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I thought was , like , three , two , two , five ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact118	253.865	254.325	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact117	253.82	255.19	C	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	but I I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll double check .
Bro014.C.dialogueact119	255.32	257.75	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	It was {vocalsound} over a week ago that I did it ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact120	256.547	256.787	A	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.A.dialogueact123	257.987	258.087	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact122	257.75	258.81	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	so I can't remember exactly .
Bro014.E.dialogueact121	257.361	257.651	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Oh .
Bro014.C.dialogueact124	258.81	259.27	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	But , uh {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact125	259.779	260.079	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact126	259.995	261.565	C	PhD	s	-1	0	um , but it 's so much faster .
Bro014.C.dialogueact128	262.015	263.475	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I it makes a big difference .
Bro014.E.dialogueact127	261.941	262.111	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact129	263.845	266.925	C	PhD	s	+1	1	So we could do a lot more experiments and throw a lot more stuff in there .
Bro014.F.dialogueact130	265.538	265.898	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact131	266.898	267.368	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	That 's great .
Bro014.C.dialogueact132	267.739	268.069	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro014.C.dialogueact133	268.069	274.239	C	PhD	s^bk|s^rt	+1	2	Oh , the other thing that I did was , um , {vocalsound} I compiled {pause} the HTK stuff for the Linux boxes .
Bro014.C.dialogueact134	274.695	277.517	C	PhD	s	+1	1	So we have this big thing that we got from IBM ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact135	277.667	279.767	C	PhD	s^e	+1	1	which is a five - processor machine .
Bro014.C.dialogueact136	280.252	281.152	C	PhD	s^e	+1	1	Really fast ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact137	281.372	282.422	C	PhD	s	+1	1	but it 's running Linux .
Bro014.C.dialogueact138	282.772	286.562	C	PhD	s	+1	1	So , you can now run your experiments on that machine
Bro014.C.dialogueact139	286.562	287.992	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and you can run five at a time
Bro014.C.dialogueact140	287.992	292.633	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and it runs , {vocalsound} uh , as fast as , you know , uh , five different machines .
Bro014.A.dialogueact141	290.613	291.633	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.F.dialogueact142	291.404	291.674	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact143	293.208	294.138	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	So , um ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact144	294.508	296.118	C	PhD	s^no	+1	1	I 've forgotten now what the name of that machine is
Bro014.C.dialogueact145	296.118	299.148	C	PhD	s^cc	+1	1	but I can {disfmarker} I can send email around about it .
Bro014.A.dialogueact146	297.539	297.899	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.C.dialogueact147	299.599	300.499	C	PhD	s	-1	0	And so we 've got it {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact148	300.599	304.929	C	PhD	s	-1	0	now HTK 's compiled for both the Linux and for , um , the Sparcs .
Bro014.C.dialogueact149	305.605	316.19	C	PhD	s	+1	1	Um , you have to make {disfmarker} you have to make sure that in your dot CSHRC , {vocalsound} um , it detects whether you 're running on the Linux or a {disfmarker} a Sparc and points to the right executables .
Bro014.C.dialogueact150	316.36	316.64	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact151	317.04	322.07	C	PhD	s	+1	1	and you may not have had that in your dot CSHRC before , if you were always just running the Sparc .
Bro014.C.dialogueact152	322.21	322.44	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact153	322.89	323.26	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact155	324.344	325.084	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact154	324.09	327.61	C	PhD	s	+1	1	uh , I can {disfmarker} I can tell you exactly what you need to do to get all of that to work .
Bro014.C.dialogueact156	328.193	330.683	C	PhD	s	-1	0	But it 'll {disfmarker} it really increases what we can run on .
Bro014.E.dialogueact157	328.218	328.778	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Hmm . Cool .
Bro014.C.dialogueact158	330.683	340.067	C	PhD	s	-1	0	So , {vocalsound} together with the fact that we 've got these {pause} faster Linux boxes and that it takes less time to do {pause} these , um , we should be able to crank through a lot more experiments .
Bro014.A.dialogueact159	340.354	341.044	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact160	341.041	341.421	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro014.E.dialogueact161	341.099	341.279	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact162	342.604	346.654	C	PhD	s	+1	1	So after I did that , then what I wanted to do {comment} was try {pause} increasing the number of mixtures ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact163	346.654	350.371	C	PhD	s^df	+1	1	just to see , um {disfmarker} see how {disfmarker} how that affects performance .
Bro014.A.dialogueact164	350.029	350.239	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.C.dialogueact165	350.714	351.004	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro014.B.dialogueact166	351.433	357.753	B	Professor	fg|s^cs	+1	1	Yeah . In fact , you could do something like {pause} keep exactly the same procedure and then add a fifth thing onto it
Bro014.C.dialogueact167	358.349	358.619	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact169	358.88	359.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that had more .
Bro014.C.dialogueact168	358.799	359.269	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly .
Bro014.B.dialogueact170	359.72	360.01	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.C.dialogueact171	360.061	360.291	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro014.C.dialogueact172	360.621	360.841	C	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	Right .
Bro014.E.dialogueact173	362.44	368.16	E	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	So at {disfmarker} at the middle o where the arrows are showing , that 's {disfmarker} you 're adding one more mixture per state ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact174	365.559	365.829	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro014.C.dialogueact176	368.83	369.3	C	PhD	h	-1	0	Uh ,
Bro014.E.dialogueact175	368.39	368.66	E	Grad	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact177	369.73	370.09	C	PhD	s^t1	-1	0	let 's see ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact178	370.09	370.12	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh .
Bro014.C.dialogueact179	371.126	372.266	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	It goes from
Bro014.C.dialogueact180	374.023	380.244	C	PhD	s	-1	0	this {disfmarker} uh , try to go it backwards {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} at this point it 's two mixtures {pause} per state .
Bro014.C.dialogueact181	380.65	381.9	C	PhD	s^na	-1	0	So this just adds one .
Bro014.C.dialogueact182	382.303	389.108	C	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	Except that , uh , actually for the silence model , it 's six mixtures per state .
Bro014.B.dialogueact183	386.774	387.134	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact185	390.13	391.42	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Uh , so it goes to two .
Bro014.E.dialogueact184	389.888	390.178	E	Grad	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.C.dialogueact186	391.5	392.16	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro014.C.dialogueact187	393.619	395.759	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And I think what happens here is {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact188	398.199	402.498	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Might be between , uh , shared , uh {disfmarker} shared variances or something ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact189	400.572	401.772	C	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yeah . I think that 's what it is .
Bro014.B.dialogueact190	402.498	402.758	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	or {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact191	402.762	403.392	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact192	403.812	405.062	C	PhD	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	yeah . It 's , uh {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact193	406.6	406.79	C	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	Shoot .
Bro014.C.dialogueact194	406.79	409.33	C	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I can't remember now what happens at that first one .
Bro014.C.dialogueact195	409.52	411.03	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Uh , I have to look it up and see .
Bro014.E.dialogueact196	409.56	409.94	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bro014.C.dialogueact197	411.756	412.306	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact198	413.05	417.204	C	PhD	s	-1	0	there {disfmarker} because they start off with , uh , an initial model
Bro014.C.dialogueact199	417.204	418.744	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which is just this global model ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact200	418.864	420.894	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and then they split it to the individuals .
Bro014.C.dialogueact201	420.894	423.152	C	PhD	s	-1	0	And so , {vocalsound} it may be that that 's what 's happening here .
Bro014.C.dialogueact202	423.152	424.902	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I have to look it up and see .
Bro014.C.dialogueact203	424.962	426.012	C	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I don't exactly remember .
Bro014.E.dialogueact204	425.729	426.129	E	Grad	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.B.dialogueact205	432.25	432.59	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.C.dialogueact206	432.26	433.18	C	PhD	s	-1	0	So . That 's it .
Bro014.B.dialogueact207	433.68	434.06	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Alright .
Bro014.B.dialogueact208	435.435	436.135	B	Professor	qo^tc	-1	0	So what else ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact209	437.44	438.26	A	PhD	h	-1	0	Um .
Bro014.A.dialogueact210	438.97	439.14	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact211	439.39	441.68	A	PhD	s^rt	+1	2	There was a conference call this Tuesday .
Bro014.A.dialogueact212	443.82	445.02	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro014.A.dialogueact213	445.838	449.788	A	PhD	s^no	+1	2	I don't know yet the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} what happened {vocalsound} Tuesday ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact214	449.788	456.646	A	PhD	s	+1	3	but {vocalsound} the points that they were supposed to discuss is still , {vocalsound} uh , things like {vocalsound} the weights ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact215	457.834	458.594	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact216	458.373	462.893	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	Oh , this is a conference call for , uh , uh , Aurora participant sort of thing .
Bro014.E.dialogueact217	460.416	460.746	E	Grad	%	-1	0	For {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact218	462.143	462.303	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact220	462.903	463.083	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact219	462.893	463.443	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bro014.A.dialogueact221	464.508	464.988	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact222	464.68	468.85	B	Professor	qw^rt	+1	1	Do you know who was {disfmarker} who was {disfmarker} since we weren't in on it , uh , do you know who was in from OGI ?
Bro014.B.dialogueact223	468.85	470.941	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Was {disfmarker} {vocalsound} was {disfmarker} was Hynek involved
Bro014.B.dialogueact224	470.941	471.781	B	Professor	qrr	-1	0	or was it Sunil
Bro014.A.dialogueact225	471.66	472.13	A	PhD	s^no	+1	1	I have no idea .
Bro014.B.dialogueact226	471.781	471.901	B	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact228	472.67	473.49	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Mmm , I just {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact227	472.421	473.111	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , you don't know .
Bro014.B.dialogueact229	473.221	473.531	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.A.dialogueact230	473.83	474.0	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact231	474.375	474.695	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Alright .
Bro014.A.dialogueact232	476.229	476.989	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Um ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact233	477.459	477.789	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact234	478.802	487.045	A	PhD	s	+1	1	So the points were the {disfmarker} the weights {disfmarker} how to weight the different error rates {vocalsound} that are obtained from different language and {disfmarker} and conditions .
Bro014.A.dialogueact235	487.898	488.808	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact236	489.738	492.128	A	PhD	s	+1	1	it 's not clear that they will keep the same kind of weighting .
Bro014.A.dialogueact237	492.368	494.888	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Right now it 's a weighting on {disfmarker} on improvement .
Bro014.B.dialogueact238	495.195	495.615	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact239	495.751	499.041	A	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	Some people are arguing that it would be better to have weights on
Bro014.A.dialogueact240	499.81	500.35	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact241	500.692	504.232	A	PhD	s	+1	1	well , to {disfmarker} to combine error rates {pause} before computing improvement .
Bro014.A.dialogueact242	505.25	510.36	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , and the fact is that for {disfmarker} right now for {pause} the English , they have weights {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact243	510.47	512.51	A	PhD	s	-1	0	they {disfmarker} they combine error rates ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact244	512.57	515.65	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but for the other languages they combine improvement .
Bro014.A.dialogueact245	516.222	517.392	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So it 's not very consistent .
Bro014.A.dialogueact247	518.278	519.168	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact246	517.965	518.895	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact248	520.024	520.314	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact249	520.514	521.284	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	The , um {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact250	522.162	522.472	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact251	523.684	524.064	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And so {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact252	524.344	526.034	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , {vocalsound} this is a point .
Bro014.A.dialogueact253	527.43	541.574	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And right now actually there is a thing also , {vocalsound} uh , that happens with the current weight is that a very non - significant improvement {pause} on the well - matched case result in {pause} huge differences in {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in the final number .
Bro014.B.dialogueact254	542.053	542.563	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact256	542.565	547.017	A	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	And so , perhaps they will change the weights to {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact255	542.349	542.799	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact257	548.293	548.543	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.C.dialogueact258	549.07	549.93	C	PhD	qw	-1	0	How should that be done ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact259	550.24	553.28	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	I mean , it {disfmarker} it seems like there 's a simple way {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact260	550.914	551.134	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact261	555.963	557.723	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Uh , this seems like an obvious mistake or something .
Bro014.B.dialogueact263	557.923	560.643	B	Professor	s	+1	1	Well , I mean , the fact that it 's inconsistent is an obvious mistake .
Bro014.C.dialogueact262	557.723	558.103	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Th - they 're {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact264	560.643	562.733	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But the {disfmarker} but , um , the other thing {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact265	561.272	561.502	A	PhD	x	-1	0	In
Bro014.B.dialogueact266	562.733	563.093	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	I don't know
Bro014.B.dialogueact267	563.093	563.853	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I haven't thought it through ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact268	563.853	566.589	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but one {disfmarker} one would think that {vocalsound} each {disfmarker} It {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact269	566.759	570.039	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	it 's like if you say what 's the {disfmarker} what 's the best way to do an average ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact270	570.039	572.169	B	Professor	qr^d	-1	0	an arithmetic average or a geometric average ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact271	572.255	572.665	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact272	573.366	574.456	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It depends what you wanna show .
Bro014.A.dialogueact273	574.822	575.432	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact274	575.126	577.346	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Each {disfmarker} each one is gonna have a different characteristic .
Bro014.A.dialogueact275	577.237	577.497	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact276	577.746	578.246	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact277	578.38	582.05	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Well , it seems like they should do , like , the percentage improvement or something ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact278	582.44	584.92	C	PhD	s	-1	0	rather than the {pause} absolute improvement .
Bro014.A.dialogueact279	585.33	586.78	A	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	Tha - that 's what they do .
Bro014.B.dialogueact280	585.879	586.659	B	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	Well , they are doing that .
Bro014.A.dialogueact281	586.78	586.96	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact282	587.64	588.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	No , that is relative .
Bro014.B.dialogueact283	589.049	596.689	B	Professor	qr	+1	1	But the question is , do you average the relative improvements {pause} or do you average the error rates and take the relative improvement maybe of that ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact284	591.625	591.945	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact285	594.633	594.773	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact286	597.357	600.667	B	Professor	s	+1	1	And the thing is it 's not just a pure average because there are these weightings .
Bro014.C.dialogueact287	599.826	600.196	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bro014.B.dialogueact288	601.441	602.611	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's a weighted average .
Bro014.B.dialogueact289	603.86	604.27	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro014.A.dialogueact290	604.98	605.07	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact291	605.07	614.318	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And so when you average the {disfmarker} the relative improvement it tends to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to give a lot of {disfmarker} of , um , {vocalsound} importance to the well - matched case
Bro014.A.dialogueact292	614.318	616.458	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because {pause} the baseline is already very good
Bro014.A.dialogueact293	616.458	616.658	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact294	617.694	618.264	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact296	618.264	619.024	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	i it 's {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact295	618.172	621.342	C	PhD	qw^cs	-1	0	Why don't they not look at improvements but just look at your av your scores ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact297	621.342	623.552	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	You know , figure out how to combine the scores
Bro014.A.dialogueact298	623.876	624.326	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact299	624.041	625.021	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	with a weight or whatever ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact300	625.261	626.151	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and then give you a score {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact301	626.151	626.811	C	PhD	s	-1	0	here 's your score .
Bro014.C.dialogueact302	626.811	628.631	C	PhD	s	-1	0	And then they can do the same thing for the baseline system {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact303	628.631	629.371	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and here 's its score .
Bro014.C.dialogueact304	629.371	630.261	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And then you can look at {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact305	630.567	630.817	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact306	630.759	632.789	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , that 's what he 's seeing as one of the things they could do .
Bro014.A.dialogueact308	632.799	633.249	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact307	632.789	636.254	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	It 's just when you {disfmarker} when you get all done , I think that they pro
Bro014.B.dialogueact309	636.254	637.404	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I m I {disfmarker} I wasn't there
Bro014.B.dialogueact310	637.404	644.235	B	Professor	s	+1	1	but I think they started off this process with the notion that {vocalsound} you should be {pause} significantly better than the previous standard .
Bro014.C.dialogueact311	644.538	644.948	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact312	645.21	646.2	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	And , um ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact313	646.2	648.04	B	Professor	s	+1	1	so they said " how much is significantly better ?
Bro014.B.dialogueact314	648.04	648.5	B	Professor	qw.%--	-1	0	what do you {disfmarker} ? "
Bro014.B.dialogueact315	648.5	653.636	B	Professor	s	+1	1	And {disfmarker} and so they said " well , {vocalsound} you know , you should have half the errors , " or something , " that you had before " .
Bro014.A.dialogueact316	650.265	650.605	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact317	651.255	652.545	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact318	652.568	653.138	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact319	653.781	654.031	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact320	653.94	654.67	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So it 's ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact321	655.45	655.9	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact323	657.332	658.372	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	But it does seem like
Bro014.C.dialogueact322	656.954	657.254	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact324	659.01	661.66	B	Professor	s^r	+1	1	i i it does seem like it 's more logical to combine them first
Bro014.B.dialogueact325	661.66	662.25	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and then do the {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact326	663.399	664.809	A	PhD	s^2^rt	-1	0	Combine error rates
Bro014.A.dialogueact328	664.809	665.199	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and then {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact327	664.722	665.072	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact329	665.359	665.649	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact331	666.295	666.555	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact330	665.862	666.162	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact332	667.744	670.384	A	PhD	s	+1	1	But there is this {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} is this still this problem of weights .
Bro014.A.dialogueact333	670.384	674.774	A	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	When {disfmarker} when you combine error rate it tends to {pause} give more importance to the difficult cases ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact335	675.476	677.066	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and some people think that {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact334	675.067	675.367	B	Professor	qy^bh^rt	-1	0	Oh , yeah ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact336	677.316	680.686	A	PhD	s	-1	0	well , they have different , {vocalsound} um , opinions about this .
Bro014.A.dialogueact337	681.116	691.062	A	PhD	s^e	+1	1	Some people think that {vocalsound} it 's more important to look at {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to have ten percent imp relative improvement on {pause} well - matched case than to have fifty percent on the m mismatched ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact338	691.452	695.911	A	PhD	s^e	+1	1	and other people think that it 's more important to improve a lot on the mismatch
Bro014.A.dialogueact339	695.911	696.131	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact341	697.142	697.622	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	So , bu
Bro014.C.dialogueact340	696.8	701.08	C	PhD	s	+1	1	It sounds like they don't really have a good idea about what the final application is gonna be .
Bro014.A.dialogueact342	697.622	698.392	A	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	l de fff !
Bro014.A.dialogueact343	701.278	701.558	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact344	701.489	716.104	B	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	Well , you know , the {disfmarker} the thing is {vocalsound} that if you look at the numbers on the {disfmarker} on the more difficult cases , {vocalsound} um , if you really believe that was gonna be the predominant use , {vocalsound} none of this would be good enough .
Bro014.A.dialogueact345	702.088	702.468	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact346	702.468	703.378	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact348	716.483	716.743	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact349	716.554	717.334	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Nothing anybody 's {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact347	716.388	716.808	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact350	717.334	724.5	B	Professor	s	-1	0	whereas {vocalsound} you sort of with some reasonable error recovery could imagine in the better cases that these {disfmarker} these systems working .
Bro014.B.dialogueact351	725.387	726.147	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact352	726.147	726.757	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact353	726.757	732.823	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I think the hope would be that it would {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , it would work well {pause} for the good cases
Bro014.B.dialogueact354	732.823	739.85	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and , uh , it would have reasonable {disfmarker} reas {vocalsound} soft degradation as you got to worse and worse conditions .
Bro014.B.dialogueact355	740.14	740.7	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro014.C.dialogueact356	740.145	740.495	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.C.dialogueact357	741.125	742.075	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I guess what I 'm {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact358	742.901	746.381	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , I {disfmarker} I was thinking about it in terms of , if I were building the final product
Bro014.C.dialogueact359	746.381	749.424	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and I was gonna test to see which front - end I 'd {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I wanted to use ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact360	749.424	756.108	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I would {vocalsound} try to {pause} weight things depending on the exact environment that I was gonna be using the system in .
Bro014.B.dialogueact362	756.289	756.949	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} No .
Bro014.C.dialogueact361	756.108	756.438	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	If I {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact363	757.009	757.219	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	Well , no {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact364	757.219	757.469	B	Professor	s^ar^r	-1	0	well , no .
Bro014.B.dialogueact365	757.469	759.434	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , {vocalsound} it isn't the operating theater .
Bro014.B.dialogueact366	759.434	763.504	B	Professor	s	+1	1	I mean , they don they {disfmarker} they don't {disfmarker} they don't really {pause} know , I think .
Bro014.C.dialogueact367	760.06	760.44	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact368	764.03	764.49	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , I th
Bro014.C.dialogueact369	764.198	767.548	C	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	So if {disfmarker} if they don't know , doesn't that suggest the way for them to go ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact370	768.319	768.769	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact371	770.307	771.527	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	you assume everything 's equal .
Bro014.C.dialogueact372	771.587	772.647	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , y y I mean , you {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact373	773.038	776.798	B	Professor	h|s^cs	-1	0	Well , I mean , I {disfmarker} I think one thing to do is to just not rely on a single number {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact374	776.798	778.478	B	Professor	s^cs^e	-1	0	to maybe have two or three numbers ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact375	777.539	777.909	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact377	778.478	778.858	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	you know ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact376	778.329	778.679	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro014.B.dialogueact378	778.858	785.934	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and say {vocalsound} here 's how much you , uh {disfmarker} you improve {vocalsound} the , uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the relatively clean case
Bro014.B.dialogueact379	785.934	786.444	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and here 's {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact380	786.444	787.704	B	Professor	s^bsc	-1	0	or {disfmarker} or well - matched case ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact381	787.704	789.274	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and here 's how {disfmarker} here 's how much you ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact382	787.995	788.465	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact383	790.045	790.445	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact384	790.619	790.869	C	PhD	x	-1	0	So not {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact386	791.45	791.54	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro014.C.dialogueact385	791.291	792.551	C	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	So not try to combine them .
Bro014.B.dialogueact387	792.6	792.82	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact388	793.11	793.91	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh , actually it 's true .
Bro014.C.dialogueact389	793.128	793.398	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact390	793.91	795.05	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh , I had forgotten this ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact391	795.05	797.98	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh , but , uh , well - matched is not actually clean .
Bro014.B.dialogueact392	797.98	799.22	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	What it is is just that ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact394	799.705	801.795	B	Professor	s^m^na	-1	0	u uh , the training and testing are similar .
Bro014.C.dialogueact393	799.447	800.627	C	PhD	s^2	-1	0	The training and testing .
Bro014.A.dialogueact395	801.977	802.197	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact396	802.085	802.655	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact397	803.155	810.487	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I guess what you would do in practice is you 'd try to get as many , {vocalsound} uh , examples of similar sort of stuff as you could ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact399	810.96	811.64	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and then ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact398	810.692	811.042	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact400	812.0	812.65	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact401	812.65	823.235	B	Professor	s	+1	1	So the argument for that being the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the more important thing , {vocalsound} is that you 're gonna try and do that , {vocalsound} but you wanna see how badly it deviates from that when {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when the , uh {disfmarker} it 's a little different .
Bro014.C.dialogueact402	822.243	822.643	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact403	823.75	824.38	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact404	823.935	828.121	C	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	so you should weight those other conditions v very {disfmarker} you know , really small .
Bro014.B.dialogueact405	828.301	828.581	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact406	828.811	829.031	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bro014.B.dialogueact407	829.031	830.441	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	That 's a {disfmarker} that 's a {disfmarker} that 's an arg
Bro014.C.dialogueact408	829.119	831.169	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	I mean , that 's more of an information kind of thing .
Bro014.B.dialogueact409	831.179	831.739	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	that 's an ar
Bro014.B.dialogueact410	831.739	833.089	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , that 's an argument for it ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact411	833.089	834.249	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	but let me give you the opposite argument .
Bro014.B.dialogueact413	834.249	837.789	B	Professor	s	+1	1	The opposite argument is you 're never really gonna have a good sample of all these different things .
Bro014.C.dialogueact412	834.084	834.414	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro014.B.dialogueact414	838.28	841.72	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	I mean , are you gonna have w uh , uh , examples with the windows open ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact415	841.72	842.46	B	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	half open ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact416	842.46	843.14	B	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	full open ?
Bro014.B.dialogueact417	843.553	846.233	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Going seventy , sixty , fifty , forty miles an hour ?
Bro014.B.dialogueact418	846.233	847.313	B	Professor	s	-1	0	On what kind of roads ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact419	846.59	847.09	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact420	847.313	848.303	B	Professor	s	-1	0	With what passing you ?
Bro014.B.dialogueact421	848.303	848.563	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	With {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact422	848.563	849.083	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh , I mean ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact423	849.387	849.857	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact424	850.002	854.482	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think that you could make the opposite argument that the well - matched case is a fantasy .
Bro014.C.dialogueact425	854.742	855.272	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact427	855.801	856.041	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	You know ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact428	856.041	856.621	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so ,
Bro014.E.dialogueact426	855.691	856.091	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro014.B.dialogueact429	856.891	868.499	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I think the thing is is that if you look at the well - matched case versus the po you know , the {disfmarker} the medium and the {disfmarker} and the fo and then the mismatched case , {vocalsound} um , we 're seeing really , really big differences in performance .
Bro014.B.dialogueact430	868.499	868.839	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bro014.B.dialogueact431	869.653	872.853	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and y you wouldn't like that to be the case .
Bro014.B.dialogueact432	873.083	875.253	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	You wouldn't like that as soon as you step outside {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact433	875.785	877.705	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	You know , a lot of the {disfmarker} the cases it 's {disfmarker} is {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact434	876.671	878.101	C	PhD	s^j	-1	0	Well , that 'll teach them to roll their window up .
Bro014.B.dialogueact435	882.156	884.586	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , in these cases , if you go from the {disfmarker} the , uh {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact436	884.876	886.266	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , I don't remember the numbers right off ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact437	886.266	895.269	B	Professor	s^r	-1	0	but if you {disfmarker} if you go from the well - matched case to the medium , {vocalsound} it 's not an enormous difference in the {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} the training - testing situation ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact438	895.269	898.864	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and it 's a really big {vocalsound} performance drop .
Bro014.C.dialogueact439	895.429	895.809	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact440	899.154	899.404	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	You know ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact441	899.404	899.924	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact442	900.762	901.242	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact443	902.89	911.933	B	Professor	s^bk|s	-1	0	Yeah , I mean the reference one , for instance {disfmarker} this is back old on , uh {disfmarker} on Italian {disfmarker} uh , was like {pause} six percent error for the well - matched
Bro014.B.dialogueact444	911.933	913.463	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and eighteen for the medium - matched
Bro014.B.dialogueact445	913.463	916.363	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and sixty for the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} for highly - mismatched .
Bro014.B.dialogueact446	916.991	917.291	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact447	917.291	921.372	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and , you know , with these other systems we {disfmarker} we {vocalsound} helped it out quite a bit ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact448	921.372	926.262	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but still there 's {disfmarker} there 's something like a factor of two or something between well - matched and medium - matched .
Bro014.B.dialogueact449	926.262	933.244	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And {vocalsound} so I think that {vocalsound} if what you 're {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if the goal of this is to come up with robust features , it does mean {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact450	934.083	937.533	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So you could argue , in fact , that the well - matched is something you shouldn't be looking at at all ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact451	938.812	944.642	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that {disfmarker} that the goal is to come up with features {vocalsound} that will still give you reasonable performance ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact452	945.181	947.451	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	you know , with again gentle degregra degradation ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact453	947.991	951.891	B	Professor	fh|s^e	-1	0	um , even though the {disfmarker} the testing condition is not the same as the training .
Bro014.C.dialogueact454	952.228	952.658	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact455	953.06	959.92	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	So , you know , I {disfmarker} I could argue strongly that something like the medium mismatch , which is you know not compl pathological but {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact456	960.13	962.08	B	Professor	qw^rt	-1	0	I mean , what was the {disfmarker} the medium - mismatch condition again ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact457	963.528	965.388	A	PhD	h|s.%--	-1	0	Um , {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact458	965.868	966.048	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact459	966.208	970.118	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Medium mismatch is everything with the far {pause} microphone ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact460	970.468	974.217	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but trained on , like , low noisy condition ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact461	974.217	975.277	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	like low speed
Bro014.A.dialogueact462	975.277	977.417	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and {disfmarker} or {pause} stopped car
Bro014.A.dialogueact463	977.767	980.837	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and tested on {pause} high - speed conditions , I think ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact464	980.837	981.977	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	like on a highway
Bro014.A.dialogueact465	981.977	982.087	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact466	983.242	983.492	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bro014.A.dialogueact468	983.903	984.073	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact467	983.492	986.632	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So it 's still the same {disfmarker} same microphone in both cases ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact469	985.34	986.21	A	PhD	s^m^na	-1	0	Same microphone
Bro014.A.dialogueact470	986.21	986.35	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact471	986.59	986.8	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact472	987.348	991.088	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	but , uh , it 's {disfmarker} there 's a mismatch between the car conditions .
Bro014.B.dialogueact473	991.088	991.468	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And that 's {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact474	991.917	995.616	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh , you could argue that 's a pretty realistic situation
Bro014.C.dialogueact475	994.1	994.42	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact476	995.44	995.94	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact477	995.616	998.496	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and , uh , I 'd almost argue for weighting that highest .
Bro014.B.dialogueact478	998.496	1001.57	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But the way they have it now , {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker} I guess it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact479	1002.16	1004.3	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	They {disfmarker} they compute the relative improvement first
Bro014.B.dialogueact480	1004.3	1005.76	B	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	and then average that with a weighting ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact481	1005.92	1006.21	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact482	1006.55	1010.27	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And so then the {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that makes the highly - matched the really big thing .
Bro014.A.dialogueact483	1010.95	1011.2	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact484	1011.28	1012.08	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact485	1013.0	1023.29	B	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	so , u i since they have these three categories , it seems like the reasonable thing to do {vocalsound} is to go across the languages {pause} and to come up with an improvement for each of those .
Bro014.A.dialogueact486	1023.07	1024.21	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact487	1024.49	1027.63	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	Just say " OK , in the {disfmarker} in the highly - matched case this is what happens ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact488	1027.63	1031.5	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	in the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} m the , uh {disfmarker} this other m medium if this happens ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact489	1031.5	1034.03	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	in the highly - mismatched {pause} that happens " .
Bro014.A.dialogueact490	1032.52	1032.78	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact491	1034.55	1035.55	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	And , uh ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact492	1036.31	1040.6	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you should see , uh , a gentle degradation {pause} through that .
Bro014.A.dialogueact493	1039.42	1040.23	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact494	1041.82	1042.45	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro014.B.dialogueact495	1045.21	1045.58	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact496	1046.69	1047.25	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	I don't know .
Bro014.A.dialogueact497	1047.97	1048.19	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact498	1048.83	1049.59	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I think that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact499	1050.62	1051.08	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact500	1052.01	1058.31	B	Professor	s	+1	1	I gather that in these meetings it 's {disfmarker} it 's really tricky to make anything {vocalsound} ac {vocalsound} make any {comment} policy change
Bro014.B.dialogueact501	1058.31	1062.57	B	Professor	s^df	+1	1	because {vocalsound} {vocalsound} everybody has {disfmarker} has , uh , their own opinion
Bro014.A.dialogueact503	1063.01	1063.24	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact502	1062.57	1062.73	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact504	1064.01	1064.92	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	I don't know .
Bro014.A.dialogueact505	1064.9	1065.04	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact506	1065.25	1065.47	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact507	1067.04	1067.6	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Uh , so {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact508	1067.69	1067.9	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact509	1069.88	1069.98	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact510	1069.98	1073.81	A	PhD	s	+1	1	but there is probably a {disfmarker} a big change that will {vocalsound} be made
Bro014.A.dialogueact511	1073.81	1077.9	A	PhD	s	+1	1	is that the {disfmarker} the baseline {disfmarker} th they want to have a new baseline , perhaps ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact512	1078.5	1079.5	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which is , um , MFCC
Bro014.A.dialogueact513	1079.5	1082.07	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	but with {vocalsound} a voice activity detector .
Bro014.A.dialogueact514	1083.43	1092.86	A	PhD	s	+1	1	And apparently , {vocalsound} uh , some people are pushing to still keep this fifty percent number .
Bro014.A.dialogueact515	1092.86	1097.37	A	PhD	s	+1	1	So they want {vocalsound} to have at least fifty percent improvement on the baseline ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact517	1098.27	1100.27	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	but w which would be a much better baseline .
Bro014.B.dialogueact516	1097.79	1098.27	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact518	1100.51	1100.9	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact519	1101.02	1108.65	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	And if we look at the result that Sunil sent , {vocalsound} just putting the VAD in the baseline improved , like , more than twenty percent ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact520	1108.69	1109.06	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact521	1109.22	1116.5	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	which would mean then {disfmarker} then {disfmarker} mean that fifty percent on this new baseline is like , well , more than sixty percent improvement on {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact523	1117.94	1119.39	A	PhD	x	-1	0	on {disfmarker} o e e uh {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact522	1117.68	1119.5	B	Professor	s^bu|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	So nobody would {pause} be there , probably . Right ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact524	1119.65	1121.11	A	PhD	s^m^na	-1	0	Right now , nobody would be there ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact525	1121.11	1121.28	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact527	1121.88	1122.01	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact526	1121.67	1121.86	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Good .
Bro014.B.dialogueact528	1122.99	1123.45	B	Professor	s^j	-1	0	Work to do .
Bro014.A.dialogueact529	1125.67	1126.07	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro014.B.dialogueact530	1126.42	1127.38	B	Professor	qw^rt	+1	1	So whose VAD
Bro014.B.dialogueact531	1127.38	1128.43	B	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	is {disfmarker} Is {disfmarker} is this a {disfmarker} ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact532	1128.94	1130.29	A	PhD	h|s	+1	1	Uh , they didn't decide yet .
Bro014.A.dialogueact533	1130.29	1133.66	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	I guess i this was one point of the conference call also ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact534	1133.66	1133.87	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact535	1134.21	1134.36	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	mmm ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact536	1135.16	1135.55	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	so I don't know .
Bro014.A.dialogueact537	1135.92	1136.55	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact538	1138.44	1138.6	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact539	1139.78	1139.94	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.E.dialogueact540	1140.07	1140.18	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Oh .
Bro014.B.dialogueact541	1143.59	1146.02	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Oh , I {disfmarker} I think th that would be {vocalsound} good .
Bro014.B.dialogueact542	1146.02	1148.61	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , it 's not that the design of the VAD isn't important ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact543	1149.18	1157.43	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but it 's just that it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it does seem to be i uh , a lot of {pause} work to do a good job on {disfmarker} on that
Bro014.B.dialogueact544	1157.43	1161.45	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	and as well as being a lot of work to do a good job on the feature {vocalsound} design ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact545	1160.64	1160.95	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact546	1161.45	1161.83	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so
Bro014.A.dialogueact547	1162.38	1162.62	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact548	1163.74	1166.97	B	Professor	s^cs^rt	-1	0	if we can {pause} cut down on that maybe we can make some progress .
Bro014.A.dialogueact549	1164.97	1165.07	A	PhD	%	-1	0	M
Bro014.A.dialogueact550	1166.05	1166.28	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.E.dialogueact551	1167.69	1167.86	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact552	1168.34	1169.34	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But I guess perhaps {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact553	1170.98	1171.72	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	I don't know
Bro014.A.dialogueact554	1172.01	1172.81	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	w {vocalsound} Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact555	1174.96	1175.44	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh , yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact556	1175.44	1187.12	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Per - e s s someone told that perhaps it 's not fair to do that because the , um {disfmarker} to make a good VAD {pause} you don't have enough to {disfmarker} with the {disfmarker} the features that are {disfmarker} the baseline features .
Bro014.A.dialogueact557	1187.12	1187.47	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact558	1189.16	1190.93	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	mmm ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact559	1192.68	1193.83	A	PhD	s	-1	0	you need more features .
Bro014.A.dialogueact560	1195.74	1199.25	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	So you really need to put more {disfmarker} more in the {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the front - end .

Bro014.B.dialogueact578	1212.96	1217.31	B	Professor	s	-1	0	see , MFCC for instance doesn't have anything in it , uh , related to the pitch .
Bro014.B.dialogueact579	1218.23	1219.49	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So just {disfmarker} just for example .
Bro014.B.dialogueact580	1219.49	1223.53	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So suppose you 've {disfmarker} that {vocalsound} what you really wanna do is put a good pitch detector on there

Bro014.A.dialogueact584	1225.35	1226.08	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact585	1225.64	1231.19	B	Professor	s^r	-1	0	if it gets an unambiguous result then you 're definitely in a {disfmarker} in a {disfmarker} in a voice in a , uh , s region with speech .
Bro014.B.dialogueact587	1231.82	1232.31	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bro014.C.dialogueact586	1231.33	1235.5	C	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	So there 's this assumption that the v the voice activity detector can only use the MFCC ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact588	1236.26	1237.04	A	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	That 's not clear ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact589	1237.04	1238.75	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but this {disfmarker} {vocalsound} e
Bro014.B.dialogueact590	1238.11	1238.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , for the baseline .
Bro014.C.dialogueact591	1239.42	1239.68	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact592	1240.42	1242.38	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so if you use other features then y
Bro014.B.dialogueact593	1242.38	1244.12	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But it 's just a question of what is your baseline .
Bro014.B.dialogueact594	1245.01	1245.18	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bro014.B.dialogueact596	1245.18	1246.87	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	What is it that you 're supposed to do better than ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact595	1245.03	1245.37	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I g
Bro014.C.dialogueact597	1245.37	1245.78	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact598	1246.87	1247.63	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	And so
Bro014.B.dialogueact600	1248.11	1256.19	B	Professor	s	-1	0	having the baseline be the MFCC 's {pause} means that people could {pause} choose to pour their ener their effort into trying to do a really good VAD
Bro014.C.dialogueact599	1248.04	1248.55	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I don't s
Bro014.C.dialogueact601	1256.12	1258.31	C	PhD	s	-1	0	But they seem like two {pause} separate issues .
Bro014.B.dialogueact602	1256.74	1257.06	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	or tryi
Bro014.B.dialogueact605	1258.71	1259.58	B	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	They 're sort of separate .
Bro014.C.dialogueact603	1258.31	1258.66	C	PhD	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact604	1258.66	1258.95	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I mean {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact606	1259.58	1261.09	B	Professor	s^arp	-1	0	Unfortunately there 's coupling between them ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact607	1261.36	1267.39	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	which is part of what I think Stephane is getting to , is that {vocalsound} you can choose your features in such a way as to improve the VAD .
Bro014.A.dialogueact608	1268.11	1268.28	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact609	1268.13	1271.85	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And you also can choose your features in such a way as to prove {disfmarker} improve recognition .
Bro014.B.dialogueact611	1271.85	1272.91	B	Professor	s	-1	0	They may not be the same thing .
Bro014.C.dialogueact610	1271.81	1272.91	C	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	But it seems like you should do both .
Bro014.B.dialogueact613	1273.43	1274.21	B	Professor	s^m^na	-1	0	You should do both
Bro014.C.dialogueact612	1273.11	1273.53	C	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bro014.B.dialogueact614	1274.21	1277.79	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and I {disfmarker} I think that this still makes {disfmarker} I still think this makes sense as a baseline .
Bro014.B.dialogueact615	1278.58	1280.45	B	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	It 's just saying , as a baseline , we know {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact616	1279.2	1280.15	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact617	1281.05	1282.69	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	you know , we had the MFCC 's before ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact618	1282.69	1284.87	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	lots of people have done voice activity detectors ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact619	1285.13	1285.5	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact620	1285.77	1288.78	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you might as well pick some voice activity detector and make that the baseline ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact621	1288.78	1291.84	B	Professor	s	-1	0	just like you picked some version of HTK and made that the baseline .
Bro014.A.dialogueact622	1291.73	1291.95	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact623	1292.66	1292.93	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro014.B.dialogueact624	1292.73	1295.09	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And then {pause} let 's try and make everything better .
Bro014.B.dialogueact625	1295.68	1296.24	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact626	1297.39	1304.19	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and if one of the ways you make it better is by having your features {pause} be better features for the VAD then that 's {disfmarker} so be it .
Bro014.A.dialogueact628	1304.28	1304.75	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact627	1304.19	1304.34	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	But ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact629	1304.95	1307.33	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh , uh , uh , at least you have a starting point that 's {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact630	1308.23	1308.7	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact631	1308.93	1312.36	B	Professor	s^bu^df	-1	0	cuz i i some of {disfmarker} the some of the people didn't have a VAD at all , I guess .
Bro014.B.dialogueact632	1312.36	1312.7	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bro014.B.dialogueact633	1312.69	1313.31	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and
Bro014.A.dialogueact634	1313.78	1313.94	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact635	1313.89	1315.2	B	Professor	s	-1	0	then they {disfmarker} they looked pretty bad
Bro014.B.dialogueact636	1315.2	1317.83	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and in fact what they were doing wasn't so bad at all .
Bro014.A.dialogueact637	1315.72	1316.07	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact639	1318.08	1318.42	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact638	1317.83	1318.04	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	But ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact641	1318.7	1319.1	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um .
Bro014.C.dialogueact640	1318.67	1322.39	C	PhD	fg|s^cs	-1	0	Yeah . It seems like you should try to make your baseline as good as possible .
Bro014.C.dialogueact642	1322.82	1328.67	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	And if it turns out that {pause} you can't improve on that , well , I mean , then , you know , nobody wins and you just use MFCC .
Bro014.C.dialogueact643	1328.77	1329.05	C	PhD	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bro014.B.dialogueact644	1329.69	1329.87	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact645	1329.87	1330.52	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , it seems like ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact646	1331.21	1331.69	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact647	1332.67	1337.99	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it should include sort of the current state of the art {vocalsound} that you want {disfmarker} are trying to improve ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact648	1337.99	1344.18	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	and MFCC 's , you know , or PLP or something {disfmarker} it seems like {vocalsound} reasonable baseline for the features ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact649	1344.18	1349.95	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	and anybody doing this task , {vocalsound} uh , is gonna have some sort of voice activity detection at some level , in some way .
Bro014.B.dialogueact650	1349.95	1354.15	B	Professor	s	-1	0	They might use the whole recognizer to do it {vocalsound} but {disfmarker} rather than {vocalsound} a separate thing ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact651	1354.15	1356.48	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but they 'll have it on some level .
Bro014.B.dialogueact652	1356.64	1356.92	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact653	1358.22	1359.35	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um .
Bro014.C.dialogueact654	1359.08	1367.16	C	PhD	s	-1	0	It seems like whatever they choose they shouldn't , {vocalsound} you know , purposefully brain - damage a part of the system to {pause} make a worse baseline ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact655	1367.16	1367.43	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact657	1367.7	1368.82	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Well , I think people just had
Bro014.C.dialogueact656	1367.58	1368.03	C	PhD	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	You know ?
Bro014.B.dialogueact658	1368.82	1370.42	B	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	it wasn't that they purposely brain - damaged it .
Bro014.B.dialogueact659	1370.42	1374.81	B	Professor	s^df^nd	-1	0	I think people hadn't really thought through {vocalsound} about the , uh {disfmarker} the VAD issue .
Bro014.C.dialogueact660	1374.98	1375.54	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact661	1376.78	1377.43	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact662	1376.81	1382.18	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and then when the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the proposals actually came in and half of them had V A Ds and half of them didn't ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact663	1382.18	1383.52	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and the half that did did well
Bro014.B.dialogueact664	1383.52	1385.45	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and the {vocalsound} half that didn't did poorly .
Bro014.C.dialogueact665	1383.74	1384.28	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact666	1385.45	1386.09	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So it 's {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact667	1386.06	1386.73	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact668	1390.44	1391.81	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Um .
Bro014.B.dialogueact669	1390.72	1391.06	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bro014.A.dialogueact670	1392.68	1392.96	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact671	1392.96	1393.44	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	So
Bro014.A.dialogueact672	1393.44	1394.65	A	PhD	s^co^tc	-1	0	we 'll see what happen with this .
Bro014.A.dialogueact673	1396.68	1397.71	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact674	1400.04	1400.26	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact675	1400.26	1404.12	A	PhD	s.%--	+1	3	So what happened since , um , {vocalsound} last week is {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact676	1405.02	1409.85	A	PhD	s^rt	+1	2	well , from OGI , these experiments on {pause} putting VAD on the baseline .
Bro014.A.dialogueact677	1411.29	1418.22	A	PhD	s	+1	1	And these experiments also are using , uh , some kind of noise compensation ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact678	1418.22	1419.36	A	PhD	s	+1	1	so spectral subtraction ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact679	1420.43	1425.59	A	PhD	s	+1	1	and putting on - line normalization , um , just after this .
Bro014.A.dialogueact680	1426.01	1429.66	A	PhD	s	+1	1	So I think spectral subtraction , LDA filtering , and on - line normalization ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact681	1429.66	1435.85	A	PhD	s^e	+1	1	so which is similar to {vocalsound} the pro proposal - one , but with {pause} spectral subtraction in addition ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact682	1436.38	1441.56	A	PhD	s	+1	1	and it seems that on - line normalization doesn't help further when you have spectral subtraction .
Bro014.C.dialogueact683	1444.17	1449.23	C	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Is this related to the issue that you brought up a couple of meetings ago with the {disfmarker} the {vocalsound} musical tones
Bro014.A.dialogueact684	1448.11	1448.33	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	I {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact685	1449.23	1449.44	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker} ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact686	1449.98	1450.68	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I have no idea ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact687	1450.68	1455.55	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because the issue I brought up was with a very simple spectral subtraction approach ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact688	1454.77	1455.09	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact689	1456.55	1464.7	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	and the one that {vocalsound} they use at OGI is one from {disfmarker} from {vocalsound} the proposed {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the Aurora prop uh , proposals ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact690	1465.32	1467.15	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which might be much better .
Bro014.A.dialogueact691	1468.26	1468.71	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So , yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact692	1468.81	1471.59	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I asked {vocalsound} Sunil for more information about that ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact693	1472.76	1473.45	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	but , uh ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact694	1474.09	1474.72	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I don't know yet .
Bro014.A.dialogueact695	1476.04	1477.03	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro014.A.dialogueact696	1479.1	1481.05	A	PhD	s.%--	+1	2	And what 's happened here is that we {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact697	1481.05	1490.29	A	PhD	s^rt	+1	2	so we have this kind of new , um , reference system which {vocalsound} use a nice {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a clean downsampling - upsampling ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact698	1490.92	1494.51	A	PhD	s^e	+1	2	which use a new filter {vocalsound} that 's much shorter
Bro014.A.dialogueact699	1495.09	1499.18	A	PhD	s^e	+1	2	and which also cuts the frequency below sixty - four hertz ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact700	1495.52	1495.68	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro014.A.dialogueact701	1499.57	1502.4	A	PhD	s^e^rt	-1	0	which was not done on our first proposal .
Bro014.B.dialogueact702	1502.53	1504.92	B	Professor	qy^bu^rt	+1	2	When you say " we have that " , does Sunil have it now , too ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact703	1503.98	1504.15	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	I
Bro014.A.dialogueact705	1505.38	1505.57	A	PhD	s^ar	+1	2	No .
Bro014.B.dialogueact704	1504.92	1505.11	B	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact706	1505.99	1506.18	A	PhD	s^ar^r	-1	0	No .
Bro014.B.dialogueact707	1506.13	1506.48	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.A.dialogueact708	1506.82	1507.93	A	PhD	s^df^rt	+1	2	Because we 're still testing .
Bro014.A.dialogueact709	1507.93	1513.04	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So we have the result for , {vocalsound} uh , just the features
Bro014.B.dialogueact710	1508.37	1508.6	B	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.A.dialogueact711	1513.77	1517.87	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	and we are currently testing with putting the neural network in the KLT .
Bro014.A.dialogueact712	1519.4	1522.97	A	PhD	fh|s^rt	+1	2	Um , it seems to improve on the well - matched case ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact713	1524.79	1530.85	A	PhD	fh|s^rt	+1	2	um , {vocalsound} but it 's a little bit worse on the mismatch and highly - mismatched {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact714	1531.74	1533.22	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	I mean when we put the neural network .
Bro014.A.dialogueact715	1533.8	1537.62	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And with the current weighting I think it 's sh it will be better
Bro014.A.dialogueact716	1538.03	1539.69	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because the well - matched case is better .
Bro014.A.dialogueact717	1541.11	1541.76	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact718	1541.94	1544.1	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	But how much worse {disfmarker} since the weighting might change {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact719	1544.1	1546.61	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	how {disfmarker} how much worse is it on the other conditions ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact720	1546.61	1547.83	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	when you say it 's a little worse ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact721	1548.47	1556.43	A	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's like , uh , fff , fff {comment} {vocalsound} {pause} um , {comment} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {pause} ten percent relative .
Bro014.A.dialogueact722	1558.81	1559.11	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact723	1560.12	1560.43	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .

Bro014.B.dialogueact727	1565.24	1566.46	B	Professor	s	+1	2	the latencies are much shorter .
Bro014.B.dialogueact728	1566.7	1567.02	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact729	1569.2	1574.57	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Uh - y w when I say it 's worse , it 's not {disfmarker} it 's when I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} uh , compare proposal - two to proposal - one ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact730	1574.67	1574.86	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so ,

Bro014.A.dialogueact732	1577.38	1582.79	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	uh , y putting neural network {vocalsound} compared to n not having any neural network .
Bro014.A.dialogueact734	1585.03	1586.86	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , this new system is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is better ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact733	1584.86	1585.31	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro014.A.dialogueact735	1587.23	1592.0	A	PhD	s^df^rt	-1	0	because it has {vocalsound} um , this sixty - four hertz cut - off ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact736	1592.88	1595.21	A	PhD	fh|s^df^rt	-1	0	uh , clean {vocalsound} downsampling ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact737	1595.78	1596.39	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact738	1596.75	1598.27	A	PhD	fh|qw	-1	0	um {disfmarker} what else ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact739	1599.24	1600.43	A	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	Uh , yeah , a good VAD .
Bro014.A.dialogueact740	1600.86	1601.8	A	PhD	s	-1	0	We put the good VAD .
Bro014.A.dialogueact741	1602.89	1603.03	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro014.A.dialogueact742	1603.9	1605.81	A	PhD	fh|%--	-1	0	Yeah , I don't know . I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} j uh , uh {disfmarker} pr
Bro014.B.dialogueact743	1605.26	1606.09	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But the latencies {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact744	1606.09	1607.58	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	but you 've got the latency shorter now .
Bro014.A.dialogueact745	1607.07	1607.77	A	PhD	s^m^na	+1	2	Latency is short {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact747	1607.77	1608.04	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	is {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact748	1608.13	1608.32	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact749	1608.16	1608.37	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.F.dialogueact746	1607.7	1608.0	F	PhD	qy^g^t1	-1	0	Isn't it
Bro014.A.dialogueact750	1609.38	1610.41	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	And so
Bro014.B.dialogueact751	1609.95	1612.55	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So it 's better than the system that we had before .
Bro014.A.dialogueact752	1612.72	1612.92	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact753	1613.15	1617.96	A	PhD	s^df^na	-1	0	Mainly because {pause} {vocalsound} of {pause} the sixty - four hertz and the good VAD .
Bro014.B.dialogueact754	1613.33	1613.56	B	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.A.dialogueact755	1624.08	1628.99	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And then I took this system and , {vocalsound} mmm , w uh , I p we put the old filters also .
Bro014.A.dialogueact756	1629.38	1631.52	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	So we have this good system , with good VAD ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact757	1632.53	1634.8	A	PhD	s	-1	0	with the short filter and with the long filter ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact758	1635.26	1636.11	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact759	1637.4	1638.42	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact760	1639.51	1641.08	A	PhD	s	-1	0	with the short filter it 's not worse .
Bro014.A.dialogueact761	1641.08	1641.38	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact762	1641.38	1641.82	A	PhD	qy^g	-1	0	well , is it {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact763	1644.33	1644.7	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.A.dialogueact765	1645.1	1645.42	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	it 's in {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact764	1644.7	1645.93	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So that 's {disfmarker} that 's all fine .
Bro014.A.dialogueact767	1646.37	1646.66	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yes . Uh {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact766	1646.19	1647.8	B	Professor	s^bu.%--	-1	0	But what you 're saying is that when you do these {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact768	1647.99	1649.06	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	So let me try to understand .
Bro014.B.dialogueact769	1649.06	1652.6	B	Professor	s^bu.%--	-1	0	When {disfmarker} when you do these same improvements {vocalsound} to proposal - one ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact770	1654.23	1654.66	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact771	1655.03	1657.59	B	Professor	s^bu.%--	-1	0	that , uh , on the {disfmarker} i
Bro014.B.dialogueact772	1657.59	1662.47	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	things are somewhat better , uh , in proposal - two for the well - matched case
Bro014.B.dialogueact773	1662.46	1664.91	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	and somewhat worse for the other two cases .
Bro014.A.dialogueact774	1665.14	1665.28	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact775	1666.26	1666.93	B	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	So does , uh {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact776	1667.09	1667.85	B	Professor	s^bu.%--	-1	0	when you say , uh {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact777	1667.85	1668.24	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact778	1669.41	1679.23	B	Professor	qy	-1	0	The th now that these other things are in there , is it the case maybe that the additions of proposal - two over proposal - one are {pause} less im important ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact779	1679.42	1679.58	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact780	1680.17	1680.73	A	PhD	s^na	-1	0	Probably , yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact781	1681.17	1681.46	B	Professor	s^t1	-1	0	I get it .
Bro014.A.dialogueact782	1682.46	1683.51	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact783	1687.3	1687.65	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	So , yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact784	1688.07	1688.57	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bro014.A.dialogueact785	1689.05	1692.29	A	PhD	s^bk|s^rt^tc	-1	0	Yeah , but it 's a good thing anyway to have {vocalsound} shorter delay .
Bro014.A.dialogueact786	1692.83	1696.04	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Then we tried , um , {vocalsound} to do something like proposal - two
Bro014.A.dialogueact787	1696.11	1700.58	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but having , um , e using also MSG features .
Bro014.A.dialogueact788	1701.71	1705.91	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So there is this KLT part , which use just the standard features ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact789	1702.38	1702.72	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact790	1703.56	1703.85	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro014.A.dialogueact791	1707.01	1709.71	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and then two neura two neural networks .
Bro014.B.dialogueact792	1709.88	1710.25	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact793	1711.17	1711.23	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Mmm ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact794	1711.29	1714.64	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	and it doesn't seem to help .
Bro014.A.dialogueact795	1715.74	1718.9	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	Um , however , we just have {vocalsound} one result ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact796	1718.93	1720.7	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which is the Italian mismatch ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact797	1720.7	1721.1	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so .
Bro014.A.dialogueact798	1722.71	1723.22	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bro014.A.dialogueact799	1724.61	1726.75	A	PhD	s	-1	0	We have to wait for that to fill the whole table ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact800	1726.8	1726.89	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact801	1728.36	1728.66	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.B.dialogueact802	1730.2	1735.02	B	Professor	qy^bu^rt	+1	2	There was a {vocalsound} start of some effort on something related to voicing or something .
Bro014.B.dialogueact803	1735.08	1735.38	B	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	Is that {disfmarker} ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact804	1735.82	1736.06	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact805	1736.73	1738.32	A	PhD	fh|s^aa^r	-1	0	Um , {vocalsound} yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact806	1738.49	1745.28	A	PhD	s	+1	2	So basically we try to , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh , find {vocalsound} good features that could be used for voicing detection ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact807	1746.26	1749.17	A	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	uh , but it 's still , uh {disfmarker} on the ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact808	1749.17	1750.04	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact810	1751.44	1751.56	A	PhD	x	-1	0	t
Bro014.F.dialogueact809	1751.19	1752.1	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Oh , well , I have the picture .
Bro014.A.dialogueact811	1752.23	1756.67	A	PhD	s	+1	1	we {disfmarker} w basically we are still playing with Matlab to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to look at {disfmarker} at what happened ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact812	1755.42	1755.95	C	PhD	qw.%-	-1	0	What sorts of {disfmarker}
Bro014.F.dialogueact813	1755.64	1755.83	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact814	1756.67	1756.89	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact815	1757.21	1758.83	C	PhD	qw^rt	+1	2	what sorts of features are you looking at ?
Bro014.F.dialogueact816	1757.67	1758.59	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	We have some {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact817	1759.0	1767.79	A	PhD	s^rt	+1	2	So we would be looking at , um , the {pause} variance of the spectrum of the excitation ,
Bro014.F.dialogueact818	1761.08	1764.01	F	PhD	s^t3	-1	0	uh , um , this , this , and this .
Bro014.A.dialogueact819	1767.79	1768.53	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	something like this ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact820	1769.86	1772.0	A	PhD	s^e^rt	+1	2	which is {disfmarker} should be high for voiced sounds .
Bro014.A.dialogueact821	1773.0	1773.83	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact824	1773.83	1774.13	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	we {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact822	1773.35	1773.68	C	PhD	s^co	-1	0	Wait a minute .
Bro014.C.dialogueact823	1773.68	1774.45	C	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	I {disfmarker} what does that mean ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact825	1774.45	1778.28	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	The variance of the spectrum of excitation .
Bro014.A.dialogueact826	1779.11	1779.45	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact827	1779.45	1779.85	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So the {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact828	1782.74	1788.15	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So basically the spectrum of the excitation {vocalsound} for a purely periodic sig signal shou sh
Bro014.B.dialogueact829	1786.15	1786.51	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.B.dialogueact830	1786.51	1786.8	B	Professor	s^bk.%--	-1	0	Yeah , w
Bro014.B.dialogueact831	1787.52	1799.48	B	Professor	s	+1	1	what yo what you 're calling the excitation , as I recall , is you 're subtracting the {disfmarker} the , um {disfmarker} the mel {disfmarker} mel {disfmarker} {vocalsound} mel filter , uh , spectrum from the FFT spectrum .
Bro014.A.dialogueact832	1789.24	1789.38	A	PhD	%	-1	0	e
Bro014.A.dialogueact833	1798.97	1799.44	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	That 's right .
Bro014.A.dialogueact834	1799.44	1799.58	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact836	1799.85	1800.02	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact835	1799.68	1800.0	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bro014.A.dialogueact838	1800.44	1800.64	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.F.dialogueact837	1799.95	1800.26	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact839	1800.64	1802.23	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So we have the mel f filter bank ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact840	1802.23	1802.94	A	PhD	s	-1	0	we have the FFT ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact841	1802.94	1803.96	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	so we {pause} just {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact842	1803.06	1804.65	B	Professor	s	+1	1	So it 's {disfmarker} it 's not really an excitation ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact844	1804.74	1804.97	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	No .
Bro014.B.dialogueact843	1804.65	1807.5	B	Professor	s	+1	1	but it 's something that hopefully tells you something about the excitation .
Bro014.A.dialogueact845	1807.66	1808.2	A	PhD	s^aa	+1	1	Yeah , that 's right .
Bro014.B.dialogueact846	1808.07	1808.34	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact847	1808.48	1808.68	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact848	1809.11	1810.05	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact849	1811.44	1811.62	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.F.dialogueact850	1812.43	1814.06	F	PhD	s	-1	0	We have here some histogram ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact852	1814.95	1815.99	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	E yeah ,
Bro014.F.dialogueact851	1814.83	1816.81	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but they have a lot of overlap .
Bro014.A.dialogueact853	1815.99	1817.38	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but it 's {disfmarker} it 's still {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact854	1818.33	1818.57	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact855	1818.57	1818.89	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	So ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact856	1819.19	1819.4	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	well ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact857	1819.73	1825.38	A	PhD	s	-1	0	for unvoiced portion we have something tha {vocalsound} that has a mean around O point three ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact858	1826.3	1830.15	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and for voiced portion the mean is O point fifty - nine .
Bro014.A.dialogueact859	1831.09	1833.51	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	But the variance seem quite {vocalsound} high .
Bro014.C.dialogueact860	1833.75	1834.51	C	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	How do you know {disfmarker} ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact861	1834.3	1834.45	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact862	1834.56	1834.75	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact863	1835.05	1838.67	C	PhD	qw	-1	0	How did you get your {pause} voiced and unvoiced truth data ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact864	1838.73	1840.98	A	PhD	s	-1	0	We used , uh , TIMIT
Bro014.A.dialogueact865	1841.13	1845.27	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and we used canonical mappings between the phones
Bro014.F.dialogueact866	1841.51	1841.78	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.F.dialogueact867	1841.92	1844.78	F	PhD	s	-1	0	We , uh , use {pause} TIMIT on this ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact868	1845.27	1845.54	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and
Bro014.F.dialogueact869	1845.7	1845.82	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	for {disfmarker}

Bro014.F.dialogueact871	1848.44	1852.1	F	PhD	s	-1	0	But if we look at it in one sentence , it {disfmarker} apparently it 's good ,
Bro014.F.dialogueact872	1852.69	1853.12	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I think .
Bro014.A.dialogueact873	1854.62	1854.87	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact874	1854.97	1855.14	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact875	1855.29	1855.47	A	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact876	1857.78	1859.85	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Uh , so it 's noisy TIMIT .
Bro014.A.dialogueact877	1859.85	1860.35	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	That 's right .
Bro014.A.dialogueact880	1861.08	1861.27	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.E.dialogueact878	1860.91	1861.35	E	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	It 's noisy TIMIT .
Bro014.F.dialogueact879	1860.93	1861.13	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact881	1864.48	1866.03	A	PhD	s	-1	0	It seems quite robust to noise ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact882	1866.03	1874.19	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so when we take {disfmarker} we draw its parameters across time for a clean sentence and then nois the same noisy sentence , it 's very close .
Bro014.B.dialogueact883	1870.86	1871.39	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact884	1875.77	1877.52	A	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	Yeah . So there are {disfmarker} there is this .
Bro014.A.dialogueact885	1877.7	1884.0	A	PhD	s	-1	0	There could be also the , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} something like the maximum of the auto - correlation function
Bro014.A.dialogueact886	1884.0	1884.24	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	or {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact888	1885.31	1885.52	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	which {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact887	1884.97	1887.17	C	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Is this a {disfmarker} a s a trained system ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact889	1887.49	1889.81	C	PhD	qrr	-1	0	Or is it a system where you just pick some thresholds ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact890	1889.81	1891.07	C	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	Ho - how does it work ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact891	1891.38	1894.18	A	PhD	s	+1	1	Right now we just are trying to find some features .
Bro014.A.dialogueact893	1894.81	1895.27	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	And ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact892	1894.4	1894.71	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact894	1896.27	1897.66	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact895	1897.7	1904.02	A	PhD	s^bk|s.%--	+1	1	Yeah . Hopefully , I think what we want to have is to put these features in s some kind of ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact896	1905.57	1906.2	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact897	1906.2	1909.23	A	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	well , to {disfmarker} to obtain a statistical model on these features
Bro014.A.dialogueact898	1909.23	1911.2	A	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	and to {disfmarker} or just to use a neural network
Bro014.A.dialogueact899	1911.9	1914.49	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and hopefully these features w would help {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact900	1914.78	1921.6	C	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	Because it seems like what you said about the mean of the {disfmarker} the voiced and the unvoiced {disfmarker} {comment} {vocalsound} that seemed pretty encouraging .
Bro014.A.dialogueact901	1918.22	1918.51	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact902	1921.78	1923.18	B	Professor	s^aa|s^arp	-1	0	Well , yeah , except the variance was big .
Bro014.C.dialogueact903	1921.85	1922.14	C	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact904	1922.37	1922.52	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact905	1923.0	1924.43	A	PhD	s^ba^m	-1	0	Except the variance is quite high .
Bro014.B.dialogueact906	1923.18	1923.46	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact907	1923.74	1924.07	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	Well , y
Bro014.A.dialogueact909	1924.43	1924.56	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.C.dialogueact908	1924.23	1926.07	C	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	Well , y I {disfmarker} I don't know that I would trust that so much
Bro014.C.dialogueact910	1926.07	1928.77	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because you 're doing these canonical mappings from TIMIT labellings .
Bro014.A.dialogueact912	1928.93	1929.2	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro014.C.dialogueact911	1928.77	1929.1	C	PhD	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact913	1929.1	1929.45	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact914	1930.32	1933.89	C	PhD	s^df	+1	2	really that 's sort of a cartoon picture about what 's voiced and unvoiced .
Bro014.C.dialogueact915	1933.89	1935.91	C	PhD	s	-1	0	So that could be giving you a lot of variance .
Bro014.A.dialogueact917	1936.53	1936.78	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.C.dialogueact916	1936.52	1936.84	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	I mean ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact918	1937.95	1940.67	C	PhD	s	-1	0	i it {disfmarker} it may be that {disfmarker} that you 're finding something good
Bro014.C.dialogueact919	1940.67	1944.12	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and that the variance is sort of artificial because of how you 're getting your truth .
Bro014.A.dialogueact920	1944.6	1944.94	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact921	1945.06	1945.3	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact922	1945.42	1947.85	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But another way of looking at it {vocalsound} might be that {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact923	1947.97	1950.65	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	I mean , what w we we are coming up with feature sets after all .
Bro014.B.dialogueact924	1951.24	1961.52	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So another way of looking at it is that {vocalsound} um , the mel cepstru mel {pause} spectrum , mel cepstrum , {vocalsound} any of these variants , um , give you the smooth spectrum .
Bro014.B.dialogueact925	1961.52	1962.7	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	It 's the spectral envelope .
Bro014.B.dialogueact926	1963.25	1969.95	B	Professor	s	-1	0	By going back to the FFT , {vocalsound} you 're getting something that is {pause} more like the raw data .
Bro014.B.dialogueact927	1970.67	1973.62	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So the question is , what characterization {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact928	1973.62	1974.79	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and you 're playing around with this {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact929	1974.8	1986.23	B	Professor	qw	+1	2	another way of looking at it is what characterization {vocalsound} of the difference between {pause} the raw data {pause} and this smooth version {pause} is something that you 're missing that could help ?
Bro014.B.dialogueact930	1987.2	1990.63	B	Professor	s	+1	2	So , I mean , looking at different statistical measures of that difference ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact931	1991.03	1993.23	B	Professor	s	-1	0	coming up with some things and just trying them out
Bro014.B.dialogueact932	1993.23	1997.13	B	Professor	s	+1	2	and seeing if you add them onto the feature vector does that make things better or worse in noise ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact933	1997.75	1998.8	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	where you 're really just i i
Bro014.B.dialogueact934	1998.8	2004.31	B	Professor	s	+1	2	the way I 'm looking at it is not so much you 're trying to f find the best {disfmarker} the world 's best voiced - unvoiced , uh , uh , classifier ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact935	2003.44	2003.9	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact936	2004.17	2006.81	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact937	2004.31	2010.08	B	Professor	s	+1	2	but it 's more that , {vocalsound} you know , uh , uh , try some different statistical characterizations of that difference back to the raw data
Bro014.C.dialogueact938	2008.07	2008.49	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro014.B.dialogueact939	2010.08	2010.69	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and
Bro014.B.dialogueact941	2011.16	2013.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	m maybe there 's something there that {pause} the system can use .
Bro014.C.dialogueact940	2011.04	2011.43	C	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	Right .
Bro014.A.dialogueact942	2013.85	2014.07	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact943	2015.33	2016.65	A	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah , but ther more obvious is that {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact944	2016.86	2017.01	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact945	2017.57	2020.01	A	PhD	s^r.%--	-1	0	The {disfmarker} the more obvious is that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact946	2020.56	2031.0	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	well , using the {disfmarker} th the FFT , um , {vocalsound} you just {disfmarker} it gives you just information about if it 's voiced or not voiced , ma mainly , I mean .
Bro014.A.dialogueact947	2031.24	2031.82	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	But {disfmarker} So ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact948	2031.61	2031.86	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact949	2034.01	2040.04	A	PhD	s	-1	0	this is why we {disfmarker} we started to look {pause} by having sort of voiced phonemes
Bro014.B.dialogueact950	2036.28	2036.9	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Well , that 's the rea
Bro014.B.dialogueact951	2036.9	2038.19	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	w w what I 'm arguing is that 's
Bro014.B.dialogueact952	2039.33	2039.53	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact953	2039.53	2043.41	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , uh , what I 'm arguing is that that {disfmarker} that 's givi you {disfmarker} gives you your intuition .
Bro014.A.dialogueact954	2040.04	2040.31	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact955	2044.31	2044.68	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact956	2044.4	2048.8	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But in {disfmarker} in reality , it 's {disfmarker} you know , there 's all of this {disfmarker} this overlap and so forth ,
Bro014.E.dialogueact957	2048.71	2049.13	E	Grad	s^fa^t3	-1	0	Oh , sorry .
Bro014.B.dialogueact958	2049.29	2051.72	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} But what I 'm saying is that may be OK ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact959	2052.34	2055.46	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because what you 're really getting is not actually voiced versus unvoiced ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact960	2055.46	2060.2	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	both for the fac the reason of the overlap and {disfmarker} and then , uh , th you know , structural reasons ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact961	2060.86	2062.39	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	uh , uh , like the one that Chuck said ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact962	2062.81	2066.58	B	Professor	s^e	+1	2	that {disfmarker} that in fact , well , the data itself is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that you 're working with is not perfect .
Bro014.A.dialogueact963	2064.08	2064.32	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact964	2064.9	2065.05	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact965	2066.58	2069.44	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	2	So , what I 'm saying is maybe that 's not a killer
Bro014.B.dialogueact966	2069.61	2072.27	B	Professor	s^df	+1	2	because you 're just getting some characterization ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact967	2072.27	2075.1	B	Professor	s^e	+1	2	one that 's driven by your intuition about voiced - unvoiced certainly ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact968	2073.96	2075.26	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact969	2075.34	2082.97	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but it 's just some characterization {vocalsound} of something back in the {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} in the almost raw data , rather than the smooth version .
Bro014.A.dialogueact970	2082.06	2082.62	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact971	2083.43	2094.55	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And your intuition is driving you towards particular kinds of , {vocalsound} uh , statistical characterizations of , um , what 's missing from the spectral envelope .
Bro014.A.dialogueact972	2094.77	2095.22	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact973	2095.3	2097.95	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um , obviously you have something about the excitation ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact974	2098.5	2098.9	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact975	2099.92	2101.56	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and what is it about the excitation ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact976	2102.31	2104.74	B	Professor	s	+1	2	and , you know {disfmarker} and you 're not getting the excitation anyway , you know .
Bro014.B.dialogueact977	2104.8	2105.01	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact978	2105.61	2107.52	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so I {disfmarker} I would almost take a {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact979	2108.47	2118.2	B	Professor	fh|s^cs^r	-1	0	uh , especially if {disfmarker} if these trainings and so forth are faster , I would almost just take a {vocalsound} uh , a scattershot at a few different {vocalsound} ways of look of characterizing that difference
Bro014.B.dialogueact980	2118.45	2121.77	B	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	and , uh , you could have one of them but {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and see , you know , which of them helps .
Bro014.A.dialogueact981	2121.95	2122.54	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact983	2123.02	2123.11	A	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.C.dialogueact982	2122.59	2128.43	C	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	So i is the idea that you 're going to take {pause} whatever features you develop and {disfmarker} and just add them onto the future vector ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact984	2129.02	2132.12	C	PhD	qw	-1	0	Or , what 's the use of the {disfmarker} the voiced - unvoiced detector ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact985	2133.56	2135.6	A	PhD	h|s^no	-1	0	Uh , I guess we don't know exactly yet .
Bro014.A.dialogueact986	2135.6	2137.39	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	But , {vocalsound} um {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact987	2139.48	2139.7	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact989	2142.23	2142.58	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	Th
Bro014.C.dialogueact988	2141.99	2144.38	C	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	It 's not part of a VAD system that you 're doing ?
Bro014.F.dialogueact990	2144.35	2144.62	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	No .
Bro014.A.dialogueact991	2145.22	2146.17	A	PhD	h|s^aa	-1	0	Uh , no .
Bro014.A.dialogueact994	2146.8	2146.94	A	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	No .
Bro014.C.dialogueact992	2146.43	2146.72	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact993	2146.72	2147.04	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.A.dialogueact995	2147.48	2150.56	A	PhD	s^df^rt	-1	0	No , the idea was , I guess , to {disfmarker} to use them as {disfmarker} as features .
Bro014.C.dialogueact996	2150.43	2150.85	C	PhD	s^bk^m	-1	0	Features .
Bro014.C.dialogueact997	2150.85	2151.16	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bro014.A.dialogueact998	2151.46	2152.45	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact999	2154.93	2160.17	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	Yeah , it could be , uh {disfmarker} it could be {vocalsound} a neural network that does voiced and unvoiced detection ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact1000	2160.45	2160.76	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1001	2161.26	2165.68	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	but it could be in the {disfmarker} also the big neural network that does phoneme classification .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1002	2164.27	2164.62	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1003	2166.47	2167.9	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1005	2167.9	2168.06	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1004	2167.82	2169.5	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But each one of the mixture components {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact1006	2169.5	2172.18	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , you have , uh , uh , variance only ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1007	2172.81	2181.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so it 's kind of like you 're just multiplying together these , um , probabilities from the individual features {pause} within each mixture .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1008	2181.43	2182.09	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So it 's {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact1009	2182.25	2182.69	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1010	2184.43	2185.07	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1012	2185.32	2186.58	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it seems l you know {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact1011	2185.05	2186.01	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	I think it 's a neat thing .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1013	2186.14	2187.45	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Uh , it seems like a good idea .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1014	2188.69	2188.95	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1015	2189.82	2190.22	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1016	2196.32	2196.57	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1017	2196.57	2206.0	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , {vocalsound} I know that , um , people doing some robustness things a ways back were {disfmarker} were just doing {disfmarker} just being gross and just throwing in the FFT
Bro014.B.dialogueact1018	2206.0	2208.28	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and actually it wasn't {disfmarker} wasn't {disfmarker} wasn't so bad .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1019	2209.16	2210.31	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Uh , so it would s
Bro014.B.dialogueact1020	2210.31	2216.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and you know that i it 's gotta hurt you a little bit to not have a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a spectral , uh {disfmarker} a s a smooth spectral envelope ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1021	2216.88	2219.64	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so there must be something else that you get {pause} in return for that {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact1023	2220.85	2221.17	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1022	2220.41	2220.91	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	that , uh {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact1024	2221.86	2222.32	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact1025	2223.03	2223.33	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1026	2223.12	2223.92	C	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	So how does {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact1027	2223.92	2225.92	C	PhD	s	-1	0	uh , maybe I 'm going in too much detail ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact1028	2225.92	2232.66	C	PhD	qw	-1	0	but {vocalsound} how exactly do you make the difference between the FFT and the smoothed {pause} spectral envelope ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact1029	2233.17	2235.66	C	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	Wha - wh i i uh , how is that , uh {disfmarker} ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact1030	2237.97	2239.9	A	PhD	h|s.%--	-1	0	Um , we just {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact1031	2239.9	2241.25	A	PhD	qw^t3	-1	0	How did we do it up again ?
Bro014.F.dialogueact1032	2241.8	2248.69	F	PhD	h|s^rt	-1	0	Uh , we distend the {disfmarker} we have the twenty - three coefficient af after the mel f {vocalsound} filter ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact1033	2247.13	2248.16	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1034	2249.01	2254.94	F	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	and we extend these coefficient between the {disfmarker} all the frequency range .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1035	2255.42	2255.76	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1036	2256.0	2265.64	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And i the interpolation i between the point {vocalsound} is {disfmarker} give for the triang triangular filter , the value of the triangular filter
Bro014.F.dialogueact1037	2266.22	2271.14	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and of this way we obtained this mode this model speech .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1039	2270.53	2270.79	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	S
Bro014.B.dialogueact1038	2270.36	2274.93	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	So you essentially take the values that {disfmarker} th that you get from the triangular filter and extend them
Bro014.B.dialogueact1040	2275.46	2279.13	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	to sor sort of like a rectangle , that 's at that m value .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1041	2275.75	2276.11	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1043	2278.76	2280.42	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Yeah . I think we have linear interpolation .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1042	2278.31	2278.64	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1044	2280.42	2284.54	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	So we have {disfmarker} we have one point for {disfmarker} one energy for each filter bank ,
Bro014.F.dialogueact1045	2280.54	2281.74	F	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	mmm Yeah , it 's linear .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1046	2281.86	2282.26	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1047	2283.69	2283.91	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Oh .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1049	2284.54	2288.61	A	PhD	s^e^rt	-1	0	which is {pause} the energy {pause} that 's centered on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on the triangle {disfmarker}
Bro014.F.dialogueact1048	2284.26	2284.54	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1050	2286.2	2286.58	F	PhD	s^2.%--	-1	0	At the n
Bro014.F.dialogueact1051	2287.1	2288.44	F	PhD	s^2	-1	0	at the center of the filter {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact1052	2287.65	2291.43	C	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	So you {disfmarker} you end up with a vector that 's the same length as the FFT {pause} vector ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact1053	2290.76	2290.97	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1055	2291.16	2291.77	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	That 's right .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1054	2291.03	2291.34	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1056	2291.68	2294.68	C	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	And then you just , uh , compute differences
Bro014.F.dialogueact1057	2292.85	2293.13	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1058	2293.58	2297.84	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I have here one example if you {disfmarker} if you want see something like that .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1060	2294.79	2295.88	A	PhD	s^m^na	-1	0	Then we compute the difference .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1059	2294.68	2294.95	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	and ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact1061	2295.88	2295.94	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1062	2296.02	2296.11	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1064	2296.35	2296.64	B	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1063	2296.19	2297.35	C	PhD	qy^bu^d	-1	0	uh , sum the differences ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact1065	2297.54	2297.74	A	PhD	%	-1	0	So .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1066	2298.78	2308.8	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And I think the variance is computed only from , like , two hundred hertz to {pause} one {disfmarker} to fifteen hundred .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1067	2300.07	2301.03	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh ! OK .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1068	2303.99	2304.39	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1069	2307.1	2309.86	F	PhD	s^2	-1	0	Two thou two {disfmarker} {comment} fifteen hundred ?
Bro014.B.dialogueact1070	2309.31	2309.91	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1072	2310.18	2310.63	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Because {disfmarker}
Bro014.F.dialogueact1071	2309.93	2310.13	F	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1073	2311.07	2311.35	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1074	2311.15	2312.43	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Two hundred and fifty thousand .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1075	2312.14	2312.79	A	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	Fifteen hundred .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1076	2312.79	2313.11	A	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	Because {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact1078	2313.11	2313.33	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1077	2313.04	2313.23	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1079	2313.78	2315.1	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Two thousand and fifteen hundred .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1080	2314.54	2317.5	A	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	Above , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it seems that {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact1081	2318.2	2326.39	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Well , some voiced sound can have also , {vocalsound} like , a noisy {pause} part on high frequencies ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact1082	2326.39	2326.58	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact1084	2328.06	2328.22	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact1083	2327.62	2327.77	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1086	2328.46	2329.28	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Well , it 's just {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact1085	2328.16	2330.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	No , it 's {disfmarker} makes sense to look at {pause} low frequencies .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1087	2329.31	2336.08	C	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	So this is {disfmarker} uh , basically this is comparing {vocalsound} an original version of the signal to a smoothed version of the same signal ?
Bro014.F.dialogueact1088	2335.33	2335.65	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1089	2336.3	2336.51	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1090	2336.51	2338.5	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So i so i i this is {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact1091	2338.72	2343.24	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	I mean , i you could argue about whether it should be linear interpolation or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or zeroeth order ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1092	2343.24	2343.85	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but
Bro014.C.dialogueact1093	2343.68	2344.01	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1094	2344.22	2348.74	B	Professor	s	-1	0	at any rate something like this {pause} is what you 're feeding your recognizer , typically .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1095	2348.97	2349.95	C	PhD	qw^d.%--	-1	0	Like which of the {disfmarker} ?
Bro014.B.dialogueact1096	2349.82	2350.11	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1097	2350.11	2355.9	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh , so the mel cepstrum is the {disfmarker} is the {disfmarker} is the cepstrum of this {disfmarker} {vocalsound} this , uh , spectrum or log spectrum ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact1098	2351.15	2351.87	A	PhD	s^t3.%--	-1	0	So this is {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact1099	2351.87	2352.1	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1100	2352.02	2352.25	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1101	2355.14	2355.57	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right , right .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1102	2355.9	2356.23	B	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	whatever it {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact1103	2356.23	2359.83	B	Professor	qr	-1	0	You - you 're subtracting in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {vocalsound} power domain or log domain ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact1104	2359.69	2360.36	A	PhD	s	-1	0	In log domain .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1106	2360.4	2360.49	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1105	2360.23	2360.88	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Log domain .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1107	2361.1	2361.37	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1108	2361.37	2364.36	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So it 's sort of like division , when you do the {disfmarker} yeah , the spectra .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1109	2363.12	2363.39	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1110	2363.86	2364.79	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh , yeah .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1111	2364.56	2365.35	C	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	It 's the ratio .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1112	2365.41	2365.97	B	Professor	h	-1	0	Um .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1113	2366.98	2367.28	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1114	2367.76	2368.63	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	But , anyway ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1115	2368.71	2369.36	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact1116	2370.96	2371.65	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	and that 's {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact1117	2371.7	2374.81	C	PhD	qw	-1	0	So what 's th uh , what 's the intuition behind this kind of a thing ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact1118	2374.81	2379.05	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I don't know really know the signal - processing well enough to understand what {disfmarker} {vocalsound} what is that doing .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1119	2378.1	2378.51	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	So .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1120	2380.27	2380.47	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1123	2380.81	2387.71	A	PhD	s	-1	0	What happen if {disfmarker} what we have {disfmarker} have {disfmarker} what we would like to have is {pause} some spectrum of the excitation signal ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1121	2380.64	2380.73	B	Professor	s^aa^t3	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1122	2380.73	2381.62	B	Professor	s^na^t3	-1	0	I guess that makes sense .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1124	2381.62	2381.77	B	Professor	s^aa^t3	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1125	2388.16	2390.09	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which is for voiced sound ideally
Bro014.A.dialogueact1126	2390.09	2391.24	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	a {disfmarker} a pulse train
Bro014.C.dialogueact1127	2391.79	2392.18	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1128	2393.02	2395.65	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and for unvoiced it 's something that 's more flat .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1129	2395.78	2396.15	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1130	2396.43	2396.69	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1131	2397.23	2399.07	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And the way to do this {vocalsound} is that {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact1132	2399.07	2402.65	A	PhD	s	-1	0	well , we have the {disfmarker} we have the FFT because it 's computed in {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} in the system ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact1133	2402.65	2405.75	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	and we have {vocalsound} the mel {vocalsound} filter banks ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact1134	2402.71	2403.01	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1135	2405.79	2406.3	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1136	2406.76	2417.23	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and so if we {disfmarker} if we , like , remove the mel filter bank from the FFT , {vocalsound} we have something that 's {pause} close to the {pause} excitation signal .
Bro014.E.dialogueact1137	2417.83	2418.22	E	Grad	x	-1	0	Oh .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1139	2419.12	2423.98	A	PhD	s^e^rt	-1	0	It 's something that 's like {vocalsound} a {disfmarker} a a train of p a pulse train for voiced sound
Bro014.C.dialogueact1138	2418.76	2419.35	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1140	2420.03	2420.24	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1141	2420.09	2421.48	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh ! OK .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1142	2422.85	2423.23	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1143	2423.98	2426.08	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and that 's {disfmarker} that should be flat for {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact1144	2424.4	2424.64	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1145	2424.91	2425.86	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	I see .

Bro014.B.dialogueact1211	2475.17	2485.36	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} you know , what you 're doing in feature extraction for speech recognition is you have , {vocalsound} uh , in your head a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a simplified production model for speech ,

Bro014.F.dialogueact1215	2486.04	2489.68	F	PhD	s^t3	-1	0	This is the {disfmarker} the auto - correlation {disfmarker} the R - zero energy .

Bro014.A.dialogueact1217	2490.01	2493.28	A	PhD	qy^r^t3	-1	0	do you have the mean for the auto - correlation {disfmarker} ?
Bro014.B.dialogueact1218	2491.12	2494.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh , first order for speech recognition , you say " I don't care about the source " .

Bro014.A.dialogueact1222	2494.19	2495.74	A	PhD	s^nd^t3	-1	0	Well , I mean for the {disfmarker} the energy .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1221	2493.74	2494.43	F	PhD	s^na^t3	-1	0	I have the mean .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1224	2494.43	2494.77	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact1223	2494.24	2494.72	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1226	2495.24	2496.76	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And so you just want to find out what the filters are .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1225	2494.94	2495.52	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1227	2496.21	2496.45	F	PhD	s^aa^t3	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1228	2496.76	2507.33	B	Professor	s	-1	0	The filters {vocalsound} roughly act like a , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a , uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a an overall resonant {disfmarker} you know , f some resonances and so forth that th that 's processing excitation .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1229	2496.82	2497.06	F	PhD	s^na^t3	-1	0	Here .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1230	2498.47	2499.55	A	PhD	s^t3	-1	0	They should be more close .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1231	2500.01	2500.31	F	PhD	s^ar^t3	-1	0	Ah , no .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1232	2500.31	2500.98	F	PhD	s^rt^t3	-1	0	This is this ?
Bro014.F.dialogueact1233	2501.63	2503.05	F	PhD	s^rt^t3	-1	0	More close . Is this ?
Bro014.F.dialogueact1234	2503.28	2503.58	F	PhD	s^t3	-1	0	And this .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1235	2504.59	2505.13	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1237	2505.61	2505.81	A	PhD	s^bk^t3	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1236	2505.12	2505.39	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1238	2505.81	2506.43	A	PhD	s^t3.%--	-1	0	So they are {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact1239	2506.43	2507.73	A	PhD	s^t3	-1	0	this is {disfmarker} there is less difference .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1240	2506.56	2506.99	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1241	2507.76	2513.06	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So if you look at the spectral envelope , just the very smooth properties of it , {vocalsound} you get something closer to that .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1242	2508.41	2509.91	A	PhD	s^t3	-1	0	This is less {disfmarker} it 's less robust .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1243	2510.24	2510.86	F	PhD	s^m^na^t3	-1	0	Less robust .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1244	2510.93	2511.19	F	PhD	s^aa^t3	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1245	2513.41	2513.84	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Oh , yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1246	2513.56	2519.87	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And the notion is if you have the full spectrum , with all the little nitty - gritty details , {vocalsound} that that has the effect of both ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact1247	2516.88	2517.22	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1249	2519.87	2523.64	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and it would be a multiplication in {disfmarker} in frequency domain
Bro014.C.dialogueact1248	2519.8	2520.27	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1250	2523.64	2527.89	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	so that would be like an addition in log {disfmarker} {vocalsound} power spectrum domain .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1251	2526.68	2527.0	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1252	2527.39	2527.67	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1253	2528.49	2536.24	B	Professor	s	+1	2	And so this is saying , well , if you really do have that {vocalsound} sort of vocal tract envelope , and you subtract that off , what you get is the excitation .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1254	2536.55	2538.74	B	Professor	s	+1	2	And I call that lies because you don't really have that ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1255	2538.74	2543.18	B	Professor	s^df	+1	0	you just have some kind of {vocalsound} signal - processing trickery to get something that 's kind of smooth .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1256	2543.61	2545.39	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	It 's not really what 's happening in the vocal tract
Bro014.C.dialogueact1257	2544.88	2545.26	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1258	2545.39	2547.49	B	Professor	s^df	+1	2	so you 're not really getting the vocal excitation .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1259	2545.46	2545.9	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1260	2547.96	2554.48	B	Professor	s^df	+1	2	That 's why I was going to the {disfmarker} why I was referring to it in a more {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a more , uh , {vocalsound} uh , {vocalsound} conservative way ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1261	2554.48	2555.54	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	2	when I was saying " well , it 's {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact1262	2555.54	2555.68	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1263	2555.88	2556.48	B	Professor	s	+1	2	it 's the excitation " .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1264	2556.48	2557.64	B	Professor	s	+1	2	But it 's not really the excitation .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1265	2557.64	2559.61	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	It 's whatever it is that 's different between {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact1266	2559.52	2559.86	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1268	2560.25	2561.17	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	This moved in the {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact1267	2560.25	2564.13	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so , stand standing back from that , you sort of say there 's this very detailed representation .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1269	2561.17	2561.55	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1271	2564.52	2566.11	B	Professor	s	-1	0	You go to a smooth representation .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1270	2564.26	2564.77	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1272	2566.51	2569.53	B	Professor	s^df^r	-1	0	You go to a smooth representation cuz this typically generalizes better .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1273	2569.57	2570.15	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1274	2570.16	2570.58	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1275	2570.87	2572.75	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but whenever you smooth you lose something ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1276	2573.14	2575.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so the question is have you lost something you can you use ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact1277	2575.51	2575.92	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1278	2576.19	2581.36	B	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	Um , probably you wouldn't want to go to the extreme of just ta saying " OK , our feature set will be the FFT " ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1279	2581.8	2585.4	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	cuz we really think we do gain something in robustness from going to something smoother ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1281	2585.78	2587.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but maybe there 's something that we missed .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1280	2585.6	2585.94	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1283	2587.63	2588.37	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	So what is it ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact1282	2587.36	2587.69	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1284	2588.37	2590.21	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And then you go back to the intuition that ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1285	2590.21	2591.76	B	Professor	s	+1	2	well , you don't really get the excitation ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1286	2591.76	2593.08	B	Professor	s	+1	2	but you get something related to it .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1287	2592.89	2593.27	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1289	2593.8	2599.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And it {disfmarker} and as you can see from those pictures , you do get something {vocalsound} that shows some periodicity , uh , in frequency ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact1288	2593.5	2593.8	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1291	2599.76	2600.12	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	you know ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1292	2600.12	2601.26	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and also in time .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1290	2599.64	2599.94	C	PhD	qh^bh^rt	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1293	2601.26	2601.5	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact1294	2601.46	2602.41	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker} that 's really neat .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1295	2602.25	2602.67	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	so ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact1296	2603.57	2605.48	C	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	So you don't have one for unvoiced {pause} picture ?

Bro014.C.dialogueact1316	2625.3	2626.51	C	PhD	qy^bu^d.%--	+1	1	And so you said this is pretty {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact1317	2626.51	2629.32	C	PhD	qy^rt	+1	1	doing this kind of thing is pretty robust to noise ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact1318	2629.65	2630.66	A	PhD	s^na	+1	1	It seems ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact1319	2630.66	2630.86	A	PhD	s^aa	+1	1	yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1322	2631.12	2632.0	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact1321	2631.08	2631.33	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Huh .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1320	2630.99	2631.12	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Pfft .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1323	2631.68	2631.82	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Oops .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1324	2632.31	2634.41	F	PhD	s	-1	0	The mean is different {vocalsound} with it ,
Bro014.F.dialogueact1325	2634.72	2638.5	F	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	because the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the histogram for the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the classifica
Bro014.A.dialogueact1326	2637.57	2637.94	A	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No , no , no .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1327	2637.94	2639.97	A	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	But th the kind of robustness to noise {disfmarker}
Bro014.F.dialogueact1328	2638.5	2638.78	F	PhD	s^bk^fe	-1	0	Oh !
Bro014.A.dialogueact1329	2639.97	2648.69	A	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	So if {disfmarker} if you take this frame , {vocalsound} uh , from the noisy utterance and the same frame from the clean utterance {disfmarker}
Bro014.F.dialogueact1330	2642.49	2642.76	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1331	2649.05	2650.51	C	PhD	qy^2	+1	1	You end up with a similar difference
Bro014.A.dialogueact1332	2650.25	2651.26	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Y y y yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1333	2651.26	2651.99	A	PhD	s^na^r.%--	-1	0	We end up with {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact1334	2651.57	2652.11	C	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	over here ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact1335	2652.98	2653.14	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1336	2653.43	2653.87	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1338	2654.23	2654.49	C	PhD	s^ba^bk	-1	0	Cool !
Bro014.F.dialogueact1337	2654.16	2657.77	F	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	I have here the same frame for the {pause} clean speech {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact1339	2657.94	2658.74	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , that 's clean .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1340	2658.38	2658.95	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	the same cle
Bro014.C.dialogueact1341	2659.06	2659.68	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK
Bro014.F.dialogueact1342	2659.22	2660.64	F	PhD	s	-1	0	But they are a difference .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1344	2660.83	2661.18	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact1345	2661.18	2661.43	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	that 's {disfmarker}
Bro014.F.dialogueact1343	2660.82	2666.83	F	PhD	s^df^rt	-1	0	Because here the FFT is only with {vocalsound} two hundred fifty - six point
Bro014.C.dialogueact1347	2667.1	2667.72	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1346	2667.03	2669.62	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and this is with five hundred {pause} twelve .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1349	2670.1	2670.34	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1350	2670.34	2672.15	A	PhD	s	-1	0	This is kind of inter interesting also
Bro014.C.dialogueact1348	2669.9	2670.45	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1351	2672.15	2691.15	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because if we use the standard , {vocalsound} uh , frame length of {disfmarker} of , like , twenty - five milliseconds , {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} what happens is that for low - pitched voiced , because of the frame length , y you don't really have {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you don't clearly see this periodic structure ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1352	2691.59	2691.98	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1353	2693.68	2696.55	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because of the first lobe of {disfmarker} of each {disfmarker} each of the harmonics .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1354	2696.07	2698.94	C	PhD	s^bu.%--	-1	0	So this one inclu is a longer {disfmarker} Ah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1355	2697.34	2701.17	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So , this is like {disfmarker} yeah , fifty milliseconds or something like that .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1356	2700.56	2701.2	F	PhD	s^m^na.%--	-1	0	Fifty millis
Bro014.F.dialogueact1357	2701.66	2701.9	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1358	2702.18	2703.53	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Yeah , but it 's the same frame
Bro014.A.dialogueact1359	2703.68	2704.74	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact1360	2704.34	2706.33	C	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	Oh , it 's that time - frequency trade - off thing .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1361	2706.35	2706.61	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1362	2706.43	2706.69	C	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bro014.C.dialogueact1363	2707.53	2708.31	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1364	2709.39	2709.64	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1365	2710.04	2710.33	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	So , yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1366	2710.04	2710.49	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1367	2710.06	2712.13	C	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Oh . Oh , so this i is this the difference here ,
Bro014.C.dialogueact1370	2713.42	2713.75	C	PhD	qy^d^e^rt	-1	0	for that ?
Bro014.F.dialogueact1368	2713.05	2713.38	F	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1369	2713.38	2714.34	F	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	This is the signal .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1371	2714.81	2715.76	F	PhD	s^nd^r	-1	0	This is the signal .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1372	2715.56	2715.88	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I see that .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1373	2715.88	2716.19	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , yeah .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1374	2716.57	2717.3	F	PhD	s	-1	0	The frame .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1375	2717.6	2718.71	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Oh , that 's the f the original .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1377	2718.69	2718.89	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1376	2718.36	2719.9	F	PhD	s^na	-1	0	This is the fra the original frame .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1378	2718.89	2721.44	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So with a short frame basically you have only two periods
Bro014.C.dialogueact1379	2720.47	2720.9	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1380	2721.44	2724.47	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and it 's not {disfmarker} not enough to {disfmarker} to have this kind of neat things .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1381	2721.47	2722.1	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1382	2721.56	2722.07	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1383	2722.87	2723.35	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1384	2724.93	2725.09	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bro014.F.dialogueact1385	2725.38	2725.76	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And here {disfmarker}
Bro014.F.dialogueact1386	2725.76	2726.52	F	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No , well .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1387	2727.58	2727.73	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1388	2727.73	2730.75	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	So probably we 'll have to use , {vocalsound} like , long f long frames .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1389	2730.85	2730.94	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1390	2730.85	2731.22	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.E.dialogueact1391	2731.44	2731.78	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1392	2734.07	2734.22	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1394	2734.69	2735.07	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1393	2734.44	2735.02	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That 's interesting .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1395	2735.69	2736.14	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	Yeah , maybe .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1396	2738.08	2739.01	B	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	Well , I mean it looks better ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1397	2739.01	2749.0	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but , I mean , the thing is if {disfmarker} if , uh {disfmarker} if you 're actually asking {disfmarker} you know , if you actually j uh , need to do {disfmarker} place along an FFT , it may be {disfmarker} it may be pushing things .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1398	2749.2	2749.4	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1399	2749.8	2751.26	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and , uh {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact1400	2752.87	2757.58	C	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Would you {disfmarker} would you wanna do this kind of , uh , difference thing {vocalsound} after you do spectral subtraction ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact1401	2759.22	2761.32	A	PhD	h|s^am	-1	0	Uh , {vocalsound} maybe .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1402	2760.82	2761.03	F	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bro014.F.dialogueact1403	2761.67	2762.58	F	PhD	s^am	-1	0	Maybe we can do that .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1404	2765.39	2767.62	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1405	2772.23	2772.41	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1406	2772.79	2774.92	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	The spectral subtraction is being done
Bro014.B.dialogueact1407	2775.72	2777.26	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	at what level ? Is it being done
Bro014.B.dialogueact1408	2777.26	2778.91	B	Professor	qy^e^rt	-1	0	at the level of FFT bins
Bro014.B.dialogueact1409	2778.91	2781.63	B	Professor	qrr^e^rt	-1	0	or at the level of , uh , mel spectrum or something ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact1410	2780.64	2781.89	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact1411	2784.03	2785.35	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I guess it depends .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1412	2786.53	2787.35	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	I mean , how are they doing it ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact1413	2787.57	2788.41	A	PhD	s^bk^m	-1	0	How they 're doing it ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact1414	2788.41	2788.77	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1415	2789.48	2790.59	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact1416	2792.0	2795.94	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I guess Ericsson is on the , um , filter bank ,
Bro014.F.dialogueact1417	2794.76	2796.64	F	PhD	s^2	-1	0	FFT . Filter bank ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact1418	2796.0	2796.23	A	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	no ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact1420	2796.88	2797.8	A	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's on the filter bank ,
Bro014.F.dialogueact1419	2796.82	2796.96	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1421	2797.8	2797.97	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1422	2798.81	2799.59	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So , yeah ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact1423	2799.97	2800.89	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	probably {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact1425	2803.79	2805.33	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	I i it {disfmarker} Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1424	2803.49	2805.66	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So in that case , it might not make much difference at all .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1426	2806.18	2808.76	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Seems like you 'd wanna do it on the FFT bins .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1427	2809.19	2809.45	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	Maybe .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1428	2810.08	2811.3	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	I mean , certainly it 'd be better .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1429	2810.11	2811.42	C	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	I I mean , if you were gonna {disfmarker}
Bro014.C.dialogueact1430	2811.42	2812.78	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	uh , for {disfmarker} for this purpose , that is .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1432	2813.42	2813.81	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1431	2813.31	2813.56	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1434	2815.89	2816.22	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .

Bro014.B.dialogueact1435	2821.78	2822.11	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1436	2823.48	2823.94	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1437	2823.78	2824.28	B	Professor	qo^tc	-1	0	What else ?
Bro014.A.dialogueact1438	2825.67	2827.62	A	PhD	h	-1	0	Uh . {vocalsound} Yeah ,
Bro014.A.dialogueact1439	2827.62	2828.15	A	PhD	s	-1	0	that 's all .
Bro014.A.dialogueact1440	2828.71	2837.78	A	PhD	s^cc	+1	1	So we 'll perhaps {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} try to convince OGI people to use the new {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the new filters
Bro014.A.dialogueact1441	2837.78	2838.36	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}

Bro014.B.dialogueact1443	2842.53	2842.8	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1444	2844.72	2851.15	B	Professor	qy	+1	1	Uh , has {disfmarker} has anything happened yet on this business of having some sort of standard , uh , source ,

Bro014.A.dialogueact1489	2931.76	2932.22	A	PhD	%	-1	0	Yeah , but {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact1491	2932.18	2932.54	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	Oh , no .
Bro014.C.dialogueact1490	2931.85	2932.13	C	PhD	%	-1	0	Y
Bro014.B.dialogueact1492	2932.54	2933.94	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	We like {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact1493	2934.72	2939.44	B	Professor	s^j	-1	0	w we are {disfmarker} we 're in the , uh , Bourlard - Hermansky - Morgan , uh , frame of mind .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1494	2939.44	2940.86	B	Professor	s^j	-1	0	Yeah , we like high error rates .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1495	2940.86	2941.65	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker}
Bro014.A.dialogueact1496	2941.96	2942.47	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1497	2943.14	2944.52	B	Professor	s^j	-1	0	That way there 's lots of work to do .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1498	2945.03	2945.29	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So it 's {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact1499	2947.33	2947.84	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Uh ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1500	2948.84	2949.38	B	Professor	qy^d.%--	-1	0	anything to
Bro014.B.dialogueact1502	2951.05	2951.44	B	Professor	qy^d	-1	0	talk about ?
Bro014.D.dialogueact1501	2950.78	2952.4	D	Grad	h|s^nd	+1	2	N um , not not not much is new .
Bro014.D.dialogueact1503	2952.4	2969.89	D	Grad	s	+1	1	So when I talked about what I 'm planning to do last time , {vocalsound} I said I was , um , going to use Avendano 's method of , um , {vocalsound} using a transformation , um , {vocalsound} to map from long analysis frames which are used for removing reverberation to short analysis frames for feature calculation .
Bro014.D.dialogueact1504	2970.52	2975.03	D	Grad	s	-1	0	He has a trick for doing that {pause} involving viewing the DFT as a matrix .
Bro014.D.dialogueact1505	2975.63	2976.1	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro014.D.dialogueact1506	2976.91	2981.02	D	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	but , uh , um , I decided {vocalsound} not to do that after all
Bro014.D.dialogueact1507	2981.02	2990.3	D	Grad	s^df	+1	1	because I {disfmarker} I realized to use it I 'd need to have these short analysis frames get plugged directly into the feature computation somehow
Bro014.B.dialogueact1508	2990.1	2990.79	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.D.dialogueact1509	2990.3	2997.16	D	Grad	s^df	+1	1	and right now I think our feature computation is set to up to , um , {vocalsound} take , um , audio as input , in general .
Bro014.D.dialogueact1510	2997.61	3002.24	D	Grad	s^cc	+1	1	So I decided that I {disfmarker} I 'll do the reverberation removal on the long analysis windows
Bro014.D.dialogueact1511	3002.24	3003.91	D	Grad	s^cc	+1	1	and then just re - synthesize audio
Bro014.D.dialogueact1512	3003.91	3005.08	D	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	and then send that .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1513	3005.98	3008.82	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	This is in order to use the SRI system or something .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1515	3009.13	3009.27	B	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bro014.D.dialogueact1514	3009.0	3009.46	D	Grad	h	-1	0	Um ,
Bro014.D.dialogueact1516	3010.28	3010.65	D	Grad	%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker}
Bro014.D.dialogueact1517	3011.73	3016.59	D	Grad	s^arp	-1	0	or even if I 'm using our system , I was thinking it might be easier to just re - synthesize the audio ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1518	3013.76	3014.03	B	Professor	qy^bh^rt	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bro014.D.dialogueact1519	3017.13	3019.4	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because then I could just feacalc as is
Bro014.D.dialogueact1520	3019.4	3020.81	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	and I wouldn't have to change the code .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1521	3021.07	3021.46	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1522	3023.4	3023.69	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1523	3023.86	3024.74	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , it 's {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact1524	3025.81	3026.3	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1525	3027.01	3029.93	B	Professor	s	-1	0	certainly in a short {disfmarker} short - term this just sounds easier .
Bro014.D.dialogueact1526	3030.19	3030.39	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1527	3030.87	3031.13	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1528	3031.13	3036.69	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	I mean , longer - term if it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if it turns out to be useful , one {disfmarker} one might want to do something else ,
Bro014.D.dialogueact1529	3035.66	3036.42	D	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Right . That 's true .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1530	3036.69	3036.88	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact1531	3037.94	3045.19	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , uh , I mean , in {disfmarker} in other words , you {disfmarker} you may be putting other kinds of errors in {pause} from the re - synthesis process .
Bro014.D.dialogueact1532	3037.95	3039.12	D	Grad	fg	-1	0	But {disfmarker} e u
Bro014.D.dialogueact1533	3044.46	3045.59	D	Grad	s^2	-1	0	From the re - synthesis ?
Bro014.D.dialogueact1534	3045.59	3045.91	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1535	3046.16	3047.1	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.D.dialogueact1536	3046.25	3046.83	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	O - OK .
Bro014.D.dialogueact1537	3046.83	3048.71	D	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I don't know anything about re - synthesis .
Bro014.D.dialogueact1538	3048.71	3050.31	D	Grad	qw	-1	0	Uh , how likely do you think that is ?
Bro014.B.dialogueact1539	3051.37	3053.27	B	Professor	h|s	-1	0	Uh , it depends what you {disfmarker} what you do .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1540	3054.3	3056.56	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's , uh ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1541	3057.93	3058.51	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact1542	3061.82	3062.11	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	Don't know .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1543	3062.19	3064.79	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	But anyway it sounds like a reasonable way to go for a {disfmarker} for an initial thing ,
Bro014.B.dialogueact1544	3064.79	3067.62	B	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	and we can look at {disfmarker} {vocalsound} at exactly what you end up doing
Bro014.B.dialogueact1545	3067.62	3073.75	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and then figure out if there 's some {disfmarker} {vocalsound} something that could be {disfmarker} be hurt by the end part of the process .
Bro014.D.dialogueact1546	3074.35	3074.7	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1547	3075.15	3075.29	B	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1548	3080.16	3080.58	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So that 's {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact1550	3081.64	3082.23	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	That was it , huh ?
Bro014.D.dialogueact1549	3081.27	3082.96	D	Grad	s	-1	0	That {disfmarker} Yeah , e That 's it , that 's it .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1551	3082.23	3082.45	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1552	3083.3	3083.55	B	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro014.D.dialogueact1553	3083.31	3083.63	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1554	3084.3	3086.3	B	Professor	qo	+1	2	Um , anything to {pause} add ?
Bro014.E.dialogueact1555	3085.62	3086.04	E	Grad	h	-1	0	Um .
Bro014.E.dialogueact1556	3086.85	3089.09	E	Grad	s	+1	2	Well , I 've been continuing reading .
Bro014.E.dialogueact1557	3089.09	3091.66	E	Grad	s	+1	2	I went off on a little tangent this past week ,
Bro014.E.dialogueact1558	3091.66	3092.15	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bro014.E.dialogueact1559	3092.76	3096.73	E	Grad	s^e	+1	1	looking at , uh , {vocalsound} uh , modulation s spectrum stuff ,
Bro014.E.dialogueact1560	3097.21	3097.89	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bro014.E.dialogueact1561	3098.1	3102.46	E	Grad	s	+1	1	and {disfmarker} and learning a bit about what {disfmarker} what , um {disfmarker} what it is ,
Bro014.E.dialogueact1562	3102.92	3105.71	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and , uh , the importance of it in speech recognition .
Bro014.E.dialogueact1563	3105.71	3115.73	E	Grad	s^rt	+1	1	And I found some {disfmarker} {vocalsound} some , uh , neat papers , {vocalsound} um , historical papers from , {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} Kanedera , Hermansky , and Arai .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1564	3116.19	3116.46	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.E.dialogueact1565	3116.27	3125.76	E	Grad	s.%--	+1	1	And they {disfmarker} they did a lot of experiments where th where , {vocalsound} um , they take speech {vocalsound} and , um , e they modify {vocalsound} the , uh {disfmarker}
Bro014.E.dialogueact1566	3125.98	3133.3	E	Grad	s	+1	1	they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they measure the relative importance of having different , um , portions of the modulation spectrum intact .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1568	3133.91	3134.22	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.E.dialogueact1567	3133.87	3143.35	E	Grad	s^rt	+1	1	And they find that the {disfmarker} the spectrum between one and sixteen hertz in the modulation {vocalsound} is , uh {disfmarker} is im important for speech recognition .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1570	3144.01	3144.3	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Sure .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1571	3144.3	3146.81	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , this sort of goes back to earlier stuff by Drullman .
Bro014.E.dialogueact1569	3143.84	3144.36	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1573	3147.46	3152.37	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and , uh , the {disfmarker} the MSG features were sort of built up {vocalsound} with this notion {disfmarker}
Bro014.E.dialogueact1572	3147.04	3147.38	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro014.E.dialogueact1574	3150.43	3150.61	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1575	3152.59	3157.8	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	But , I guess , I thought you had brought this up in the context of , um , targets somehow .
Bro014.E.dialogueact1576	3157.92	3158.68	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1577	3158.63	3159.16	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But i m
Bro014.E.dialogueact1578	3158.68	3159.29	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bro014.B.dialogueact1579	3159.29	3164.38	B	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	i it 's not {disfmarker} I mean , they 're sort of not in the same kind of category as , say , a phonetic target or a syllabic target
Bro014.E.dialogueact1580	3159.94	3160.08	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro014.E.dialogueact1581	3162.24	3162.55	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1582	3164.38	3164.83	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	or a {disfmarker}
Bro014.E.dialogueact1583	3164.79	3171.07	E	Grad	fg|s^cs	+1	1	Um , I was thinking more like using them as {disfmarker} as the inputs to {disfmarker} to the detectors .
Bro014.B.dialogueact1584	3165.5	3166.99	B	Professor	s	-1	0	or a feature or something .
