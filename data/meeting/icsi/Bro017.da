Bro017.B.dialogueact0	0.04	0.84	B	Professor	z	-1	0	Is it starting now ?
Bro017.E.dialogueact1	1.139	1.319	E	PhD	z	-1	0	Yep .
Bro017.B.dialogueact2	1.81	3.24	B	Professor	z	-1	0	So what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} from {disfmarker} what {disfmarker}
Bro017.A.dialogueact4	3.47	3.85	A	Grad	z	-1	0	Hello ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact3	3.24	6.682	B	Professor	z	-1	0	Whatever we say from now on , it can be held against us ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact5	6.682	6.882	B	Professor	z	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.E.dialogueact6	6.96	7.31	E	PhD	z	-1	0	That 's right .
Bro017.B.dialogueact7	9.74	10.34	B	Professor	z	-1	0	and uh
Bro017.A.dialogueact8	10.761	12.311	A	Grad	z	-1	0	It 's your right to remain silent .
Bro017.B.dialogueact9	11.8	12.02	B	Professor	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact10	12.6	17.42	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	So I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the problem is that I actually don't know how th these held meetings are held ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact11	17.42	20.63	B	Professor	s	-1	0	if they are very informal and sort of just people are say what 's going on
Bro017.E.dialogueact12	19.641	19.991	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact13	20.63	20.85	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	and
Bro017.E.dialogueact14	20.631	21.671	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , that 's usually what we do .
Bro017.B.dialogueact16	21.89	22.34	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro017.E.dialogueact15	21.671	25.801	E	PhD	s^df.%--:qw.%--	-1	0	We just sorta go around and people say what 's going on , what 's the latest uh {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact17	23.139	23.439	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact18	24.864	25.314	B	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro017.B.dialogueact19	25.614	33.364	B	Professor	s^t	-1	0	So I guess that what may be a {disfmarker} reasonable is if I uh first make a report on what 's happening in Aurora in general , at least what from my perspective .
Bro017.E.dialogueact20	32.364	32.624	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact21	33.42	34.04	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That would be great .
Bro017.B.dialogueact23	34.118	39.918	B	Professor	fg|s^rt	+1	1	And {disfmarker} and uh so , I {disfmarker} I think that Carmen and Stephane reported on uh Amsterdam meeting ,
Bro017.D.dialogueact22	34.0	34.32	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	Uh o
Bro017.B.dialogueact24	39.998	41.488	B	Professor	s^ba	+1	1	which was kind of interesting
Bro017.B.dialogueact25	41.488	45.978	B	Professor	s^rt	+1	2	because it was for the first time we realized we are not friends really , but we are competitors .
Bro017.B.dialogueact26	46.248	50.138	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Cuz until then it was sort of like everything was like wonderful
Bro017.B.dialogueact27	50.138	50.378	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact28	50.4	50.74	E	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact29	50.97	52.49	E	PhD	s	+1	1	It seemed like there were still some issues ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact30	52.45	52.7	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact31	52.49	52.74	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.E.dialogueact32	52.74	53.91	E	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	that they were trying to decide ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact33	53.882	55.672	B	Professor	s^na	+1	2	There is a plenty of {disfmarker} there 're plenty of issues .
Bro017.E.dialogueact34	54.83	57.11	E	PhD	s.%-	+1	1	Like the voice activity detector ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact35	56.64	64.825	B	Professor	s	+1	1	Well and what happened was that they realized that if two leading proposals , which was French Telecom Alcatel , and us both had uh voice activity detector .
Bro017.B.dialogueact37	65.351	72.371	B	Professor	s:s	+1	1	And I said " well big surprise , I mean we could have told you that {pause} n n n four months ago , except we didn't because nobody else was bringing it up " .
Bro017.E.dialogueact36	64.9	65.26	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro017.B.dialogueact38	72.371	75.091	B	Professor	s	+1	1	Obviously French Telecom didn't volunteer this information either ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact40	75.506	80.219	B	Professor	s	+1	1	cuz we were working on {disfmarker} mainly on voice activity detector for past uh several months
Bro017.E.dialogueact39	75.29	75.59	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro017.B.dialogueact41	80.219	82.759	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because that 's buying us the most uh thing .
Bro017.B.dialogueact42	82.759	86.019	B	Professor	s	+1	1	And everybody said " Well but this is not fair . We didn't know that . "
Bro017.B.dialogueact43	86.9	89.99	B	Professor	s	+1	1	And of course uh the {disfmarker} it 's not working on features really .
Bro017.B.dialogueact45	90.19	91.64	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And be I agreed .
Bro017.E.dialogueact44	89.705	90.035	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro017.B.dialogueact46	91.64	92.26	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	I said " well yeah ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact47	92.26	93.21	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	you are absolutely right ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact48	93.21	97.45	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean if I wish that you provided better end point at speech because uh {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact49	97.766	102.82	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	or at least that if we could modify the recognizer , uh to account for these long silences ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact50	102.82	106.07	B	Professor	s	-1	0	because otherwise uh that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} th that wasn't a correct thing . "
Bro017.B.dialogueact51	107.24	114.39	B	Professor	fh|s:s	+1	1	And so then ev ev everybody else says " well we should {disfmarker} we need to do a new eval evaluation without voice activity detector ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact52	114.39	116.12	B	Professor	s:s	+1	1	or we have to do something about it " .
Bro017.E.dialogueact53	114.637	114.957	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro017.B.dialogueact54	116.12	118.61	B	Professor	s	+1	1	And in principle I {disfmarker} uh I {disfmarker} we agreed .
Bro017.E.dialogueact55	118.86	119.37	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact56	119.54	120.43	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	We said uh " yeah " .
Bro017.B.dialogueact57	120.69	121.6	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	Because uh {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact58	121.98	126.58	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	but in that case , uh we would like to change the uh {disfmarker} the algorithm
Bro017.B.dialogueact59	126.58	131.32	B	Professor	s^df	+1	1	because uh if we are working on different data , we probably will use a different set of tricks .
Bro017.E.dialogueact60	131.34	131.69	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro017.B.dialogueact61	132.031	136.951	B	Professor	s^rt	+1	1	But unfortunately nobody ever officially can somehow acknowledge that this can be done ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact62	137.111	141.551	B	Professor	s	+1	1	because French Telecom was saying " no , no , no , now everybody has access to our code ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact63	142.036	143.896	B	Professor	s	+1	1	so everybody is going to copy what we did . "
Bro017.B.dialogueact64	145.42	145.68	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Yeah
Bro017.B.dialogueact65	145.68	150.84	B	Professor	s	+1	1	well our argument was everybody ha has access to our code , and everybody always had access to our code .
Bro017.B.dialogueact66	150.84	153.702	B	Professor	s	+1	1	We never uh {disfmarker} uh denied that .
Bro017.B.dialogueact67	153.702	161.055	B	Professor	s	+1	1	We thought that people are honest , that if you copy something and if it is protected {disfmarker} protected by patent then you negotiate , or something ,
Bro017.E.dialogueact68	156.634	156.974	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact69	160.328	160.638	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro017.B.dialogueact70	161.055	161.345	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact71	161.345	164.025	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , if you find our technique useful , we are very happy .
Bro017.E.dialogueact72	161.49	161.79	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro017.B.dialogueact74	165.004	166.764	B	Professor	s:s	+1	1	But {disfmarker} And French Telecom was saying " no , no , no ,
Bro017.E.dialogueact73	164.53	165.06	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact75	166.764	174.585	B	Professor	s	+1	1	there is a lot of little tricks which uh sort of uh cannot be protected and you guys will take them , " which probably is also true .
Bro017.B.dialogueact76	174.585	182.016	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	I mean , you know , it might be that people will take uh uh th the algorithms apart and use the blocks from that .
Bro017.B.dialogueact77	182.056	187.046	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But I somehow think that it wouldn't be so bad , as long as people are happy abou uh uh uh honest about it .
Bro017.E.dialogueact78	186.07	186.37	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact79	187.046	194.677	B	Professor	s	+1	1	And I think they have to be honest in the long run , because winning proposal again {disfmarker} uh what will be available th is {disfmarker} will be a code .
Bro017.B.dialogueact81	195.097	199.167	B	Professor	s	+1	1	So the uh {disfmarker} the people can go to code and say " well listen this is what you stole from me "
Bro017.E.dialogueact80	194.93	195.54	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact83	200.047	200.487	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	you know ?
Bro017.E.dialogueact82	199.66	199.98	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro017.B.dialogueact85	200.882	201.832	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	" so let 's deal with that " .
Bro017.E.dialogueact84	200.702	201.042	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro017.B.dialogueact86	201.832	202.982	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So I don't see the problem .
Bro017.B.dialogueact87	202.982	209.826	B	Professor	s:s	+1	1	The biggest problem of course is that f that Alcatel French Telecom cl claims " well we fulfilled the conditions .
Bro017.B.dialogueact88	209.826	210.626	B	Professor	s^ba	+1	1	We are the best .
Bro017.B.dialogueact89	210.626	211.696	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh . We are the standard . "
Bro017.B.dialogueact90	213.24	215.05	B	Professor	s^rt	+1	1	And e and other people don't feel that ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact91	215.22	221.2	B	Professor	s	+1	1	because they {disfmarker} so they now decided that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} the whole thing will be done on well - endpointed data ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact92	222.41	225.76	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	essentially that somebody will endpoint the data based on clean speech ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact93	225.76	232.15	B	Professor	s	-1	0	because most of this the SpeechDat - Car has the also close speaking mike and endpoints will be provided .
Bro017.E.dialogueact94	225.856	226.466	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact95	232.387	232.797	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Ah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact96	233.148	235.038	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	And uh we will run again {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact97	235.038	240.126	B	Professor	s	+1	1	still not clear if we are going to run the {disfmarker} if we are allowed to run uh uh new algorithms ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact98	240.216	241.266	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but I assume so .
Bro017.B.dialogueact99	241.366	243.046	B	Professor	s	+1	1	Because uh we would fight for that , really .
Bro017.B.dialogueact100	243.785	246.725	B	Professor	fh|%--	-1	0	uh but {disfmarker} since uh u u n u {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact101	246.725	255.963	B	Professor	s	+1	2	at least our experience is that only endpointing a {disfmarker} a mel cepstrum gets uh {disfmarker} gets you twenty - one percent improvement overall and twenty - seven improvement on SpeechDat - Car
Bro017.E.dialogueact102	256.327	256.707	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact103	257.02	262.18	B	Professor	s	+1	1	then obvious the database {disfmarker} uh I mean the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} uh the baseline will go up .
Bro017.B.dialogueact105	262.58	265.17	B	Professor	s	+1	1	And nobody can then achieve fifty percent improvement .
Bro017.E.dialogueact104	262.196	262.546	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro017.B.dialogueact106	265.819	275.477	B	Professor	s.%-	+1	1	So they agreed that uh there will be a twenty - five percent improvement required on {disfmarker} on uh h u m bad mis badly mismatched {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact107	274.96	275.41	E	PhD	s^co	-1	0	But wait a minute ,
Bro017.E.dialogueact108	275.41	279.18	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I thought the endpointing really only helped in the noisy cases .
Bro017.B.dialogueact109	279.96	280.46	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	It uh {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact110	280.24	281.85	E	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	Oh , but you still have that with the MFCC .
Bro017.B.dialogueact112	282.09	282.61	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Y yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact111	281.85	282.23	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro017.B.dialogueact114	282.71	287.09	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah but you have the same prob I mean MFCC basically has an enormous number of uh insertions .
Bro017.E.dialogueact113	282.23	282.43	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact115	283.2	283.37	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro017.E.dialogueact116	284.125	284.485	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact117	286.47	286.92	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact118	287.05	287.36	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact119	287.798	297.588	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	And so , so now they want to say " we {disfmarker} we will require fifty percent improvement only for well matched condition , and only twenty - five percent for the serial cases . "
Bro017.E.dialogueact120	297.65	298.38	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact121	298.595	303.575	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	And uh {disfmarker} and they almost agreed on that except that it wasn't a hundred percent agreed .
Bro017.B.dialogueact122	303.575	307.554	B	Professor	s	+1	1	And so last time uh during the meeting , I just uh brought up the issue ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact123	307.554	312.724	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I said " well you know uh quite frankly I 'm surprised how lightly you are making these decisions
Bro017.B.dialogueact124	312.724	315.6	B	Professor	s	-1	0	because this is a major decision .
Bro017.B.dialogueact125	315.6	318.91	B	Professor	s	+1	1	For two years we are fighting for fifty percent improvement
Bro017.B.dialogueact126	319.394	322.404	B	Professor	s	+1	1	and suddenly you are saying " oh no we {disfmarker} we will do something less " ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact127	322.404	323.584	B	Professor	s^cs^t	-1	0	but maybe we should discuss that .
Bro017.B.dialogueact128	323.584	326.474	B	Professor	s	+1	1	And everybody said " oh we discussed that and you were not a mee there "
Bro017.B.dialogueact129	326.474	332.784	B	Professor	s:s	+1	1	and I said " well a lot of other people were not there because not everybody participates at these teleconferencing c things . "
Bro017.B.dialogueact130	332.954	336.194	B	Professor	s	+1	1	Then they said " oh no no no because uh everybody is invited . "
Bro017.B.dialogueact131	336.464	341.284	B	Professor	s	+1	1	However , there is only ten or fifteen lines , so people can't even con you know participate .
Bro017.B.dialogueact132	341.797	344.597	B	Professor	s	+1	1	So eh they agreed , and so they said " OK , we will discuss that . "
Bro017.B.dialogueact133	344.997	347.567	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Immediately Nokia uh raised the question
Bro017.B.dialogueact134	347.567	355.53	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and they said " oh yeah we agree this is not good to to uh dissolve the uh uh {disfmarker} the uh {disfmarker} the criterion . "
Bro017.E.dialogueact135	355.46	355.97	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact136	356.18	361.66	B	Professor	s^rt	+1	1	So now officially , Nokia is uh uh complaining and said they {disfmarker} they are looking for support ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact137	362.943	368.243	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	uh I think QualComm is uh saying , too " we shouldn't abandon the fifty percent yet .
Bro017.B.dialogueact138	368.553	371.213	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	We should at least try once again , one more round . "
Bro017.E.dialogueact139	370.27	370.78	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact141	371.865	372.785	B	Professor	s^t	-1	0	So this is where we are .
Bro017.E.dialogueact140	371.421	371.791	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact143	373.105	375.885	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I hope that {disfmarker} I hope that this is going to be a adopted .
Bro017.E.dialogueact142	373.05	373.64	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact144	376.045	382.81	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Next Wednesday we are going to have uh another uh teleconferencing call , so we 'll see what uh {disfmarker} where it goes .
Bro017.E.dialogueact145	383.104	387.234	E	PhD	qo^tc	-1	0	So what about the issue of um the weights on the {disfmarker} for the different systems ,

Bro017.B.dialogueact147	389.49	389.89	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact148	389.89	392.2	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	that 's what {disfmarker} that 's a g very good uh point ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact149	392.2	397.23	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because David says " well you know we ca we can manipulate this number by choosing the right weights anyways . "
Bro017.B.dialogueact151	397.83	400.19	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So while you are right but {disfmarker} uh you know but
Bro017.E.dialogueact150	397.337	397.867	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact152	401.041	401.431	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh yeah ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact153	401.431	408.911	B	Professor	s	-1	0	if of course if you put a zero {disfmarker} uh weight zero on a mismatched condition , or highly mismatched then {disfmarker} then you are done .
Bro017.E.dialogueact154	409.11	409.51	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact155	409.61	413.71	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But weights were also deter already decided uh half a year ago .
Bro017.B.dialogueact157	414.185	414.495	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact156	413.93	415.32	E	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	And they 're the {disfmarker} staying the same ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact158	415.47	417.63	B	Professor	h|s	-1	0	Well , of course people will not like it .
Bro017.B.dialogueact160	417.95	423.67	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Now {disfmarker} What is happening now is that I th I think that people try to match the criterion to solution .
Bro017.E.dialogueact159	417.745	418.245	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact161	424.0	424.83	B	Professor	s	-1	0	They have solution .
Bro017.B.dialogueact162	425.18	428.08	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Now they want to {vocalsound} make sure their criterion is {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact163	426.032	426.232	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro017.B.dialogueact164	428.11	429.91	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And I think that this is not the right way .
Bro017.E.dialogueact165	429.78	430.1	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact166	430.56	432.26	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Uh it may be that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact167	432.97	435.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Eventually it may ha may ha it may have to happen .
Bro017.B.dialogueact169	436.4	440.7	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But it 's should happen at a point where everybody feels comfortable that we did all what we could .
Bro017.E.dialogueact168	436.17	436.47	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact171	441.28	442.11	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And I don't think we did .
Bro017.E.dialogueact170	440.99	441.31	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact172	442.4	448.07	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Basically , I think that {disfmarker} that this test was a little bit bogus because of the data
Bro017.B.dialogueact173	448.849	455.398	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and uh essentially {pause} there were these arbitrary decisions made , and {disfmarker} and everything .
Bro017.B.dialogueact174	455.718	460.02	B	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	So , so {disfmarker} so this is {disfmarker} so this is where it is .
Bro017.B.dialogueact175	460.36	471.36	B	Professor	s^rt	+1	2	So what we are doing at OGI now is uh uh uh working basically on our parts which we I think a little bit neglected ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact176	472.14	473.11	B	Professor	s	+1	1	like noise separation .
Bro017.B.dialogueact177	474.12	484.6	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	Uh so we are looking in ways is {disfmarker} in uh which {disfmarker} uh with which we can provide better initial estimate of the mel spectrum basically ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact178	485.37	488.1	B	Professor	s	+1	1	which would be a l uh , f more robust to noise ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact179	488.1	490.17	B	Professor	s	+1	1	and so far not much uh success .
Bro017.E.dialogueact180	490.356	490.856	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact181	490.88	495.63	B	Professor	s	-1	0	We tried uh things which uh a long time ago Bill Byrne suggested ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact182	496.11	501.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	instead of using Fourier spectrum , from Fourier transform , use the spectrum from LPC model .
Bro017.B.dialogueact183	502.5	509.74	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Their argument there was the LPC model fits the peaks of the spectrum , so it may be m naturally more robust in noise .
Bro017.B.dialogueact184	510.24	514.45	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And I thought " well , that makes sense , " but so far we can't get much {disfmarker} much out of it .
Bro017.E.dialogueact185	513.43	513.77	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact186	515.52	521.03	B	Professor	fh|s.%-	-1	0	uh we may try some standard techniques like spectral subtraction and {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact187	520.839	521.849	E	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	You haven't tried that yet ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact188	521.85	523.12	B	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	not {disfmarker} not {disfmarker} not much .
Bro017.B.dialogueact190	523.64	528.78	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Or even I was thinking about uh looking back into these totally ad - hoc techniques
Bro017.E.dialogueact189	523.193	523.513	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact191	528.78	537.597	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	like for instance uh Dennis Klatt was suggesting uh the one way to uh deal with noisy speech is to add noise to everything .
Bro017.E.dialogueact192	538.355	539.185	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm !
Bro017.B.dialogueact193	539.043	543.486	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So . {comment} I mean , uh uh add moderate amount of noise to all data .
Bro017.E.dialogueact194	542.524	543.114	E	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	Oh !
Bro017.B.dialogueact196	544.457	549.427	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So that makes uh th any additive noise less addi less a a effective ,
Bro017.E.dialogueact195	544.271	544.691	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bro017.B.dialogueact197	549.427	549.747	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact199	549.967	552.927	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Because you already uh had the noise uh in a {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact198	549.56	549.9	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro017.B.dialogueact200	553.687	555.027	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And it was working at the time .
Bro017.B.dialogueact201	555.027	557.037	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	It was kind of like one of these things , you know , but
Bro017.B.dialogueact202	557.037	559.057	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	if you think about it , it 's actually pretty ingenious .
Bro017.B.dialogueact203	559.88	566.42	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So well , you know , just take a {disfmarker} take a spectrum and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and add of the constant , C , to every {disfmarker} every value .
Bro017.E.dialogueact204	560.58	561.98	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Well you 're {disfmarker} you 're basically y
Bro017.E.dialogueact205	566.89	567.13	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact206	567.56	569.57	E	PhD	s^bs	-1	0	So you 're making all your training data more uniform .
Bro017.B.dialogueact207	569.81	570.35	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly .
Bro017.B.dialogueact208	570.35	577.07	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And if {disfmarker} if then {disfmarker} if this data becomes noisy , it b it becomes eff effectively becomes less noisy basically .
Bro017.E.dialogueact209	577.47	577.92	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact210	578.21	584.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But of course you cannot add too much noise because then you 'll s then you 're clean recognition goes down ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact211	584.03	586.04	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but I mean it 's yet to be seen how much ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact212	586.04	587.15	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it 's a very simple technique .
Bro017.E.dialogueact213	587.37	587.96	E	PhD	s^no^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact214	588.25	589.65	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Yes indeed it 's a very simple technique ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact215	589.65	595.5	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	you just take your spectrum and {disfmarker} and use whatever is coming from FFT , {pause} add constant ,
Bro017.E.dialogueact216	596.292	596.792	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact217	596.83	597.21	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	you know ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact218	597.83	599.12	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	on {disfmarker} onto power spectrum .
Bro017.B.dialogueact219	599.832	600.372	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	That {disfmarker} that {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact220	601.71	611.618	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Or the other thing is of course if you have a spectrum , what you can s start doing , you can leave {disfmarker} start leaving out the p the parts which are uh uh low in energy
Bro017.B.dialogueact221	612.57	619.55	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and then perhaps uh one could try to find a {disfmarker} a all - pole model to such a spectrum .
Bro017.B.dialogueact222	619.69	630.85	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Because a all - pole model will still try to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to put the {disfmarker} the continuation basically of the {disfmarker} of the model into these parts where the issue set to zero .
Bro017.B.dialogueact223	630.9	632.16	B	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's what we want to try .
Bro017.B.dialogueact224	632.73	635.22	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I have a visitor from Brno .
Bro017.B.dialogueact225	635.7	637.46	B	Professor	s	-1	0	He 's a {disfmarker} kind of like young faculty .
Bro017.B.dialogueact226	638.228	641.858	B	Professor	s	-1	0	pretty hard - working so he {disfmarker} so he 's {disfmarker} so he 's looking into that .
Bro017.E.dialogueact227	641.94	642.31	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact228	643.025	650.635	B	Professor	s	+1	2	And then most of the effort is uh now also aimed at this e e TRAP recognition .
Bro017.B.dialogueact229	651.481	654.061	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	This uh {disfmarker} this is this recognition from temporal patterns .
Bro017.E.dialogueact230	654.653	655.153	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm !
Bro017.E.dialogueact231	655.253	655.773	E	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	What is that ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact232	655.96	657.72	B	Professor	s^fe|s	-1	0	Ah , you don't know about TRAPS !
Bro017.A.dialogueact233	656.962	657.492	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact234	657.865	659.975	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	The TRAPS sound familiar , I {disfmarker} but I don't {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact235	659.38	659.51	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah
Bro017.B.dialogueact236	659.51	660.2	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	I mean tha
Bro017.B.dialogueact237	660.2	662.97	B	Professor	s	-1	0	This is familiar like sort of because we gave you the name ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact238	662.97	670.94	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	but , what it is , is that normally what you do is that you recognize uh speech based on a shortened spectrum .
Bro017.E.dialogueact239	663.24	663.58	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact240	671.108	671.538	E	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact241	671.644	677.514	B	Professor	s	+1	1	Essentially L P - LPC , mel cepstrum , uh , everything starts with a spectral slice .
Bro017.B.dialogueact242	678.86	686.85	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	Uh so if you s So , given the spectrogram you essentially are sliding {disfmarker} sliding the spectrogram along the uh f frequency axis
Bro017.E.dialogueact243	685.126	685.616	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact244	686.85	689.484	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	and you keep shifting this thing , and you have a spectrogram .
Bro017.E.dialogueact245	687.902	688.582	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact246	689.484	694.324	B	Professor	s	+1	1	So you can say " well you can also take the time trajectory of the energy at a given frequency " ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact248	694.972	697.792	B	Professor	s	+1	1	and what you get is then , that you get a p {pause} vector .
Bro017.E.dialogueact247	694.505	695.015	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact249	699.44	704.08	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And this vector can be a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} s assigned to s some phoneme .
Bro017.B.dialogueact250	704.68	712.137	B	Professor	s	+1	1	Namely you can say i it {disfmarker} I will {disfmarker} I will say that this vector will eh {disfmarker} will {disfmarker} will describe the phoneme which is in the center of the vector .
Bro017.B.dialogueact251	713.83	715.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And you can try to classify based on that .
Bro017.E.dialogueact252	715.816	716.266	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact253	716.92	718.38	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	And you {disfmarker} so you classi
Bro017.B.dialogueact254	718.38	720.7	B	Professor	s^rt	+1	1	so it 's a very different vector , very different properties ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact255	720.7	721.75	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	we don't know much about it ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact257	723.01	723.79	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	but the truth is {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact256	722.65	722.89	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact258	723.69	726.06	E	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	But you have many of those vectors per phoneme ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact259	725.57	726.96	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , so you get many decisions .
Bro017.E.dialogueact260	726.06	726.38	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.E.dialogueact261	727.18	727.55	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro017.B.dialogueact262	727.79	731.81	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And then you can start dec thinking about how to combine these decisions .
Bro017.B.dialogueact264	731.81	733.93	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Exactly , that 's what {disfmarker} yeah , that 's what it is .
Bro017.E.dialogueact263	731.6	732.04	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact265	733.984	734.474	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact266	734.55	738.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Because if you run this uh recognition , you get {disfmarker} you still get about twenty percent error {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact267	739.01	740.06	B	Professor	s^bsc	-1	0	uh twenty percent correct .
Bro017.B.dialogueact269	740.76	741.2	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	You know ,
Bro017.E.dialogueact268	740.43	740.78	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact270	741.66	743.83	B	Professor	s	-1	0	on {disfmarker} on like for the frame by frame basis ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact271	744.05	747.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so {pause} uh {disfmarker} uh so it 's much better than chance .
Bro017.E.dialogueact272	748.35	750.72	E	PhD	qw	-1	0	How wide are the uh frequency bands ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact273	750.54	751.37	B	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's another thing .
Bro017.B.dialogueact274	751.37	754.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well c currently we start {disfmarker} I mean we start always with critical band spectrum .
Bro017.B.dialogueact275	755.54	756.73	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	For various reasons .
Bro017.B.dialogueact276	757.08	767.02	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	But uh the latest uh observation uh is that you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you are {disfmarker} you can get quite a big advantage of using two critical bands at the same time .
Bro017.A.dialogueact277	767.84	769.49	A	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Are they adjacent ,
Bro017.A.dialogueact278	769.49	770.04	A	Grad	qrr.%-	-1	0	or are they s
Bro017.B.dialogueact279	769.79	771.27	B	Professor	s^aa^m	-1	0	Adjacent , adjacent .
Bro017.A.dialogueact280	770.31	770.62	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro017.B.dialogueact281	771.93	773.76	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And the reasons {disfmarker} there are some reasons for that .
Bro017.B.dialogueact282	773.76	782.92	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	Because there are some reasons I can {disfmarker} I could talk about , will have to tell you about things like masking experiments which uh uh uh uh yield critical bands ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact283	783.29	791.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and also experiments with release of masking , which actually tell you that something is happening across critical bands , across bands .
Bro017.B.dialogueact284	792.02	792.7	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact285	792.88	801.32	E	PhD	qw	-1	0	Well how do you {disfmarker} how do you uh convert this uh energy over time in a particular frequency band into a vector of numbers ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact286	801.6	806.87	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	It 's uh uh uh I mean time T - zero is one number , {pause} time t
Bro017.E.dialogueact287	806.0	807.16	E	PhD	qw	-1	0	Yeah but what 's the number ?
Bro017.E.dialogueact288	807.53	808.32	E	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	Is it just the {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact289	808.03	810.64	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's a spectral energy , logarithmic spectral energy ,
Bro017.E.dialogueact290	809.362	813.932	E	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	it 's just the amount of energy in that band from f in that time interval .
Bro017.B.dialogueact291	810.96	811.16	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact292	811.912	812.722	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yes , yes .
Bro017.B.dialogueact293	813.88	814.68	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yes , yes .
Bro017.E.dialogueact294	814.51	814.88	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro017.B.dialogueact295	815.2	817.0	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	And that 's what {disfmarker} that 's what I 'm saying then ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact296	817.0	819.12	B	Professor	s.x	-1	0	so this is a {disfmarker} this is a starting vector .
Bro017.B.dialogueact297	819.77	823.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's just like shortened f {pause} spectrum , or something .
Bro017.B.dialogueact299	823.65	826.9	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	But now we are trying to understand what this vector actually represents ,
Bro017.E.dialogueact298	823.241	823.711	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact300	827.07	831.51	B	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	for instance a question is like " how correlated are the elements of this vector ? "
Bro017.B.dialogueact301	832.21	836.12	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Turns out they are quite correlated , because I mean , especially the neighboring ones ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact303	836.12	836.31	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact304	836.31	840.12	B	Professor	s	-1	0	They {disfmarker} they represent the same {disfmarker} almost the same configuration of the vocal tract .
Bro017.E.dialogueact302	836.09	836.39	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact305	836.39	836.86	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact306	840.197	840.607	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact307	840.71	842.11	B	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	So there 's a very high correlation .
Bro017.B.dialogueact308	843.01	847.72	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So the classifiers which use the diagonal covariance matrix don't like it .
Bro017.B.dialogueact309	848.04	850.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So we 're thinking about de - correlating them .
Bro017.E.dialogueact310	848.26	849.02	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact311	851.65	857.82	B	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	Then the question is uh " can you describe elements of this vector by Gaussian distributions " , or to what extent ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact312	858.58	859.13	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	Because uh {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact313	861.507	863.447	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and so on and so on .
Bro017.B.dialogueact314	863.447	865.517	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So we are learning quite a lot about that .
Bro017.B.dialogueact316	865.967	868.987	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And then another issue is how many vectors we should be using ,
Bro017.E.dialogueact315	865.935	866.255	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact317	868.987	870.577	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean the {disfmarker} so the minimum is one .
Bro017.E.dialogueact318	869.12	869.49	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact319	872.66	876.1	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	But I mean is the {disfmarker} is the critical band the right uh uh dimension ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact320	876.726	879.126	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So we somehow made arbitrary decision , " yes " .
Bro017.B.dialogueact321	880.72	888.88	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Then {disfmarker} but then now we are thinking a lot how to {disfmarker} uh how to use at least the neighboring band because that seems to be happening {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact322	888.88	893.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	This I somehow start to believe that 's what 's happening in recognition .
Bro017.B.dialogueact323	893.778	899.688	B	Professor	s^df^rt	-1	0	Cuz a lot of experiments point to the fact that people can split the signal into critical bands ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact324	900.65	902.587	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	but then oh uh uh
Bro017.B.dialogueact325	902.587	910.28	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so you can {disfmarker} you are quite capable of processing a signal in uh uh independently in individual critical bands .
Bro017.B.dialogueact326	910.28	912.01	B	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's what masking experiments tell you .
Bro017.B.dialogueact327	912.34	917.087	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	But at the same time you most likely pay attention to at least neighboring bands
Bro017.B.dialogueact328	917.087	926.114	B	Professor	s	-1	0	when you are making any decisions , you compare what 's happening in {disfmarker} in this band to what 's happening to the band {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to the {disfmarker} to the neighboring bands .
Bro017.B.dialogueact329	926.8	928.36	B	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	And that 's how you make uh decisions .
Bro017.B.dialogueact330	929.29	935.35	B	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's why the articulatory events , which uh F F Fletcher talks about , they are about two critical bands .
Bro017.B.dialogueact331	935.66	936.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	You need at least two , basically .
Bro017.B.dialogueact332	936.94	940.34	B	Professor	s	-1	0	You need some relative , relative relation .
Bro017.A.dialogueact333	940.713	941.583	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact335	941.61	943.41	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Absolute number doesn't tell you the right thing .
Bro017.E.dialogueact334	941.162	941.522	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact336	943.41	946.46	B	Professor	s	-1	0	You need to {disfmarker} you need to compare it to something else , what 's happening
Bro017.B.dialogueact337	947.261	949.601	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but it 's what 's happening in the {disfmarker} in the close neighborhood .
Bro017.B.dialogueact338	949.601	957.38	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So if you are making decision what 's happening at one kilohertz , you want to know what 's happening at nine hundred hertz and it {disfmarker} and maybe at eleven hundred hertz ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact339	957.38	960.72	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but you don't much care what 's happening at three kilohertz .
Bro017.E.dialogueact340	960.786	961.696	E	PhD	s^bu.%--	-1	0	So it 's really w
Bro017.E.dialogueact341	961.696	967.276	E	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	It 's sort of like saying that what 's happening at one kilohertz depends on what 's happening around it .
Bro017.E.dialogueact342	967.276	968.416	E	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's sort of relative to it .
Bro017.B.dialogueact343	968.24	970.25	B	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	To some extent , it {disfmarker} that is also true .
Bro017.B.dialogueact345	970.74	970.98	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact346	970.98	986.95	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But it 's {disfmarker} but for {disfmarker} but for instance , {vocalsound} th uh {vocalsound} uh what {disfmarker} what uh humans are very much capable of doing is that if th if they are exactly the same thing happening in two neighboring critical bands , recognition can discard it .
Bro017.E.dialogueact344	970.541	971.491	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact348	987.88	988.63	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	Is what 's happening {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact347	987.822	988.242	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.A.dialogueact350	989.131	989.451	A	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	Hey !
Bro017.B.dialogueact349	988.71	989.7	B	Professor	s^fe	-1	0	Hey !
Bro017.B.dialogueact351	989.84	992.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	OK , we need us another {disfmarker} another voice here .
Bro017.E.dialogueact352	990.24	990.9	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Hey Stephane .
Bro017.B.dialogueact353	993.19	993.45	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact354	993.72	994.3	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I think so .
Bro017.B.dialogueact356	994.3	994.54	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bro017.E.dialogueact355	994.08	994.25	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bro017.E.dialogueact357	994.48	994.64	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Sure .
Bro017.E.dialogueact358	994.64	994.95	E	PhD	s^co	-1	0	Go ahead .
Bro017.B.dialogueact359	995.5	1007.87	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	And so so {disfmarker} so for instance if you d if you a if you add the noise that normally masks {disfmarker} masks the uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the signal
Bro017.B.dialogueact361	1008.39	1008.72	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.E.dialogueact360	1008.17	1008.37	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact362	1008.87	1018.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and you can show that in {disfmarker} that if the {disfmarker} if you add the noise outside the critical band , that doesn't affect the {disfmarker} the decisions you 're making about a signal within a critical band .
Bro017.E.dialogueact363	1018.58	1019.06	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact364	1019.22	1021.0	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	Unless this noise is modulated .
Bro017.B.dialogueact365	1021.38	1029.14	B	Professor	s	-1	0	If the noise is modulated , with the same modulation frequency as the noise in a critical band , the amount of masking is less .
Bro017.B.dialogueact367	1029.86	1034.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	The moment you {disfmarker} moment you provide the noise in n neighboring critical bands .
Bro017.E.dialogueact366	1029.52	1030.04	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact368	1034.89	1038.16	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So the s m masking curve , normally it looks like sort of {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact369	1038.16	1039.46	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I start from {disfmarker} from here ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact370	1039.46	1046.71	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so you {disfmarker} {comment} you have uh no noise then you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you are expanding the critical band , so the amount of maching is increasing .
Bro017.B.dialogueact371	1047.16	1052.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And when you e hit a certain point , which is a critical band , then the amount of masking is the same .
Bro017.E.dialogueact372	1052.97	1053.38	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact373	1053.8	1056.93	B	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	So that 's the famous experiment of Fletcher , a long time ago .
Bro017.B.dialogueact374	1057.41	1060.02	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Like that 's where people started thinking " wow this is interesting ! "
Bro017.B.dialogueact376	1060.62	1060.9	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro017.E.dialogueact375	1060.15	1060.44	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact377	1061.17	1068.78	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But , if you {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} if you modulate the noise , the masking goes up and the moment you start hitting the {disfmarker} another critical band , the masking goes down .
Bro017.B.dialogueact378	1071.39	1082.85	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So essentially {disfmarker} essentially that 's a very clear indication that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that {pause} cognition can take uh uh into consideration what 's happening in the neighboring bands .
Bro017.B.dialogueact379	1083.24	1089.57	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But if you go too far in a {disfmarker} in a {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} if the noise is very broad , you are not increasing much more ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact380	1089.57	1101.66	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so {disfmarker} so if you {disfmarker} if you are far away from the signal {disfmarker} uh from the signal f uh the frequency at which the signal is , then the m even the {disfmarker} when the noise is co - modulated it {disfmarker} it 's not helping you much .
Bro017.E.dialogueact381	1089.82	1090.35	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact382	1096.88	1097.1	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact383	1101.62	1102.19	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.A.dialogueact385	1102.6	1103.23	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact384	1102.28	1102.6	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro017.B.dialogueact386	1103.95	1115.14	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So things like this we are kind of playing with {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} with the hope that perhaps we could eventually u use this in a {disfmarker} in a real recognizer .
Bro017.A.dialogueact387	1115.25	1116.14	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact388	1115.72	1122.72	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Like uh partially of course we promised to do this under the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the Aurora uh program .
Bro017.E.dialogueact389	1122.1	1126.17	E	PhD	s	-1	0	But you probably won't have anything before the next time we have to evaluate ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact391	1126.35	1127.03	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Probably not .
Bro017.E.dialogueact390	1126.17	1126.45	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact393	1127.03	1131.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , maybe , most likely we will not have anything which c would comply with the rules .
Bro017.E.dialogueact392	1126.76	1127.02	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact394	1131.62	1132.12	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Ah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact395	1132.18	1134.11	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	like because uh uh
Bro017.E.dialogueact396	1134.26	1135.2	E	PhD	s^2	-1	0	Latency and things .
Bro017.B.dialogueact397	1134.95	1141.6	B	Professor	s	-1	0	latency currently chops the require uh significant uh latency amount of processing ,
Bro017.E.dialogueact398	1138.57	1139.11	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact399	1141.6	1148.21	B	Professor	s	-1	0	because uh we don't know any better , yet , than to use the neural net classifiers , uh and uh {disfmarker} and uh TRAPS .
Bro017.E.dialogueact400	1143.82	1144.25	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.A.dialogueact401	1148.79	1149.52	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact402	1148.92	1161.42	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Though the {disfmarker} the work which uh everybody is looking at now aims at s trying to find out what to do with these vectors , so that a g simple Gaussian classifier would be happier with it .
Bro017.C.dialogueact403	1150.33	1151.38	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact404	1161.66	1162.23	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact405	1162.36	1165.73	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	or to what extent a Gaussian classifier should be unhappy uh
Bro017.B.dialogueact406	1165.73	1168.53	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that , and how to Gaussian - ize the vectors ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact407	1168.53	1168.74	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact408	1168.98	1169.44	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact409	1170.89	1172.2	B	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	So this is uh what 's happening .
Bro017.B.dialogueact410	1172.2	1177.11	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Then Sunil is uh uh uh asked me f for one month 's vacation
Bro017.B.dialogueact411	1177.92	1182.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and since he did not take any vacation for two years , I had no {disfmarker} I didn't have heart to tell him no .
Bro017.B.dialogueact412	1183.71	1184.79	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So he 's in India .
Bro017.E.dialogueact413	1185.7	1186.14	E	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	Wow .
Bro017.B.dialogueact414	1186.2	1186.6	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	And uh {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact415	1186.71	1187.78	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Is he getting married or something ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact416	1187.92	1192.94	B	Professor	s^j^ng	-1	0	Uh well , he may be looking for a girl , for {disfmarker} for I don't {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I don't ask .
Bro017.B.dialogueact417	1194.0	1198.06	B	Professor	s^j^rt	-1	0	I know that Naran - when last time Narayanan did that he came back engaged .
Bro017.E.dialogueact418	1198.32	1198.69	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro017.E.dialogueact419	1198.69	1204.23	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , I mean , I 've known other friends who {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they go to Ind - they go back home to India for a month , they come back married ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact420	1200.18	1200.42	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact421	1200.86	1201.52	B	Professor	b	-1	0	I know .
Bro017.B.dialogueact422	1204.38	1205.62	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	I know , I know ,
Bro017.E.dialogueact423	1204.85	1205.36	E	PhD	qy^d^g	-1	0	you know , huh .
Bro017.B.dialogueact424	1205.62	1211.61	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then of course then what happened with Narayanan was that he start pushing me that he needs to get a PHD because they wouldn't give him his wife .
Bro017.B.dialogueact425	1212.43	1213.96	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And she 's very pretty and he loves her
Bro017.B.dialogueact426	1215.25	1217.27	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	and so {disfmarker} so we had to really {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact427	1217.23	1218.99	E	PhD	s^j	-1	0	So he finally had some incentive to finish ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact428	1218.69	1219.16	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Oh yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact430	1219.16	1223.66	B	Professor	s	-1	0	We had {disfmarker} well I had a incentive because he {disfmarker} he always had this plan except he never told me .
Bro017.E.dialogueact429	1218.99	1219.12	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	huh ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact432	1224.01	1234.78	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Sort of figured that {disfmarker} That was a uh that he uh he told me the day when we did very well at our NIST evaluations of speaker recognition , the technology , and he was involved there .
Bro017.E.dialogueact431	1223.88	1224.29	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bro017.B.dialogueact433	1235.23	1238.49	B	Professor	s	-1	0	We were {disfmarker} after presentation we were driving home and he told me .
Bro017.E.dialogueact434	1239.9	1240.99	E	PhD	s^j	-1	0	When he knew you were happy ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact436	1241.04	1241.33	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact437	1241.33	1247.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So I {disfmarker} I said " well , yeah , OK " so he took another {disfmarker} another three quarter of the year but uh he was out .
Bro017.E.dialogueact435	1240.99	1241.12	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	huh ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact438	1247.43	1254.87	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So I {disfmarker} wouldn't surprise me if he has a plan like that , though {disfmarker} though uh Pratibha still needs to get out first .
Bro017.E.dialogueact439	1255.3	1255.74	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact440	1255.91	1257.93	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Cuz Pratibha is there a {disfmarker} a year earlier .

Bro017.B.dialogueact442	1259.04	1264.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And S and Satya needs to get out very first because he 's {disfmarker} he already has uh four years served ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact443	1265.01	1266.7	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	though one year he was getting masters .

Bro017.E.dialogueact457	1282.32	1283.25	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bro017.E.dialogueact458	1284.77	1288.29	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Are people supposed to rerun their systems ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact459	1287.85	1289.24	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	Nobody said that yet .
Bro017.E.dialogueact460	1288.29	1288.41	E	PhD	qrr.%-	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact461	1289.24	1290.27	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	I assume so .
Bro017.B.dialogueact463	1290.94	1296.66	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh yes , uh , but nobody even set up yet the {pause} date for uh delivering uh endpointed data .
Bro017.E.dialogueact462	1290.59	1291.04	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact464	1296.92	1297.1	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Wow .

Bro017.B.dialogueact466	1299.4	1300.33	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	But I uh ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact467	1300.33	1300.64	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact468	1300.96	1309.72	B	Professor	s^cs:s	-1	0	what I think would be of course extremely useful , if we can come to our next meeting and say " well you know we did get fifty percent improvement .
Bro017.B.dialogueact469	1311.18	1316.95	B	Professor	s	-1	0	If {disfmarker} if you are interested we eventually can tell you how " , but uh we can get fifty percent improvement .
Bro017.E.dialogueact470	1313.9	1314.45	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact471	1316.95	1319.15	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Because people will s will be saying it 's impossible .
Bro017.E.dialogueact472	1320.88	1321.29	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact473	1321.85	1323.13	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Do you know what the new baseline is ?
Bro017.E.dialogueact474	1323.51	1324.5	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Oh , I guess if you don't have {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact475	1324.14	1327.78	B	Professor	s^na^rt	-1	0	Twenty - two {disfmarker} t twenty {disfmarker} twenty - two percent better than the old baseline .
Bro017.E.dialogueact476	1328.36	1331.07	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Using your uh voice activity detector ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact477	1330.44	1331.11	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	u Yes .
Bro017.B.dialogueact478	1331.4	1331.64	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bro017.B.dialogueact479	1331.64	1335.72	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But I assume that it will be similar , I don't {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't see the reason why it shouldn't be .
Bro017.E.dialogueact480	1333.37	1334.03	E	PhD	s^aa^m	-1	0	Similar , yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact482	1335.83	1337.49	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I d I don't see reason why it should be worse .
Bro017.E.dialogueact481	1335.7	1336.45	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact484	1338.12	1340.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Cuz if it is worse , then we will raise the objection ,
Bro017.E.dialogueact483	1338.05	1338.34	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact485	1340.51	1341.66	B	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	we say " well you know how come ? "
Bro017.B.dialogueact486	1342.23	1348.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Because eh if we just use our voice activity detector , which we don't claim even that it 's wonderful , it 's just like one of them .
Bro017.C.dialogueact487	1347.61	1348.27	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact488	1349.18	1349.48	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact489	1349.8	1351.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	We get this sort of improvement ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact490	1351.25	1355.94	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	how come that we don't see it on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on your endpointed data ?
Bro017.C.dialogueact491	1354.03	1354.24	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.C.dialogueact492	1355.86	1357.15	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I guess it could be even better ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact494	1357.51	1358.18	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	I think so .
Bro017.C.dialogueact493	1357.15	1365.56	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because the voice activity detector that I choosed is something that cheating , it 's using the alignment of the speech recognition system ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact495	1362.15	1362.42	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact496	1365.51	1366.41	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	C yeah uh
Bro017.C.dialogueact497	1365.82	1371.08	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and only the alignment on the clean channel , and then mapped this alignment to the noisy channel .
Bro017.B.dialogueact498	1366.53	1367.83	B	Professor	s^2	-1	0	and on clean speech data .
Bro017.B.dialogueact500	1368.47	1368.59	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact499	1368.1	1368.73	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bro017.B.dialogueact501	1369.12	1370.8	B	Professor	fg|s.%-	-1	0	Well David told me {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact502	1370.93	1374.5	B	Professor	s	-1	0	David told me yesterday or Harry actually he told Harry from QualComm
Bro017.B.dialogueact503	1374.5	1378.47	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and Harry uh brought up the suggestion we should still go for fifty percent
Bro017.B.dialogueact504	1379.08	1387.3	B	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	he says are you aware that your system does only thirty percent uh comparing to {disfmarker} to endpointed baselines ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact506	1387.3	1388.82	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So they must have run already something .
Bro017.C.dialogueact505	1387.01	1387.26	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact507	1388.74	1389.32	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact508	1389.8	1390.24	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro017.B.dialogueact509	1391.3	1392.37	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And Harry said " Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact510	1392.37	1398.34	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But I mean we think that we {disfmarker} we didn't say the last word yet , that we have other {disfmarker} other things which we can try . "
Bro017.E.dialogueact511	1399.66	1400.13	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact512	1402.35	1406.79	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	So . So there 's a lot of discussion now about this uh new criterion .
Bro017.B.dialogueact514	1407.32	1412.96	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Because Nokia was objecting , with uh QualComm 's {disfmarker} we basically supported that , we said " yes " .
Bro017.C.dialogueact513	1406.98	1407.56	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.C.dialogueact515	1412.43	1412.92	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact516	1413.57	1416.97	B	Professor	s.x	-1	0	Now everybody else is saying " well you guys might {disfmarker} must be out of your mind . "
Bro017.B.dialogueact517	1417.56	1422.76	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh The {disfmarker} Guenter Hirsch who d doesn't speak for Ericsson anymore because he is not with Ericsson
Bro017.B.dialogueact518	1422.76	1427.98	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and Ericsson may not {disfmarker} may withdraw from the whole Aurora activity because they have so many troubles now .
Bro017.E.dialogueact519	1428.38	1428.67	E	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	Wow .
Bro017.B.dialogueact520	1429.0	1430.76	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Ericsson 's laying off twenty percent of people .
Bro017.A.dialogueact521	1431.09	1431.51	A	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	Wow .
Bro017.E.dialogueact522	1431.42	1432.8	E	PhD	qw	-1	0	Where 's uh Guenter going ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact523	1432.99	1437.82	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well Guenter is already {disfmarker} he got the job uh already was working on it for past two years or three years {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact524	1437.35	1437.91	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact525	1438.65	1445.15	B	Professor	s	-1	0	he got a job uh at some {disfmarker} some Fachschule , the technical college not too far from Aachen .
Bro017.E.dialogueact526	1445.19	1445.96	E	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	Hmm !
Bro017.B.dialogueact527	1445.86	1448.21	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So it 's like professor {disfmarker} u university professor
Bro017.E.dialogueact528	1448.33	1448.94	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact529	1448.91	1456.77	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	you know , not quite a university , not quite a sort of {disfmarker} it 's not Aachen University , but it 's a good school and he {disfmarker} he 's happy .
Bro017.E.dialogueact530	1454.33	1454.96	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact531	1457.15	1457.55	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm !
Bro017.B.dialogueact532	1457.7	1465.11	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And he {disfmarker} well , he was hoping to work uh with Ericsson like on t uh like consulting basis ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact534	1465.11	1470.18	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but right now he says {disfmarker} says it doesn't look like that anybody is even thinking about speech recognition .
Bro017.E.dialogueact533	1465.06	1465.48	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact536	1470.71	1471.77	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	They think about survival .
Bro017.E.dialogueact535	1470.5	1470.85	E	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	Wow !
Bro017.B.dialogueact537	1472.96	1473.16	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact538	1473.92	1474.59	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact539	1474.69	1475.41	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro017.B.dialogueact540	1477.63	1479.78	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So . But this is being now discussed right now ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact541	1479.78	1486.64	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and it 's possible that uh {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that it may get through , that we will still stick to fifty percent .
Bro017.C.dialogueact542	1486.65	1487.26	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact543	1487.24	1490.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But that means that nobody will probably get this im this improvement .
Bro017.B.dialogueact544	1491.36	1492.82	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yet , wi with the current system .
Bro017.B.dialogueact545	1493.25	1496.36	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Which event es essentially I think that we should be happy with
Bro017.B.dialogueact546	1496.36	1502.12	B	Professor	s	-1	0	because that {disfmarker} that would mean that at least people may be forced to look into alternative solutions
Bro017.C.dialogueact547	1497.42	1498.07	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact549	1502.12	1502.35	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bro017.C.dialogueact548	1501.79	1502.62	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.C.dialogueact550	1504.17	1510.39	C	PhD	s	-1	0	But maybe {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean we are not too far from {disfmarker} from fifty percent , from the new baseline .
Bro017.B.dialogueact551	1510.73	1511.49	B	Professor	s^ar.%-	-1	0	Uh , but not {disfmarker}
Bro017.C.dialogueact552	1511.26	1515.82	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Which would mean like sixty percent over the current baseline , which is {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact553	1513.54	1513.95	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact554	1514.76	1515.66	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yes . Yes .
Bro017.B.dialogueact555	1516.61	1518.13	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	We {disfmarker} we getting {disfmarker} we getting there , right .
Bro017.C.dialogueact556	1516.75	1516.93	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	Well .
Bro017.C.dialogueact557	1518.42	1519.93	C	PhD	s	-1	0	We are around fifty , fifty - five .

Bro017.B.dialogueact562	1523.55	1524.76	B	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	Is it like sort of {disfmarker} is {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact563	1524.76	1526.34	B	Professor	qw^rt	-1	0	How did you come up with this number ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact564	1526.34	1533.82	B	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	If you improve twenty {disfmarker} by twenty percent the c the f the all baselines , it 's just a quick c comp co computation ?
Bro017.C.dialogueact565	1532.49	1533.23	C	PhD	h	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.C.dialogueact566	1533.39	1534.87	C	PhD	s^no.%-	-1	0	I don't know exactly if it 's {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact567	1534.88	1535.18	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro017.B.dialogueact568	1537.2	1538.27	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I think it 's about right .
Bro017.C.dialogueact569	1537.32	1539.16	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Yeah , because it de it depends on the weightings

Bro017.C.dialogueact593	1586.9	1587.26	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact594	1588.39	1590.32	E	PhD	qw^rt	+1	2	So have you been running some new experiments ?
Bro017.E.dialogueact595	1590.32	1592.99	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I thought I saw some jobs of yours running on some of the machine {disfmarker}
Bro017.C.dialogueact596	1592.77	1593.11	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.C.dialogueact597	1593.11	1593.6	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro017.C.dialogueact598	1593.6	1603.81	C	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	We 've fff {comment} done some strange things like removing C - zero or C - one from the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} the vector of parameters ,
Bro017.C.dialogueact599	1604.07	1608.33	C	PhD	s	+1	1	and we noticed that C - one is almost not useful at all .
Bro017.C.dialogueact600	1608.73	1611.9	C	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	You can remove it from the vector , it doesn't hurt .
Bro017.E.dialogueact601	1608.83	1609.22	E	PhD	qh	-1	0	Really ? !
Bro017.E.dialogueact602	1610.51	1611.37	E	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	That has no effect ?
Bro017.C.dialogueact603	1613.14	1613.9	C	PhD	h	-1	0	Um .
Bro017.E.dialogueact604	1613.63	1614.78	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Eh {disfmarker} Is this in the baseline ?
Bro017.E.dialogueact605	1614.78	1615.45	E	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	or in uh {disfmarker}
Bro017.C.dialogueact606	1615.82	1616.77	C	PhD	s^m.%--	-1	0	In the {disfmarker}
Bro017.C.dialogueact607	1616.77	1617.04	C	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No ,
Bro017.C.dialogueact608	1617.18	1619.01	C	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	in the proposal .

Bro017.E.dialogueact610	1619.01	1619.79	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	uh - huh , uh - huh .
Bro017.B.dialogueact611	1620.32	1622.86	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	So we were just discussing , since you mentioned that , in {disfmarker} it w
Bro017.C.dialogueact612	1621.52	1621.84	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact613	1622.86	1634.88	B	Professor	s^rt	+1	1	driving in the car with Morgan this morning , we were discussing a good experiment for b for beginning graduate student who wants to run a lot of {disfmarker} who wants to get a lot of numbers on something
Bro017.C.dialogueact614	1625.46	1625.85	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact615	1636.05	1646.2	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	which is , like , " imagine that you will {disfmarker} you will start putting every co any coefficient , which you are using in your vector , in some general power .
Bro017.E.dialogueact616	1647.09	1647.58	E	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	In some what ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact617	1647.77	1648.87	B	Professor	s	-1	0	General pow power .
Bro017.B.dialogueact618	1648.98	1654.15	B	Professor	s	+1	1	Like sort of you take a s power of two , or take a square root , or something .
Bro017.E.dialogueact619	1651.7	1652.03	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.C.dialogueact620	1652.93	1653.37	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact622	1654.76	1658.08	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	So suppose that you are working with a s C - zer C - one .
Bro017.E.dialogueact621	1654.29	1654.7	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact623	1659.1	1665.49	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	So if you put it in a s square root , that effectively makes your model half as efficient .
Bro017.B.dialogueact624	1667.25	1669.66	B	Professor	s^df	+1	1	Because uh your uh Gaussian mixture model ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact625	1670.08	1670.62	B	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact626	1670.62	1671.37	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	computes the mean .
Bro017.E.dialogueact627	1671.54	1672.08	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact628	1672.39	1675.07	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and uh i i i
Bro017.B.dialogueact629	1675.07	1682.01	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but it 's {disfmarker} the mean is an exponent of the whatever , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} this Gaussian function .
Bro017.E.dialogueact630	1681.03	1682.33	E	PhD	s	-1	0	You 're compressing the range ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact633	1682.79	1686.27	B	Professor	s^na	+1	1	So you 're compressing the range of this coefficient , so it 's becoming less efficient .
Bro017.E.dialogueact631	1682.33	1682.57	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.E.dialogueact632	1682.57	1682.93	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	of that {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact634	1687.04	1687.3	B	Professor	qy^d^f^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bro017.E.dialogueact635	1687.28	1687.81	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact636	1687.99	1688.43	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro017.B.dialogueact637	1688.77	1689.18	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro017.B.dialogueact638	1689.42	1695.77	B	Professor	s	+1	1	Morgan was @ @ and he was {disfmarker} he was saying well this might be the alternative way how to play with a {disfmarker} with a fudge factor ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact639	1695.77	1696.06	B	Professor	qy^d^f	+1	1	you know ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact640	1696.69	1697.54	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	uh in the {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact641	1697.3	1698.05	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bro017.B.dialogueact642	1698.06	1699.82	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you know , just compress the whole vector .
Bro017.E.dialogueact643	1700.04	1700.42	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact644	1700.57	1705.02	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	And I said " well in that case why don't we just start compressing individual elements , like when {disfmarker} when {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact645	1705.56	1713.77	B	Professor	s	-1	0	because in old days we were doing {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when people still were doing template matching and Euclidean distances , we were doing this liftering of parameters ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact646	1713.77	1714.01	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.E.dialogueact647	1714.08	1714.39	E	PhD	s^aa^rt	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro017.B.dialogueact648	1714.63	1718.94	B	Professor	s	+1	1	because we observed that uh higher parameters were more important than lower for recognition .
Bro017.B.dialogueact649	1719.16	1724.16	B	Professor	s	+1	1	And basically the {disfmarker} the C - ze C - one contributes mainly slope ,
Bro017.E.dialogueact650	1719.17	1719.35	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro017.B.dialogueact651	1724.15	1730.99	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and it 's highly affected by uh frequency response of the {disfmarker} of the recording equipment and that sort of thing ,
Bro017.C.dialogueact652	1725.73	1726.15	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact653	1730.09	1730.43	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact654	1730.99	1731.33	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact655	1731.84	1733.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so we were coming with all these f various lifters .
Bro017.E.dialogueact656	1734.28	1734.67	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact657	1734.96	1744.86	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh Bell Labs had he {disfmarker} this uh uh r raised cosine lifter which still I think is built into H {disfmarker} HTK for reasons n unknown to anybody ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact658	1744.86	1751.57	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but uh we had exponential lifter , or triangle lifter , basic number of lifters .
Bro017.E.dialogueact659	1751.97	1752.35	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact660	1752.8	1757.61	B	Professor	fh|s.%-	-1	0	And . But so they may be a way to {disfmarker} to fiddle with the f with the f
Bro017.E.dialogueact661	1757.31	1757.88	E	PhD	qy^2^d^rt	-1	0	Insertions .
Bro017.B.dialogueact662	1758.26	1766.02	B	Professor	s^aap^m	-1	0	Insertions , deletions , or the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} giving a relative {disfmarker} uh basically modifying relative importance of the various parameters .
Bro017.C.dialogueact663	1766.29	1766.79	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact664	1767.35	1770.66	B	Professor	s	-1	0	The only of course problem is that there 's an infinite number of combinations
Bro017.B.dialogueact667	1770.66	1772.33	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	and if the {disfmarker} if you s if y
Bro017.E.dialogueact665	1770.54	1770.57	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Oh .
Bro017.E.dialogueact666	1770.57	1771.23	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro017.E.dialogueact668	1772.83	1774.19	E	PhD	s^cs.%-	-1	0	You need like a {disfmarker} some kind of a {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact669	1774.03	1777.65	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Yeah , you need a lot of graduate students , and a lot of computing power .
Bro017.E.dialogueact670	1777.3	1783.55	E	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	You need to have a genetic algorithm , that basically tries random permutations of these things .
Bro017.B.dialogueact671	1779.58	1780.19	B	Professor	b	-1	0	I know .
Bro017.B.dialogueact672	1780.54	1781.55	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly .
Bro017.B.dialogueact673	1781.74	1782.22	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Oh .
Bro017.B.dialogueact674	1783.23	1785.38	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	If you were at Bell Labs or {disfmarker} I d d
Bro017.B.dialogueact675	1785.38	1787.15	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I shouldn't be saying this in {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on a mike ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact676	1787.15	1787.36	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact677	1787.89	1789.32	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Or I {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} IBM ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact678	1790.33	1792.33	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that 's what {disfmarker} maybe that 's what somebody would be doing .
Bro017.E.dialogueact679	1792.69	1793.06	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.A.dialogueact680	1793.45	1793.62	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact681	1793.77	1796.58	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Oh , I mean , I mean the places which have a lot of computing power ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact683	1797.04	1801.69	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so because it is really it 's a p it 's a {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it will be reasonable search
Bro017.E.dialogueact682	1796.93	1797.33	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact684	1802.15	1802.42	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact685	1802.66	1802.78	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh
Bro017.B.dialogueact686	1803.6	1812.26	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but I wonder if there isn't some way of doing this uh search like when we are searching say for best discriminants .
Bro017.E.dialogueact687	1813.3	1815.41	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	You know actually , I don't know that this wouldn't be all that bad .
Bro017.E.dialogueact688	1815.41	1817.35	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean you {disfmarker} you compute the features once ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact689	1817.2	1817.75	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact691	1817.75	1818.05	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact690	1817.35	1817.78	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.E.dialogueact692	1818.27	1821.97	E	PhD	s	-1	0	And then these exponents are just applied to that {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact693	1818.98	1819.82	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Absolutely .
Bro017.B.dialogueact694	1821.65	1823.0	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And hev everything is fixed .
Bro017.E.dialogueact695	1821.97	1822.29	E	PhD	fg	-1	0	So .
Bro017.B.dialogueact696	1823.0	1823.96	B	Professor	s^r	-1	0	Everything is fixed .
Bro017.B.dialogueact698	1823.96	1824.37	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	Each {disfmarker} each {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact697	1823.95	1826.42	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	And is this something that you would adjust for training ?
Bro017.E.dialogueact699	1826.42	1827.6	E	PhD	qrr	-1	0	or only recognition ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact700	1827.48	1828.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	For both , you would have to do .
Bro017.B.dialogueact702	1829.57	1829.73	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact701	1829.12	1829.73	E	PhD	s^bu^m	-1	0	You would do it on both .
Bro017.B.dialogueact704	1829.84	1830.87	B	Professor	s^r	-1	0	You have to do bo both .
Bro017.E.dialogueact703	1829.73	1830.4	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So you 'd actually {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact705	1831.44	1835.01	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Because essentially you are saying " uh this feature is not important " .
Bro017.E.dialogueact706	1834.55	1834.92	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact707	1835.65	1836.67	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Or less important ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact708	1836.67	1838.64	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so that 's {disfmarker} th that 's a {disfmarker} that 's a painful one ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact709	1838.64	1838.92	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact710	1838.93	1845.23	E	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	So for each {disfmarker} uh set of exponents that you would try , it would require a training and a recognition ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact711	1842.69	1842.85	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact712	1843.75	1845.25	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but wait a minute .
Bro017.B.dialogueact713	1845.25	1847.74	B	Professor	s	-1	0	You may not need to re uh uh retrain the m model .
Bro017.B.dialogueact714	1848.54	1858.43	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	You just may n may need to c uh give uh less weight to {disfmarker} to uh a mod uh a component of the model which represents this particular feature .
Bro017.B.dialogueact715	1859.15	1860.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	You don't have to retrain it .

Bro017.B.dialogueact794	1993.51	2011.0	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	So in order {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} in order to make dimension which {disfmarker} which Stephane sees uh less important , uh uh I mean not {disfmarker} not useful , less important , what you do is that this particular component in the model you can multiply by w you can {disfmarker} you can basically de - weight it in the model .
Bro017.B.dialogueact795	2011.35	2013.54	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But you can't do it in a {disfmarker} in a test data
Bro017.B.dialogueact796	2013.54	2017.38	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because you don't have a model for th I mean uh when the test comes ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact797	2017.38	2023.4	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	but what you can do is that you put this particular component in {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and you compress it .
Bro017.B.dialogueact798	2023.96	2028.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	That becomes uh th gets less variance , subsequently becomes less important .
Bro017.E.dialogueact799	2030.81	2034.63	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Couldn't you just do that to the test data and not do anything with your training data ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact800	2034.47	2035.65	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	That would be very bad ,

Bro017.B.dialogueact803	2041.3	2045.09	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Because your model was trained expecting a certain var variance on C - one .

Bro017.B.dialogueact805	2046.09	2048.46	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And because the model thinks C - one is important .
Bro017.B.dialogueact806	2049.52	2057.97	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	After you train the model , you sort of {disfmarker} y you could do {disfmarker} you could do still what I was proposing initially ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact807	2058.86	2066.58	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	that during the training you {disfmarker} you compress C - one that becomes {disfmarker} then it becomes less important in a training .

Bro017.B.dialogueact809	2067.12	2074.35	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But if you have {disfmarker} if you want to run e ex extensive experiment without retraining the model , you don't have to retrain the model .
Bro017.B.dialogueact810	2074.52	2076.42	B	Professor	s	-1	0	You train it on the original vector .
Bro017.B.dialogueact811	2077.09	2087.55	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	But after , you {disfmarker} wh when you are doing this parametric study of importance of C - one you will de - weight the C - one component in the model ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact812	2088.7	2096.18	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and you will put in the {disfmarker} you will compress the {disfmarker} this component in a {disfmarker} in the test data . s by the same amount .
Bro017.E.dialogueact813	2094.02	2095.39	E	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	Could you also if you wanted to {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact814	2095.98	2117.17	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	if you wanted to try an experiment uh by {pause} leaving out say , C - one , couldn't you , in your test data , uh modify the {disfmarker} all of the C - one values to be um way outside of the normal range of the Gaussian for C - one that was trained in the model ?
Bro017.E.dialogueact815	2117.63	2122.55	E	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	So that effectively , the C - one never really contributes to the score ?

Bro017.E.dialogueact857	2172.29	2173.0	E	PhD	b	-1	0	
Bro017.B.dialogueact859	2173.39	2175.22	B	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	But what you can do , I 'm confident you ca
Bro017.E.dialogueact858	2173.0	2173.35	E	PhD	b	-1	0	
Bro017.B.dialogueact860	2175.22	2178.56	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well , I 'm reasonably confident and I putting it on the record ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact861	2178.56	2178.74	B	Professor	qy^d^f^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact862	2178.74	2182.08	B	Professor	s^j	-1	0	I mean y people will listen to it for {disfmarker} for centuries now ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact863	2182.53	2188.97	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	is {pause} what you can do , is you train the model uh with the {disfmarker} with the original data .
Bro017.A.dialogueact864	2189.41	2190.12	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact865	2190.57	2194.6	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Then you decide that you want to see how important C {disfmarker} C - one is .
Bro017.B.dialogueact866	2195.73	2203.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So what you will do is that a component in the model for C - one , you will divide it by {disfmarker} by two .
Bro017.B.dialogueact867	2204.35	2208.75	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And you will compress your test data by square root .
Bro017.E.dialogueact868	2209.11	2209.5	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact869	2209.7	2211.63	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Then you will still have a perfect m match .
Bro017.B.dialogueact870	2211.9	2216.07	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Except that this component of C - one will be half as important in a {disfmarker} in a overall score .
Bro017.E.dialogueact871	2211.94	2212.33	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact872	2214.95	2215.48	E	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact873	2217.1	2220.75	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Then you divide it by four and you take a square , f fourth root .
Bro017.B.dialogueact874	2221.97	2237.34	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	Then if you think that some component is more {disfmarker} is more important then th th th it then {disfmarker} then uh uh i it is , based on training , then you uh multiply this particular component in the model by {disfmarker} by {disfmarker} by {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact875	2235.63	2237.18	E	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	You 're talking about the standard deviation ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact876	2237.34	2237.76	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact877	2237.87	2238.08	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact878	2238.53	2242.66	B	Professor	s^aa|s^rt	-1	0	Yeah , multiply this component uh i it by number b larger than one ,
Bro017.E.dialogueact879	2242.69	2243.42	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact880	2243.4	2246.12	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and you put your data in power higher than one .
Bro017.B.dialogueact881	2247.36	2250.53	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Then it becomes more important . In the overall score , I believe .
Bro017.C.dialogueact883	2251.6	2251.73	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro017.C.dialogueact884	2251.73	2252.53	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	but , at the {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact882	2251.27	2253.59	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	But {pause} don't you have to do something to the mean , also ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact885	2253.93	2254.19	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bro017.C.dialogueact886	2254.48	2254.72	C	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bro017.A.dialogueact888	2255.15	2255.33	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact887	2254.9	2255.22	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bro017.C.dialogueact889	2255.3	2261.57	C	PhD	s	-1	0	But I think it 's {disfmarker} uh the {disfmarker} The variance is on {disfmarker} on the denominator in the {disfmarker} in the Gaussian equation .
Bro017.C.dialogueact890	2261.57	2264.12	C	PhD	s	-1	0	So . I think it 's maybe it 's the contrary .
Bro017.C.dialogueact891	2264.63	2271.58	C	PhD	s.x	-1	0	If you want to decrease the importance of a c parameter , you have to increase it 's variance .
Bro017.B.dialogueact892	2267.46	2267.84	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bro017.B.dialogueact893	2269.6	2269.98	B	Professor	s^aa.x	-1	0	Right .
Bro017.B.dialogueact894	2270.48	2270.7	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bro017.D.dialogueact895	2270.53	2271.26	D	PhD	s.x	-1	0	Multiply .
Bro017.B.dialogueact896	2271.62	2272.09	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly .
Bro017.B.dialogueact897	2272.28	2272.51	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact898	2272.8	2275.2	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	So you {disfmarker} so you may want to do it other way around ,
Bro017.C.dialogueact899	2272.87	2273.08	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.C.dialogueact900	2273.08	2273.65	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	That 's right .
Bro017.C.dialogueact901	2273.65	2274.11	C	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro017.B.dialogueact902	2275.2	2275.4	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bro017.C.dialogueact903	2275.42	2275.88	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.A.dialogueact904	2275.97	2276.26	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro017.E.dialogueact905	2276.88	2277.55	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	But if your {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact906	2279.66	2284.51	E	PhD	s	-1	0	If your um original data for C - one had a mean of two .
Bro017.B.dialogueact907	2284.8	2285.06	B	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro017.E.dialogueact908	2286.09	2291.26	E	PhD	s	-1	0	And now you 're {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} you 're changing that by squaring it .
Bro017.E.dialogueact909	2291.52	2295.41	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Now your mean of your C - one original data has {disfmarker} {comment} is four .
Bro017.E.dialogueact910	2296.0	2297.96	E	PhD	s	-1	0	But your model still has a mean of two .
Bro017.E.dialogueact911	2299.14	2303.3	E	PhD	s	-1	0	So even though you 've expended the range , your mean doesn't match anymore .
Bro017.C.dialogueact912	2303.52	2304.04	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact914	2307.12	2307.55	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	Let 's see .
Bro017.E.dialogueact913	2306.83	2307.52	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Do you see what I mean ?
Bro017.C.dialogueact915	2307.67	2312.92	C	PhD	s^cs^rt	-1	0	I think {disfmarker} What I see {disfmarker} What could be done is you don't change your features , which are computed once for all ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact916	2308.73	2309.42	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro017.C.dialogueact917	2313.86	2315.75	C	PhD	s	-1	0	but you just tune the model .
Bro017.C.dialogueact918	2316.33	2317.57	C	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	So . You have your features .
Bro017.C.dialogueact919	2317.57	2319.81	C	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	You train your {disfmarker} your model on these features .
Bro017.E.dialogueact920	2319.93	2320.38	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.C.dialogueact921	2320.99	2334.06	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And then if you want to decrease the importance of C - one you just take the variance of the C - one component in the {disfmarker} in the model and increase it if you want to decrease the importance of C - one or decrease it {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact922	2329.36	2329.6	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact923	2332.49	2332.71	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact924	2333.32	2333.68	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro017.B.dialogueact925	2333.84	2334.01	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact926	2335.51	2337.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	You would have to modify the mean in the model .
Bro017.B.dialogueact927	2337.17	2338.23	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	I {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} I agree with you .
Bro017.B.dialogueact928	2338.63	2338.83	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact929	2339.32	2339.51	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact931	2339.71	2341.76	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but I mean , but it 's {disfmarker} it 's i it 's do - able ,
Bro017.C.dialogueact932	2340.13	2340.43	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	Well .
Bro017.E.dialogueact930	2339.69	2340.37	E	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah , so y
Bro017.B.dialogueact933	2341.76	2342.0	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact934	2342.0	2342.72	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , it 's predictable .
Bro017.B.dialogueact935	2342.72	2343.83	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh . Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact936	2343.07	2344.05	E	PhD	s^aa^m	-1	0	It 's predictable , yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact937	2343.92	2344.12	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact938	2344.18	2345.04	B	Professor	s^aa^r	-1	0	Yeah , it 's predictable .
Bro017.C.dialogueact940	2344.73	2345.11	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact939	2344.68	2345.01	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact941	2345.43	2349.22	E	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	But as a simple thing , you could just {disfmarker} just muck with the variance .
Bro017.C.dialogueact942	2347.92	2348.9	C	PhD	s^2	-1	0	Just adjust the model ,
Bro017.C.dialogueact943	2348.99	2349.17	C	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact944	2350.3	2353.27	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	to get uh this {disfmarker} uh this {disfmarker} the effect I think that you 're talking about ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact945	2353.0	2353.53	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact946	2353.27	2353.59	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact947	2354.18	2354.6	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	It might be .
Bro017.E.dialogueact948	2355.11	2357.79	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Could increase the variance to decrease the importance .
Bro017.B.dialogueact949	2357.95	2358.48	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.C.dialogueact950	2358.82	2359.25	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact951	2359.89	2365.64	E	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , because if you had a huge variance , you 're dividing by a large number , {comment} you get a very small contribution .
Bro017.A.dialogueact954	2362.19	2362.83	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	Doesn't matter {disfmarker}
Bro017.C.dialogueact952	2361.96	2362.08	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro017.C.dialogueact953	2362.08	2363.16	C	PhD	s	-1	0	it becomes more flat
Bro017.A.dialogueact956	2363.63	2363.95	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro017.C.dialogueact955	2363.16	2363.43	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact957	2364.16	2364.5	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.C.dialogueact959	2365.71	2366.03	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact958	2365.64	2365.95	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.A.dialogueact961	2368.1	2372.96	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , the sharper the variance , the more {disfmarker} more important to get that one right .
Bro017.E.dialogueact960	2367.64	2368.29	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact962	2371.82	2372.42	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact963	2372.04	2376.41	E	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , you know actually , this reminds me of something that happened uh when I was at BBN .
Bro017.E.dialogueact964	2376.41	2380.64	E	PhD	s	-1	0	We were playing with putting um pitch into the Mandarin recognizer .
Bro017.B.dialogueact965	2378.55	2378.99	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact966	2381.13	2387.21	E	PhD	s	-1	0	And this particular pitch algorithm um when it didn't think there was any voicing , was spitting out zeros .
Bro017.E.dialogueact967	2387.9	2394.83	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So we were getting {disfmarker} uh when we did clustering , we were getting groups uh of features
Bro017.B.dialogueact968	2393.85	2395.87	B	Professor	s	-1	0	p Pretty new outliers , interesting outliers ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact970	2396.12	2396.33	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.E.dialogueact969	2395.85	2399.6	E	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	yeah , with {disfmarker} with a mean of zero and basically zero variance .
Bro017.B.dialogueact971	2398.78	2399.46	B	Professor	s^m	-1	0	Variance .
Bro017.E.dialogueact972	2399.91	2405.45	E	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	So , when ener {comment} when anytime any one of those vectors came in that had a zero in it , we got a great score .
Bro017.E.dialogueact973	2405.51	2410.67	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean it was just , {nonvocalsound} you know , incredibly {nonvocalsound} high score , and so that was throwing everything off .
Bro017.C.dialogueact974	2407.05	2407.67	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact975	2411.28	2416.48	E	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	So {vocalsound} if you have very small variance you get really good scores when you get something that matches .
Bro017.B.dialogueact976	2415.42	2415.87	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.C.dialogueact978	2416.84	2417.65	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact977	2416.48	2419.69	E	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	So . {vocalsound} So that 's a way , yeah , yeah {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact979	2420.08	2421.84	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	That 's a way to increase the {disfmarker} yeah , n
Bro017.E.dialogueact980	2421.98	2422.93	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That 's interesting .
Bro017.E.dialogueact981	2423.82	2425.12	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So in fact , that would be {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact982	2426.19	2427.89	E	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	That doesn't require any retraining .
Bro017.B.dialogueact983	2428.34	2428.55	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact985	2428.68	2429.58	B	Professor	s^aa^m	-1	0	No . No .
Bro017.C.dialogueact984	2428.52	2428.7	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	No ,
Bro017.C.dialogueact986	2428.75	2429.26	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	that 's right .
Bro017.C.dialogueact988	2430.08	2430.22	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So it 's
Bro017.E.dialogueact987	2429.89	2431.79	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So that means it 's just
Bro017.B.dialogueact990	2431.35	2431.68	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.C.dialogueact989	2431.34	2433.69	C	PhD	s	-1	0	just tuning the models and testing , actually .
Bro017.E.dialogueact991	2431.79	2432.53	E	PhD	s	-1	0	recognitions .
Bro017.B.dialogueact993	2432.91	2433.24	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact992	2432.88	2433.2	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.C.dialogueact995	2433.69	2434.58	C	PhD	s	-1	0	It would be quick .
Bro017.E.dialogueact994	2433.3	2441.39	E	PhD	s	-1	0	You {disfmarker} you have a step where you you modify the models , make a d copy of your models with whatever variance modifications you make , and rerun recognition .
Bro017.B.dialogueact996	2436.38	2436.59	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.C.dialogueact997	2436.43	2436.66	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact998	2438.08	2438.5	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact999	2439.63	2439.93	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1000	2440.79	2440.99	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1001	2441.65	2442.99	E	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	And then do a whole bunch of those .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1002	2443.21	2443.42	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bro017.B.dialogueact1029	2479.42	2486.03	B	Professor	s^j	-1	0	because then y you just write the " do " - loops and then you pretend that you are working while you are sort of {disfmarker} you c you can go fishing .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1027	2479.2	2480.18	E	PhD	s^e	-1	0	And two gigs of memory .

Bro017.B.dialogueact1038	2489.36	2492.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Then you are sort of in this mode like all of those ARPA people are ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact1040	2492.3	2492.78	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.E.dialogueact1039	2492.15	2492.34	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1041	2494.78	2498.47	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh , since it is on the record , I can't say uh which company it was ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact1042	2499.44	2503.49	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but it was reported to me that uh somebody visited a company
Bro017.B.dialogueact1043	2504.22	2511.33	B	Professor	s^j	-1	0	and during a {disfmarker} d during a discussion , there was this guy who was always hitting the carriage returns uh on a computer .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1044	2511.65	2511.99	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1045	2512.23	2516.56	B	Professor	s^j:qw	-1	0	So after two hours uh the visitor said " wh why are you hitting this carriage return ? "
Bro017.B.dialogueact1046	2517.2	2522.77	B	Professor	s^j	-1	0	And he said " well you know , we are being paid by a computer ty I mean we are {disfmarker} we have a government contract .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1047	2522.86	2525.93	B	Professor	s^j	-1	0	And they pay us by {disfmarker} by amount of computer time we use . "
Bro017.B.dialogueact1048	2527.07	2530.48	B	Professor	s^j	-1	0	It was in old days when there were uh {disfmarker} of PDP - eights and that sort of thing .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1049	2528.2	2528.74	E	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	Oh , my gosh !
Bro017.E.dialogueact1050	2531.66	2532.9	E	PhD	s^bu.%--	-1	0	So he had to make it look like {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact1051	2535.01	2545.12	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Because so they had a {disfmarker} they literally had to c monitor at the time {disfmarker} at the time on a computer how much time is being spent I {disfmarker} i i or on {disfmarker} on this particular project .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1052	2539.82	2540.1	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1053	2541.36	2541.54	E	PhD	s^m.%-	-1	0	How {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact1054	2541.97	2542.69	E	PhD	s^2	-1	0	Idle time .

Bro017.B.dialogueact1057	2547.01	2548.86	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Nobody was looking even at what was coming out .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1058	2548.36	2549.86	E	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	Have you ever seen those little
Bro017.E.dialogueact1059	2549.86	2550.29	E	PhD	h	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact1060	2551.08	2555.95	E	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} it 's this thing that 's the shape of a bird and it has a red ball and its beak dips into the water ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact1061	2554.08	2554.39	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , I know ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact1062	2554.5	2554.59	B	Professor	b	-1	0	right .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1063	2556.41	2558.9	E	PhD	s^j.%--	-1	0	So {vocalsound} if you could hook that up so it hit the keyboard {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact1064	2557.55	2557.75	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1065	2558.51	2558.82	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1066	2559.41	2559.73	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1067	2561.16	2561.4	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1068	2564.25	2565.63	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That 's an interesting experiment .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1069	2565.07	2566.67	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	It would be similar {disfmarker} similar to {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact1070	2566.67	2571.31	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I knew some people who were uh that was in old Communist uh Czechoslovakia ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact1071	2571.31	2571.52	B	Professor	qy^d^f^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact1072	2571.52	2576.92	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so we were watching for American airplanes , coming to spy on {disfmarker} on uh {disfmarker} on us at the time ,
Bro017.E.dialogueact1073	2573.72	2574.02	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1074	2576.38	2576.7	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1075	2577.48	2587.2	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so there were three guys uh uh stationed in the middle of the woods on one l lonely uh watching tower , pretty much spending a year and a half there because there was this service
Bro017.B.dialogueact1076	2587.2	2587.35	B	Professor	qy^d^f^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact1078	2588.01	2592.11	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And so they {disfmarker} very quickly they made friends with local girls and local people in the village
Bro017.E.dialogueact1077	2587.56	2587.79	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Ugh !
Bro017.B.dialogueact1079	2592.11	2592.42	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact1080	2592.26	2592.54	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1081	2593.07	2597.93	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and so but they {disfmarker} there was one plane flying over s always uh uh above ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact1082	2598.56	2600.48	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so that was the only work which they had .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1083	2600.64	2606.01	B	Professor	s	-1	0	They {disfmarker} like four in the afternoon they had to report there was a plane from Prague to Brno Basically f flying there ,
Bro017.E.dialogueact1084	2605.95	2606.31	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1085	2606.53	2615.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so they f very q f first thing was that they would always run back and {disfmarker} and at four o ' clock and {disfmarker} and quickly make a call , " this plane is uh uh passing "
Bro017.B.dialogueact1086	2616.13	2621.98	B	Professor	s	-1	0	then a second thing was that they {disfmarker} they took the line from this u u post to uh uh a local pub .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1087	2622.61	2624.01	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And they were calling from the pub .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1088	2624.64	2633.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And they {disfmarker} but third thing which they made , and when they screwed up , they {disfmarker} finally they had to p the {disfmarker} the p the pub owner to make these phone calls because they didn't even bother to be there anymore .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1089	2634.49	2636.81	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And one day there was {disfmarker} there was no plane .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1090	2636.81	2640.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	At least they were sort of smart enough that they looked if the plane is flying there ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact1091	2640.29	2640.6	B	Professor	qy^d^f^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact1093	2640.99	2645.82	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And the pub owner says " oh my {disfmarker} four o ' clock , OK , quickly p pick up the phone , call that there 's a plane flying . "
Bro017.E.dialogueact1092	2640.57	2640.79	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1094	2645.82	2647.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	There was no plane for some reason ,
Bro017.E.dialogueact1095	2645.84	2646.51	E	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	And there wasn't ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact1096	2647.29	2648.01	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it was downed ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact1097	2648.01	2648.98	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	or {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact1098	2649.84	2650.75	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so they got in trouble .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1099	2653.98	2656.54	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	But . {vocalsound} But uh .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1100	2656.79	2657.02	E	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	Huh !
Bro017.E.dialogueact1101	2657.37	2658.56	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Well that 's {disfmarker} that 's a really i
Bro017.B.dialogueact1102	2658.19	2659.84	B	Professor	b	-1	0	So . So . Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1103	2658.56	2659.87	E	PhD	s	-1	0	That wouldn't be too difficult to try .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1105	2660.03	2660.12	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1104	2659.87	2660.79	E	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	Maybe I could set that up .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1106	2660.92	2661.07	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1107	2661.82	2662.27	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	And we 'll just {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact1108	2662.67	2666.41	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	Well , at least go test the s test the uh assumption about C - C - one I mean to begin with .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1109	2666.41	2669.96	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But then of course one can then think about some predictable result to change all of them .
Bro017.C.dialogueact1110	2666.42	2667.0	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1111	2669.96	2676.13	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's just like we used to do these uh {disfmarker} these uh {disfmarker} um the {disfmarker} the uh distance measures .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1112	2676.27	2678.0	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	It might be that uh {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact1113	2676.81	2685.56	E	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , so the first set of uh variance weighting vectors would be just you know one {disfmarker} modifying one and leaving the others the same .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1114	2678.15	2678.33	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1115	2679.57	2679.92	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bro017.C.dialogueact1120	2686.08	2686.75	C	PhD	s^am	-1	0	Maybe .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1121	2686.14	2687.46	E	PhD	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and do that for each one .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1122	2687.23	2696.99	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Because you see , I mean , what is happening here in a {disfmarker} in a {disfmarker} in a {disfmarker} in such a model is that it 's {disfmarker} tells you yeah what has a low variance uh is uh {disfmarker} is uh {disfmarker} is more reliable ,
Bro017.E.dialogueact1123	2687.46	2688.63	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	That would be one set of experiment {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact1124	2696.99	2697.35	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact1125	2700.1	2700.93	B	Professor	qw.%-	-1	0	How do we {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact1126	2700.23	2703.01	E	PhD	s^aa.%--	-1	0	Wh - yeah , when the data matches that , then you get really {disfmarker}

Bro017.E.dialogueact1147	2725.11	2725.73	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1148	2725.81	2728.45	E	PhD	s	-1	0	And so it seems like they 're already sort of compressed .
Bro017.C.dialogueact1149	2729.19	2729.66	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1150	2730.32	2731.82	E	PhD	s^e	-1	0	The range {pause} of values .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1151	2731.34	2745.91	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah that 's why uh people used these lifters were inverse variance weighting lifters basically that makes uh uh Euclidean distance more like uh Mahalanobis distance with a diagonal covariance when you knew what all the variances were over the old data .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1152	2735.08	2735.65	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1153	2740.83	2741.36	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1154	2746.23	2746.98	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1155	2746.73	2751.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	What they would do is that they would weight each coefficient by inverse of the variance .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1156	2751.82	2758.27	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Turns out that uh the variance decreases at least at fast , I believe , as the index of the cepstral coefficients .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1158	2758.27	2760.99	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I think you can show that uh uh analytically .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1157	2757.92	2758.26	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1160	2761.48	2770.5	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So typically what happens is that you {disfmarker} you need to weight the {disfmarker} uh weight the higher coefficients more than uh the lower coefficients .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1159	2761.2	2761.59	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1161	2770.64	2771.21	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1162	2773.26	2773.83	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1164	2779.87	2780.42	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro017.C.dialogueact1163	2779.84	2781.46	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1165	2780.65	2780.89	E	PhD	b	-1	0	
Bro017.B.dialogueact1166	2782.1	2783.0	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	When {disfmarker} Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1167	2783.15	2799.1	B	Professor	s	+1	1	When we talked about Aurora still I wanted to m make a plea {disfmarker} uh encourage for uh more communication between {disfmarker} between uh {pause} uh different uh parts of the distributed uh {pause} uh center .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1168	2800.49	2806.03	B	Professor	s	+1	1	Uh even when there is absolutely nothing to {disfmarker} to s to say but the weather is good in Ore - in {disfmarker} in Berkeley .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1169	2806.32	2811.9	B	Professor	s	+1	1	I 'm sure that it 's being appreciated in Oregon and maybe it will generate similar responses down here ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact1170	2812.8	2813.75	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	like , uh {disfmarker}
Bro017.C.dialogueact1171	2814.04	2815.48	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	We can set up a webcam maybe .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1172	2815.74	2815.98	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.A.dialogueact1173	2819.81	2819.9	A	Grad	s^aa^j	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1174	2820.48	2822.04	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	What {disfmarker} you know , nowadays ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact1175	2822.04	2822.37	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1176	2822.49	2824.13	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's actually do - able , almost .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1177	2827.81	2828.71	E	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	Is the um {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact1178	2828.71	2833.12	E	PhD	qy^rt	+1	1	if we mail to " Aurora - inhouse " , does that go up to you guys also ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact1179	2833.29	2833.92	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	I don't think so .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1181	2834.04	2834.26	B	Professor	s^ar	+1	1	No .
Bro017.C.dialogueact1180	2833.72	2833.97	C	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1182	2834.51	2834.92	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1184	2835.26	2836.02	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	So we should do that .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1183	2835.07	2835.66	E	PhD	qw.%-	-1	0	So i What is it {disfmarker}
Bro017.A.dialogueact1187	2836.44	2836.74	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1186	2836.39	2837.68	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	We should definitely set up {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact1185	2836.34	2836.72	E	PhD	s^aa^m.%--	-1	0	Yeah we sh
Bro017.E.dialogueact1188	2837.03	2839.67	E	PhD	qy^rt	+1	1	Do we have a mailing list that includes uh the OGI people ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact1189	2838.65	2838.99	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.C.dialogueact1190	2839.78	2840.27	C	PhD	h|s^ar	+1	1	Uh no .
Bro017.C.dialogueact1191	2840.49	2840.99	C	PhD	s^ar	+1	1	We don't have .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1193	2841.25	2841.66	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1192	2841.04	2841.46	E	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	Oh !
Bro017.E.dialogueact1194	2841.71	2842.6	E	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	Maybe we should set that up .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1195	2842.6	2844.06	E	PhD	s^df	+1	1	That would make it much easier .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1196	2843.47	2843.71	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1197	2843.8	2844.29	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1198	2844.48	2845.87	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , that would make it easier .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1199	2845.98	2849.18	E	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	So maybe just call it " Aurora " or something that would {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact1200	2848.08	2848.31	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1201	2848.7	2848.91	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1202	2849.41	2851.85	B	Professor	s	+1	1	And then we also can send the {disfmarker} the dis to the same address
Bro017.B.dialogueact1203	2851.85	2852.06	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact1204	2852.06	2853.15	B	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	+1	1	and it goes to everybody
Bro017.E.dialogueact1205	2852.09	2852.76	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1206	2853.21	2853.7	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.C.dialogueact1207	2853.89	2854.42	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1208	2856.06	2856.32	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1209	2856.92	2857.81	E	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Maybe we can set that up .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1210	2857.89	2864.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Because what 's happening naturally in research , I know , is that people essentially start working on something and they don't want to be much bothered ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact1211	2864.49	2864.73	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact1212	2864.73	2877.54	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but what the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} then the danger is in a group like this , is that two people are working on the same thing and i c of course both of them come with the s very good solution , but it could have been done somehow in half of the effort or something .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1213	2870.18	2870.66	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1214	2878.3	2881.25	B	Professor	s^t	-1	0	Oh , there 's another thing which I wanted to uh uh report .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1215	2881.25	2886.54	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Lucash , I think , uh wrote the software for this Aurora - two system .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1216	2887.58	2890.85	B	Professor	s	-1	0	reasonably uh good one , because he 's doing it for Intel ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact1217	2891.13	2897.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but I trust that we have uh rights to uh use it uh or distribute it and everything .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1218	2897.03	2900.45	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Cuz Intel 's intentions originally was to distribute it free of charge anyways .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1219	2900.46	2900.98	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm !
Bro017.B.dialogueact1220	2901.26	2909.85	B	Professor	fh|s^cc	-1	0	u s And so {disfmarker} so uh we {disfmarker} we will make sure that at least you can see the software and if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if it is of any use .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1221	2910.8	2911.19	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	Just uh {disfmarker}
Bro017.C.dialogueact1222	2911.02	2911.44	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1223	2912.28	2916.84	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It might be a reasonable point for p perhaps uh start converging .
Bro017.C.dialogueact1224	2913.46	2913.93	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1225	2918.29	2920.41	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Because Morgan 's point is that {disfmarker} He is an experienced guy .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1226	2920.41	2929.32	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	He says " well you know it 's very difficult to collaborate if you are working with supposedly the same thing , in quotes , except which is not s is not the same .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1227	2929.51	2929.6	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1228	2930.02	2936.01	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	Which {disfmarker} which uh uh one is using that set of hurdles , another one set {disfmarker} is using another set of hurdles .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1229	2936.01	2939.49	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	So . And {disfmarker} And then it 's difficult to c compare .
Bro017.C.dialogueact1230	2942.06	2942.9	C	PhD	qo	-1	0	What about Harry ?
Bro017.C.dialogueact1231	2943.13	2949.63	C	PhD	fh|s^rt	-1	0	Uh . We received a mail last week and you are starting to {disfmarker} to do some experiments .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1232	2947.7	2949.07	B	Professor	s	-1	0	He got the {disfmarker} he got the software .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1233	2949.44	2950.47	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah . They sent the release .
Bro017.C.dialogueact1234	2949.81	2952.44	C	PhD	s	-1	0	And use this Intel version .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1235	2950.65	2950.81	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1236	2951.05	2951.26	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1237	2951.48	2951.67	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1238	2952.76	2953.12	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.C.dialogueact1239	2953.09	2953.18	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1240	2955.67	2958.19	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Yeah because Intel paid us uh
Bro017.B.dialogueact1241	2958.19	2959.32	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	should I say on a microphone ?
Bro017.B.dialogueact1242	2959.43	2961.12	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh some amount of money , not much .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1243	2961.52	2962.95	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Not much I can say on a microphone .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1244	2963.39	2966.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Much less then we should have gotten {vocalsound} for this amount of work .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1245	2967.74	2974.77	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And they wanted uh to {disfmarker} to have software so that they can also play with it , which means that it has to be in a certain environment {disfmarker}
Bro017.E.dialogueact1246	2972.33	2972.66	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1247	2974.77	2991.71	B	Professor	s	-1	0	they use actu actually some Intel libraries , but in the process , Lucash just rewrote the whole thing because he figured rather than trying to f make sense uh of uh {disfmarker} including ICSI software uh not for training on the nets
Bro017.E.dialogueact1248	2988.59	2989.08	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.A.dialogueact1249	2989.82	2990.13	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Oh .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1250	2991.71	3006.06	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but I think he rewrote the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} or so maybe somehow reused over the parts of the thing so that {disfmarker} so that {disfmarker} the whole thing , including MLP , trained MLP is one piece of uh software .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1251	2997.28	2997.9	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.E.dialogueact1252	3006.36	3006.62	E	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	Wow !
Bro017.B.dialogueact1253	3008.83	3009.35	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Is it useful ?
Bro017.A.dialogueact1255	3010.71	3011.72	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Ye - Yeah .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1254	3010.56	3010.84	B	Professor	fh.%	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bro017.A.dialogueact1256	3011.91	3016.64	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , I remember when we were trying to put together all the ICSI software for the submission .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1257	3012.16	3012.58	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	Or {disfmarker}
Bro017.B.dialogueact1258	3016.35	3017.35	B	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's what he was saying ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact1259	3017.35	3017.73	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	right .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1260	3017.73	3023.12	B	Professor	s	-1	0	He said that it was like {disfmarker} it was like just so many libraries and nobody knew what was used when ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact1261	3023.12	3030.19	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and so that 's where he started and that 's where he realized that it needs to be {disfmarker} needs to be uh uh at least cleaned up ,
Bro017.A.dialogueact1262	3027.59	3027.89	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.C.dialogueact1263	3027.82	3028.3	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1264	3030.19	3031.77	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so I think it {disfmarker} this is available .
Bro017.A.dialogueact1265	3032.15	3032.38	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1267	3033.39	3033.77	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bro017.C.dialogueact1266	3032.97	3033.17	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.C.dialogueact1268	3033.59	3040.15	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , the {disfmarker} the only thing I would check is if he {disfmarker} does he use Intel math libraries ,
Bro017.B.dialogueact1270	3040.23	3041.19	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	uh e ev
Bro017.C.dialogueact1269	3040.15	3046.1	C	PhD	s	-1	0	because if it 's the case , it 's maybe not so easy to use it on another architecture .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1271	3042.3	3047.82	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	n not maybe {disfmarker} Maybe not in a first {disfmarker} maybe not in a first ap approximation
Bro017.B.dialogueact1273	3047.82	3053.44	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	because I think he started first just with a plain C {disfmarker} C or C - plus - plus or something before {disfmarker}
Bro017.C.dialogueact1272	3047.81	3048.23	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Ah yeah .
Bro017.C.dialogueact1274	3050.23	3050.59	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1275	3053.57	3054.68	B	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I can check on that .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1276	3055.27	3055.47	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro017.C.dialogueact1277	3055.55	3055.87	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bro017.E.dialogueact1279	3056.61	3057.07	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1280	3057.19	3062.79	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And uh in {disfmarker} otherwise the Intel libraries , I think they are available free of f freely .
Bro017.B.dialogueact1281	3063.81	3066.85	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But they may be running only on {disfmarker} on uh {disfmarker} on uh Windows .
Bro017.C.dialogueact1282	3064.07	3064.42	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
