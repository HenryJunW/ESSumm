Bmr026.A.dialogueact3	5.501	9.972	A	Grad	s	+1	1	three of them were requested by Jane who is not gonna be at the meeting today .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact4	10.55	10.7	A	Grad	b	-1	0	
Bmr026.A.dialogueact5	11.064	15.835	A	Grad	h|s^rt^t	-1	0	So . {vocalsound} The uh first was transcription status .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact6	15.895	18.445	A	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Does anyone besides Jane know what the transcription status is ?
Bmr026.F.dialogueact7	18.97	21.21	F	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Um , sort of , I do , peripherally .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact9	21.661	22.681	C	PhD	qy^rt^t1	-1	0	Is that English ?
Bmr026.F.dialogueact8	21.55	31.88	F	PhD	h|s	+1	2	Um {disfmarker} Well first of all with IBM I got a note from Brian yesterday saying that they finally made the tape for the thing that we sent them a {pause} week or week and a half ago
Bmr026.D.dialogueact10	26.836	27.686	D	PhD	s	-1	0	That 's our system .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact11	28.891	29.071	A	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	Ugh !
Bmr026.F.dialogueact12	31.88	33.35	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and that it 's gone out to the transcribers
Bmr026.F.dialogueact13	33.35	36.397	F	PhD	s	+1	2	and hopefully next week we 'll have the transcription back from that .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact15	37.28	38.13	A	Grad	qy	-1	0	C can I have a pen ?
Bmr026.F.dialogueact14	37.16	44.95	F	PhD	h|s	-1	0	Um {disfmarker} Jane seems to be um moving right along on the transcriptions from the ICSI side .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact16	44.95	51.703	F	PhD	s	-1	0	She 's assigned , I think probably five or six m more meetings .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact17	50.28	52.74	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	Yeah , I think we 're up to MR thirteen or something .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact19	52.799	53.239	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact18	52.77	56.24	F	PhD	fg|s	+1	1	Yeah , so um , I guess she 's hired some new transcribers
Bmr026.D.dialogueact22	57.002	57.492	D	PhD	s^t1.%-	-1	0	Speaking {disfmarker}
Bmr026.E.dialogueact21	56.61	57.89	E	Grad	qw^rt	-1	0	Which meetings is she transcribing ?
Bmr026.F.dialogueact20	56.24	56.5	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr026.F.dialogueact23	58.23	65.66	F	PhD	h|s	-1	0	Um well we 've {disfmarker} we 've run out of E D Us because a certain number of them are um , sort of awaiting to go to IBM .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact24	60.463	60.733	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact25	65.129	65.929	C	PhD	s^2	-1	0	For IBM , yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact27	65.904	66.154	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact26	65.834	66.104	E	Grad	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact28	66.12	69.47	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and the rest are in process being transcribed uh here .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact30	69.34	75.2	D	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	So does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there 's no data back from IBM
Bmr026.E.dialogueact29	68.93	70.01	E	Grad	s^bu	+1	2	So we 're doing some in parallel .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact31	71.136	71.366	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact32	72.967	73.097	F	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact34	75.08	75.41	A	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	No , no .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact33	74.67	75.09	F	PhD	s^ar^r	-1	0	Oh no no .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact38	75.49	76.82	A	Grad	s	-1	0	We haven't done that process .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact36	75.3	75.63	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^r^rt	-1	0	no ?
Bmr026.F.dialogueact35	75.23	75.44	F	PhD	s^ar^r	-1	0	No .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact37	75.44	76.37	F	PhD	s	-1	0	We 're not waiting on them .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact39	76.9	79.27	A	Grad	s^e	+1	1	So . They ' r they 're doing the full transcription process .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact40	76.954	77.224	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact41	79.38	79.81	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact43	79.89	81.08	E	Grad	s^bu.%-	-1	0	So they 're just doing their own thing until {disfmarker}
Bmr026.F.dialogueact42	79.74	79.97	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact44	80.494	97.058	D	PhD	s	+1	1	Because I {disfmarker} I need to ask Jane whether it 's {disfmarker} it would be OK for her {disfmarker} um , s some of her people to transcribe uh some of the initial data we got from the SmartKom data collection , which is these short like five or seven minute sessions .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact45	81.0	81.98	F	PhD	s^na	-1	0	We 're doing it in parallel , yeah .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact46	82.084	82.194	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact47	96.122	96.342	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact48	97.724	99.874	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Um and we want it {disfmarker} You know , we need {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact49	100.428	106.157	D	PhD	s	-1	0	The {disfmarker} Again , we {disfmarker} we have a similar uh logistic set - up where we are supposed to send the data to Munich
Bmr026.A.dialogueact51	106.433	106.773	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact50	106.157	107.797	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and get it transcribed and get it back .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact52	108.41	112.57	D	PhD	s	+1	1	But to get going we would like some of the data transcribed right away so we can get started .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact53	112.506	113.406	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Yep , sounds familiar .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact54	113.44	121.01	D	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	And so um I wanted to ask Jane if {disfmarker} if uh , you know , maybe one of their transcribers could {disfmarker} could do {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact55	121.01	123.96	D	PhD	s.%-	+1	1	I mean since these are very short , that should really be uh ,
Bmr026.B.dialogueact56	123.517	123.877	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact57	124.713	127.83	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	um {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker}
Bmr026.C.dialogueact58	125.376	126.376	C	PhD	s	-1	0	There 's only two channels .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact59	127.14	127.85	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	So it 's only {disfmarker}
Bmr026.C.dialogueact62	128.22	128.4	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact60	127.83	128.21	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact63	128.49	130.68	C	PhD	s	-1	0	As the synthesis doesn't have to be transcribed I think .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact61	128.21	128.9	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	It 's only two {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact64	129.95	130.35	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	Right , s
Bmr026.C.dialogueact65	130.75	130.97	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact66	130.99	131.25	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact67	131.25	133.53	D	PhD	s	-1	0	So {disfmarker} So it 's basically one channel to transcribe .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact68	133.53	133.88	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact69	134.07	136.71	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	One session is only uh like seven {disfmarker}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact70	136.139	138.779	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So that should have ma many fewer {disfmarker}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact71	139.039	142.859	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	And it 's also not uh a bunch of interruptions with people and all that ,
Bmr026.D.dialogueact72	141.83	142.08	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact73	142.32	147.653	D	PhD	s	-1	0	And some of it is read speech , so we could give them the {disfmarker} the thing that they 're reading
Bmr026.B.dialogueact74	143.059	143.219	B	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	right ?
Bmr026.B.dialogueact75	143.219	143.289	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact76	144.129	144.469	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact77	147.653	148.783	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and they just may {disfmarker}
Bmr026.A.dialogueact78	148.846	149.656	A	Grad	qy^2^d^rt	-1	0	Make sure it 's right .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact80	150.298	150.478	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact79	149.905	151.135	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	And so um ,
Bmr026.D.dialogueact81	151.904	153.474	D	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	um , I guess since she 's {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact82	153.474	156.484	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I was gonna ask her but since she 's not around I {disfmarker} maybe I 'll {disfmarker}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact83	157.398	158.748	B	Professor	fg|s.%-	-1	0	Yeah , well it certainly seems {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact84	157.64	163.409	D	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	Uh if {disfmarker} if that 's OK with you to {disfmarker} to , you know , get that stuff uh {disfmarker} to ask her for that , then I 'll do that .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact85	160.361	160.601	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact86	163.75	172.39	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Yeah , if we 're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to encompass that , that 's OK because I I um , I mean I still have high hopes that the that the IBM pipeline 'll work out for us , so it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact87	168.307	168.557	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact88	171.668	173.098	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK , yeah .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact89	174.046	174.266	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact90	174.48	174.79	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Alrighty .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact91	174.54	177.67	F	PhD	fg|s^tc	-1	0	Oh , yeah , and also related to the transcription stuff ,
Bmr026.F.dialogueact92	177.67	185.65	F	PhD	s	+1	2	so I 've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date f showing what the current status is of the trans of all the things we 've collected
Bmr026.F.dialogueact93	185.65	189.43	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and what stage each meeting is in , in terms of whether it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr026.A.dialogueact94	189.028	190.518	A	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Can you mail that out to the list ?
Bmr026.F.dialogueact95	190.52	191.26	F	PhD	s^aa^cc	-1	0	Mm - hmm , yeah I will .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact96	191.26	191.48	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	I {disfmarker}
Bmr026.F.dialogueact97	191.48	194.59	F	PhD	s	+1	2	That 's the thing that I sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages
Bmr026.A.dialogueact99	194.881	195.731	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK , OK .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact98	194.59	195.91	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and so that 's where I 'm putting it but I 'll {disfmarker}
Bmr026.F.dialogueact100	196.52	198.57	F	PhD	s^cc	+1	2	I 'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact101	198.462	199.462	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , I haven't done that .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact102	199.462	202.412	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So . I have lots of stuff to add that 's just in my own directory .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact103	201.24	201.42	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact104	202.572	203.292	A	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	I 'll try to get to that .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact105	206.858	207.038	A	Grad	s^bk^rt^tc	-1	0	OK .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact106	207.378	211.848	A	Grad	s	+1	2	So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval , but I don't really think there 's much to talk about .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact107	211.848	212.668	A	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	I 'm just gonna do it .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact108	213.448	216.678	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And uh , if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact109	217.68	218.64	B	Professor	qy^bu^d.%-	-1	0	You are going to {disfmarker}
Bmr026.A.dialogueact110	218.878	227.638	A	Grad	s^cc	+1	2	I 'm gonna send out to the participants , uh , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to {pause} suggest edits .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact111	228.198	229.108	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And then bleep them out .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact112	230.236	230.476	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact113	230.81	231.8	A	Grad	s	-1	0	For the ones that we have .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact114	233.095	233.565	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bmr026.C.dialogueact115	233.096	235.786	C	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	+1	2	So but it 's just transcripts , not the {disfmarker} not the audio ?
Bmr026.A.dialogueact116	235.955	237.985	A	Grad	s^ar|s	+1	2	Nope , they 'll have access to the audio also .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact117	236.409	237.979	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK , yeah , yep .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact118	238.659	238.809	C	PhD	h	-1	0	Ah .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact119	240.52	241.41	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean that 's my intention .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact121	241.41	243.66	A	Grad	s	+1	2	Because the transcripts might not be right .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact120	241.259	241.379	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact122	241.55	241.84	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr026.A.dialogueact124	244.1	245.58	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So you want people to be able to listen to them .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact123	244.063	244.213	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact125	245.77	249.91	F	PhD	qy^d^rt	+1	2	So , um the audio that they 're gonna have access to , will that be the uncompressed version ?
Bmr026.F.dialogueact126	249.91	252.84	F	PhD	qrr.%-	+1	2	Or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and {disfmarker}
Bmr026.A.dialogueact127	252.269	253.159	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Oh , that 's a good point .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact128	254.22	254.87	A	Grad	s^ba^r	-1	0	That 's a good point .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact129	254.95	263.53	A	Grad	h|s	+1	2	Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} it 's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because , uh , uh , it takes too long to do random access decompression .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact130	262.7	263.15	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact131	264.73	269.55	F	PhD	s.%-	+1	1	Yeah , I was just wondering because we 're uh running out of the un - backed - up disk space on
Bmr026.A.dialogueact132	268.867	269.767	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , that was the other point .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact133	270.17	270.74	F	PhD	qy^bu	-1	0	Oh , was that another one ?
Bmr026.A.dialogueact134	270.677	272.227	A	Grad	s^t	-1	0	Yep , that 's another agenda item .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact135	270.74	271.0	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact136	271.04	271.44	F	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	I 'll wait .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact137	273.128	273.718	A	Grad	h	-1	0	So , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr026.A.dialogueact138	275.76	277.55	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	But that is a good point so we 'll get to that , too .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact139	277.55	280.14	A	Grad	h|s	+1	2	Um , DARPA demo status , not much to say .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact140	280.14	282.11	A	Grad	s	+1	2	The back - end stuff is working out fine .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact141	282.25	283.63	A	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's more or less ready to go .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact142	283.63	290.2	A	Grad	s	+1	1	I 've added some stuff that uh indes indexes by the meeting type MR , EDU , et cetera
Bmr026.A.dialogueact143	290.2	291.77	A	Grad	s	+1	1	and also by the user ID .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact144	292.6	295.31	A	Grad	s	+1	1	So that the front - end can then do filtering based on that as well .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact145	295.89	303.05	A	Grad	fh|s	+1	2	Uh {disfmarker} The back - end is uh , going more slowly as I s I think I said before just cuz I 'm not much of a Tcl - TK programmer .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact146	303.5	306.63	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	And uh Dave Gelbart says he 's a little too busy .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact147	306.63	311.64	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So I think Don and I are gonna work on that and {disfmarker} and you and I can just talk about it off - line more .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact148	311.5	311.72	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact149	313.16	315.47	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	But uh {pause} the back - end was pretty smooth .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact150	314.247	314.687	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Oh
Bmr026.A.dialogueact151	315.47	317.02	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So I think , we 'll have something .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact152	317.58	321.87	A	Grad	s	-1	0	It may not be as {disfmarker} As pretty as we might like , but we 'll have something .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact153	321.926	324.316	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I wondered whe when we would reach Dave 's saturation point .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact154	324.316	326.546	B	Professor	s	-1	0	He 's sort of been {disfmarker} been volunteering for everything
Bmr026.A.dialogueact156	326.614	326.894	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact155	326.546	327.876	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	and {pause} and uh {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact157	327.032	327.622	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact158	329.597	329.987	B	Professor	s^fe^rt	-1	0	O K .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact159	329.987	331.037	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Finally said he was too busy .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact160	332.007	332.737	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I guess we reached it .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact161	333.206	336.096	A	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , he {disfmarker} he actually {disfmarker} he volunteered but then he s then he retracted it .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact162	336.096	336.406	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact163	336.826	337.216	A	Grad	s^bd	-1	0	Oh well .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact164	337.91	338.47	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bmr026.E.dialogueact165	339.56	344.885	E	Grad	fg|s^tc	+1	2	And , also um , I was just showing Andreas , I got um an X Waves kind of display ,
Bmr026.E.dialogueact166	344.885	346.795	E	Grad	s^no	+1	2	and I don't know how much more we can do with it {disfmarker}
Bmr026.E.dialogueact167	346.795	353.095	E	Grad	s	+1	2	with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom
Bmr026.A.dialogueact168	350.039	350.459	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Oh , cool .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact169	353.095	354.605	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so , right now it 's just an X Waves
Bmr026.E.dialogueact170	354.605	355.585	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and then you have three windows
Bmr026.E.dialogueact171	355.585	357.245	E	Grad	s	-1	0	but I don't know , it looked pretty nice
Bmr026.E.dialogueact172	357.245	360.53	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and I 'm sure it {disfmarker} think it has potential for a little something ,
Bmr026.A.dialogueact173	359.44	359.94	A	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	For a demo ?
Bmr026.E.dialogueact174	360.53	361.83	E	Grad	s^aa^r	-1	0	yeah , for a demo .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact175	361.05	361.63	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , sounds good .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact176	362.46	362.75	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact177	363.194	370.784	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	OK , so again , the issue is {disfmarker} For July , the issue 's gonna be what can we fit into a Windows machine , uh , and so on ,
Bmr026.B.dialogueact179	370.784	370.874	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bmr026.E.dialogueact178	370.39	370.67	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact180	371.5	371.79	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact181	372.013	373.253	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So it might just be slides .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact182	373.42	374.28	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , OK .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact184	374.789	375.989	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Well {disfmarker} {pause} Yeah .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact183	374.7	376.7	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	Well , we 'll see , um {disfmarker}
Bmr026.C.dialogueact185	377.059	379.859	C	PhD	s	+1	2	I 've been putting together uh Transcriber things for Windows
Bmr026.C.dialogueact186	379.859	380.469	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	so i
Bmr026.C.dialogueact187	380.649	384.559	C	PhD	s	-1	0	And I installed it on Dave Gelbart 's PC and it worked just fine .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact188	384.559	386.009	C	PhD	s	-1	0	So hopefully that will work .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact189	385.39	385.68	D	PhD	qy^bh	-1	0	Really ?
Bmr026.D.dialogueact190	385.68	386.2	D	PhD	qy^rt.%--	-1	0	So is that {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact191	386.886	388.156	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Because there 's some people um {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact192	388.73	392.27	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	It would be cool if we could uh get that to work uh at {disfmarker} at SRI
Bmr026.C.dialogueact193	391.122	391.242	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact195	392.449	392.609	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact194	392.27	394.25	D	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	because the um {disfmarker}
Bmr026.A.dialogueact197	395.1	400.656	A	Grad	s	+1	1	Well Transcriber is Tcl - TK , very generic with Snack ,
Bmr026.D.dialogueact196	395.07	398.03	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	we have m m We have more Windows machines to run the {disfmarker}
Bmr026.C.dialogueact198	399.409	399.549	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact199	400.746	403.756	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so basically anything you can get Snack to run on , it will work .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact200	400.88	401.45	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact201	401.623	401.853	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact202	403.1	403.16	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah
Bmr026.C.dialogueact203	403.16	409.6	C	PhD	s	+1	1	but {disfmarker} But the problem is the version Transcriber works with , the Snack version , is one point six whatever
Bmr026.C.dialogueact204	409.92	411.84	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and that 's not anymore supported .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact205	411.84	413.4	C	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's not on {disfmarker} on the web page anymore .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact206	413.78	416.74	C	PhD	s	-1	0	But I just wrote an email to {disfmarker} to the author of {disfmarker} to the Snack author
Bmr026.C.dialogueact207	416.74	419.64	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and he sent me to one point six whatever library
Bmr026.A.dialogueact209	419.887	422.757	A	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	Well I thought it was packaged with Transcriber ?
Bmr026.C.dialogueact208	419.64	420.59	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and so it works .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact210	422.575	422.875	C	PhD	s^aap	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr026.C.dialogueact211	422.925	425.045	C	PhD	s^arp	-1	0	but then you can't add our patches
Bmr026.C.dialogueact212	425.045	428.14	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and then the {disfmarker} the new version is {disfmarker} is totally different
Bmr026.A.dialogueact213	426.14	426.45	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact214	428.14	431.11	C	PhD	s	-1	0	a and in {disfmarker} yeah , in terms of {disfmarker} of the source code .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact216	431.471	431.751	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Ah .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact215	431.46	433.13	C	PhD	s	-1	0	You {disfmarker} you can't find the Tcl files anymore .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact217	433.13	435.55	C	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's some whatever wrapped thing
Bmr026.D.dialogueact218	434.115	434.485	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact219	435.55	437.12	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and you can't {disfmarker} you can't access that
Bmr026.C.dialogueact220	437.12	441.128	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so you have to install {disfmarker} First install Tcl then install Snack
Bmr026.C.dialogueact221	441.128	442.838	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and then install the Transcriber thing
Bmr026.C.dialogueact222	442.838	444.7	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and then do the patches .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact223	444.492	444.852	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Patch .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact225	444.992	445.232	A	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	Ugh !
Bmr026.D.dialogueact224	444.517	452.044	D	PhD	s^cs.%-	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I wonder if {disfmarker} if we should contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along {disfmarker}
Bmr026.C.dialogueact226	445.13	445.28	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact227	449.075	449.225	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact228	451.428	451.828	A	Grad	s	-1	0	We have {disfmarker}
Bmr026.A.dialogueact230	452.858	454.728	A	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah b it 's just hasn't made it into the release yet .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact229	452.454	452.774	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^m^rt	-1	0	We have ?
Bmr026.D.dialogueact231	452.974	453.214	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact232	454.58	455.13	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact233	455.63	460.911	F	PhD	qr^tc.%--	-1	0	So did you um put the uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the NT version out on the uh Meeting Recorder page ? Or {disfmarker}
Bmr026.C.dialogueact234	461.2	462.23	C	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No , I haven't done that yet .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact235	462.51	463.12	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	I 'm {disfmarker}
Bmr026.C.dialogueact236	463.12	463.91	C	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	oh Nope .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact237	464.49	465.7	C	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	But I definitely will do that .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact238	466.448	470.078	B	Professor	qy^tc	-1	0	So , can some of the stuff that Don 's talking about somehow fit into this
Bmr026.B.dialogueact239	471.257	474.837	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Uh , mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with the {disfmarker}
Bmr026.E.dialogueact240	474.25	474.49	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact242	476.05	476.44	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr026.E.dialogueact241	475.83	478.95	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , it 's basically ASCII files or binary files , whatever representation .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact243	479.37	480.16	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	Just three different {disfmarker}
Bmr026.E.dialogueact244	480.28	484.956	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	It 's a waveform and just a stylized pitch vector basically so it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact246	485.924	487.884	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker}
Bmr026.E.dialogueact245	485.676	489.396	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean we could do it in Matl - {comment} I mean you could do it in a number of different places I 'm sure .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact247	489.072	503.97	D	PhD	s^cs	+1	4	But {disfmarker} But it would be cool if the Transcriber interface had like another window for the {disfmarker} you know , maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is {disfmarker} that is you know time synchron ti ti time synchronous with the wavform .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact248	491.522	491.702	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact249	495.65	495.9	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact251	499.291	499.641	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact250	499.23	500.06	E	Grad	s^aa^ba	-1	0	Yeah , that 'd be very cool .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact252	500.357	501.867	A	Grad	s	-1	0	It 'd be easy enough to add that .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact253	501.867	505.577	A	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	Again it 's {disfmarker} it 's {pause} It 's more Tcl - T
Bmr026.E.dialogueact254	504.13	504.31	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact255	505.577	508.137	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So someone who 's familiar with Tcl - TK has to do it ,
Bmr026.D.dialogueact256	505.827	506.447	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact258	508.257	509.747	A	Grad	s	-1	0	but uh , it wouldn't be hard to do .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact257	507.784	508.164	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact259	510.29	512.7	D	PhD	s	-1	0	But it would almost be like having another waveform displayed .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact261	512.876	513.066	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact263	513.074	513.264	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact262	512.89	513.24	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	S
Bmr026.E.dialogueact260	512.77	513.09	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact264	513.38	513.61	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact265	515.485	515.625	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact266	516.295	517.905	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Yeah , maybe we could l look into that .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact267	518.01	518.2	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact268	518.689	520.577	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	But it {disfmarker} it seems to me that I c
Bmr026.C.dialogueact269	518.815	519.045	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bmr026.A.dialogueact270	521.21	524.29	A	Grad	s	-1	0	It doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact271	524.29	526.63	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So yo It seems to me you could do images .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact272	527.56	529.94	E	Grad	h|qw	-1	0	Um {pause} What do you mean by real time ?
Bmr026.E.dialogueact273	529.94	531.09	E	Grad	qy.%-	-1	0	Do you mean like {disfmarker}
Bmr026.F.dialogueact274	530.71	533.14	F	PhD	s^bu^rt	-1	0	Like being able to scroll through it and stuff for the demo .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact275	532.58	532.88	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact277	534.22	534.94	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , jus Yeah .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact276	534.19	534.71	F	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Is that what you mean ?
Bmr026.A.dialogueact279	535.01	535.8	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	It just seems to me jus
Bmr026.E.dialogueact280	535.24	536.65	E	Grad	s.x	-1	0	It would be cool to see it {disfmarker}
Bmr026.F.dialogueact278	534.97	535.13	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact281	536.65	540.32	E	Grad	s	-1	0	It would be cool like to see {disfmarker} to hear it and see it ,
Bmr026.C.dialogueact282	539.016	539.956	C	PhD	s^2	-1	0	And to hear it .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact283	539.956	540.236	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact285	540.676	540.836	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact284	540.42	542.04	E	Grad	s	+1	4	and see the pitch contours also .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact287	542.578	546.808	A	Grad	s^aap|s^nd	-1	0	Sure , but I don't think {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} You can do all that just statically in
Bmr026.C.dialogueact286	542.155	542.325	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact288	542.63	543.62	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	I think it would lose {disfmarker}
Bmr026.E.dialogueact289	547.35	548.34	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	Yeah , I mean y
Bmr026.A.dialogueact290	548.043	550.853	A	Grad	s.%-	+1	4	Just record the audio clip and show an image and I think that 's {disfmarker}
Bmr026.E.dialogueact291	548.72	549.82	E	Grad	fg	-1	0	Right , right .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact292	550.36	556.57	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	I just thought if you meant slides I thought you meant like just {pause} like {pause} um view graphs or something .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact293	556.486	557.086	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	You know , wh
Bmr026.B.dialogueact294	557.086	557.406	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact295	557.406	558.326	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	So . Uh ,
Bmr026.B.dialogueact296	558.326	559.646	B	Professor	s	-1	0	no , we 're talking about on the computer
Bmr026.B.dialogueact298	559.886	565.476	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and um , I think when we were talking about this before we had littl this little demo meeting ,
Bmr026.E.dialogueact297	559.81	560.08	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact299	566.046	570.376	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have
Bmr026.B.dialogueact300	570.986	577.156	B	Professor	s	+1	4	and , {vocalsound} the more live , the better , but uh , given the crunch of time , we may have to retreat from it to some extent .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact301	577.156	585.566	B	Professor	s	+1	4	So I think {disfmarker} {pause} For a lot of reasons , I think it would be very nice to have this Transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it
Bmr026.D.dialogueact302	583.848	584.328	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact303	585.626	587.396	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so it 'd be a good thing to get in there .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact304	587.686	587.886	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	But ,
Bmr026.B.dialogueact305	588.776	595.025	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um {disfmarker} Anyway , jus just looking for ways that we could actually show what you 're doing , uh , in {disfmarker} {pause} to people .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact306	593.15	593.46	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact307	596.029	603.479	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Cuz a lot of this stuff , particularly for Communicator , uh certainly a significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about th originally had t had to do with prosodics
Bmr026.B.dialogueact308	604.294	607.473	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It 'd be nice to show that we can actually get them and see them .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact310	606.163	606.573	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact309	605.799	606.579	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact311	612.03	615.56	A	Grad	s^tc	+1	1	And the last i item on the agenda is disk issues yet again .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact312	615.56	617.83	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So , we 're doing OK on backed up .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact313	617.88	621.66	A	Grad	s	+1	2	We 're {disfmarker} We 're only about thirty percent on the second disk .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact314	622.35	626.36	A	Grad	s	+1	1	So , uh , we have a little bit of time before that becomes critical ,
Bmr026.A.dialogueact315	626.36	632.05	A	Grad	s	+1	2	but we are like ninety five percent , ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact316	632.362	632.512	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact317	633.17	637.73	A	Grad	s^rt	+1	1	And , my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space ,
Bmr026.A.dialogueact318	637.73	644.55	A	Grad	s	+1	1	but unfortunately we 're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data {pause} all at once , in a lot of different ways .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact319	644.669	644.889	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact320	644.68	646.04	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Oh there 's a lot of transcribers , too .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact321	646.305	647.355	A	Grad	s^bk|s^m	-1	0	Yeah , there 're a lot of transcribers ,
Bmr026.C.dialogueact322	646.545	646.735	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact323	647.355	649.085	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	so all of those need to be expanded ,
Bmr026.A.dialogueact325	649.085	657.07	A	Grad	s^rt^t	-1	0	and then people are doing chunking and I want to do uh , uh , uh , the permission forms ,
Bmr026.F.dialogueact324	648.968	649.398	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.C.dialogueact326	650.153	650.473	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	An
Bmr026.F.dialogueact327	653.47	653.74	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact328	657.07	660.29	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so I want those to be live , so there 's a lot of data that has to be around .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact329	661.19	665.83	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	Um {disfmarker} And Jane was gonna talk to , uh , Dave Johnson about it .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact330	665.83	668.49	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	One of the things I was thinking is we {disfmarker} we just got these hundred {disfmarker}
Bmr026.A.dialogueact331	668.68	669.3	A	Grad	s^fa	-1	0	alright , excuse me {disfmarker}
Bmr026.A.dialogueact332	669.3	674.8	A	Grad	s	-1	0	ten , uh SPARC - Blade SUN - Blades .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact333	672.802	673.372	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Did they come in ?
Bmr026.F.dialogueact334	673.65	674.08	F	PhD	s^r	-1	0	SUN - Blades .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact336	674.272	674.602	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact335	674.08	674.23	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact337	674.38	675.13	F	PhD	s	-1	0	They came in the other day .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact338	674.92	676.53	A	Grad	s^r	-1	0	They came in but they 're not set up yet .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact339	675.55	675.8	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact340	676.53	681.6	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	And so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those {pause} because they 'll be in the machine room ,
Bmr026.A.dialogueact341	681.6	684.44	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	they 'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact342	684.91	688.08	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And if we just need un - backed - up space , we could just hang disks off them .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact343	688.26	689.47	F	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	Well , is there {disfmarker}
Bmr026.F.dialogueact344	689.47	690.92	F	PhD	qw^cs^nd	-1	0	Why not just hang them off of Abbott ,
Bmr026.F.dialogueact345	690.92	691.41	F	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	is there a {disfmarker}
Bmr026.A.dialogueact347	691.65	694.35	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Because there 's no more room in the disk racks on Abbott .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact346	691.502	691.752	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact348	693.0	693.38	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Ah .

Bmr026.F.dialogueact349	694.72	695.41	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Ah , I see .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact351	695.901	697.591	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	Well , maybe it should get another rack .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact352	696.68	698.6	D	PhD	s	-1	0	But you still need to store the disks somehow .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact353	699.69	702.05	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , but the SUN - Blades have spare drive bays .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact354	699.785	700.045	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr026.A.dialogueact356	703.96	704.68	A	Grad	s^co	-1	0	Just put them in .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact355	703.72	704.9	F	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	You can put two {disfmarker}

Bmr026.D.dialogueact362	709.106	709.336	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact364	711.96	715.88	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So you can just go out and buy a PC hard drive and stick it in .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact365	714.66	715.1	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact366	716.148	724.368	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	But if Abbott is going to be our disk server it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} file server {comment} it seems like we would want to get it , uh , a second disk rack or something .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact367	725.6	728.34	D	PhD	s^e^rt	-1	0	Plus we 're talking about buying a second dis uh , file server .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact368	729.55	731.41	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Well , I mean there are lots of long term solutions .

Bmr026.B.dialogueact502	904.745	907.365	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well I mean it 's {disfmarker} the they really are cheap .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact503	907.655	910.685	B	Professor	s	+1	4	I mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them ,

Bmr026.F.dialogueact504	909.78	910.16	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact506	910.685	915.206	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but But uh , we could {disfmarker} You know , if you want to get four disks , get four disks .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact507	915.206	919.196	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's small {disfmarker} I mean these things ar are just a few hundred dollars .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact508	919.57	919.74	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact509	919.74	924.9	F	PhD	s	+1	1	Well I sent that message out to , I guess , you and Dave asking for {disfmarker} if we could get some disk .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact510	922.511	922.821	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact511	924.9	927.66	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I s I sent this out a {disfmarker} a day ago
Bmr026.A.dialogueact512	925.467	926.257	A	Grad	qw	-1	0	And put it where ?
Bmr026.B.dialogueact513	925.799	926.059	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact514	927.66	932.066	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but {disfmarker} and Dave didn't respond so I don I don't know how the whole process works .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact515	932.066	934.926	F	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	I mean does he just go out and get them and {disfmarker} if it 's OK , and {disfmarker}
Bmr026.A.dialogueact516	934.17	934.31	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact517	935.81	937.79	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So I was assuming he was gonna take over {pause} that .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact518	937.79	939.82	F	PhD	s	-1	0	But he 's probably too busy given that he 's leaving .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact519	939.774	941.814	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Yeah , I think you need a direct conversation with him .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact520	941.994	944.934	B	Professor	s^cs:qw	-1	0	And just {vocalsound} say an - e just ask him that , you know , wha what should you do .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact521	945.474	947.964	B	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	And in my answer back was " are you sure you just want one ? "
Bmr026.B.dialogueact522	948.124	955.854	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So I mean I think {pause} that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure " well , here 's what we pi figure on doing for the next few months " .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact523	948.473	948.663	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact524	955.252	956.642	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Wa - a I know what they want .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact525	956.842	960.632	A	Grad	s	+1	1	The sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact527	961.082	963.312	A	Grad	s	+1	1	So they don't want to stack up external drives .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact526	961.035	961.325	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact528	963.97	966.53	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	Um {disfmarker} {pause} And then they want everything else in the machine room .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact529	967.629	967.849	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact530	968.9	970.46	A	Grad	qw	-1	0	So the question is where are you gonna hang them ?
Bmr026.F.dialogueact531	971.154	971.694	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact532	972.22	974.46	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I don't know what the space situation is in the machine room .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact533	974.792	975.042	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact534	975.718	976.028	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	So .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact535	978.038	978.258	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact536	978.258	981.158	B	Professor	s	+1	4	So this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave ,
Bmr026.D.dialogueact537	978.334	978.734	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	Th - The {disfmarker}
Bmr026.F.dialogueact538	980.32	986.25	F	PhD	s	+1	1	I think part of the reason why Dave can't get the {disfmarker} the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine room right now .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact539	981.218	981.588	B	Professor	s^df.%-	-1	0	cuz it {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact540	982.78	983.02	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	One {disfmarker}

Bmr026.F.dialogueact544	986.25	987.62	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So he has to re - arrange a bunch of stuff .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact545	992.718	997.18	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I bet there are still some old , uh , like , nine gig disks , uh , around
Bmr026.D.dialogueact546	997.18	999.66	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks
Bmr026.D.dialogueact547	999.66	1001.77	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and you know recover the space .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact548	1001.82	1002.05	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact549	1002.68	1002.77	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact550	1002.77	1002.9	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	No .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact551	1002.9	1005.08	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I think Dave {disfmarker} Dave knows all these things , of course .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact553	1005.08	1012.27	B	Professor	s	-1	0	An - and so , he always has a a lot of plans of things that he 's gonna do to make things better in many ways an and runs out of time .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact552	1004.82	1005.09	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact554	1010.29	1010.75	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact555	1010.79	1015.1	A	Grad	s	-1	0	But I {disfmarker} I know that {pause} generally their first priority has been for backed up disk .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact556	1015.1	1022.6	A	Grad	s	+1	1	And so I think what he 's been concentrating on is uh the back {disfmarker} the {pause} back up system , rather than on new disk .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact557	1017.85	1018.2	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .

Bmr026.A.dialogueact562	1026.25	1026.52	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	Which {disfmarker}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact560	1025.84	1026.14	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Well .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact561	1026.14	1026.29	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact563	1026.29	1028.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But this {disfmarker} this is a very specific question for me .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact564	1028.29	1032.22	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Basically , we can easily get {pause} one to four disks ,
Bmr026.B.dialogueact565	1032.22	1034.5	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean you just go out and get four and we 've got the money for it ,
Bmr026.B.dialogueact566	1034.5	1035.31	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it 's no big deal .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact567	1035.95	1037.77	B	Professor	fh|qo	-1	0	Uh , but the question is where they go ,
Bmr026.B.dialogueact568	1038.08	1039.28	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and I don't think we can solve that here ,
Bmr026.B.dialogueact570	1039.28	1040.12	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	you just have to ask him .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact569	1039.17	1041.77	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Maybe we can put some disks in the {disfmarker} in that back room there .

Bmr026.C.dialogueact582	1055.15	1055.74	C	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's not bad .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact583	1056.28	1060.24	A	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's behind lots of fire walls that don't allow any services through except S S
Bmr026.D.dialogueact584	1058.78	1061.19	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Oh because it 's {disfmarker} because it 's an ACIRI machine ?
Bmr026.A.dialogueact585	1060.85	1061.11	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact587	1061.29	1061.57	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr026.A.dialogueact588	1062.34	1065.02	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And also on the list is to get it into the normal ICSI net ,
Bmr026.A.dialogueact589	1065.1	1067.54	A	Grad	qh	-1	0	but Who knows when that will happen ?
Bmr026.D.dialogueact591	1068.08	1069.19	D	PhD	s	-1	0	But that can't be that hard .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact590	1067.66	1070.44	F	PhD	s	-1	0	That might be a good short term solution , though .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact592	1069.19	1069.48	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	I mean {disfmarker}
Bmr026.A.dialogueact593	1070.02	1077.59	A	Grad	s	-1	0	No , the {disfmarker} the problem with that apparently is that they don't currently have a wire running to that back room {pause} that goes anywhere near one of the ICSI routers .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact594	1078.06	1078.55	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	Oh ,
Bmr026.A.dialogueact595	1078.79	1081.4	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So , they actually have to run a wire somewhere .

Bmr026.B.dialogueact597	1082.87	1086.7	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah , e again , you know , any one of these things is certainly not a big deal .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact598	1086.7	1093.44	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	If there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} jus every ever everybody {disfmarker} everybody has a {disfmarker} has {disfmarker}
Bmr026.A.dialogueact599	1090.78	1092.13	A	Grad	s^arp	-1	0	But Dave has to do all of them .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact600	1093.8	1096.34	B	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	Well all of us have long lists of different things we 're doing .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact601	1097.29	1101.06	B	Professor	s	+1	5	But at any rate I think that there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need
Bmr026.B.dialogueact602	1101.06	1103.17	B	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	and I think we need a {disfmarker} a conversation with {disfmarker}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact603	1103.96	1109.49	B	Professor	fh|s^cs.x	-1	0	Uh , maybe {disfmarker} maybe after {disfmarker} after tea or something you and I can go down and {disfmarker} and talk to him about it

Bmr026.D.dialogueact717	1378.02	1378.89	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	We could do that , yeah .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact718	1378.83	1379.06	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact719	1379.91	1382.81	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Personally I 'd {disfmarker} I 'm not in favor of more meetings .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact720	1383.0	1384.87	D	PhD	fh|s.%-	-1	0	Um . {vocalsound} Because , uh .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact721	1383.78	1384.12	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact723	1385.17	1385.5	A	Grad	s^j^nd	-1	0	I am .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact722	1385.09	1385.39	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	You know .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact724	1385.81	1386.48	A	Grad	s^fa.%-	-1	0	Oh sor
Bmr026.F.dialogueact725	1386.2	1391.17	F	PhD	s	+1	2	But I do I don't {disfmarker} I mean a lot of times lately it seems like we don't really have enough for a full meeting on Meeting Recorder .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact726	1391.32	1391.56	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact728	1391.83	1394.32	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , except that we keep going for our full time .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact727	1391.66	1392.41	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So if we did that {disfmarker}
Bmr026.C.dialogueact729	1394.11	1394.3	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact730	1394.24	1396.0	F	PhD	fg|s^ng	-1	0	Well , cuz we get into these other topics .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact733	1395.8	1396.02	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact732	1395.6	1397.71	D	PhD	s	-1	0	We feel {disfmarker} We feel obligated to collect more data .
Bmr026.E.dialogueact731	1395.51	1395.73	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact735	1398.04	1398.12	A	Grad	x	-1	0	Ugh .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact734	1397.86	1397.97	F	PhD	x	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact737	1399.18	1399.54	A	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	I don't .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact736	1398.83	1401.09	F	PhD	s^cs.%-	-1	0	So if we could alternate the focus of the meeting {disfmarker}
Bmr026.A.dialogueact738	1399.54	1400.56	A	Grad	s^co^t1	-1	0	Let 's read digits and go .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact739	1401.53	1402.72	B	Professor	qw^cs	-1	0	Why don't we just start with that .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact740	1401.76	1405.17	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	ummh . {comment} ummh . {comment} OK .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact741	1402.85	1409.48	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	2	And then if we find , you know we 're just not getting enough done , there 's all these topics not coming up , then we can expand into another meeting .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact742	1407.34	1407.84	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact743	1409.48	1411.08	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	But I {disfmarker} I think that 's a great idea .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact744	1411.63	1420.29	B	Professor	fh|s^cs.%--	+1	3	Uh . So uh . Um . Let 's chat about it with Liz and Jane {pause} when we get a chance , see what they think and {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact745	1418.84	1419.35	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact746	1420.12	1420.67	F	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah that would be good .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact747	1420.67	1423.72	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean Andreas and I have various talks in the halls
Bmr026.D.dialogueact749	1423.96	1425.05	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact748	1423.72	1430.4	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and there 's lots of things , you know , details and stuff that would I think people 'd be interested in
Bmr026.F.dialogueact750	1430.4	1432.7	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and I 'd {disfmarker} you know , where do we go from here kind of things and {disfmarker}
Bmr026.F.dialogueact751	1433.7	1434.43	F	PhD	s^r^rt	-1	0	So , it would be good .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact752	1435.58	1442.2	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Yeah , and you 're {disfmarker} you 're attending {pause} the uh {disfmarker} the front - end meeting as well as the others so you have {disfmarker} you have probably one of the best {disfmarker}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact753	1442.49	1447.13	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you and I , I guess are the main ones who sort of see the bridge between the two .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact754	1445.23	1445.61	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Bridge .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact755	1445.46	1445.85	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact756	1447.13	1448.84	B	Professor	s	-1	0	We are doing recognition in both of them .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact757	1448.9	1449.06	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact758	1449.23	1449.79	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact759	1449.73	1449.87	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact760	1450.87	1451.16	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact762	1452.25	1452.48	A	Grad	b	-1	0	OK ?
Bmr026.D.dialogueact761	1452.15	1452.74	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	So um .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact763	1453.78	1457.2	D	PhD	s^cs^tc	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so we could talk a little bit about that now if {disfmarker} if there 's some time .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact764	1456.79	1458.27	A	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	No , no that would be for next week .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact765	1460.2	1463.67	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Um I jus So the latest result was that um
Bmr026.D.dialogueact766	1464.77	1478.67	D	PhD	fh|s	+1	2	um yot I tested the uh {disfmarker} the sort of final version of the PLP configuration um on development test data for {disfmarker} for this year 's Hub - five test set .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact767	1478.32	1478.85	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact768	1479.43	1491.08	D	PhD	s	+1	2	And the recognition performance was exactly , and I mean exactly up to the {disfmarker} you know , the first decimal , same as with the uh Mel Cepstra front - end .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact769	1490.64	1490.74	A	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact770	1491.43	1492.6	F	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	For both females and males ?
Bmr026.D.dialogueact771	1492.97	1493.27	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact773	1494.07	1495.94	D	PhD	s^bd.%--	-1	0	Uh , well i there was a little bit of a {disfmarker}
Bmr026.F.dialogueact772	1493.7	1493.96	F	PhD	s^bk^fe	-1	0	Oh !
Bmr026.D.dialogueact774	1498.11	1498.7	D	PhD	s	-1	0	i overall .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact775	1498.87	1503.79	D	PhD	s	+1	2	They {disfmarker} They were {disfmarker} The males I think were slightly better and the females were slightly worse but nothing really .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact776	1499.16	1499.71	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact778	1504.02	1504.32	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact777	1503.79	1505.09	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean definitely not significant .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact779	1504.44	1505.08	F	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact780	1505.85	1511.74	D	PhD	s	+1	2	And then the really nice thing was that if {disfmarker} if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half percent improvement .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact781	1511.45	1511.7	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Wow .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact783	1512.79	1513.46	A	Grad	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	Just with ROVER ?
Bmr026.D.dialogueact782	1512.36	1512.79	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	So .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact784	1514.24	1514.38	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	t
Bmr026.D.dialogueact785	1514.38	1518.6	D	PhD	s	-1	0	With N - best ROVER , which is like our {vocalsound} new and improved version of ROVER .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact786	1518.2	1518.44	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact787	1518.79	1524.25	D	PhD	s	+1	1	Which u actually uses the whole N - best list from both systems {pause} to {pause} mmm , uh {pause} c combine that .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact788	1524.81	1533.57	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So except {disfmarker} I mean the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end which is the auto - regressive versus the cepstral truncation .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact789	1531.97	1532.29	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact790	1533.98	1534.5	B	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact791	1534.15	1535.47	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	And , the {disfmarker}
Bmr026.F.dialogueact792	1535.08	1535.91	F	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	But a percent and a half ?
Bmr026.A.dialogueact794	1536.15	1537.82	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Yeah , it 's pretty {pause} impressive .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact793	1535.91	1536.31	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact795	1536.96	1545.56	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And {disfmarker} And so uh after I told the {disfmarker} my uh colleagues at SRI about that , you know , now they definitely want to , you know , uh , have a {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact796	1545.56	1551.07	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Next time we have an evaluation they want to do uh , you know , basically a at least the system combination .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact797	1551.73	1553.9	D	PhD	fh|qh	-1	0	Um , and , you know , why not ?
Bmr026.B.dialogueact798	1554.35	1554.9	B	Professor	s^aa|qh^m	-1	0	Sure , why not ?
Bmr026.D.dialogueact799	1554.59	1556.38	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh . {vocalsound} So .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact800	1555.9	1557.77	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	We clearly gotta add a few more features , though .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact801	1559.59	1560.69	D	PhD	h|qw^bu	-1	0	Uh w what do you mean ?
Bmr026.D.dialogueact802	1560.69	1564.92	D	PhD	qr	-1	0	More features in the sense of front - end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles ?
Bmr026.A.dialogueact803	1564.92	1566.48	A	Grad	s	-1	0	No , uh front - end features .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact804	1566.86	1569.67	A	Grad	s	-1	0	You know we did PLP and Mel Cepstra .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact805	1569.67	1572.56	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	Let 's , you know , try RASTA and MSG , and {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact806	1570.36	1570.87	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Oh I mean {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact807	1570.87	1571.34	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact808	1571.34	1571.74	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	Well
Bmr026.D.dialogueact809	1572.5	1572.8	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact810	1572.8	1573.59	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So , we cou
Bmr026.D.dialogueact811	1573.59	1573.87	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact812	1574.07	1575.54	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the the {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact813	1575.73	1580.17	D	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	There 's one thing uh {disfmarker} I mean you don't want to overdo it because y every front - end {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact814	1580.34	1586.13	D	PhD	s	+1	1	You know , if you {disfmarker} you know you basically multiply your effort by N , where N is a number of different systems
Bmr026.F.dialogueact815	1580.71	1580.86	F	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact816	1586.05	1586.62	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact817	1586.13	1587.5	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker} Um .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact818	1587.62	1598.49	D	PhD	s	-1	0	So . So one {disfmarker} one compromise would be to {disfmarker} only to have the {disfmarker} everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system
Bmr026.D.dialogueact819	1598.49	1602.99	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and then after that you rescore your lattices with the multiple systems
Bmr026.D.dialogueact820	1602.99	1607.45	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and combine the results and that 's a fairly painless um thing .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact821	1604.67	1605.04	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact822	1607.18	1607.61	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	An
Bmr026.D.dialogueact824	1608.17	1608.3	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact823	1607.76	1609.97	F	PhD	qy^rt.%--	-1	0	Do you think we 'd still get the one and a half uh {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact825	1610.06	1610.84	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I think so .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact826	1611.33	1611.6	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact827	1612.06	1614.75	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower
Bmr026.D.dialogueact828	1614.75	1615.35	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and so if {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact830	1615.73	1619.08	D	PhD	s	-1	0	You know , maybe it 's only one percent or something but that would still be worthwhile doing .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact829	1615.63	1616.16	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact831	1619.83	1620.19	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact832	1621.4	1625.73	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Um {pause} Jus - You know , just wanted to let you know that that 's working out very nicely .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact833	1624.56	1624.74	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Cool .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact834	1627.49	1633.04	D	PhD	s^tc.%--	+1	2	And then we had some results on {pause} digits , uh , with um {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact835	1633.25	1633.7	D	PhD	%--	-1	0	We {disfmarker} We {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact836	1634.0	1641.69	D	PhD	s	-1	0	So this was uh really {comment} {disfmarker} really sort of just to get Dave going with his um experiments .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact837	1641.79	1642.16	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact838	1642.1	1643.78	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And so , uh .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact839	1643.78	1650.36	D	PhD	s	-1	0	But as a result , um , you know , we were sort of wondering why is the Hub - five system doing so well on the digits .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact841	1650.54	1650.76	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact840	1650.36	1654.44	D	PhD	s	+1	2	And the reason is basically there 's a whole bunch of read speech data in the Hub - five training set .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact842	1653.13	1653.41	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact843	1654.57	1656.09	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Including digits I gather , yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact844	1654.91	1655.37	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	And you c
Bmr026.D.dialogueact845	1655.96	1656.17	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact846	1656.23	1656.67	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Not all of {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact847	1656.78	1660.33	D	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	No it 's actually , digits is only a maybe a fifth of it .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact849	1660.93	1662.19	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	A fifth of it is how much ?
Bmr026.D.dialogueact848	1660.6	1666.76	D	PhD	s	+1	1	The rest is {disfmarker} is read {disfmarker} is read TIMIT data and uh ATIS data and Wall Street Journal and stuff like that .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact850	1666.33	1666.61	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact851	1666.61	1668.08	B	Professor	qw^r	-1	0	But a fi a fifth is how much ?
Bmr026.D.dialogueact852	1672.96	1679.73	D	PhD	s	+1	1	A fifth would be maybe uh two hours something .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact853	1679.18	1682.75	B	Professor	s	+1	0	Yeah , so I mean that 's actually not that different from the {pause} amount of training that there was .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact854	1681.32	1681.61	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact856	1682.75	1682.96	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact855	1682.56	1684.61	D	PhD	s	+1	1	But it definitely helps to have the other read data in there
Bmr026.B.dialogueact858	1685.31	1685.57	B	Professor	qy^bh^d	-1	0	Oh yeah
Bmr026.D.dialogueact857	1685.18	1686.39	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	because we 're doing {disfmarker}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact859	1685.81	1686.25	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	w
Bmr026.D.dialogueact860	1687.21	1692.13	D	PhD	s	+1	1	You know the error rate is half of what you do if you train only on ti uh TIMIT {disfmarker} {comment} uh not TIMIT uh TI - digits ,
Bmr026.B.dialogueact861	1692.53	1693.02	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact862	1692.69	1693.37	D	PhD	qw	-1	0	which is only what
Bmr026.D.dialogueact863	1693.37	1694.61	D	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	two hours something ?
Bmr026.B.dialogueact864	1694.48	1694.67	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact865	1694.99	1695.37	A	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I don't know .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact866	1695.71	1699.38	D	PhD	s	+1	1	So . Uh , more read speech data definitely helps .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact867	1699.38	1703.3	D	PhD	s	+1	1	And you can leave out all the conversational data with no performance penalty .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact869	1703.39	1704.57	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah that was the interesting thing .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact868	1703.38	1704.21	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	That 's e
Bmr026.B.dialogueact871	1704.57	1708.64	B	Professor	s	+1	1	Because {disfmarker} because uh , it was apparent if you put in a bunch more data it would be better ,
Bmr026.D.dialogueact870	1704.33	1704.78	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	That was e
Bmr026.D.dialogueact872	1704.78	1705.48	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right , right .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact873	1708.64	1709.5	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but uh .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact874	1709.04	1709.67	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact875	1709.14	1711.37	F	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Well is there even more read speech data around ?
Bmr026.D.dialogueact876	1711.6	1711.94	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact877	1711.94	1718.31	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	So we only {disfmarker} for the Hub - five training , we 're only using uh a fairly small subset of the Macrophone {pause} database .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact878	1717.49	1717.85	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact879	1718.98	1722.52	D	PhD	fh|s^cs	-1	0	Um , so , you could beef that up and probably do even better .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact880	1722.44	1730.98	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	I could also put in {pause} uh focus condition zero from Hub - four from Broadcast News , which is mostly prepared speech .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact881	1722.58	1723.02	F	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact882	1731.7	1734.2	A	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's not exactly read speech but it 's pretty darn close .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact883	1731.91	1732.23	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact884	1733.3	1733.62	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact885	1734.32	1734.64	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact886	1735.42	1736.84	D	PhD	s	+1	1	Well , I mean that 's plenty of read speech data .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact887	1736.84	1739.82	D	PhD	s	+1	1	I mean , Wall Street Journal , {pause} uh , take one example .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact888	1738.06	1738.27	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact889	1738.57	1739.05	A	Grad	b	-1	0	That 's right .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact890	1740.61	1741.64	D	PhD	%--	-1	0	But um .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact891	1742.32	1749.7	D	PhD	s	+1	1	So , you know that might be useful for the people who train the {disfmarker} the digit recognizers to {disfmarker} to use uh something other than TI - digits .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact892	1747.71	1747.96	A	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact893	1750.64	1751.72	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well they been using TIMIT .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact894	1752.28	1752.55	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact895	1752.92	1753.16	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	That {disfmarker}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact896	1753.16	1761.04	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh . {pause} They {disfmarker} they uh {disfmarker} they experimented for a while with a bunch of different databases with French and Spanish and so forth cuz they 're multilingual tests
Bmr026.D.dialogueact897	1759.21	1759.85	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact898	1761.22	1766.45	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and uh , um , {disfmarker} and actually the best results they got wa were uh using TIMIT .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact899	1767.12	1767.36	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact900	1767.71	1771.45	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker} But uh {disfmarker} which {disfmarker} So that 's what they 're {disfmarker} they 're using now .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact901	1770.36	1770.95	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact902	1771.45	1774.6	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but yeah certainly if we , um {disfmarker}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact903	1775.42	1778.95	B	Professor	s	-1	0	If we knew what the structure of what we 're doing there was .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact904	1778.95	1783.37	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean there 's still a bunch of messing around with different kinds of uh noise robustness algorithms .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact905	1779.09	1779.56	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact907	1783.37	1786.99	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So we don't know exactly which combination we 're gonna be going with .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact906	1783.02	1783.47	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact908	1787.61	1793.26	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Once we know , then {disfmarker} the trainable parts of it {disfmarker} it 'd be great to run lots of {disfmarker} lots of stuff through .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact909	1792.34	1792.87	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact910	1793.57	1793.75	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact911	1795.58	1796.08	D	PhD	s^tc	-1	0	Well , that was that .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact912	1796.08	1801.81	D	PhD	s^tc	+1	2	And then I th guess Chuck and I had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem uh system
Bmr026.D.dialogueact913	1801.81	1805.59	D	PhD	qy^cs^d	-1	0	and {disfmarker} You wanna {disfmarker} {vocalsound} You wanna see where that stands ?
Bmr026.F.dialogueact914	1804.45	1805.1	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Well , I 'm {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact916	1805.58	1805.95	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	
Bmr026.F.dialogueact915	1805.47	1811.07	F	PhD	s	+1	1	Yeah , so Andreas uh brought over the uh alignments that the SRI system uses .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact917	1811.52	1821.03	F	PhD	s	+1	1	And so I 'm in the process of um converting those alignments into uh label files that we can use to train uh a new net with .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact918	1821.63	1823.21	F	PhD	s	+1	1	And uh so then I 'll train the net .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact919	1823.28	1823.81	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	And .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact920	1824.22	1828.55	D	PhD	s	-1	0	An - And one side effect of that would be that it 's {disfmarker} um that the phone set would change .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact922	1829.17	1833.71	D	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	So the MLP would be trained on I think only forty - six or forty - eight {disfmarker}
Bmr026.F.dialogueact921	1828.92	1829.1	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact923	1833.19	1833.43	F	PhD	s^bc	-1	0	Eight .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact924	1833.71	1834.41	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	forty - eight phones ?
Bmr026.F.dialogueact925	1834.25	1834.58	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact926	1835.59	1841.66	D	PhD	s	+1	1	Uh which is smaller than the um than the phone set that {disfmarker} that we 've been using so far .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact927	1842.26	1842.49	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact928	1842.51	1844.63	D	PhD	s	-1	0	And that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that will probably help , actually ,
Bmr026.F.dialogueact929	1842.64	1843.46	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So it 's a little different ?
Bmr026.D.dialogueact930	1844.63	1853.35	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	because um the fewer dimensions uh e the less trouble probably with the {disfmarker} as far as just the um , um {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact931	1854.45	1854.73	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Just {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact932	1854.73	1858.12	D	PhD	s	+1	1	You know we want to try things like deltas on the tandem features .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact933	1858.12	1861.1	D	PhD	s	+1	1	And so you h have to multiply everything by two or three .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact934	1861.1	1867.45	D	PhD	s	+1	1	And so , you know , fewer dimensions in the {pause} phone set would be actually helpful just from a logistics point of view .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact935	1867.67	1867.96	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Sure .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact936	1867.96	1872.54	B	Professor	s.%-	+1	1	Although we {disfmarker} I mean , it 's not that many fewer and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and we take a KLT anyway so we could {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact937	1870.32	1870.58	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact938	1871.86	1872.3	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	Exactly .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact940	1872.64	1872.87	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact939	1872.3	1873.62	D	PhD	s	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so that was the other thing .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact941	1873.62	1882.81	D	PhD	s	+1	1	And then we wanted to s just limit it to maybe uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um front - end .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact942	1882.81	1889.96	D	PhD	s	+1	1	So that would mean just doing the top I don't know ten or twelve or something of the KLT dimensions .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact943	1888.77	1891.75	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Yeah , and I think {disfmarker} and we sh again check {disfmarker} we should check with Stephane .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact944	1891.75	1896.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	My impression was that when we did that before that had very little {disfmarker} uh he didn't lose very much .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact945	1896.44	1896.71	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact946	1897.11	1898.74	F	PhD	qy^bu^d	-1	0	By just taking the top whatever ?
Bmr026.A.dialogueact947	1898.49	1898.64	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact948	1899.01	1899.17	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah
Bmr026.B.dialogueact949	1899.88	1900.04	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact950	1900.61	1900.9	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But then {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact951	1900.9	1902.14	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And then something {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact952	1902.14	1915.71	D	PhD	s	+1	1	Once we have the new M L P trained up , uh one thing I wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run uh like a standard hybrid system that is based on you know , those features
Bmr026.D.dialogueact953	1915.71	1922.76	D	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	uh and uh retrain MLP and also the you know , the dictionary that we use for the Hub - five system .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact954	1923.01	1927.99	B	Professor	s	+1	1	And the b And the base u starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from i from a pretty decent system .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact955	1926.51	1927.02	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Exactly .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact956	1926.55	1926.73	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact957	1927.84	1928.08	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact958	1928.08	1935.32	D	PhD	s	-1	0	So that would basically give us a , um , more {disfmarker} hopefully a {disfmarker} a better system
Bmr026.B.dialogueact959	1929.11	1929.32	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact960	1935.92	1941.93	D	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um because {disfmarker} you know , compared to what Eric did a while ago , where he trained up , I think , a system based on Broadcast News
Bmr026.D.dialogueact961	1941.93	1945.17	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and then uh tra retraining it on Switchboard
Bmr026.D.dialogueact962	1945.17	1946.55	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	or s uh and {disfmarker}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact963	1945.8	1946.02	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact964	1947.34	1952.4	D	PhD	s	-1	0	But he {disfmarker} I think he d he didn't {disfmarker} he probably didn't use all the training data that was available .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact965	1952.4	1960.25	D	PhD	s	-1	0	And his dictionary probably wasn't as tuned to um conversational speech as {disfmarker} as the {disfmarker} as ours is .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact967	1960.59	1962.5	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker} That 's certainly one thing , yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact966	1960.25	1960.62	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact969	1962.83	1965.29	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh . Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact968	1962.41	1963.81	D	PhD	s	-1	0	And the dictionary made a huge difference .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact970	1964.15	1969.1	D	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	Uh . We {disfmarker} we made some improvements to the dictionary 's uh {disfmarker} to the dictionary about two years ago
Bmr026.D.dialogueact971	1969.11	1976.51	D	PhD	s	-1	0	which resulted in a {disfmarker} uh something like a four percent absolute error rate reduction on Switchboard ,
Bmr026.D.dialogueact972	1976.51	1976.81	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	which {disfmarker}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact973	1977.08	1985.32	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	Well the other thing is , dipping {pause} deep into history and into uh our resource management days , when we were collaborating with SRI before ,
Bmr026.D.dialogueact974	1981.13	1981.7	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact975	1984.75	1985.32	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact977	1985.49	1992.57	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh it was {disfmarker} I think , it is was a really key uh starting point for us that we actually got our alignment .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact976	1985.32	1985.84	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact978	1992.57	1997.48	B	Professor	s	-1	0	When we were working together we got our initial alignments from Decipher , uh {pause} at the time .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact979	1995.43	1995.94	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact980	1996.59	1996.78	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact981	1997.92	2006.71	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh . {pause} And . Later we got away from it because {disfmarker} because once we had decent systems going then it was {disfmarker} it was typically better to use our own systems
Bmr026.F.dialogueact982	1998.13	1998.35	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact983	2003.44	2003.83	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact984	2006.71	2007.84	B	Professor	s	-1	0	cuz they were self consistent
Bmr026.B.dialogueact985	2007.91	2013.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but certainly to start off when we were trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty percent error uh rate .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact986	2013.7	2017.12	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh . {vocalsound} But that was a {disfmarker} that was a good {disfmarker} good {disfmarker} good way to start .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact987	2015.9	2016.09	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact989	2017.55	2022.04	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And we 're not quite that bad with our {disfmarker} our Switchboard systems but it was {disfmarker} they certainly aren't as good as SRI 's ,
Bmr026.D.dialogueact988	2017.49	2018.2	D	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact990	2020.0	2020.22	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr026.B.dialogueact995	2027.34	2031.2	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , the hybrid system we never got better than about fifty percent {pause} error .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact996	2031.65	2032.95	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And uh it was {disfmarker}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact997	2033.4	2036.7	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I think there 's just a whole lot of things that uh no one ever had time for .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact998	2036.7	2039.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	We never did really fix up the dictionary .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact999	2039.77	2043.06	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh we always had a list of a half dozen things that we were gonna do
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1000	2043.06	2045.21	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and a lot of them were pretty simple and we never did .

Bmr026.D.dialogueact1006	2048.62	2048.85	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1008	2050.52	2053.26	D	PhD	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} And that number I think was on Switchboard - one data ,
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1009	2053.26	2053.61	D	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1010	2054.27	2056.11	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Where the error rate now is in the twenties .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1011	2056.64	2056.85	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1013	2057.16	2057.42	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1012	2056.68	2057.57	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So , um .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1014	2057.42	2057.8	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So we were {disfmarker}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1016	2057.8	2057.94	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1017	2057.94	2060.05	B	Professor	s	-1	0	We were probably at least a factor or two off .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1015	2057.71	2058.73	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	That 's yet s
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1018	2059.18	2059.45	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .

Bmr026.D.dialogueact1020	2060.14	2062.92	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So it would be {disfmarker} So it would be good t to sort of r re uh {disfmarker}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1021	2062.19	2062.41	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1022	2062.92	2066.53	D	PhD	s	-1	0	just at least to give us an idea of how well the hybrid system would do .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1023	2066.36	2066.58	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1024	2067.45	2068.34	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But I think {disfmarker} again it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1025	2068.34	2068.5	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1026	2068.5	2070.69	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's the conver it 's the s conversational speech bit .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1027	2070.69	2073.19	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Because our {disfmarker} our Broadcast News system is actually pretty good .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1028	2070.84	2071.51	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1029	2073.19	2073.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	He knows .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1030	2073.23	2073.61	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1031	2074.21	2079.37	D	PhD	s	-1	0	And the other thing that that would help us to evaluate is to see how well the M L P is trained up .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1032	2079.51	2079.81	D	PhD	qy^d^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1033	2080.49	2084.33	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Because it 's a pretty good um indicator of that .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1034	2082.89	2083.33	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1035	2084.81	2093.93	D	PhD	s^df	+1	1	So it 's sort of a sanity check of the M L P outputs {pause} before we go ahead and train up the {disfmarker} uh you know , use them as a basis for the tandem system .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1036	2091.09	2091.48	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1037	2094.43	2094.57	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1038	2094.75	2095.8	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It 'll still probably be worse .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1039	2095.8	2098.22	B	Professor	s	+1	1	I mean , it 's {disfmarker} it 'd be context independent and so on .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1040	2096.22	2096.41	D	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1041	2096.54	2096.82	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Sure .

Bmr026.F.dialogueact1042	2097.73	2105.6	F	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Should we {disfmarker} Should we bother with um using the net before doing uh embedded training ?

Bmr026.D.dialogueact1044	2098.43	2098.62	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1046	2106.23	2107.61	F	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	I mean should {disfmarker} should we even use that ?
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1047	2107.36	2109.26	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh {pause} oh that 's a good question .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1048	2107.61	2109.03	F	PhD	qrr.%-	-1	0	Or should I just go straight to {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1049	2109.26	2116.36	D	PhD	h|s^no	-1	0	Yeah , we {disfmarker} we weren't sure whether it 's worth to just use the alignments um from the S R I recognizer
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1050	2116.36	2120.61	D	PhD	s	-1	0	or whether to actually go through one or more iterations of embedded training where you realign .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1051	2119.48	2119.8	A	Grad	s^co	-1	0	Try it .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1052	2121.49	2121.94	A	Grad	s^co^rt	-1	0	You run it ?
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1053	2122.21	2123.59	A	Grad	s^co^rt	-1	0	Keep {disfmarker} keep both versions ?
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1054	2123.65	2124.39	A	Grad	s^co	-1	0	See which one 's better ?
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1055	2124.15	2124.88	B	Professor	h|s^aa	-1	0	Uh , yeah .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1056	2124.88	2126.16	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean . I think I agree with Ad
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1057	2126.16	2128.86	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	I mean basically you would then {disfmarker} You proceed with the embedded training .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1058	2126.45	2127.01	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1060	2128.86	2131.8	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's gonna take you a while to train at this net anyway .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1059	2128.82	2129.31	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1061	2130.38	2130.75	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1062	2131.8	2134.93	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	And while it 's training you may as well test the one you have and see how it did .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1063	2135.25	2135.47	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1065	2136.28	2136.59	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Alright .

Bmr026.A.dialogueact1066	2137.07	2138.51	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I could make arguments either way .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1068	2138.85	2139.32	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	You know , it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1067	2138.81	2139.45	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	But {disfmarker} But so I {disfmarker}
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1070	2139.48	2140.74	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Sort of given up guessing .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1069	2139.45	2140.15	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	Well but i
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1071	2140.15	2147.13	D	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	But in your experience I mean uh have you seen big improvements in s on some tasks with embedded training ?
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1072	2147.14	2150.1	D	PhD	qrr	-1	0	Or was it sort of small - ish uh improvements that you got
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1073	2149.76	2150.92	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh well . It depended on the task .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1074	2150.92	2153.55	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean I think in this one I would sort of expect it to be important
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1075	2151.09	2151.38	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1076	2153.55	2158.77	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because we 're coming from uh , alignments that were achieved with an extremely different system .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1077	2156.55	2157.24	D	PhD	s^2.%-	-1	0	That are from another {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1078	2157.63	2158.01	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1080	2159.27	2167.43	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Although , I mean we 've done it with {disfmarker} When we were combining with the Cambridge recurrent neural net , embedded training made it worse .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1079	2158.78	2159.09	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1081	2159.64	2160.13	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1082	2168.71	2169.64	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Which I 've never figured out .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1083	2171.34	2171.62	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1084	2171.62	2172.44	B	Professor	s^arp.%-	-1	0	But I mean i
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1085	2172.34	2173.03	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I think it 's a bug .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1086	2173.27	2179.44	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	+1	1	So you {disfmarker} you started training with outputs from a {disfmarker} with alignments that were generated by the Cambridge uh system ?
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1087	2178.45	2178.61	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1088	2179.44	2179.85	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And then {disfmarker}

Bmr026.D.dialogueact1092	2182.71	2183.7	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Hmm . Well , that might probably just {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1093	2184.17	2184.4	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1094	2184.4	2188.35	D	PhD	s	+1	1	That was probably because your initial system {disfmarker} I mean your system was ba worse than Cambridge 's .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1095	2189.67	2193.26	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	And you {disfmarker} Um .

Bmr026.D.dialogueact1118	2218.63	2220.14	D	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	because we have seen {disfmarker}

Bmr026.B.dialogueact1123	2228.51	2236.9	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But I But I would {disfmarker} I would suspect that something that {disfmarker} that had um a very different Um feature set , for instance {disfmarker}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1124	2236.9	2239.46	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean they were using pretty diff similar feature sets to us .

Bmr026.B.dialogueact1126	2240.27	2244.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I would expect that something that had a different feature set would {disfmarker} would uh benefit from {disfmarker}

Bmr026.F.dialogueact1128	2244.96	2247.42	F	PhD	qw	-1	0	What about uh hidden unit size {pause} on this .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1129	2246.97	2247.54	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	Oh , wait a minute ,
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1130	2247.54	2248.62	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and the other thing uh ,

Bmr026.B.dialogueact1133	2248.88	2254.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it was {disfmarker} the other thing is that what was in common {comment} to the Cambridge system and our system is they both were training posteriors .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1134	2255.21	2255.47	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1136	2256.14	2256.33	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Ah yeah .

Bmr026.A.dialogueact1137	2256.33	2257.45	A	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's another big difference .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1138	2257.83	2260.29	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	and uh , one bac at least {disfmarker}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1139	2260.68	2261.08	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	Back at {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1140	2260.68	2261.83	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	You mean with soft targets ?
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1141	2263.03	2263.25	D	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	Or {disfmarker} ?
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1142	2265.07	2265.77	D	PhD	s^fa.%--	-1	0	Sorry , I 'm sor
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1143	2265.77	2266.17	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I missed {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1144	2266.17	2267.68	D	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	What {disfmarker} What 's the key issue here ?
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1145	2268.06	2274.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Oh , that uh both the Cambridge system and our system were {disfmarker} were training {pause} posteriors .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1146	2274.59	2279.08	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And if we 're {disfmarker} we 're coming from alignments coming from the SRI system , it 's a likelihood - based system .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1147	2280.13	2281.74	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so that 's another difference .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1148	2280.18	2280.5	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1149	2281.74	2287.76	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean . You know , there 's diffe different front - end different {disfmarker} different uh , um , training criterion {disfmarker}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1150	2288.75	2297.66	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , I would think that in a that an embedded {pause} uh {pause} embedded uh training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1151	2296.93	2297.34	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1152	2297.66	2298.18	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	But we don't know .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1153	2300.17	2300.5	D	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1154	2301.01	2301.53	B	Professor	qy^d^rt^tc	-1	0	You gonna say something ?
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1155	2301.61	2301.8	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1156	2301.8	2305.82	F	PhD	s^r.%--	+1	1	I was wondering uh you know what size net I should {disfmarker}
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1157	2307.2	2309.7	F	PhD	qo	+1	1	Anybody have any intuitions or suggestions ?
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1158	2309.63	2310.68	B	Professor	qw^rt	+1	1	Uh , how much training data ?
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1159	2311.89	2314.41	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , I was gonna start off with the small train set .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1160	2314.52	2315.86	B	Professor	qw^rt	-1	0	And how {disfmarker} How many hours is that ?
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1161	2315.68	2316.13	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	That 's why I was {disfmarker}
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1162	2316.13	2317.43	F	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure how much that is .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1163	2316.85	2318.75	D	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	Uh , I think that has about {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1164	2319.48	2321.45	D	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	Well i you 'd {disfmarker} would be gender - dependent training ,
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1165	2321.6	2321.98	D	PhD	qy^d^g	-1	0	right ?
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1167	2321.98	2328.56	D	PhD	s	-1	0	So {disfmarker} So I think it 's {disfmarker} uh that 's about mmm , something like thirty hours .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1166	2321.89	2322.88	F	PhD	s^aa^m	-1	0	Gender - dependent , yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1169	2329.9	2331.04	D	PhD	s^aa^e	-1	0	Thirty hours per gender .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1168	2329.82	2330.3	F	PhD	qy^d^m^rt	-1	0	Thirty hours .

Bmr026.D.dialogueact1173	2334.49	2335.27	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I think so .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1174	2335.27	2335.54	D	PhD	%--	-1	0	I 'll {disfmarker}
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1175	2336.74	2337.09	A	Grad	qw^br^rt^t3	-1	0	Excuse me ?
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1176	2337.58	2338.66	D	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's definitely less than a hundred {disfmarker}
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1178	2339.14	2339.53	A	Grad	s^bk^t3	-1	0	Alright .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1177	2338.66	2342.65	D	PhD	s	-1	0	You know , it 's more like {disfmarker} like thirty forty hours
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1179	2342.65	2343.42	D	PhD	s	-1	0	something like that .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1180	2343.44	2343.84	A	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	Wrong number .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1181	2345.65	2346.42	F	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	They called to tell us that ?
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1183	2347.2	2347.35	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1182	2346.93	2347.12	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1184	2348.2	2351.71	B	Professor	fg|s.%-	-1	0	Um . So . Uh . after run
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1185	2350.56	2352.05	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , I didn't want to do too big ,
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1186	2352.33	2352.69	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1188	2352.82	2353.2	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1187	2352.39	2352.75	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	just {disfmarker}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1189	2353.41	2355.54	B	Professor	s	-1	0	At least a couple thousand hidden units .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1190	2357.01	2357.29	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1192	2357.29	2360.21	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} it 's th the thing I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll think about it a little more
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1191	2357.06	2357.45	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1193	2360.21	2362.93	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but it {disfmarker} it 'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1194	2363.36	2363.72	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1195	2364.01	2365.38	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	You definitely wouldn't want the eight thousand .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1196	2365.38	2366.72	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	It 's m It 's more than {disfmarker}
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1197	2366.6	2367.68	F	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	And a thousand is too small ?
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1198	2369.27	2370.11	B	Professor	h	-1	0	Oh let me think about it ,
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1199	2370.11	2373.69	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but I think that {disfmarker} that uh th at some point there 's diminishing returns .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1201	2374.12	2375.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean it doesn't actually get worse , typically ,
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1200	2373.83	2374.16	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1202	2374.71	2374.97	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1203	2375.88	2377.8	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	but it {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but there is diminishing returns
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1204	2377.8	2379.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and you 're doubling {pause} the amount of time .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1205	2378.66	2382.37	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Remember you 'll have a smaller output layer so there 's gonna be fewer parameters there .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1206	2382.01	2382.91	A	Grad	s^arp	-1	0	But not by a lot .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1207	2382.47	2383.3	B	Professor	s^arp	-1	0	Not by much .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1208	2382.55	2383.19	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	And then {disfmarker}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1209	2383.63	2385.74	B	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Fifty s Fifty four to forty eight ?
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1210	2384.7	2386.55	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Vast majority is from the input unit .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1213	2388.12	2388.4	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1211	2387.68	2388.0	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1212	2388.0	2388.31	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1214	2388.68	2388.95	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1215	2388.95	2390.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It 'll have a very tiny effect .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1216	2390.82	2392.41	A	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	Right , because you used the context windows
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1217	2392.73	2395.2	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and so the input to hidden is much , much larger .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1218	2392.82	2393.16	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1219	2394.43	2394.92	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh I see ,
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1220	2394.92	2395.15	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	I see ,
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1221	2395.15	2395.86	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah , of course .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1222	2395.76	2396.01	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1223	2395.99	2396.11	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1224	2396.11	2397.87	D	PhD	s^bs|s^bk	-1	0	It 's negligible , OK .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1225	2398.21	2401.47	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah , so it 's {disfmarker} it 'd be way , way less than ten percent of the difference .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1226	2400.06	2400.29	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1227	2401.76	2404.92	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Uh . There 's uh {disfmarker}
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1228	2405.99	2406.63	B	Professor	qw.%-	-1	0	How bi how big
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1229	2407.25	2407.48	B	Professor	h	-1	0	Let 's see .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1230	2407.48	2408.3	B	Professor	qw^t1	-1	0	What am I trying to think of ?
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1231	2408.28	2412.09	F	PhD	s	-1	0	The {disfmarker} The net that {disfmarker} that we did use already {pause} uh was eight thousand hidden units
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1232	2412.09	2413.24	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and that 's the one that Eric trained up .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1233	2413.97	2414.17	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1234	2414.17	2418.82	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And that was trained up on uh like a hundred and forty hours of {disfmarker} of speech .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1235	2418.32	2420.07	D	PhD	qrr	-1	0	Was that gender - dependent or independent ?
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1236	2419.84	2420.56	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Gender - dependent .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1237	2420.48	2420.66	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1238	2420.66	2423.36	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So that would be like trained on s sixty or seventy hours .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1239	2423.06	2423.6	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1240	2424.42	2424.93	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So , uh ,
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1241	2424.93	2428.33	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah definitely not the one thousand uh {disfmarker} two thousand fr
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1242	2428.33	2430.24	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean the four thousand will be better
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1243	2430.86	2434.04	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and the two thousand will be almost {disfmarker} will be faster and almost as good .
Bmr026.A.dialogueact1244	2431.71	2432.47	A	Grad	s	-1	0	It 'll be faster .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1246	2434.04	2434.4	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1245	2433.65	2433.96	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1248	2434.53	2435.04	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1247	2434.48	2437.15	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Maybe I 'll start off with two thousand just to see .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1249	2435.71	2435.97	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1250	2438.27	2438.44	D	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr026.F.dialogueact1251	2438.35	2438.51	F	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1252	2439.22	2447.01	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , thirty hours is like a hundred and ten thousand uh seconds .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1253	2448.25	2451.74	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , so that 's like eleven {disfmarker} eleven million frames .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1254	2452.93	2462.74	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And a two thousand hidden unit net is uh I guess about seven , eight hundred thousand parameters .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1255	2463.36	2465.45	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So that 's probably {disfmarker} That 's probably fine .
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1256	2465.45	2469.39	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean a four thousand is well within the range that you could benefit from
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1257	2469.39	2470.69	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but the two thousand 'd be faster
Bmr026.B.dialogueact1258	2470.69	2470.92	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1259	2471.98	2472.07	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	Right .
Bmr026.D.dialogueact1260	2472.07	2473.16	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I actually have to go .
