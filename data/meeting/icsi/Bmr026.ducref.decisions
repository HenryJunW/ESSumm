Jane will be contacted to see whether transcribers could work on a small amount of SmartKom data , in order to get the project moving.
Details of the transcription status web page will be sent to the group.
Participants will be contacted to approve transcripts or suggest edits , however this depends upon decisions regarding disk space and ( un )compression of audio files.
There are disk space problems regarding scratch space , although the group decide that a solution about adding extra drives cannot be resolved without talking to sysadmin.
Until they can be contacted , the group will use the hard drives on each other's machines.
Displaying pitch contours live in Transcriber would be desirable for the demo , however , if the group run out of time , the group note that they could generate this statically using Powerpoint.
The group decide that it may be more beneficial to have separate meetings to discuss recognition , since Jane and Liz are less likely to be interested in this.
They will discuss this with them before going ahead.
