Scratch disk space used to store the uncompressed meetings when they are being processed is getting short - the group are using 98%.
Various options are suggested about adding extra drives , externally to their machines , or to the server , but these cannot be resolved until after the relevant sysadmin person returns from a break in 10 days time.
Time is getting tight for some of the demo development , especially a lack of Tcl-TK skills slowing up back-end progress.
Additionally , time constraints may impinge upon the "live-ness" of the Transcriber pitch contour demo.
Annual report is due next week , so this will need to be discussed at the next meeting.
