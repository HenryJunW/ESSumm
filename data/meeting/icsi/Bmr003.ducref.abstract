The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group discussed the aims , methods , timing , and outsourcing issues concerning transcription of the Meeting Recorder corpus.
The Transcriber software tool was introduced , along with a set of transcription conventions for coding different speech events.
The prospect of sending the data to an external transcription service was weighed against that of hiring a graduate student transcriber pool.
It was tentatively decided that the latter option would be less costly and allow BMR to maintain greater control over the transcription process.
Methods for distributing the data were briefly discussed , along with an initiative for creating a BMR project website.
The group received an update on the meeting room recording setup and electronics.
