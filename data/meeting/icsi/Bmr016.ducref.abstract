The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group discussed digits data , recent ASR results , the status of transcriptions , and disk space and storage format issues.
Approximately two hours of digits have been recorded , half of which have been extracted.
Researchers doing ASR are looking into methods for generating a better channel-based segmentation to improve recognition results for close-talking microphone data.
Transcription checking procedures were reviewed , and efforts to coordinate the channelization and presegmention of data with the tightening of time bins were discussed.
The group also talked about downsampling and strategies for coping with low disk space.
