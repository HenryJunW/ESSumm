Bmr027.F.dialogueact25	34.299	34.489	F	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	Ugh !
Bmr027.F.dialogueact26	36.09	37.48	F	Grad	s^t	+1	1	So I didn't send out agenda items
Bmr027.F.dialogueact27	37.48	40.15	F	Grad	s	+1	1	because until five minutes ago we only had one agenda item
Bmr027.F.dialogueact28	40.15	41.06	F	Grad	s	+1	1	and now we have two .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact29	41.16	43.303	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	So . {vocalsound} And , uh .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact30	42.179	42.429	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact31	43.957	46.907	B	Professor	s^t.%--	+1	2	So , just to repeat the thing bef that we said last week ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact32	46.907	55.386	B	Professor	s^bu	+1	2	it was there 's this suggestion of alternating weeks on {vocalsound} more , uh , automatic speech recognition related or not ?
Bmr027.B.dialogueact34	55.506	57.156	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Was that sort of {pause} the division ?
Bmr027.F.dialogueact33	55.46	55.72	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact35	57.516	58.456	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	So which week are we in ?

Bmr027.F.dialogueact37	61.407	65.597	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	but I thought we more {disfmarker} we more or less did Meeting Recorder stuff last week ,
Bmr027.F.dialogueact38	65.597	66.747	F	Grad	s^cs.%-	-1	0	so I thought we could do , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr027.B.dialogueact39	67.002	69.622	B	Professor	s^arp	-1	0	I thought we had a thing about speech recognition last week too .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact41	71.052	71.342	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact40	71.049	74.419	F	Grad	s^cs	+1	1	But I figure also if they 're short agenda items , we could also do a little bit of each .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact42	74.857	75.137	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact43	74.909	75.159	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact44	77.993	80.173	F	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	I seem to be having difficulty getting this adjusted .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact45	80.173	80.603	F	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	Here we go .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact46	80.73	80.96	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .

Bmr027.F.dialogueact50	92.819	94.489	F	Grad	s	-1	0	So , no on no one has bleeped out anything .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact51	95.36	96.529	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Um . Yeah .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact52	95.73	95.98	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact53	97.79	98.87	F	Grad	s	-1	0	I don't expect anyone to .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact54	98.95	99.16	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	But .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact55	99.46	101.04	B	Professor	qw.%--	-1	0	Um . {vocalsound} So , w what follows ?

Bmr027.B.dialogueact60	106.521	107.341	B	Professor	s^aa|s^df	-1	0	Yeah , but I 've forgotten .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact59	106.222	109.732	F	Grad	s	+1	2	and we had decided that they have {disfmarker} they only needed to sign once .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact61	110.232	114.332	F	Grad	s	-1	0	And the agreement that they already signed simply said that we would give them an opportunity .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact62	114.802	116.212	F	Grad	s	-1	0	So as long as we do that , we 're covered .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact63	116.436	118.536	B	Professor	qw^rt	-1	0	And how long of an opportunity did you tell them ?

Bmr027.A.dialogueact87	150.535	150.955	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	That 's right .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact88	151.355	151.765	A	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	That 's why .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact89	151.971	152.461	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , I see .

Bmr027.B.dialogueact101	167.362	168.252	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	We probably should have talked about it ,

Bmr027.B.dialogueact104	180.216	180.596	B	Professor	qy^d^f^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr027.F.dialogueact105	180.287	182.557	F	Grad	s^aa|s^df	-1	0	Yeah . As I said , we {disfmarker} I just got one date
Bmr027.B.dialogueact107	182.313	182.593	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact106	181.952	182.122	H	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	Damn !
Bmr027.F.dialogueact108	182.557	183.497	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and that 's the one I used .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact110	183.82	184.08	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact109	183.677	185.237	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	So . But I can send a follow - up .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact111	185.237	186.567	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	I mean , it 's almost all us .

Bmr027.C.dialogueact113	192.773	194.743	C	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Was my {disfmarker} was my response OK ?
Bmr027.A.dialogueact114	193.386	193.726	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	That 's right .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact115	194.743	197.243	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I just wrote you {disfmarker} replied to the email saying they 're all fine .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact116	196.799	197.559	F	Grad	s^bk|s^ba^na	-1	0	Right . I mean , that 's fine .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact117	197.9	198.27	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK , good .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact118	198.17	207.52	F	Grad	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} we don't {disfmarker} My understanding of what we {pause} had agreed upon when we had spoken about this months ago was that , uh , we don't actually need a reply .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact119	199.218	199.838	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That makes it easy .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact120	208.081	210.171	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	We just need to tell them that they can do it if they want .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact121	209.306	209.696	B	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact122	210.361	211.151	B	Professor	s^df^no	-1	0	I just didn't remember ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact123	211.301	211.511	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bmr027.F.dialogueact124	211.33	214.161	F	Grad	s	-1	0	And so no reply is no changes .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact125	214.326	217.966	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And he 's got it so that the default thing you see when you look at the page is " OK " .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact126	214.346	214.646	B	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact127	218.62	219.39	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So that 's very clear
Bmr027.A.dialogueact128	219.39	220.51	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	all the way down the page , " OK " .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact129	220.66	221.59	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And they have two options
Bmr027.A.dialogueact130	221.59	225.63	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	they can change it to . One of them is {pause} " censor " , and the other one is " incorrect " .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact131	225.89	227.14	A	Postdoc	qh	-1	0	Is it {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} your word is " incorrect " ?
Bmr027.F.dialogueact132	226.309	226.519	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact133	227.44	234.096	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Which means also we get feedback on {pause} if {pause} um , there 's something that they w that needs to be {pause} adjusted ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact134	234.096	237.266	A	Postdoc	s^df^rt	-1	0	because , I mean , these are very highly technical things .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact135	237.266	241.166	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean , it 's an added , uh , level of checking on the accuracy of the transcription , as I see it .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact136	241.166	243.706	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But in any case , people can agree to things that are wrong .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact137	241.64	241.94	F	Grad	fg	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bmr027.A.dialogueact138	243.946	244.216	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact139	244.62	251.06	F	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah . The reason I did that it was just so that people would not censor {disfmarker} not ask to have stuff removed because it was transcribed incorrectly ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact140	251.48	253.1	A	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	And the reason I liked it was because {disfmarker}
Bmr027.F.dialogueact141	252.49	253.62	F	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	as opposed to , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr027.A.dialogueact142	254.36	259.18	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	was because it , um {disfmarker} it gives them the option of , uh , being able to correct it .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact143	259.35	259.55	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact144	260.338	261.358	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Approve it and correct it .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact145	262.69	263.47	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	And {pause} um .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact146	264.52	267.49	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So , you have {pause} it nicely set up so they email you
Bmr027.A.dialogueact147	267.49	268.29	A	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	and , uh {disfmarker}

Bmr027.B.dialogueact193	323.779	325.129	B	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	I mean , if we 're going to have a policy on it ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact194	325.129	327.639	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	that we discuss the length of time that we want to give people ,

Bmr027.B.dialogueact196	328.29	330.26	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	so that we have a uniform thing .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact197	330.3	331.67	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So , tha that 's a month ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact198	331.67	332.15	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	which is fine .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact201	332.15	332.75	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	I mean , it seems {disfmarker}
Bmr027.C.dialogueact199	331.95	332.58	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Twelve hours .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact200	331.996	336.296	F	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , the only thing I said in the email is that {pause} the data is going to be released on the fifteenth .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact202	336.296	337.546	F	Grad	s	-1	0	I didn't give any other deadline .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact203	337.727	338.017	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact204	338.219	344.18	F	Grad	s:s	-1	0	So my feeling is if someone after the fifteenth says , " wow I suddenly found something " , we 'll delete it from our record .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact205	344.38	346.72	F	Grad	s	-1	0	We just won't delete it from whatever 's already been released .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact206	346.993	348.583	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Hmm . That 's a little bit difficult .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact207	351.35	352.06	F	Grad	qo	-1	0	What else can we do ?
Bmr027.A.dialogueact208	352.616	352.926	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact209	353.7	360.707	F	Grad	qo:s	-1	0	If someone says " hey , look , I {pause} found something in this meeting and {pause} it 's libelous and I want it removed " . What can we do ?

Bmr027.F.dialogueact210	360.937	361.797	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	We have to remove it .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact212	362.25	363.11	A	Postdoc	s^aap	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I agree with that part ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact213	363.11	371.397	A	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	but I think that it would {disfmarker} it , uh {disfmarker} we need to have , uh , a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a message to them very clearly that {vocalsound} beyond this date , you can't make additional changes .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact214	374.626	375.036	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean ,

Bmr027.B.dialogueact216	376.782	381.292	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i I think that somebody might {pause} request something
Bmr027.B.dialogueact217	381.292	382.472	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	even though we say that .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact218	382.472	384.982	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	But I think it 's good to at least start some place like that .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact220	385.122	385.432	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm . Good .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact219	384.982	389.358	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	So if we agreed , {vocalsound} OK , how long is a reasonable amount of time for people to have {disfmarker}
Bmr027.B.dialogueact221	389.358	391.458	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	if we say two weeks , or if we say a month ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact222	391.902	392.742	B	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	I think we should just say that {disfmarker}
Bmr027.B.dialogueact223	392.742	402.478	B	Professor	s^cs:s	-1	0	say that , you know , i a as {pause} um , {vocalsound} " per the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the , uh , page you signed , you have the ability to look over this stuff " and so forth
Bmr027.B.dialogueact224	403.017	405.835	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	" and , uh , because we w " these , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr027.B.dialogueact225	405.835	417.13	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	I would {disfmarker} I would imagine some sort of generic thing that would say " because we , uh , will continually be making these things available {vocalsound} to other researchers , uh , this can't be open - ended
Bmr027.B.dialogueact226	417.13	423.55	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and so , uh , uh , please give us back your response within this am you know , within this amount of time " , whatever time we agree upon .

Bmr027.F.dialogueact232	427.725	429.675	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	and then make comments on what you want me to change ?

Bmr027.B.dialogueact234	432.106	437.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I I 'm {disfmarker} what I 'm {disfmarker} what I 'm {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I 'm trying to spark a discussion hopefully among people who have read it
Bmr027.B.dialogueact235	437.09	440.309	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so that {disfmarker} that you can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you can , uh , decide on something .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact236	438.679	438.909	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact237	440.309	441.799	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So I 'm not telling you what to decide .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact238	441.595	441.815	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .

Bmr027.A.dialogueact241	443.644	443.914	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact242	443.924	444.294	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	and then {disfmarker}
Bmr027.F.dialogueact240	443.577	444.897	F	Grad	s	-1	0	I already did decide something ,
Bmr027.F.dialogueact243	445.017	446.067	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and that 's what 's in the email .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact244	445.724	446.614	A	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	Yeah , yeah . OK , so {disfmarker}
Bmr027.F.dialogueact245	446.067	449.137	F	Grad	qo^cs	+1	1	And if you disagree with it , why don't you read it and give me comments on it ?

Bmr027.B.dialogueact251	457.913	461.183	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And you also just said that the reason you said that was because someone said it to you .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact253	461.629	467.349	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	So what I 'm telling you {pause} is that what you should do is come up with a length of time that you guys think is enough
Bmr027.F.dialogueact252	461.29	461.59	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact254	468.289	472.029	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and you should use that rather than {pause} this date that you just got from somewhere .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact255	472.109	472.769	B	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	That 's all I 'm saying .

Bmr027.A.dialogueact260	476.662	478.452	A	Postdoc	s	+1	2	and presumably people may be out of town .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact261	478.452	484.042	A	Postdoc	s^bu	+1	2	But we can make the assumption , can't we ? that , um , they will be receiving email , uh , most of the month .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact262	484.042	484.402	A	Postdoc	qy^d^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr027.A.dialogueact263	487.608	488.458	A	Postdoc	s^df.%-	-1	0	Because if someone {disfmarker}

Bmr027.E.dialogueact319	602.565	609.015	E	PhD	s^cs^rt	-1	0	And then if you {disfmarker} if the person thinks they 'll need more time because they 're out of town or whatever , they can tell you at that point ?
Bmr027.E.dialogueact320	609.71	610.14	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	Because {disfmarker}

Bmr027.F.dialogueact322	611.86	614.91	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because I don't wanna have a discussion with every person {pause} if I can avoid it .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact323	616.174	616.584	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	Well , it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr027.F.dialogueact324	616.451	618.271	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	So what I wanted to do was just send it out
Bmr027.F.dialogueact325	618.271	621.34	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and say " on the fifteenth , the data is released ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact326	620.388	620.658	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .

Bmr027.E.dialogueact331	625.77	627.86	E	PhD	s^bk|s.%-	-1	0	OK . So , we 're assuming that {disfmarker}
Bmr027.H.dialogueact333	626.588	628.758	H	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Well , that 's {disfmarker} that would be great if {disfmarker}
Bmr027.H.dialogueact334	629.048	631.988	H	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	but you should probably have a {pause} legal person look at this
Bmr027.H.dialogueact335	631.988	633.368	H	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and {pause} make sure it 's OK .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact336	633.438	651.211	H	PhD	s^df.%-	+1	1	Because if you {disfmarker} if you , uh , do this {vocalsound} and you {disfmarker} then there 's a dispute later and , uh , some {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know , someone who understands these matters concludes that they didn't have , uh , you know , enough opportunity to actually {vocalsound} exercise their {disfmarker} their right {disfmarker}
Bmr027.E.dialogueact337	650.282	652.562	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Or they {disfmarker} they might never have gotten the email ,
Bmr027.E.dialogueact338	652.562	657.132	E	PhD	s^df	+1	2	because although they signed this , they don't know by which date to expect your email .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact339	657.813	661.213	E	PhD	s.%--	+1	2	And so {pause} someone whose machine is down or whatever {disfmarker}
Bmr027.E.dialogueact340	661.213	662.803	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , we have no {disfmarker}

Bmr027.E.dialogueact342	662.803	664.843	E	PhD	s	-1	0	in internally we know that people are there ,

Bmr027.E.dialogueact344	664.843	667.533	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but we have no confirmation that they got the mail .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact345	666.401	668.271	F	Grad	s	-1	0	So let 's say someone {disfmarker} I send this out ,
Bmr027.F.dialogueact346	668.271	669.651	F	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and someone doesn't respond .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact347	670.11	672.04	F	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Do we delete every meeting that they were in ?
Bmr027.E.dialogueact349	674.08	674.49	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	Well , then {disfmarker}
Bmr027.F.dialogueact348	673.954	674.814	F	Grad	s	-1	0	I don't think so .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact351	675.09	676.77	E	PhD	s	-1	0	It {disfmarker} we 're hoping that doesn't happen ,

Bmr027.E.dialogueact352	676.77	679.23	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but that 's why there 's such a thing as registered mail

Bmr027.F.dialogueact358	681.701	683.141	F	Grad	s^df	+1	3	Because people don't read their email ,
Bmr027.F.dialogueact359	683.141	684.801	F	Grad	s:s	+1	3	or they 'll read and say " I don't care about that ,

Bmr027.H.dialogueact473	873.29	882.874	H	PhD	s	-1	0	It might well be the case that {disfmarker} that this is perfectly {disfmarker} you know , this is enough to give us a basis t to just , eh , assume their consent if they don't reply .

Bmr027.A.dialogueact488	909.824	910.664	A	Postdoc	s	+1	2	I think they 'd appreciate it .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact489	911.16	916.59	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah . My {disfmarker} Adam , my {disfmarker} my view before was about {pause} the nature of what was {disfmarker} of the presentation ,

Bmr027.B.dialogueact494	923.53	929.92	B	Professor	qh.%--	-1	0	h how m how much implication would there be that it 's likely you 're going to be changing something , as opposed to {disfmarker}
Bmr027.F.dialogueact495	929.141	929.431	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact496	929.92	932.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	That was the kind of dispute I was making before .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact497	931.104	931.434	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact498	931.494	932.014	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	I remember that .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact499	932.64	937.97	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But , um , the attorneys , I {disfmarker} uh , I can guarantee you , the attorneys will always come back with {disfmarker}
Bmr027.B.dialogueact500	937.97	940.48	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and we have to decide how stringent we want to be in these things ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact501	940.54	952.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but they will always come back with saying {vocalsound} that , um , you need to {disfmarker} you want to have someth some paper trail or {disfmarker} which includes electronic trail {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that they have , uh , in fact {pause} O K 'd it .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact502	952.734	952.974	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact503	953.425	954.565	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So , um ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact504	955.076	958.636	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	I think that if you f i if {pause} we send the email as you have
Bmr027.B.dialogueact505	958.636	966.923	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	2	and if there 's half the people , say , who don't respond {pause} at all by , you know , some period of time , {vocalsound} we can just make a list of these people
Bmr027.B.dialogueact506	966.923	968.273	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and hand it to , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr027.B.dialogueact507	968.273	969.103	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you know , just give it to me
Bmr027.B.dialogueact508	969.103	970.833	B	Professor	s	+1	2	and I 'll hand it to administrative staff or whatever ,
Bmr027.F.dialogueact509	970.064	970.334	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact510	970.833	972.753	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	2	and they 'll just call them up and say , you know , " have you {disfmarker}
Bmr027.B.dialogueact511	973.47	979.02	B	Professor	s^cs:s	+1	2	Is {disfmarker} is this OK ? And would you please mail {disfmarker} you know , mail Adam that it is , if i if it , you know , is or not . "
Bmr027.B.dialogueact512	979.9	981.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So , you know , we can {disfmarker} we can do that .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact513	979.9	992.33	E	PhD	s	+1	3	The other thing that there 's a psychological effect that {disfmarker} at least for most people , that if they 've responded to your email saying " yes , I will do it " or " yes , I got your email " , they 're more likely to actually do it {comment} {pause} later {pause} than to just ignore it .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact514	990.619	991.029	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact515	992.833	994.643	E	PhD	s	-1	0	And of course we don't want them to bleep things out ,
Bmr027.E.dialogueact516	994.643	1004.06	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but it {disfmarker} it 's a little bit better if we 're getting the {disfmarker} their , uh , final response , once they 've answered you once than if they never answer you 'd {comment} at al at all .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact517	1004.83	1006.1	E	PhD	s	-1	0	That 's how these mailing houses work .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact518	1006.1	1008.33	E	PhD	s	-1	0	So , I mean , it 's not completely lost work
Bmr027.E.dialogueact519	1008.33	1011.56	E	PhD	s	-1	0	because it might benefit us in terms of getting {pause} responses .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact520	1009.46	1009.59	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact521	1012.53	1018.21	E	PhD	s	+1	2	You know , an official OK from somebody {pause} is better than no answer , even if they responded that they got your email .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact522	1018.21	1021.64	E	PhD	s	-1	0	And they 're probably more likely to do that once they 've responded that they got the email .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact523	1021.75	1023.37	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I also think they 'd just simply appreciate it .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact524	1023.44	1027.98	A	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	I think it 's a good {disfmarker} a good way of {disfmarker} of fostering goodwill among our subjects .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact525	1028.49	1029.83	A	Postdoc	s^bsc	-1	0	Well , our participants .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact526	1029.08	1032.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I think the main thing is {disfmarker} I mean , what lawyers do is they always look at worst cases .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact527	1030.49	1031.36	F	Grad	s	-1	0	Sending lots of spam .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact528	1032.25	1034.6	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So they s so {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} Tha - that 's what they 're paid to do .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact529	1032.61	1032.77	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact530	1034.78	1039.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And so , {vocalsound} it is certainly possible that , uh , somebody 's server would be down or something
Bmr027.B.dialogueact531	1039.1	1041.12	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and they wouldn't actually hear from us ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact532	1041.12	1042.63	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then they find this thing is in there
Bmr027.B.dialogueact533	1042.63	1044.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and we 've already distributed it to someone .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact534	1044.17	1049.05	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So , {vocalsound} what it says in there , in fact , is that they will be given an opportunity to blah - blah - blah ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact535	1048.1	1048.24	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact536	1049.28	1057.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but if in fact {disfmarker} if we sent them something or we thought we sent them something but they didn't actually receive it for some reason , {vocalsound} um , then we haven't given them that .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact537	1056.79	1058.65	F	Grad	fg|qw	-1	0	Well , so how far do we have to go ?
Bmr027.F.dialogueact538	1058.65	1060.15	F	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Do we need to get someone 's signature ?

Bmr027.F.dialogueact554	1083.42	1086.03	F	Grad	s	-1	0	If they don't submit the form , it goes in the general web log .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact555	1086.45	1087.72	F	Grad	s	-1	0	But that 's not sufficient .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact556	1088.1	1088.36	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact557	1088.79	1088.92	F	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr027.F.dialogueact558	1088.92	1092.75	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Cuz if someone just visits the web site that doesn't {pause} imply anything in particular .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact559	1093.02	1094.51	C	PhD	s^2^aap	-1	0	Except that you know they got the mail .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact560	1094.57	1095.26	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm . That 's right .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact561	1094.65	1094.87	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact562	1095.52	1098.01	A	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I could get you on the notify list if you want me to .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact563	1098.24	1098.83	F	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	I 'm already on it .

Bmr027.A.dialogueact566	1100.89	1101.43	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK , great .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact565	1100.51	1100.76	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact567	1105.03	1110.36	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So again , hopefully , um , this shouldn't be quite as odious a problem either way ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact568	1110.58	1112.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh , in any of the extremes we 've talked about
Bmr027.B.dialogueact569	1112.51	1117.11	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because {vocalsound} uh , we 're talking a pretty small {pause} number of people .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact570	1114.9	1115.18	F	Grad	%-	-1	0	W
Bmr027.F.dialogueact571	1116.03	1117.61	F	Grad	s	-1	0	For this set , I 'm not worried ,
Bmr027.F.dialogueact572	1117.61	1120.53	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because {pause} we basically know everyone on it .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact573	1118.54	1118.99	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact574	1120.57	1120.75	A	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact575	1120.98	1121.33	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact576	1121.1	1122.42	F	Grad	s	-1	0	You know , they 're all more or less here
Bmr027.F.dialogueact577	1122.42	1124.63	F	Grad	s	-1	0	or it 's {disfmarker} it 's Eric and Dan and so on .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact578	1125.14	1131.58	F	Grad	s	-1	0	But for some of the others , you 're talking about visitors who are {pause} gone from ICSI , whose email addresses may or may not work ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact579	1129.3	1129.7	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact581	1131.93	1132.19	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact580	1131.9	1132.31	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact582	1132.19	1132.74	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr027.F.dialogueact583	1134.61	1138.04	F	Grad	qw	+1	3	So what are we gonna do when we run into someone that we can't get in touch with ?
Bmr027.A.dialogueact584	1138.58	1141.27	A	Postdoc	s	+1	3	I don't think , uh {disfmarker} They 're so recent , these visitors .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact586	1141.35	1141.6	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact585	1141.35	1143.87	A	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	I {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and I {disfmarker} they 're also so {disfmarker}
Bmr027.B.dialogueact587	1142.17	1142.82	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact588	1144.57	1146.82	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	They 're prominent enough that they 're easy to find through {disfmarker}
Bmr027.A.dialogueact589	1146.86	1151.51	A	Postdoc	s	+1	3	I {disfmarker} I mean , I {disfmarker} I w I 'll be able to {disfmarker} if you have any trouble finding them , I really think I could find them .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact590	1147.37	1148.0	F	Grad	qy^2^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Other methods ?
Bmr027.F.dialogueact591	1151.45	1151.72	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact592	1153.92	1158.1	B	Professor	fg|s^df	-1	0	Yeah . Cuz it {disfmarker} what it {disfmarker} what it really does promise here is that we will ask their permission .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact593	1158.88	1165.52	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Um , and I think , you know , if you go into a room and close the door and {disfmarker} and ask their permission {vocalsound} and they 're not there , it doesn't seem {comment} that
Bmr027.B.dialogueact594	1165.52	1167.32	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that 's the intent of , uh , meaning here .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact595	1167.32	1167.67	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact596	1168.11	1171.1	F	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , the qu the question is just whether {disfmarker} how active it has to be .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact597	1171.1	1173.65	F	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , because they {disfmarker} they filled out a contact information
Bmr027.F.dialogueact598	1173.65	1175.16	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and that 's where I 'm sending the information .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact599	1175.08	1175.37	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact600	1175.7	1177.32	F	Grad	s	-1	0	And so far everyone has done email .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact601	1177.32	1180.66	F	Grad	s	-1	0	There isn't anyone who did , uh , any other contact method .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact602	1180.76	1188.78	B	Professor	s	+1	2	Well , the way ICSI goes , people , uh , who , uh , were here ten years ago still have acc {vocalsound} have forwards to other accounts and so on .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact603	1185.9	1186.13	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact604	1188.78	1190.5	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	So it 's unusual that {disfmarker} that they , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr027.F.dialogueact605	1189.83	1192.89	F	Grad	s	-1	0	So my original impression was that that was sufficient ,
Bmr027.F.dialogueact606	1193.03	1199.86	F	Grad	s	+1	3	that if they give us contact information and that contact information isn't accurate that {pause} we fulfilled our burden .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact607	1193.53	1194.14	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact608	1194.97	1196.05	E	PhD	s^2	-1	0	Then they just come back .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact609	1198.53	1199.84	C	PhD	s	-1	0	All my files were still here .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact610	1200.05	1200.89	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Same as us .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact611	1200.83	1201.23	A	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	I just {disfmarker}
Bmr027.B.dialogueact612	1200.93	1204.98	B	Professor	s	+1	3	So if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe I will call the attorney about it .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact613	1201.11	1201.32	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact614	1204.32	1204.52	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact615	1205.16	1206.61	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But , you know , hopefully we won't need to .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact616	1206.41	1207.6	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I d I just don't think we will .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact618	1208.3	1209.61	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	For all the reasons that we 've discussed .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact617	1207.89	1208.15	F	Grad	s^bk^rt	-1	0	Alright .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact619	1209.43	1210.73	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll see if we do or not .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact620	1210.07	1212.77	F	Grad	fg|s^cc	-1	0	Yep . And we 'll see how many people respond to that email .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact621	1210.87	1211.16	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact622	1212.86	1214.26	F	Grad	s	-1	0	So far , two people have .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact623	1214.43	1215.9	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah . I think very few people will
Bmr027.F.dialogueact624	1214.62	1214.87	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact625	1215.9	1224.06	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , you know , people {disfmarker} people see long emails about things that they don't think {vocalsound} is gonna be high priority , they typically , uh , don't {disfmarker} don't read it , or half read it .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact626	1224.22	1224.49	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact627	1225.09	1226.04	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Cuz people are swamped .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact629	1226.56	1227.29	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And actually ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact628	1226.41	1226.64	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr027.A.dialogueact630	1227.52	1229.78	A	Postdoc	fh|s^df	-1	0	um , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} didn't anticipate this
Bmr027.A.dialogueact631	1229.78	1231.52	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	so I {disfmarker} that 's why I didn't give this comment ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact632	1231.57	1242.88	A	Postdoc	s^cs:s	+1	2	and it {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} this discussion has made me think it might be nice to have a follow - up email within the next couple of days saying " by the way , you know , we wanna hear back from you by X date
Bmr027.A.dialogueact633	1244.21	1245.14	A	Postdoc	s^cs.%--:s.%--	-1	0	and please {disfmarker} " ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact634	1245.14	1246.26	A	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	and then add what Liz said {disfmarker}
Bmr027.A.dialogueact635	1246.45	1249.32	A	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	" please , uh , respond to {disfmarker} please indicate you received this mail . "
Bmr027.B.dialogueact636	1250.07	1253.24	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Uh , or e well , maybe even additionally , uh , um ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact637	1253.69	1259.19	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	" Even if you 've decided you have no changes you 'd like to make , if you could tell us that " .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact638	1258.39	1259.53	F	Grad	s^2^cs|s^aa	-1	0	Respond to the email . {comment} Yep .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact639	1259.36	1259.66	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact642	1259.85	1261.17	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It is the first time through the cycle .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact641	1259.48	1259.83	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact640	1259.38	1262.03	E	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	Right . That would {disfmarker} that would definitely work on me .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact643	1262.03	1263.77	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	You know , it makes you feel m like ,
Bmr027.E.dialogueact644	1264.69	1265.07	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bmr027.E.dialogueact645	1265.47	1270.23	E	PhD	s	-1	0	if you were gonna p if you 're predicting that you might not answer , you have a chance now to say that .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact646	1271.35	1273.98	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Whereas , I {disfmarker} I mean , I would be much more likely myself ,
Bmr027.C.dialogueact647	1274.37	1274.97	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	And the other th
Bmr027.E.dialogueact648	1274.44	1279.24	E	PhD	s:s	-1	0	given all my email , t to respond at that point , saying " you know what , I 'm probably not gonna get to it " or whatever ,
Bmr027.E.dialogueact649	1279.83	1282.31	E	PhD	s	-1	0	rather than just having seen the email , thinking I might get to it ,
Bmr027.E.dialogueact650	1282.31	1286.74	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and never really , {vocalsound} uh , pushing myself to actually do it until it 's too late .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact651	1284.01	1284.65	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	Yeah . I was {disfmarker}
Bmr027.C.dialogueact652	1286.67	1292.25	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I was thinking that it also {pause} lets them know that they don't have to go to the page to {pause} accept this .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact653	1291.4	1293.25	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right . R Right . That 's true .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact654	1292.58	1292.9	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact655	1293.24	1293.9	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}
Bmr027.C.dialogueact656	1293.9	1294.17	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact657	1294.17	1299.68	C	PhD	s	-1	0	So that way they could {disfmarker} they can see from that email that if they just write back and say " I got it , no changes " , they 're off the hook .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact658	1299.05	1299.44	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact659	1299.68	1300.86	C	PhD	s	-1	0	They don't have to go to the web page
Bmr027.B.dialogueact661	1301.25	1314.47	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , the other thing I 've learned from dealing with {disfmarker} dealing with people sending in reviews and so forth , uh , is , um , {vocalsound} if you say " you 've got three months to do this review " , {vocalsound} um , people do it , you know , {vocalsound} two and seven eighths months from now .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact660	1300.86	1300.98	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr027.E.dialogueact662	1301.76	1302.68	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah . That 's true .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact664	1314.47	1320.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	If you say " you 've got three weeks to do this review " , they do {disfmarker} do it , you know , two and seven eighths weeks from now {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they do the review .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact663	1314.17	1314.45	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact665	1320.25	1322.51	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	And , um {disfmarker} So ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact666	1323.42	1326.26	B	Professor	s^cs.%-	-1	0	if we make it {pause} a little less time , I don't think it 'll be that much {disfmarker}
Bmr027.F.dialogueact667	1325.69	1329.71	F	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Well , and also if we want it ready by the fifteenth , that means we better give them deadline of the first ,
Bmr027.F.dialogueact668	1329.96	1333.53	F	Grad	s	-1	0	if we have any prayer of actually getting everyone to respond in time .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact669	1334.52	1335.55	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	There 's the responding part
Bmr027.B.dialogueact670	1335.55	1336.68	B	Professor	qh.%--	-1	0	and there 's also what if ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact671	1336.91	1338.65	B	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	uh , I mean , I hope this doesn't happen ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact672	1338.79	1342.04	B	Professor	qh	-1	0	what if there are a bunch of deletions that have to get put in and changes ?
Bmr027.F.dialogueact673	1341.3	1341.54	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact674	1342.04	1343.96	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Then {vocalsound} we actually have to deal with that
Bmr027.A.dialogueact675	1343.46	1344.34	A	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	Mm - hmm . Some lead time .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact676	1343.96	1344.62	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	if we want it to {disfmarker}

Bmr027.E.dialogueact691	1360.29	1361.69	E	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah . You have to do all of them ,
Bmr027.F.dialogueact690	1360.18	1361.21	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	You need all the channels .
Bmr027.D.dialogueact692	1361.14	1361.93	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact693	1362.33	1363.64	C	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Do you have to do the other close - talking ?
Bmr027.E.dialogueact694	1362.37	1363.5	E	PhD	s^e	-1	0	as well as all of these .
Bmr027.D.dialogueact695	1363.32	1363.77	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact698	1364.4	1367.4	E	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	You have to do all {disfmarker} You could just do it in that time period , though ,
Bmr027.F.dialogueact697	1364.09	1366.54	F	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yes . Absolutely . There 's a lot of cross - talk .
Bmr027.G.dialogueact696	1363.65	1363.92	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Wow .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact699	1365.2	1365.35	A	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bmr027.E.dialogueact700	1367.4	1368.48	E	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	but I guess it 's a pain .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact701	1369.02	1370.44	F	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	Well , but you have to copy the whole file .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact702	1370.31	1370.83	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact703	1370.53	1370.77	F	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr027.F.dialogueact704	1370.77	1372.32	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Because we 're gonna be releasing the whole file .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact705	1372.22	1373.13	E	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yeah . You 're right .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact706	1372.88	1378.3	A	Postdoc	s	+1	2	Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} you know , I think at a certain point , that copy that has the deletions will become the master copy .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact707	1378.63	1380.56	F	Grad	s^am|s	-1	0	Yeah . It 's just I hate deleting any data .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact708	1380.91	1385.65	F	Grad	s	+1	2	So I {disfmarker} I don't want {disfmarker} I really would rather make a copy of it , rather than bleep it out
Bmr027.B.dialogueact709	1384.89	1387.16	B	Professor	qy^rt	+1	2	Are you del are you bleeping it by adding ?
Bmr027.F.dialogueact710	1385.65	1386.2	F	Grad	%-	+1	1	and then {disfmarker}
Bmr027.F.dialogueact711	1388.28	1388.92	F	Grad	s	+1	1	Overlapping .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact712	1389.31	1391.81	F	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	So , it 's {disfmarker} it 's exactly a censor bleep .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact713	1392.63	1394.93	F	Grad	s^cs^rt.%--:s^fe.%--	+1	1	So what I really think is " bleep "
Bmr027.B.dialogueact714	1393.52	1393.83	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	I I
Bmr027.B.dialogueact715	1394.73	1395.31	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	I I understand ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact717	1395.31	1397.03	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	but is {disfmarker} is it summing signals
Bmr027.F.dialogueact716	1394.99	1395.6	F	Grad	s^cs.%-	-1	0	and then I want to {disfmarker}
Bmr027.B.dialogueact718	1397.03	1399.49	B	Professor	qrr	-1	0	or do you {pause} delete the old one and put the new one in ?
Bmr027.F.dialogueact719	1399.13	1400.62	F	Grad	s	-1	0	I delete the old one , put the new one in .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact720	1400.39	1400.7	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact722	1400.7	1401.02	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	Cuz {disfmarker}
Bmr027.F.dialogueact721	1400.62	1402.16	F	Grad	s	-1	0	There 's nothing left of the original signal .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact723	1401.79	1403.05	B	Professor	fg|s^cs.%--	-1	0	Oh . Cuz if you were summing , you could {disfmarker}
Bmr027.B.dialogueact724	1403.41	1403.83	B	Professor	s^ar|s^bd.%--	-1	0	No . But anyway {disfmarker}
Bmr027.F.dialogueact725	1404.0	1406.18	F	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yeah . It would be qui quite easy to get it back again .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact726	1406.45	1410.52	A	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} And then w I was gonna say also that the they don't have to stay on the system , as you know ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact727	1406.56	1406.75	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact728	1407.67	1410.16	E	PhD	s^cs^j^t3	-1	0	Then someday we can sell the {pause} unedited versions .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact729	1410.52	1412.51	A	Postdoc	s^df.%-	-1	0	cuz {disfmarker} cuz the {disfmarker} the ones {disfmarker}
Bmr027.F.dialogueact730	1410.97	1411.38	F	Grad	qw^br^co	-1	0	Say again ?
Bmr027.A.dialogueact731	1413.0	1416.67	A	Postdoc	qy.%-	-1	0	Once it 's been successfully bleeped , can't you rely on the {disfmarker} ?
Bmr027.C.dialogueact732	1414.29	1416.44	C	PhD	s^cs^j^t3	-1	0	Or {pause} we 'll tell people the frequency of the beep
Bmr027.B.dialogueact733	1415.57	1416.12	B	Professor	s^cs^j	-1	0	Encrypt it .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact735	1416.44	1417.95	C	PhD	s^cs^e^j^t3	-1	0	and then they could subtract the beep out .
Bmr027.D.dialogueact734	1416.23	1417.16	D	Grad	s^cs^j|s^aa	-1	0	You can hide it . Yeah .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact737	1417.36	1420.06	A	Postdoc	qy^r	-1	0	Can't you rely on the archiving to preserve the older version ?
Bmr027.H.dialogueact736	1417.13	1417.68	H	PhD	s^aa^j^t3	-1	0	Oh , yeah .
Bmr027.D.dialogueact739	1418.59	1421.04	D	Grad	s^ba^j^t3	-1	0	It wouldn't be that hard to hide it .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact738	1418.1	1419.13	E	PhD	s^aa^j^t3	-1	0	Right . Exactly . I see .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact740	1418.7	1420.6	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , that 's true . Yeah . Yep , that 's true .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact741	1419.54	1420.22	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	See , this is good .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact742	1420.22	1423.27	E	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	I wanted to create some {pause} side conversations in these meetings .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact744	1420.75	1421.13	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact743	1420.64	1422.17	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah . You could encrypt it ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact746	1422.93	1426.71	B	Professor	s^cs.%-	-1	0	you know , with a {disfmarker} with a two hundred bit {disfmarker} {vocalsound} thousand bit , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr027.D.dialogueact745	1422.61	1423.63	D	Grad	s^cs^j	-1	0	You can use spread spectrum .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact747	1423.54	1423.82	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr027.D.dialogueact749	1423.89	1424.49	D	Grad	s^cs^e^j	-1	0	Hide it .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact748	1423.57	1423.85	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr027.C.dialogueact750	1424.66	1425.17	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Here we go .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact751	1424.72	1425.89	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr027.D.dialogueact752	1425.39	1426.07	D	Grad	s^j^na	-1	0	Yeah , there you go .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact753	1426.06	1427.4	E	PhD	s^ba^df	-1	0	Cuz we don't have enough asides .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact754	1426.32	1426.97	H	PhD	s	-1	0	I have an idea .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact755	1426.97	1428.44	H	PhD	s^cs^j	-1	0	You reverse the signal ,
Bmr027.D.dialogueact757	1428.52	1428.99	D	Grad	s	-1	0	There you go .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact756	1428.44	1430.96	H	PhD	s	-1	0	so it {disfmarker} it lets people say what they said backwards .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact758	1430.76	1431.36	F	Grad	s	-1	0	Backwards .
Bmr027.D.dialogueact759	1432.62	1434.93	D	Grad	s	-1	0	Then you have , like , subliminal , uh , messages ,
Bmr027.F.dialogueact760	1432.72	1433.2	F	Grad	%-	-1	0	But ,
Bmr027.F.dialogueact761	1433.66	1438.34	F	Grad	qy	-1	0	ha you 've seen the {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact762	1433.98	1434.32	H	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.D.dialogueact763	1434.93	1435.06	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	like .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact764	1438.46	1439.39	F	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Did you read that paper ?
Bmr027.F.dialogueact766	1439.92	1440.57	F	Grad	s	-1	0	It wouldn't work .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact765	1439.53	1439.83	H	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact767	1440.57	1442.03	F	Grad	s	-1	0	The speech recognizer still works .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact768	1442.13	1443.81	E	PhD	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah . And if you do it backward then {disfmarker}
Bmr027.B.dialogueact769	1445.05	1445.36	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact770	1445.66	1447.0	C	PhD	s	-1	0	That 's cuz they use forward - backward .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact771	1445.82	1447.27	E	PhD	s^ba^j	-1	0	H - good old HMM .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact772	1447.41	1448.79	F	Grad	s^bk^m|s^aa	-1	0	Forward but backward . That 's right .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact773	1447.95	1449.31	E	PhD	s^ar|s	-1	0	No , it 's backward - forward .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact774	1448.79	1449.25	F	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Good point .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact775	1450.44	1450.93	F	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	A point .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact776	1453.28	1455.5	F	Grad	fg|s^fa	-1	0	Well , I 'm sorry if I sound a little peeved about this whole thing .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact777	1455.5	1458.15	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	It 's just we 've had meeting after meeting after meeting a on this
Bmr027.F.dialogueact778	1458.15	1459.99	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and it seems like we 've never gotten it resolved .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact780	1461.13	1461.71	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact779	1460.65	1462.74	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , but we never also {disfmarker} we 've also never done it .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact781	1461.84	1461.91	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	Uh .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact782	1461.98	1462.29	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact784	1463.13	1463.95	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	This is the first cycle .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact785	1463.19	1463.88	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	If it makes {disfmarker}
Bmr027.F.dialogueact783	1462.77	1463.03	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact786	1463.95	1465.6	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	There 're bound to be some glitches the first time through .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact787	1465.9	1469.04	B	Professor	s^fa	-1	0	So . {vocalsound} And , uh {disfmarker} and I 'm sorry responding without , uh , having much knowledge ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact788	1469.04	1472.13	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but the thing is , uh , I am , like , one of these people who gets a gazillion mails
Bmr027.B.dialogueact789	1472.13	1474.07	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and stuff comes in as
Bmr027.F.dialogueact790	1472.77	1474.78	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Well , and that 's exactly why I did it the way I did it ,
Bmr027.F.dialogueact791	1474.78	1477.46	F	Grad	s	-1	0	which is the default is if you do nothing we 're gonna release it .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact793	1477.78	1478.09	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact792	1477.46	1482.34	F	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	Because , you know , I have my {pause} stack of emails of to d to be done ,
Bmr027.F.dialogueact794	1482.79	1484.26	F	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	that , you know , fifty or sixty long ,
Bmr027.F.dialogueact795	1484.26	1486.03	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and the ones at the top I 'm never gonna get to .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact796	1486.42	1486.78	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact797	1486.71	1488.68	F	Grad	fg	-1	0	And , uh {pause} So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker}
Bmr027.C.dialogueact798	1487.58	1488.3	C	PhD	s^cs^j	-1	0	Move them to the bottom .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact800	1489.72	1495.05	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so the only thing we 're missing is {disfmarker} is some way to respond to easily to say , uh , " OK , go ahead " or something .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact799	1489.39	1489.96	F	Grad	s^aa^j	-1	0	Yeah , right .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact801	1490.98	1492.27	F	Grad	qy.%-	-1	0	So , i this is gonna mean {disfmarker}
Bmr027.C.dialogueact802	1493.89	1495.89	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Just re - mail them to yourself and then they 're at the bottom .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact803	1495.05	1495.35	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact804	1495.13	1495.34	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr027.F.dialogueact805	1496.41	1497.86	F	Grad	fg|s^ba	-1	0	Yeah . That 's actually definitely a good point .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact807	1497.86	1503.87	F	Grad	s	-1	0	The m email doesn't specify that you can just reply to the email , as op as opposed to going to the form
Bmr027.A.dialogueact809	1503.42	1503.73	A	Postdoc	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact808	1503.13	1503.4	H	PhD	%-	-1	0	In {disfmarker}
Bmr027.A.dialogueact812	1504.2	1506.52	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And it also doesn't give a {disfmarker} a specific {disfmarker} I didn't think of it .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact810	1503.81	1504.23	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact811	1503.87	1504.01	F	Grad	%-	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr027.A.dialogueact813	1506.7	1511.77	A	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	S I think it 's a good idea {disfmarker} an ex explicit time by which this will be considered definite .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact814	1511.03	1511.69	F	Grad	fg|s^2	-1	0	Yeah , release .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact815	1512.36	1514.3	A	Postdoc	s^co^e	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and it has to be a time earlier than that endpoint .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact816	1514.93	1516.17	B	Professor	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	Yeah . It 's converging .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact818	1517.09	1517.67	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah . That 's right .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact817	1516.63	1518.63	H	PhD	s	-1	0	This {disfmarker} um , I 've seen this recently .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact819	1518.63	1519.56	H	PhD	s	-1	0	Uh , I got email ,

Bmr027.A.dialogueact822	1530.95	1532.54	A	Postdoc	s^ba^rt	-1	0	Oh , that 's interesting .
Bmr027.D.dialogueact821	1530.79	1531.02	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact823	1531.18	1531.74	H	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr027.F.dialogueact824	1531.88	1532.49	F	Grad	%-	-1	0	You {disfmarker} you can {disfmarker}
Bmr027.D.dialogueact826	1532.93	1534.36	D	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's like certified mail .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact825	1532.89	1535.14	F	Grad	s^bd	-1	0	A lot of mailers support return receipt .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact827	1534.05	1534.74	A	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	Could do that .

Bmr027.F.dialogueact893	1619.25	1620.69	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	You could put wed bugs in the email .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact895	1620.35	1620.85	E	PhD	qw.%-	-1	0	How m
Bmr027.H.dialogueact896	1620.41	1620.67	H	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact897	1621.01	1623.0	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Like , there were three meetings this time , or so
Bmr027.A.dialogueact899	1623.42	1623.85	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Six .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact898	1623.0	1623.78	E	PhD	qw	-1	0	or how many ?
Bmr027.E.dialogueact900	1623.78	1624.28	E	PhD	s^bk^rt	-1	0	Six ?
Bmr027.E.dialogueact901	1624.6	1626.32	E	PhD	s	-1	0	But , no of different people .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact902	1626.32	1628.84	E	PhD	s^ba	+1	1	So I guess if you 're in both these types of meetings , you 'd have a lot .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact903	1628.84	1629.99	E	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} How {disfmarker}
Bmr027.E.dialogueact904	1630.33	1632.26	E	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	I mean , it also depends on how many {disfmarker}
Bmr027.E.dialogueact905	1632.93	1636.2	E	PhD	s^ba	+1	1	Like , if we release {disfmarker} this time it 's a fairly small number of meetings ,
Bmr027.E.dialogueact906	1636.19	1638.67	E	PhD	qh^cs	-1	0	but what if we release , like , twenty - five meetings to people ?
Bmr027.E.dialogueact908	1639.66	1639.92	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	In th
Bmr027.F.dialogueact907	1639.32	1646.18	F	Grad	s	+1	1	Well , what my s expectation is , is that we 'll send out one of these emails {pause} every time a meeting has been checked and is ready .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact909	1640.72	1641.04	E	PhD	s^bd^no	-1	0	I don't know .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact910	1646.43	1647.13	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh . Oh , OK .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact912	1647.56	1649.68	E	PhD	s|s^bk	-1	0	So this time was just the first chunk . OK .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact911	1647.36	1648.75	F	Grad	s	-1	0	So . Tha - that was my intention .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact913	1648.75	1649.06	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	It 's just {disfmarker}
Bmr027.F.dialogueact914	1649.06	1649.28	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah {disfmarker}
Bmr027.F.dialogueact915	1649.28	1651.18	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	that we just happened to have a bunch all at once .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact916	1650.44	1651.39	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Well , that 's a good idea .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact917	1651.9	1652.41	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , maybe {disfmarker}
Bmr027.F.dialogueact918	1652.41	1653.96	F	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Is that {pause} the way it 's gonna be , you think , Jane ?
Bmr027.A.dialogueact919	1653.17	1653.76	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I agree with you .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact920	1654.13	1656.73	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} we could do it , uh {disfmarker} I I could {disfmarker} I 'd be happy with either way ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact921	1656.73	1657.24	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	batch - wise {disfmarker}
Bmr027.A.dialogueact922	1657.24	1657.95	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	What I was thinking {disfmarker}
Bmr027.A.dialogueact923	1657.95	1658.69	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	Uh , so this one {disfmarker}
Bmr027.A.dialogueact924	1658.83	1659.88	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	That was exactly right ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact925	1659.95	1660.66	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	that we had a {disfmarker} uh , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr027.A.dialogueact926	1660.96	1664.03	A	Postdoc	s^rt	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I had wanted to get the entire set of twelve hours ready .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact927	1664.5	1665.08	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Don't have it .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact928	1665.36	1669.45	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But , uh , this was the biggest clump I could do by a time where I thought it was reasonable .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact929	1668.91	1669.61	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact930	1669.45	1671.5	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	People would be able to check it and still have it ready by then .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact931	1671.94	1676.55	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	My , um {disfmarker} I was thinking that with the {pause} NSA meetings , I 'd like {disfmarker} there are three of them ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact932	1676.55	1680.37	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and they 're {disfmarker} uh , I {disfmarker} I will have them done by Monday .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact933	1680.81	1682.48	A	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	Uh , unfortunately the time is later
Bmr027.A.dialogueact934	1682.48	1683.69	A	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	and I don't know how that 's gonna work out ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact935	1683.69	1685.9	A	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	but I thought it 'd be good to have that released as a clump , too ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact936	1685.9	1689.28	A	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	because then , {vocalsound} you know , they 're {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they have a {disfmarker} it it 's in a category ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact937	1689.28	1691.49	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it 's not quite so distracting to them , is what I was thinking ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact938	1691.59	1692.69	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and it 's all in one chu
Bmr027.A.dialogueact939	1692.88	1699.67	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But after that , when we 're caught up a bit on this process , then , um , I could imagine sending them out periodically as they become available .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact940	1700.26	1700.61	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact941	1700.82	1701.69	A	Postdoc	s^cs^rt	-1	0	I could do it either way .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact942	1701.69	1704.44	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean , it 's a question of how distracting it is to the people who have to do the checking .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact943	1708.49	1709.59	B	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt^t^tc	+1	2	We heard anything from IBM ?
Bmr027.B.dialogueact944	1710.36	1710.67	B	Professor	s^e^rt	-1	0	at all ?
Bmr027.C.dialogueact945	1710.9	1712.62	C	PhD	h|s	-1	0	Uh . Let 's see .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact946	1712.62	1713.31	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	We {disfmarker}
Bmr027.C.dialogueact947	1713.31	1713.67	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , right .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact948	1713.67	1715.86	C	PhD	s	+1	2	So we got the transcript back from that one meeting .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact949	1715.86	1717.0	C	PhD	s^ba^rt	+1	2	Everything seemed fine .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact950	1717.12	1722.76	C	PhD	s	+1	3	Adam {pause} had a script that will {pause} put everything back together and there was {disfmarker} Well , there was one small problem but it was a simple thing to fix .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact951	1723.47	1727.98	C	PhD	s	-1	0	And then , um , {vocalsound} we , uh {disfmarker} I sent him a pointer to three more .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact952	1728.65	1732.26	C	PhD	s	-1	0	And so he 's {pause} off and {pause} working on those .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact953	1731.38	1736.62	F	Grad	fg|s	+1	3	Yeah . Now we haven't actually had anyone go through that meeting , to see whether the transcript is correct
Bmr027.F.dialogueact954	1736.62	1738.98	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and to see how much was missed and all that sort of stuff .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact955	1738.91	1739.71	A	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	That 's on my list .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact956	1738.98	1740.38	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	So at some point we need to do that .

Bmr027.A.dialogueact958	1740.38	1741.16	A	Postdoc	s^r	-1	0	Well , that 's on my list .
Bmr027.C.dialogueact959	1741.64	1744.32	C	PhD	fg|s	+1	2	Yeah . It 's gonna have to go through our regular process .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact960	1743.8	1746.43	F	Grad	s	+1	2	I mean , the one thing I noticed is it did miss a lot of backchannels .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact961	1746.43	1749.96	F	Grad	s	-1	0	There are a fair number of " yeahs " and " uh - huhs " that {disfmarker} it 's just {disfmarker} that aren't in there .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact962	1750.42	1750.72	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact963	1751.78	1751.91	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Hmm .

Bmr027.E.dialogueact1008	1836.13	1837.09	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I think they 're doing w
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1007	1836.1	1836.43	H	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact1009	1837.09	1840.94	E	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	didn't they want to do language modeling on , you know , recognition - compatible transcripts
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1010	1839.06	1840.65	H	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh . I see .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1013	1841.69	1844.99	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	This is to show you , uh , some of the things that turn up during the checking procedure .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact1011	1841.26	1841.42	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact1012	1841.28	1841.31	E	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1014	1846.35	1848.46	A	Postdoc	s	+1	2	Um @ @ {comment} So , this is from one of the NSA meetings
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1015	1848.46	1852.32	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and , uh , i if you 're familiar with the diff format , the arrow to the left is what it was ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1016	1852.32	1855.15	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and the arrow to the right is {pause} what it was changed to .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1017	1855.15	1855.49	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1018	1856.61	1857.25	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	um . {vocalsound} And now the first one .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1019	1857.25	1858.76	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	" OK . So , then we started a weekly meeting .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1020	1858.91	1861.98	A	Postdoc	s^ba:s	-1	0	The last time , uh {disfmarker} " And the transcriber thought " little too much "
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1021	1863.13	1864.45	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	But , {vocalsound} uh ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1022	1865.68	1867.73	A	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	really , um , it was " we learned too much " ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1023	1867.94	1869.67	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	which makes more sense syntactically as well .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1024	1869.51	1871.99	H	PhD	s^bu.%-	-1	0	And these {disfmarker} the parentheses were f from {disfmarker}
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1025	1870.61	1870.87	A	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	Then {disfmarker}
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1026	1871.69	1873.93	A	Postdoc	s^bk|s	-1	0	Oh , this {disfmarker} that 's the convention for indicating uncertain .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1027	1872.01	1873.0	F	Grad	s	-1	0	U uncertains .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1028	1873.93	1875.32	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So the transcriber was right .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1029	1874.49	1874.79	H	PhD	%-	-1	0	S
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1030	1875.52	1876.97	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	You know , she was uncertain about that .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1031	1876.73	1877.12	H	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1032	1877.29	1878.58	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So she 's right to be uncertain .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1034	1879.09	1881.07	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And it 's also a g a good indication of the {disfmarker} of that .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1033	1879.03	1879.81	H	PhD	b	-1	0	Oh . {comment} OK .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1035	1881.07	1883.39	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	The next one . This was about , uh , Claudia
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1036	1883.39	1886.8	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and {pause} she 'd been really b busy with stuff , such as waivers .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1037	1888.66	1889.1	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Uh , OK .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1038	1889.39	1890.39	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Um , next one .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1039	1890.39	1892.45	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Um . {vocalsound} This was {pause} an interesting one .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1040	1892.69	1896.42	A	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	So the original was " So that 's not {disfmarker} so Claudia 's not the bad master here " ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1041	1896.86	1897.73	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and then he laughs ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1043	1897.73	1899.04	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but it really " web master " .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1042	1897.5	1898.14	F	Grad	s	-1	0	Web master .
Bmr027.D.dialogueact1044	1898.35	1899.48	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh . {comment} Uh - oh .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1045	1900.7	1904.68	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And then you see another type of uncertainty which is , you know , they just didn't know what to make out of that .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1046	1904.78	1907.8	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So instead of " split upon unknown " , {comment} it 's " split in principle " .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1047	1904.8	1904.97	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr027.D.dialogueact1048	1907.87	1909.22	D	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Jane , these are from IBM ?
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1049	1908.41	1909.01	F	Grad	qy^bu^d^t3	-1	0	Spit upon ?
Bmr027.D.dialogueact1050	1909.22	1910.03	D	Grad	s^e^rt	-1	0	The top lines ?
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1051	1909.95	1913.61	A	Postdoc	s^ar|s	+1	2	No , no . These are {disfmarker} these are our local transcriptions of the NSA meetings .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1052	1910.31	1911.57	F	Grad	s^ar|s	-1	0	No , these are {pause} ours .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1054	1913.75	1916.77	A	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	The transcribers {disfmarker} transcriber 's version ver versus the checked version .
Bmr027.D.dialogueact1053	1913.67	1914.14	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr027.D.dialogueact1055	1916.79	1917.23	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , I see .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1056	1917.36	1918.97	A	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	My {disfmarker} my checked version , after I go through it .
Bmr027.D.dialogueact1057	1918.19	1918.42	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1058	1919.57	1920.79	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Um , then you get down here .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1059	1921.1	1921.51	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1060	1921.98	1925.37	A	Postdoc	s	+1	2	Sometimes some speakers will insert foreign language terms .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1061	1925.37	1926.35	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	That 's the next example ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1062	1926.35	1926.88	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	the next one .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1063	1927.52	1929.82	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	The , uh , version beyond this is {disfmarker}
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1064	1929.82	1931.43	A	Postdoc	s.%--:s.%--	-1	0	So instead of saying " or " ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1065	1931.78	1935.24	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	especially those words , " also " and " oder " and some other ones .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1066	1935.3	1935.99	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Those sneak in .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1067	1936.45	1937.53	A	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	Um , the next one {disfmarker}
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1069	1937.72	1938.23	F	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	That 's cool .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1068	1937.33	1938.21	H	PhD	s	-1	0	Discourse markers .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1071	1938.95	1939.23	A	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	S
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1070	1938.79	1939.67	H	PhD	s^r	-1	0	Discourse markers .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1072	1940.05	1940.42	A	Postdoc	s^fa|qw^rt	-1	0	Sorry , what ?
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1073	1940.69	1941.35	A	Postdoc	qy^bu^d^m^rt	-1	0	Discourse markers ?
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1075	1941.35	1942.11	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Sure . Sure , sure , sure .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1074	1940.95	1941.77	H	PhD	s^r	-1	0	Discourse markers .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1077	1942.22	1943.08	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	And it 's {disfmarker} and it makes sense
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1076	1941.77	1942.39	H	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1078	1943.08	1945.1	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	cuz it 's , like , below this {disfmarker} it 's a little subliminal there .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1079	1943.18	1943.47	H	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1080	1944.71	1945.3	H	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1081	1945.76	1947.05	A	Postdoc	fg|s	-1	0	Um . OK , the next one ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1082	1947.46	1948.89	A	Postdoc	s^rt	-1	0	uh , {vocalsound} this is a term .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1083	1948.98	1950.09	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	The problem with terminology .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1084	1950.09	1953.37	A	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	Description with th the transcriber has " X as an advance " .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1085	1953.37	1955.4	A	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	But really it 's " QS in advance " .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1086	1955.48	1958.55	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean , I {disfmarker} I 've benefited from some of these , uh , cross - group meetings .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1087	1958.8	1959.58	A	Postdoc	fg|s.%--	-1	0	OK , then you got ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1088	1959.58	1961.01	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	um , {vocalsound} uh ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1089	1961.19	1964.73	A	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	instead of " from something - or - other cards " , {comment} it 's " for multicast " .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1090	1965.5	1969.02	A	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	And instead of " ANN system related " , it 's " end system related " .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1091	1969.02	1970.61	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	This was changed to an acronym initially
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1092	1970.61	1971.73	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and it should shouldn't have been .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1093	1972.78	1976.94	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And then , you can see here " GPS " was misinterpreted .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1094	1977.49	1978.5	A	Postdoc	s^by.%--	-1	0	It 's just totally understanda
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1095	1978.5	1979.77	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	This is {disfmarker} this is a lot of jargon .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1096	1980.29	1981.55	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	Um , and the final one ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1097	1982.13	1984.88	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	the transcriber had th " in the core network itself
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1098	1985.19	1987.1	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	or the exit unknown ,

Bmr027.A.dialogueact1100	1989.31	1992.58	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And it {disfmarker} it comes through as " in the core network itself of the access provider ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1101	1992.58	1994.38	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	not the internet backbone core " .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1102	1994.47	1996.23	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Now this is a lot of {pause} terminology .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1104	1996.99	1998.6	A	Postdoc	s^ba.%--	-1	0	And they 're generally extremely good ,
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1103	1996.92	1997.33	H	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1105	1998.75	2002.54	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but , you know in this {disfmarker} this area it really does pay to , um {disfmarker} to double check
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1106	2002.54	2008.64	A	Postdoc	s	+1	2	and I 'm hoping that when the checked versions are run through the recognizer that you 'll see s substantial improvements in performance
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1107	2008.64	2010.47	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	cuz the {disfmarker} you know , there 're a lot of these in there .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1108	2011.07	2012.33	H	PhD	fg|qw.%-	-1	0	Yeah . So how often {disfmarker} ?
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1109	2011.6	2015.26	F	Grad	fg|s	+1	2	Yeah , but I bet {disfmarker} I bet they 're acoustically challenging parts anyway , though .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1111	2015.51	2016.16	A	Postdoc	s^ar	+1	2	No , actually no .
Bmr027.D.dialogueact1110	2015.33	2015.7	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1113	2016.67	2017.04	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Huh - uh .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1112	2016.27	2016.7	F	Grad	qy^bh	-1	0	Oh , really ?
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1114	2016.92	2017.27	F	Grad	%--	-1	0	Uh , it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1115	2017.27	2018.22	F	Grad	s^bk|s	+1	2	Oh , so it 's just jargon .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1116	2018.7	2019.36	A	Postdoc	s^bk^m|s^aa	-1	0	It 's jargon . Yeah .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1117	2019.36	2024.37	A	Postdoc	s^df	+1	2	I mean this is {disfmarker} cuz , you know you don't realize in daily life how much you have top - down influences in what you 're hearing .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1118	2020.08	2020.5	H	PhD	%-	-1	0	Well , but {disfmarker}
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1120	2025.0	2027.36	A	Postdoc	s	+1	2	And it 's jar it 's jargon coupled with a foreign accent .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1119	2024.83	2025.57	H	PhD	%-	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker}
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1121	2026.84	2030.45	H	PhD	s	+1	2	But we don't {disfmarker} I mean , our language model right now doesn't know about these words anyhow .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1122	2030.99	2031.29	H	PhD	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact1124	2032.31	2032.57	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1123	2031.94	2036.32	H	PhD	s	-1	0	you know , un until you actually {pause} get a decent language model , @ @ {comment} Adam 's right .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1125	2035.88	2036.87	F	Grad	s^2	-1	0	It probably won't do any better .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1126	2036.32	2037.95	H	PhD	s	-1	0	You probably won't notice a difference .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1127	2037.95	2040.2	H	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	But it 's {disfmarker} I mean , it 's definitely good that these are fixed .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1128	2040.2	2042.01	H	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	I mean , {vocalsound} obviously .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1130	2042.07	2044.3	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Well , also from the standpoint of getting people 's approval ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact1129	2041.59	2041.92	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1131	2044.3	2052.44	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	cuz if someone sees a page full of uh , um , barely decipherable w you know , sentences , and then is asked to approve of it or not , {vocalsound} it 's , uh , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1132	2049.47	2050.12	F	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Did I say that ?
Bmr027.B.dialogueact1133	2052.55	2052.84	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1135	2053.97	2054.09	A	Postdoc	b.x	-1	0	OK .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact1134	2053.85	2057.74	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah . That would be a shame if people said " well , I don't approve it because {pause} the {disfmarker} it 's not what I said " .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1136	2057.99	2060.04	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	Well , that 's exactly why I put the extra option in ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact1137	2058.93	2059.1	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1138	2060.15	2061.46	A	Postdoc	s^aa|s	-1	0	Exactly . That 's why we discussed that .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact1140	2060.27	2060.7	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1139	2060.21	2063.64	F	Grad	s	-1	0	is that I was afraid people would say , " let 's censor that because it 's wrong " ,
Bmr027.B.dialogueact1142	2063.93	2064.2	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1141	2063.82	2064.94	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and I don't want them to do that .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1143	2065.57	2070.57	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	And then I also {disfmarker} the final thing I have for transcription is that I made a purchase of some other headphones
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1144	2066.33	2066.4	H	PhD	%--	-1	0	C
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1145	2070.57	2073.09	A	Postdoc	s^df	+1	1	because of the problem of low gain in the originals .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1146	2073.46	2076.77	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	And {disfmarker} and they very much appro they mu much prefer the new ones ,
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1147	2076.77	2081.0	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and actually I {disfmarker} I mean , I {disfmarker} I think that there will be fewer things to correct because of the {disfmarker} the choice .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1148	2081.0	2084.62	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	We 'd originally chosen , uh , very expensive head headsets
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1149	2081.77	2081.94	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1150	2083.65	2083.72	F	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	Ugh !
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1151	2084.62	2091.11	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	but , um , they 're just not as good as these , um , in this {disfmarker} with this respect to this particular task .
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1152	2090.78	2091.86	H	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , return the old ones .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1153	2091.79	2093.61	F	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's probably impedance matching problems .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1155	2094.08	2094.79	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I don't know exactly ,
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1154	2093.78	2093.87	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1156	2094.79	2098.56	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	but we chose them because that 's what 's been used here by prominent projects in transcription .
Bmr027.B.dialogueact1157	2096.07	2096.37	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	Could be .
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1159	2098.56	2100.47	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So it i we had every reason to think they would work .
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1158	2098.36	2098.62	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .

Bmr027.E.dialogueact1482	2533.93	2537.85	E	PhD	s	+1	2	You know , before we were working with these segments that were all synchronous
Bmr027.E.dialogueact1483	2537.85	2539.54	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and that caused a lot of problems
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1484	2538.03	2538.41	H	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr027.E.dialogueact1486	2539.54	2542.35	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because you have timed sp at {disfmarker} on either side .

Bmr027.E.dialogueact1499	2564.47	2565.06	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	very poor ,

Bmr027.E.dialogueact1512	2585.81	2586.94	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	so that should be interesting .
