Bro019.C.dialogueact0	0.17	2.87	C	Professor	z	-1	0	Uh , is it the twenty - fourth ?
Bro019.F.dialogueact1	0.83	1.47	F	PhD	z	-1	0	now we 're on .
Bro019.C.dialogueact2	2.87	3.29	C	Professor	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact3	3.5	5.68	A	PhD	z	-1	0	Uh Chuck , is the mike type wireless {disfmarker}
Bro019.F.dialogueact4	5.851	6.181	F	PhD	z	-1	0	Yes .
Bro019.A.dialogueact5	6.58	7.71	A	PhD	z	-1	0	wireless headset ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact7	8.26	8.5	A	PhD	z	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.F.dialogueact6	7.808	8.178	F	PhD	z	-1	0	Yes .
Bro019.C.dialogueact8	9.46	9.79	C	Professor	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.F.dialogueact9	10.067	10.727	F	PhD	z	-1	0	For you it is .
Bro019.C.dialogueact10	11.964	12.204	C	Professor	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact11	12.274	14.134	C	Professor	z	-1	0	We uh {disfmarker} we abandoned the lapel
Bro019.C.dialogueact12	14.134	18.674	C	Professor	z	-1	0	because they sort of were not too {disfmarker} not too hot , not too cold ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact13	18.724	26.134	C	Professor	z	-1	0	they were {disfmarker} you know , they were {vocalsound} uh , far enough away that you got more background noise , uh , and uh {disfmarker} and so forth
Bro019.A.dialogueact14	23.74	23.95	A	PhD	z	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro019.C.dialogueact15	26.134	29.444	C	Professor	z	-1	0	but they weren't so close that they got quite the {disfmarker} you know , the really good {disfmarker} No , th
Bro019.A.dialogueact16	29.25	29.61	A	PhD	z	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.C.dialogueact17	29.914	30.704	C	Professor	z	-1	0	they {disfmarker} I mean they didn't {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact18	30.704	31.034	C	Professor	z	-1	0	Wait a minute .
Bro019.C.dialogueact19	31.034	31.554	C	Professor	z	-1	0	I 'm saying that wrong .
Bro019.C.dialogueact20	31.924	35.784	C	Professor	z	-1	0	They were not so far away that they were really good representative distant mikes ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact22	36.29	36.48	A	PhD	z	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro019.C.dialogueact21	36.024	39.434	C	Professor	z	-1	0	but on the other hand they were not so close that they got rid of all the interference .
Bro019.C.dialogueact23	39.434	42.194	C	Professor	z	-1	0	So it was no {disfmarker} didn't seem to be a good point to them .
Bro019.C.dialogueact24	42.654	46.404	C	Professor	z	-1	0	On the other hand if you only had to have one mike in some ways you could argue the lapel was a good choice ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact25	46.404	47.874	C	Professor	z	-1	0	precisely because it 's in the middle .
Bro019.A.dialogueact26	48.31	48.86	A	PhD	z	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact27	49.0	52.63	C	Professor	z	-1	0	There 's uh , some kinds of junk that you get with these things that you don't get with the lapel
Bro019.C.dialogueact28	52.63	56.97	C	Professor	z	-1	0	uh , little mouth clicks and breaths and so forth are worse with these than with the lapel ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact29	57.12	57.3	C	Professor	z	-1	0	but
Bro019.C.dialogueact30	58.183	64.043	C	Professor	z	-1	0	given the choice we {disfmarker} there seemed to be very strong opinions for uh , getting rid of lapels .
Bro019.A.dialogueact32	66.66	68.33	A	PhD	z	-1	0	The mike number is {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact31	66.52	66.6	C	Professor	z	-1	0	So ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact33	68.52	70.83	F	PhD	z	-1	0	Uh , your mike number 's written on the back of that unit there .
Bro019.A.dialogueact34	71.05	71.23	A	PhD	z	-1	0	Oh yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact35	71.23	71.46	A	PhD	z	-1	0	One .
Bro019.F.dialogueact36	71.76	73.75	F	PhD	z	-1	0	And then the channel number 's usually one less than that .
Bro019.A.dialogueact37	75.07	75.69	A	PhD	z	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bro019.A.dialogueact39	76.854	77.154	A	PhD	z	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.F.dialogueact38	76.73	78.93	F	PhD	z	-1	0	It - it 's one less than what 's written on the back of your {disfmarker}
Bro019.A.dialogueact40	78.76	79.01	A	PhD	z	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.A.dialogueact41	79.22	79.48	A	PhD	z	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.F.dialogueact42	79.33	79.39	F	PhD	z	-1	0	yeah .
Bro019.F.dialogueact43	79.89	81.15	F	PhD	z	-1	0	So you should be zero , actually .
Bro019.A.dialogueact44	81.72	82.02	A	PhD	z	-1	0	Hello ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact45	82.22	82.44	A	PhD	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.F.dialogueact46	83.76	84.95	F	PhD	z	-1	0	For your uh , channel number .
Bro019.A.dialogueact47	85.091	85.511	A	PhD	z	-1	0	Yep , yep .
Bro019.C.dialogueact48	85.62	88.27	C	Professor	z	-1	0	And you should do a lot of talking so we get a lot more of your pronunciations .
Bro019.C.dialogueact49	89.604	92.714	C	Professor	z	-1	0	no , they don't {disfmarker} don't have a {disfmarker} have any Indian pronunciations .
Bro019.F.dialogueact50	92.13	95.22	F	PhD	z	-1	0	So what we usually do is um , we typically will have our meetings
Bro019.C.dialogueact51	93.554	93.844	C	Professor	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.F.dialogueact52	95.22	97.48	F	PhD	z	-1	0	and then at the end of the meetings we 'll read the digits .
Bro019.F.dialogueact53	97.48	100.4	F	PhD	z	-1	0	Everybody goes around and reads the digits on the {disfmarker} the bottom of their forms .
Bro019.C.dialogueact54	98.802	99.692	C	Professor	z	-1	0	Session R
Bro019.D.dialogueact55	100.31	101.09	D	PhD	z	-1	0	R - nineteen ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact56	100.98	101.31	A	PhD	z	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.C.dialogueact57	100.999	101.899	C	Professor	z	-1	0	R - nineteen .
Bro019.F.dialogueact58	102.11	102.27	F	PhD	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.F.dialogueact59	102.27	103.99	F	PhD	z	-1	0	We 're {disfmarker} This is session R - nineteen .
Bro019.C.dialogueact60	104.225	104.675	C	Professor	z	-1	0	If you say so .
Bro019.C.dialogueact61	107.379	108.089	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	O K .
Bro019.C.dialogueact62	108.089	109.259	C	Professor	qy^rt^t	-1	0	Do we have anything like an agenda ?
Bro019.C.dialogueact63	109.479	110.129	C	Professor	qw	-1	0	What 's going on ?
Bro019.C.dialogueact64	110.409	111.059	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro019.C.dialogueact65	112.36	112.9	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I guess
Bro019.C.dialogueact66	112.9	113.55	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um .
Bro019.C.dialogueact67	114.52	115.06	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro019.C.dialogueact69	115.87	116.4	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	One thing {disfmarker}
Bro019.F.dialogueact68	115.76	116.74	F	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Sunil 's here for the summer ?
Bro019.C.dialogueact70	116.94	118.07	C	Professor	s^m^na	+1	1	Sunil 's here for the summer ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact71	118.07	118.58	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right .
Bro019.C.dialogueact72	119.31	119.82	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact73	120.35	123.21	C	Professor	s^t	-1	0	so , one thing is to talk about a kick off meeting
Bro019.C.dialogueact74	124.11	124.63	C	Professor	s^am^e	-1	0	maybe
Bro019.C.dialogueact75	125.734	126.474	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact76	126.564	140.826	C	Professor	s^t	+1	1	and then just uh , I guess uh , progress reports individually , and then uh , plans for where we go between now and then , pretty much .
Bro019.C.dialogueact77	141.55	142.11	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro019.F.dialogueact78	143.08	147.73	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	I could say a few words about um , some of the uh , compute stuff that 's happening around here ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact79	147.91	149.05	F	PhD	s^df	+1	1	so that people in the group know .
Bro019.C.dialogueact80	149.56	149.95	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact81	151.425	151.875	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.C.dialogueact82	153.06	153.79	C	Professor	qw^co	-1	0	Why don't you start with that ?
Bro019.C.dialogueact83	154.04	155.5	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	That 's sort of {disfmarker}
Bro019.F.dialogueact84	154.15	154.4	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.C.dialogueact86	155.5	155.75	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bro019.F.dialogueact85	155.44	156.15	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	We um {disfmarker}
Bro019.F.dialogueact87	156.55	163.736	F	PhD	s	+1	1	So we just put in an order for about twelve new machines , uh , to use as sort of a compute farm .
Bro019.F.dialogueact88	164.106	165.086	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	And um ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact89	165.731	167.711	F	PhD	s	-1	0	uh , we ordered uh , SUN - Blade - one - hundreds ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact90	167.961	168.821	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	and um ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact91	169.43	171.72	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact92	171.96	174.34	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but , uh , in addition , we 're running {disfmarker}
Bro019.F.dialogueact93	174.829	178.949	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So the plan for using these is , uh , we 're running P - make and Customs here
Bro019.F.dialogueact94	178.949	182.629	F	PhD	s	+1	1	and Andreas has sort of gotten that all uh , fixed up and up to speed .
Bro019.F.dialogueact95	183.058	190.27	F	PhD	s	+1	1	And he 's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um , {vocalsound} run things using P - make and Customs .
Bro019.F.dialogueact96	190.27	193.13	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	You don't actually have to write P - make scripts and things like that .
Bro019.F.dialogueact97	193.579	194.299	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	The simplest thing {disfmarker}
Bro019.F.dialogueact98	194.299	195.509	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	2	And I can send an email around
Bro019.F.dialogueact99	195.509	198.169	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	2	or , maybe I should do an FAQ on the web site about it or something .
Bro019.F.dialogueact100	198.679	199.069	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact102	199.88	201.47	C	Professor	qw^cs	+1	2	How about an email that points to the FAQ ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact101	199.749	200.149	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	there 's a c
Bro019.C.dialogueact104	201.47	201.92	C	Professor	qy^f	-1	0	you know what I 'm saying ?
Bro019.F.dialogueact103	201.4	201.96	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact105	201.92	202.46	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so that you can {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact106	202.85	203.07	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.F.dialogueact107	203.587	207.137	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Uh , there 's a command , uh , that you can use called " run command " .
Bro019.F.dialogueact108	207.307	208.377	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	" Run dash command " ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact109	208.497	209.247	F	PhD	s^bsc^e	-1	0	" run hyphen command " .
Bro019.F.dialogueact110	209.754	219.714	F	PhD	s	+1	1	And , if you say that and then some job that you want to execute , uh , it will find the fastest currently available machine , and export your job to that machine ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact111	220.234	221.634	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	and uh {disfmarker} and run it there
Bro019.F.dialogueact112	221.634	223.124	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and it 'll duplicate your environment .
Bro019.F.dialogueact113	223.124	223.534	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So
Bro019.F.dialogueact114	224.51	227.49	F	PhD	s	-1	0	you can try this as a simple test with uh , the L S command .
Bro019.F.dialogueact115	227.55	229.61	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	So you can say " run dash command L S " ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact116	230.123	238.173	F	PhD	fh|s^e	-1	0	and , um , it 'll actually export that {vocalsound} LS command to some machine in the institute , and um , do an LS on your current directory .
Bro019.F.dialogueact117	238.633	241.613	F	PhD	s^bs	-1	0	So , substitute LS for whatever command you want to run ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact118	241.753	245.583	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	and um {disfmarker} And that 's a simple way to get started using {disfmarker} using this .
Bro019.F.dialogueact119	246.152	252.5	F	PhD	s	+1	1	And , so , soon , when we get all the new machines up , {vocalsound} um , e then we 'll have lots more compute to use .
Bro019.F.dialogueact120	252.82	260.032	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Now th one of the nice things is that uh , each machine that 's part of the P - make and Customs network has attributes associated with it .
Bro019.F.dialogueact121	260.422	263.442	F	PhD	fh|s^e	-1	0	Uh , attributes like how much memory the machine has ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact122	263.442	264.282	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	what its speed is ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact123	264.282	265.332	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	what its operating system ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact124	265.732	270.632	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and when you use something like " run command " , you can specify those attributes for your program .
Bro019.F.dialogueact125	270.632	275.589	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	For example if you only want your thing to run under Linux , you can give it the Linux attribute ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact126	275.589	279.449	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and then it will find the fastest available Linux machine and run it on that .
Bro019.F.dialogueact127	279.599	279.849	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro019.F.dialogueact128	280.199	282.689	F	PhD	s	-1	0	You can control where your jobs go , to a certain extent ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact129	282.929	284.489	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	all the way down to an individual machine .
Bro019.F.dialogueact130	284.489	287.559	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself .
Bro019.F.dialogueact131	287.669	289.989	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that .
Bro019.F.dialogueact132	290.604	296.024	F	PhD	s	-1	0	If there 's already a job running , on some machine that you 're trying to select , your job will get queued up ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact133	296.561	300.851	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and then when that resource , that machine becomes available , your job will get exported there .
Bro019.F.dialogueact134	301.331	301.621	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact135	302.52	303.72	F	PhD	s	+1	1	there 's a lot of nice features to it
Bro019.F.dialogueact136	303.72	306.27	F	PhD	s	+1	1	and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines
Bro019.F.dialogueact137	306.27	306.61	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	and uh ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact138	307.032	309.272	F	PhD	s	-1	0	right now Andreas and I have been the main ones using it
Bro019.F.dialogueact139	309.272	310.322	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	and we 're {disfmarker} Uh .
Bro019.F.dialogueact140	310.322	314.672	F	PhD	s	-1	0	The SRI recognizer has all this P - make customs stuff built into it .
Bro019.C.dialogueact142	314.84	318.32	C	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	So as I understand , you know , he 's using all the machines and you 're using all the machines ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact141	314.672	315.082	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro019.C.dialogueact144	318.46	319.6	C	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	is the rough division of {disfmarker}
Bro019.F.dialogueact143	318.03	318.24	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.F.dialogueact145	318.54	318.98	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly .
Bro019.F.dialogueact146	321.79	325.17	F	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , you know , I {disfmarker} I sort of got started {comment} using the recognizer just recently
Bro019.F.dialogueact147	325.17	325.57	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	and uh ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact148	326.022	328.272	F	PhD	s	-1	0	uh I fired off a training job ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact149	328.272	329.952	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and then I fired off a recognition job
Bro019.F.dialogueact150	329.952	335.742	F	PhD	s:qy	-1	0	and I get this email about midnight from Andreas saying , " uh , are you running two {vocalsound} trainings simultaneously
Bro019.F.dialogueact151	335.822	338.042	F	PhD	s:s	-1	0	s my m my jobs are not getting run . "
Bro019.F.dialogueact152	338.642	340.022	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So I had to back off a little bit .
Bro019.F.dialogueact153	340.022	340.222	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	But ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact154	340.832	345.052	F	PhD	s	-1	0	soon as we get some more machines then uh {disfmarker} then we 'll have more compute available .
Bro019.F.dialogueact155	345.172	345.512	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact156	346.322	346.662	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact157	346.662	348.892	F	PhD	s	-1	0	that 's just a quick update about what we 've got .
Bro019.F.dialogueact159	349.372	349.542	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro019.G.dialogueact158	349.37	353.02	G	Grad	fg|s^rt	-1	0	Um , I have {disfmarker} I have a question about the uh , parallelization ?
Bro019.F.dialogueact160	353.238	353.548	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.G.dialogueact161	353.37	357.08	G	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	So , um , let 's say I have like , a thousand little {disfmarker} little jobs to do ?
Bro019.F.dialogueact162	357.29	357.54	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.G.dialogueact163	357.46	359.45	G	Grad	fh|qw	-1	0	Um , how do I do it with " run command " ?
Bro019.G.dialogueact164	359.59	360.23	G	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	I mean do {disfmarker}
Bro019.F.dialogueact165	360.4	365.75	F	PhD	s	-1	0	You could write a script uh , which called run command on each sub - job
Bro019.G.dialogueact166	361.72	362.22	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro019.G.dialogueact167	364.29	365.29	G	Grad	qy^2^d	-1	0	A thousand times ?
Bro019.F.dialogueact168	365.75	365.97	F	PhD	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right ?
Bro019.F.dialogueact170	366.17	368.527	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	But you probably wanna be careful with that
Bro019.G.dialogueact169	366.16	366.4	G	Grad	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.F.dialogueact171	368.527	371.897	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because um , you don't wanna saturate the network .
Bro019.F.dialogueact172	372.257	372.767	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact173	373.297	374.597	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	so , um ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact174	375.84	381.7	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	you know , you should {disfmarker} you should probably not run more than , say ten jobs yourself at any one time ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact175	382.09	384.52	F	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	uh , just because then it would keep other people {disfmarker}
Bro019.G.dialogueact176	383.69	383.88	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh ,
Bro019.G.dialogueact177	383.88	385.59	G	Grad	s	-1	0	too much file transfer and stuff .
Bro019.F.dialogueact178	385.52	392.28	F	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	Well it 's not that so much as that , you know , e with {disfmarker} if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt
Bro019.F.dialogueact179	392.28	393.98	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and , you know , people 's jobs would get delayed ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact180	393.98	395.99	F	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	so it 's sort of a sharing thing .
Bro019.F.dialogueact182	396.53	396.84	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro019.G.dialogueact181	396.27	396.49	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.F.dialogueact183	396.89	401.43	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	so you should try to limit it to somet sometim some number around ten jobs at a time .
Bro019.F.dialogueact184	401.83	402.2	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro019.F.dialogueact185	402.48	412.57	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	So if you had a script for example that had a thousand things it needed to run , um , you 'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were gonna use " run command " , uh , to only have ten of those going at a time .
Bro019.F.dialogueact186	412.82	415.6	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	And uh , then , when one of those finished you 'd fire off another one .
Bro019.F.dialogueact187	416.15	416.55	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact188	417.07	419.98	C	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	I remember I {disfmarker} I forget whether it was when the Rutgers or {disfmarker} or Hopkins workshop ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact189	419.98	424.6	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I remember one of the workshops I was at there were {disfmarker} everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines
Bro019.C.dialogueact190	424.6	427.69	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and there was some kind of P - make like thing that sit sent things out .
Bro019.F.dialogueact191	424.846	425.156	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.F.dialogueact192	426.22	426.57	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact194	428.13	431.06	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines
Bro019.F.dialogueact193	427.83	428.09	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.F.dialogueact195	430.42	430.67	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact197	431.33	435.17	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and {vocalsound} and things were a lot less efficient than if you 'd just use your own machine .
Bro019.F.dialogueact196	431.17	431.55	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.F.dialogueact198	432.8	432.99	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bro019.F.dialogueact199	435.02	435.78	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , exactly .
Bro019.F.dialogueact200	436.35	437.76	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Yeah , you have to be a little bit careful .
Bro019.C.dialogueact201	436.97	437.37	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	as I recall ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact202	437.37	437.47	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	but .
Bro019.C.dialogueact204	438.01	438.16	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.D.dialogueact203	437.63	438.22	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro019.F.dialogueact205	438.32	438.78	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	Um ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact206	439.85	441.16	F	PhD	s^tc.%--	-1	0	but uh , you can also {disfmarker}
Bro019.F.dialogueact207	441.16	450.04	F	PhD	s	-1	0	If you have that level of parallelization um , and you don't wanna have to worry about writing the logic in {disfmarker} in a Perl script to take care of that , you can use um , P - make
Bro019.G.dialogueact208	449.877	450.807	G	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Just do P - make .
Bro019.F.dialogueact209	450.786	458.056	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and you basically write a Make file that uh , you know your final job depends on these one thousand things ,
Bro019.G.dialogueact210	450.807	451.367	G	Grad	%	-1	0	s
Bro019.G.dialogueact211	457.029	457.759	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.F.dialogueact212	458.376	465.41	F	PhD	s^cs^rt	-1	0	and when you run P - make , uh , on your Make file , you can give it the dash capital J and {disfmarker} and then a number ,
Bro019.G.dialogueact213	464.17	464.83	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.F.dialogueact214	465.41	468.75	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and that number represents how many uh , machines to use at once .
Bro019.F.dialogueact216	468.93	471.03	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And then it 'll make sure that it never goes above that .
Bro019.G.dialogueact215	468.787	469.047	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bro019.F.dialogueact219	471.761	472.101	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bro019.G.dialogueact217	471.284	471.484	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bro019.G.dialogueact218	471.614	471.914	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.F.dialogueact220	474.38	475.66	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I can get some documentation .
Bro019.D.dialogueact221	474.98	477.05	D	PhD	s	-1	0	So it {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's not systematically queued .
Bro019.D.dialogueact222	477.05	479.98	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	I mean all the jobs are running .
Bro019.D.dialogueact223	479.98	482.68	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	If you launch twenty jobs , they are all running .
Bro019.D.dialogueact225	483.755	484.235	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	Alright .
Bro019.F.dialogueact224	483.267	484.027	F	PhD	s^am	-1	0	It depends .
Bro019.F.dialogueact226	484.027	489.897	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	If you {disfmarker} " Run command " , that I mentioned before , is {disfmarker} doesn't know about other things that you might be running .
Bro019.D.dialogueact227	485.627	485.927	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro019.F.dialogueact228	490.272	495.292	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	So , it would be possible to run a hundred run jobs at once ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact229	494.73	495.02	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro019.F.dialogueact230	495.552	497.292	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	and they wouldn't know about each other .
Bro019.F.dialogueact231	497.775	502.475	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	But if you use P - make , then , it knows about all the jobs that it has to run
Bro019.D.dialogueact232	503.14	503.63	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.F.dialogueact233	503.36	506.51	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	and it can control , uh , how many it runs simultaneously .
Bro019.C.dialogueact234	506.63	508.33	C	Professor	qy^bu^d|qrr.%--	-1	0	So " run command " doesn't use P - make , or {disfmarker} ?
Bro019.F.dialogueact235	508.75	510.52	F	PhD	s	-1	0	It uses " export " underlyingly .
Bro019.F.dialogueact236	510.78	511.88	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But , if you {disfmarker}
Bro019.F.dialogueact237	511.88	514.48	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i It 's meant to be run one job at a time ?
Bro019.F.dialogueact238	514.73	516.72	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	So you could fire off a thousand of those ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact239	516.96	520.55	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and it doesn't know {disfmarker} any one of those doesn't know about the other ones that are running .
Bro019.C.dialogueact240	521.5	523.47	C	Professor	qw	-1	0	So why would one use that rather than P - make ?
Bro019.F.dialogueact241	523.76	524.68	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Well , if you have ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact242	524.68	525.27	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bro019.F.dialogueact243	526.13	529.1	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Like , for example , uh if you didn't wanna write a P - make script
Bro019.F.dialogueact244	529.1	534.69	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and you just had a , uh {disfmarker} an HTK training job that you know is gonna take uh , six hours to run ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact245	535.337	538.987	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and somebody 's using , uh , the machine you typically use ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact246	539.127	541.357	F	PhD	s	-1	0	you can say " run command " and your HTK thing
Bro019.F.dialogueact247	541.357	543.387	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and it 'll find another machine ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact248	543.517	545.477	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	the fastest currently available machine
Bro019.F.dialogueact249	545.477	546.627	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and run your job there .
Bro019.C.dialogueact250	546.99	549.2	C	Professor	qy	-1	0	Now , does it have the same sort of behavior as P - make ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact251	549.2	553.08	C	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	which is that , you know , if you run something on somebody 's machine and they come in and hit a key then it {disfmarker}
Bro019.F.dialogueact252	553.51	553.88	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bro019.F.dialogueact253	554.09	554.26	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact254	554.61	555.73	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	there are um {disfmarker}
Bro019.F.dialogueact255	555.92	556.14	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro019.F.dialogueact256	556.36	561.55	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So some of the machines at the institute , um , have this attribute called " no evict " .
Bro019.F.dialogueact257	562.11	570.15	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And if you specify that , in {disfmarker} in one of your attribute lines , then it 'll go to a machine which your job won't be evicted from .
Bro019.C.dialogueact258	566.555	566.935	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.F.dialogueact259	570.8	578.186	F	PhD	s	-1	0	But , the machines that don't have that attribute , if a job gets fired up on that , which could be somebody 's desktop machine , and {disfmarker} and they were at lunch ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact260	577.72	578.49	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.F.dialogueact261	578.186	587.528	F	PhD	s	-1	0	they come back from lunch and they start typing on the console , then your machine will get evicted {disfmarker} your job {comment} will get evicted from their machine and be restarted on another machine . Automatically .
Bro019.F.dialogueact262	588.032	589.782	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	So {disfmarker} which can cause you to lose time ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact263	589.782	589.972	F	PhD	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right ?
Bro019.F.dialogueact264	589.972	592.962	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	If you had a two hour job , and it got halfway through
Bro019.F.dialogueact265	592.962	595.032	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and then somebody came back to their machine and it got evicted .
Bro019.F.dialogueact266	595.032	602.663	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	So . If you don't want your job to run on a machine where it could be evicted , then you give it the minus {disfmarker} the attribute , you know , " no evict " ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact267	602.983	604.963	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and it 'll pick a machine that it can't be evicted from .
Bro019.F.dialogueact268	605.333	605.423	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro019.C.dialogueact269	606.77	608.04	C	Professor	fg|qw.%--	-1	0	Um , what {disfmarker} what about {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact270	608.04	618.69	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I remember always used to be an issue , maybe it 's not anymore , that if you {disfmarker} if something required {disfmarker} if your machine required somebody hitting a key in order to evict things that are on it so you could work ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact272	619.311	620.791	C	Professor	qw^d^rt	-1	0	but if you were logged into it from home ?
Bro019.F.dialogueact271	618.886	619.186	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact273	621.331	624.421	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and you weren't hitting any keys ? cuz you were , home ?
Bro019.F.dialogueact274	625.054	625.434	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact275	625.434	627.484	F	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I 'm not sure how that works .
Bro019.C.dialogueact277	627.565	627.865	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.F.dialogueact276	627.484	629.474	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Uh , it seems like Andreas did something for that .
Bro019.C.dialogueact278	629.722	630.052	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro019.F.dialogueact279	630.064	630.504	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro019.C.dialogueact280	630.858	631.078	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.C.dialogueact281	631.078	632.188	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	We can ask him sometime .
Bro019.F.dialogueact282	631.658	631.838	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bro019.F.dialogueact283	632.118	632.508	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.F.dialogueact284	632.568	637.458	F	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I don't know whether it monitors the keyboard or actually looks at the console TTY ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact285	637.608	642.7	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	so maybe if you echoed something to the you know , dev {disfmarker} dev console or something .
Bro019.C.dialogueact286	641.14	642.54	C	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	You probably wouldn't ordinarily , though .
Bro019.C.dialogueact287	642.54	642.99	C	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	Yeah . Right ?
Bro019.C.dialogueact289	642.99	644.17	C	Professor	s^r	-1	0	You probably wouldn't ordinarily .
Bro019.F.dialogueact288	642.76	642.85	F	PhD	qw^br	-1	0	Hmm ?
Bro019.C.dialogueact290	644.17	644.74	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean you sort of {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact291	645.39	646.73	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you 're at home and you 're trying to log in ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact292	646.73	648.43	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and it takes forever to even log you in ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact294	648.43	649.86	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and you probably go , " screw this " ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact293	647.98	648.85	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact295	649.86	652.13	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} You know .
Bro019.F.dialogueact296	649.95	650.25	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .

Bro019.A.dialogueact319	677.489	677.769	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.F.dialogueact320	677.75	679.17	F	PhD	s	-1	0	He {disfmarker} he knows that stuff better than I do .
Bro019.C.dialogueact321	682.47	682.79	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.C.dialogueact322	683.64	685.26	C	Professor	qw^cs.%--	-1	0	Well , why don't we uh ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact323	686.66	687.07	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact324	687.77	693.65	C	Professor	qw^cs^tc	+1	2	Sunil since you 're {vocalsound} haven't {disfmarker} haven't been at one of these yet , why don't yo you tell us what 's {disfmarker} what 's up with you ?
Bro019.C.dialogueact325	694.23	695.75	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	Wh - what you 've been up to , hopefully .
Bro019.A.dialogueact326	695.04	695.38	A	PhD	h	-1	0	Um .
Bro019.A.dialogueact327	696.11	696.25	A	PhD	h	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact328	697.15	697.74	A	PhD	h	-1	0	So ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact329	699.82	701.25	A	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	uh , shall I start from {disfmarker}
Bro019.A.dialogueact330	702.29	703.35	A	PhD	s^no.%--	-1	0	Well I don't know how may I {disfmarker} how {disfmarker}
Bro019.A.dialogueact331	703.47	703.72	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.A.dialogueact332	703.88	707.15	A	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	Uh , I think I 'll start from the post uh Aurora submission maybe .
Bro019.C.dialogueact333	707.57	707.72	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact334	708.59	709.51	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh , yeah ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact335	709.51	715.96	A	PhD	s	-1	0	after the submission the {disfmarker} what I 've been working on mainly was to take {disfmarker} take other s submissions
Bro019.A.dialogueact336	715.96	716.39	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and then
Bro019.A.dialogueact337	730.02	731.69	A	PhD	s	-1	0	over their system , what they submitted ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact338	732.36	735.22	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because we didn't have any speech enhancement system in {disfmarker} in ours .
Bro019.A.dialogueact339	735.22	735.55	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bro019.A.dialogueact340	736.3	736.88	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So I tried
Bro019.A.dialogueact341	737.07	737.5	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact342	746.551	749.445	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And u First I tried just LDA .
Bro019.A.dialogueact343	749.445	750.415	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And then I found that
Bro019.A.dialogueact344	750.775	751.125	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact345	756.536	760.416	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , if {disfmarker} if I combine it with LDA , it gives @ @ improvement over theirs .
Bro019.A.dialogueact346	762.16	762.48	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker}
Bro019.F.dialogueact347	762.48	763.8	F	PhD	qy	-1	0	Are y are you saying LDA ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact348	763.93	764.01	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact351	764.708	764.948	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.F.dialogueact349	764.262	764.622	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	LDA .
Bro019.F.dialogueact350	764.622	764.742	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.A.dialogueact352	765.513	765.803	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	So ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact353	766.05	767.14	A	PhD	s	-1	0	just {disfmarker} just the LDA filters .
Bro019.A.dialogueact354	767.14	773.28	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I just plug in {disfmarker} I just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in LDA on top of that .
Bro019.A.dialogueact356	773.48	776.96	A	PhD	s	-1	0	But the LDA filter that I used was different from what we submitted in the proposal .
Bro019.F.dialogueact355	773.128	773.428	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.A.dialogueact357	776.96	781.79	A	PhD	s	-1	0	What I did was {vocalsound} I took the LDA filter 's design using clean speech ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact358	782.57	786.29	A	PhD	fh|s^df	-1	0	uh , mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement
Bro019.A.dialogueact359	786.29	793.29	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so , instead of using this , uh , narrow {disfmarker} narrow band LDA filter that we submitted uh , I got new filters .
Bro019.A.dialogueact360	793.29	793.64	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So
Bro019.A.dialogueact361	793.95	798.12	A	PhD	s	-1	0	that seems to be giving {disfmarker} uh , improving over their uh , system .
Bro019.A.dialogueact362	798.7	799.21	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	Slightly .
Bro019.A.dialogueact363	799.39	801.47	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	But , not very significantly .
Bro019.A.dialogueact364	802.15	803.33	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And uh , that was
Bro019.A.dialogueact365	809.452	813.312	A	PhD	s	-1	0	uh , showing any improvement over {disfmarker} final {disfmarker} by plugging in an LDA .
Bro019.A.dialogueact366	814.321	814.891	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	And uh ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact367	815.041	820.031	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so then after {disfmarker} after that I {disfmarker} I added uh , on - line normalization also on top of that .
Bro019.A.dialogueact368	820.031	826.625	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And that {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there also I n I found that I have to make some changes to their time constant that I used
Bro019.A.dialogueact369	826.855	830.615	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because th it has a {disfmarker} a mean and variance update time constant
Bro019.A.dialogueact370	830.615	836.715	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and {disfmarker} which is not suitable for the enhanced speech , and whatever we try it on with proposal - one .
Bro019.A.dialogueact371	837.205	837.935	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	But um ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact372	839.0	841.25	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I didn't {disfmarker} I didn't play with that time constant a lot ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact373	841.25	842.3	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I just t g
Bro019.A.dialogueact374	842.41	844.17	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I just found that I have to reduce the value {disfmarker}
Bro019.A.dialogueact375	844.17	847.61	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , I have to increase the time constant , or reduce the value of the update value .
Bro019.A.dialogueact376	847.97	848.62	A	PhD	s	-1	0	That 's all I found
Bro019.A.dialogueact377	848.62	849.14	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So I have to .
Bro019.A.dialogueact378	849.81	850.2	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact379	850.728	850.938	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact380	851.309	851.979	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	And uh ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact381	853.37	864.02	A	PhD	s	+1	1	uh , the other {disfmarker} other thing what I tried was , I just um , uh , took the baseline and then ran it with the endpoint inf uh th information ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact382	864.37	865.59	A	PhD	s^e	+1	1	just the Aurora baseline ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact383	866.03	869.07	A	PhD	s^e	+1	1	to see that how much the baseline itself improves
Bro019.A.dialogueact384	869.84	873.9	A	PhD	s^e	+1	1	by just supplying the information of the {disfmarker} I mean the w speech and nonspeech .
Bro019.A.dialogueact385	874.43	875.07	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	And uh ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact386	875.45	879.71	A	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	I found that the baseline itself improves by twenty - two percent by just giving the wuh .
Bro019.C.dialogueact387	881.03	882.14	C	Professor	qy^br^cs	-1	0	Uh , can you back up a second ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact388	882.14	883.53	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I missed something ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact389	883.53	883.81	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact390	884.75	885.47	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	I guess my mind wandered .
Bro019.C.dialogueact391	885.47	891.39	C	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Ad - ad When you added the on - line normalization and so forth , uh , uh things got better again ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact392	888.62	888.88	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact394	891.58	891.95	A	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bro019.C.dialogueact393	891.39	891.75	C	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	or is it ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact395	892.1	892.3	A	PhD	s^ar^r	-1	0	No .
Bro019.A.dialogueact397	892.3	895.95	A	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	No , things didn't get better with the same time constant that we used .
Bro019.C.dialogueact396	892.17	892.62	C	Professor	qy^bu	-1	0	Did it not ?
Bro019.C.dialogueact398	896.29	896.51	C	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	No , no .
Bro019.C.dialogueact399	896.51	897.52	C	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	With a different time constant .
Bro019.A.dialogueact400	897.6	899.19	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	With the different time constant I found that {disfmarker}
Bro019.A.dialogueact401	899.19	902.98	A	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	I mean , I didn't get an improvement over not using on - line normalization ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact402	902.78	902.96	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bro019.A.dialogueact404	903.32	907.43	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because I {disfmarker} I found that I would have change the value of the update factor .
Bro019.C.dialogueact403	902.96	903.37	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	No you didn't ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact405	903.37	903.65	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.A.dialogueact406	907.81	911.59	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But I didn't play it with play {disfmarker} play quite a bit to make it better than .
Bro019.C.dialogueact407	908.01	908.28	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact409	912.56	913.49	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So , it 's still not {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact408	912.087	912.427	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.A.dialogueact410	913.49	915.83	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , the on - line normalization didn't give me any improvement .
Bro019.C.dialogueact411	914.049	914.319	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.A.dialogueact412	916.74	917.77	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	And uh ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact414	919.146	919.626	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact413	919.112	919.392	C	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.A.dialogueact415	920.69	921.05	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh yeah
Bro019.A.dialogueact416	921.05	924.34	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So I just stopped there with the uh , speech enhancement .
Bro019.A.dialogueact417	924.34	929.3	A	PhD	s	-1	0	The {disfmarker} the other thing what I tried was the {disfmarker} adding the uh , endpoint information to the baseline
Bro019.A.dialogueact418	929.3	931.5	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and that itself gives like twenty - two percent
Bro019.A.dialogueact419	931.5	935.14	A	PhD	s^df	+1	1	because the {disfmarker} the second {disfmarker} the new phase is going to be with the endpointed speech .
Bro019.A.dialogueact420	935.14	941.61	A	PhD	s.%-	+1	1	And just to get a feel of how much the baseline itself is going to change by adding this endpoint information , I just , uh , use {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact421	940.404	940.704	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro019.F.dialogueact422	941.21	944.76	F	PhD	s^bu	+1	1	So people won't even have to worry about , uh , doing speech - nonspeech then .
Bro019.A.dialogueact423	944.62	944.84	A	PhD	s^aa	+1	1	Yeah
Bro019.A.dialogueact424	944.84	947.26	A	PhD	s^na	-1	0	that 's , that 's what the feeling is like .
Bro019.A.dialogueact426	947.53	949.11	A	PhD	s	-1	0	They 're going to give the endpoint information .
Bro019.F.dialogueact425	947.44	947.72	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact428	949.626	952.606	C	Professor	s	-1	0	G I guess the issue is that people do that anyway ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact427	949.48	949.9	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bro019.C.dialogueact429	952.606	953.636	C	Professor	s	-1	0	everybody does that ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact431	953.69	954.09	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact430	953.636	958.506	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and they wanted to see , given that you 're doing that , what {disfmarker} what are the best features that you should use .
Bro019.F.dialogueact432	957.8	958.17	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact433	958.51	958.9	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bro019.A.dialogueact434	959.33	959.61	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	So ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact435	959.8	961.06	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean clearly they 're interact .
Bro019.C.dialogueact436	961.06	962.97	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So I don't know that I entirely agree with it .
Bro019.F.dialogueact437	962.2	962.74	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact438	962.97	972.78	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but it might be uh {disfmarker} In some ways it might be better t to {disfmarker} rather than giving the endpoints , to have a standard that everybody uses and then interacts with .
Bro019.F.dialogueact439	970.61	970.97	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact440	972.78	975.72	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But , you know . It 's {disfmarker} it 's still someth reasonable .
Bro019.F.dialogueact441	975.96	979.27	F	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	So , are people supposed to assume that there is uh {disfmarker}
Bro019.F.dialogueact442	980.27	983.39	F	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Are {disfmarker} are people not supposed to use any speech outside of those endpoints ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact443	984.15	984.69	A	PhD	h	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker}
Bro019.F.dialogueact444	984.26	988.33	F	PhD	qrr	-1	0	Or can you then use speech outside of it for estimating background noise and things ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact445	984.85	985.24	A	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bro019.A.dialogueact446	985.41	985.57	A	PhD	s^ar^r	-1	0	No .
Bro019.A.dialogueact447	985.57	986.06	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	That i I {disfmarker}
Bro019.A.dialogueact448	986.749	987.069	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact449	987.66	988.11	A	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	Yeah , yeah ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact450	988.22	988.67	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	exactly .
Bro019.A.dialogueact451	988.89	990.83	A	PhD	s^na	-1	0	I guess that is {disfmarker} that is where the consensus is .
Bro019.A.dialogueact452	990.83	996.0	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Like y you will {disfmarker} you will {disfmarker} You 'll be given the information about the beginning and the end of speech
Bro019.A.dialogueact453	996.54	998.4	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but the whole speech is available to you .
Bro019.F.dialogueact454	998.62	999.01	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.A.dialogueact455	999.14	999.3	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro019.C.dialogueact456	999.195	1001.86	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So it should make the spectral subtraction style things work even better ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact458	1002.01	1002.3	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact457	1001.87	1003.24	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because you don't have the mistakes in it .
Bro019.C.dialogueact459	1003.41	1003.55	C	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact461	1004.17	1004.47	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact462	1004.47	1004.95	A	PhD	b	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact460	1004.16	1004.42	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.A.dialogueact463	1006.25	1007.68	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} The baseline itself {disfmarker}
Bro019.A.dialogueact464	1007.75	1009.54	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , it improves by twenty - two percent .
Bro019.A.dialogueact465	1009.54	1017.11	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I found that in s one of the SpeechDat - Car cases , that like , the Spanish one improves by just fifty percent by just putting the endpoint .
Bro019.A.dialogueact467	1017.85	1018.02	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	w
Bro019.F.dialogueact466	1017.44	1017.89	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Wow .
Bro019.A.dialogueact468	1018.02	1021.03	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	I mean you don't need any further speech enhancement with fifty .
Bro019.A.dialogueact469	1021.82	1022.59	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So , uh ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact470	1023.71	1025.71	F	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	So the baseline itself improves by fifty percent .
Bro019.A.dialogueact471	1025.02	1025.95	A	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yeah , by fifty percent .
Bro019.C.dialogueact472	1026.18	1026.44	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.F.dialogueact474	1026.44	1026.84	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Wow .
Bro019.C.dialogueact473	1026.44	1029.27	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So it 's g it 's gonna be harder to {vocalsound} beat that actually .
Bro019.F.dialogueact475	1027.83	1028.35	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact476	1029.23	1029.67	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact478	1029.67	1029.94	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact477	1029.27	1030.03	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker}
Bro019.A.dialogueact479	1030.22	1038.18	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so that is when uh , the {disfmarker} the qualification criteria was reduced from fifty percent to something like twenty - five percent for well - matched .
Bro019.A.dialogueact480	1038.18	1041.76	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And I think they have {disfmarker} they have actually changed their qualification c criteria now .
Bro019.A.dialogueact481	1042.8	1043.49	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	And uh ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact482	1044.14	1044.31	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact483	1044.31	1048.9	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I guess after that , I just went home f I just had a vacation fo for four weeks .
Bro019.A.dialogueact485	1050.16	1050.67	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bro019.C.dialogueact484	1049.68	1050.02	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.C.dialogueact486	1050.18	1052.1	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	No , that 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that 's a good {disfmarker} good update .
Bro019.A.dialogueact487	1051.26	1051.44	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	Ye
Bro019.A.dialogueact488	1052.39	1052.72	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact489	1052.72	1057.59	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and I {disfmarker} I came back and I started working on uh , some other speech enhancement algorithm .
Bro019.A.dialogueact490	1057.78	1065.98	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , so {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} from the submission what I found that people have tried spectral subtraction and Wiener filtering . These are the main uh , approaches where people have tried ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact491	1064.34	1064.53	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact492	1065.98	1077.99	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so just to {disfmarker} just to fill the space with some f few more speech enhancement algorithms to see whether it improves a lot , I {disfmarker} I 've been working on this uh , signal subspace approach for speech enhancement
Bro019.A.dialogueact493	1077.99	1084.71	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	where you take the noisy signal and then decomposing the signal s and the noise subspace
Bro019.A.dialogueact494	1084.71	1088.85	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and then try to estimate the clean speech from the signal plus noise subspace .
Bro019.A.dialogueact496	1089.32	1089.78	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact495	1089.14	1089.49	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.A.dialogueact497	1090.04	1091.81	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So , I 've been actually running some s
Bro019.A.dialogueact498	1092.14	1093.71	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So far I 've been trying it only on Matlab .
Bro019.A.dialogueact499	1093.71	1097.41	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I have to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to test whether it works first or not
Bro019.C.dialogueact500	1094.71	1094.88	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact501	1097.41	1098.87	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and then I 'll p port it to C
Bro019.A.dialogueact502	1098.87	1103.57	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and I 'll update it with the repository once I find it it giving any some positive result .
Bro019.A.dialogueact503	1104.85	1105.82	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So , yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact504	1105.57	1105.85	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	S
Bro019.C.dialogueact505	1106.62	1108.9	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So you s you So you said one thing I want to jump on for a second .
Bro019.C.dialogueact506	1108.9	1113.85	C	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so now you 're {disfmarker} you 're getting tuned into the repository thing that he has here
Bro019.A.dialogueact507	1113.39	1113.57	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact508	1113.85	1117.02	C	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	and {disfmarker} so we we 'll have a {vocalsound} single place where the stuff is .
Bro019.A.dialogueact509	1115.4	1115.5	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bro019.A.dialogueact510	1116.97	1117.07	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact511	1117.09	1117.32	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Cool .
Bro019.C.dialogueact512	1118.38	1118.78	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	Um ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact513	1119.58	1124.38	C	Professor	s^co^tc	+1	2	so maybe uh , just briefly , you could remind us about the related experiments .
Bro019.C.dialogueact514	1124.38	1126.54	C	Professor	s^bu^df	+1	2	Cuz you did some stuff that you talked about last week ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact515	1126.54	1127.0	C	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	I guess ?
Bro019.D.dialogueact516	1127.12	1127.36	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact517	1127.72	1130.53	C	Professor	fh|s^e.%--	-1	0	Um , where you were also combining something {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact518	1130.53	1136.47	C	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	both of you I guess were both combining something from the uh , French Telecom system with {vocalsound} the u uh {disfmarker}
Bro019.D.dialogueact519	1133.17	1133.59	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro019.C.dialogueact520	1136.55	1139.07	C	Professor	s^bu^no	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I don't know whether it was system one or system two ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact521	1139.07	1139.2	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bro019.D.dialogueact522	1139.53	1139.72	D	PhD	h	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.D.dialogueact523	1139.72	1140.69	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	It was system one .
Bro019.D.dialogueact524	1140.69	1141.07	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	So
Bro019.C.dialogueact525	1141.35	1141.55	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.D.dialogueact526	1141.58	1142.24	D	PhD	%--	-1	0	we {disfmarker}
Bro019.D.dialogueact527	1143.79	1148.95	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	2	The main thing that we did is just to take the spectral subtraction from the France Telecom ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact528	1149.21	1154.75	D	PhD	s^e^rt	-1	0	which provide us some speech samples that are uh , with noise removed .
Bro019.C.dialogueact529	1155.01	1155.99	C	Professor	s^co	-1	0	So I let me {disfmarker} let me just stop you there .
Bro019.C.dialogueact530	1155.99	1163.46	C	Professor	s^bu.%-	-1	0	So then , one distinction is that uh , you were taking the actual France Telecom features and then applying something to {disfmarker}
Bro019.A.dialogueact531	1162.96	1163.57	A	PhD	h|s^ar	-1	0	Uh , no
Bro019.A.dialogueact532	1163.57	1164.55	A	PhD	s^arp	-1	0	there is a slight different .
Bro019.A.dialogueact533	1165.09	1165.48	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh
Bro019.A.dialogueact534	1169.88	1171.46	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , which are extracted at the handset
Bro019.A.dialogueact536	1172.65	1175.03	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because they had another back - end blind equalization {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact535	1172.26	1172.47	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact539	1175.24	1175.49	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact537	1174.92	1175.0	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact538	1175.0	1175.88	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But that 's what I mean .
Bro019.A.dialogueact540	1175.71	1175.96	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact541	1175.88	1176.47	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	But u u
Bro019.C.dialogueact542	1176.47	1176.8	C	Professor	s^fa	-1	0	Sorry ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact544	1177.09	1177.41	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact543	1176.8	1178.18	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	yeah , I 'm not being {disfmarker} I 'm not being clear .
Bro019.A.dialogueact545	1178.38	1178.8	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact546	1178.46	1182.49	C	Professor	s^bu|qy^d^g	-1	0	What I meant was you had something like cepstra or something , right ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact547	1181.64	1182.62	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact548	1182.96	1186.54	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And so one difference is that , I guess you were taking spectra .
Bro019.A.dialogueact549	1186.34	1186.84	A	PhD	s^2	-1	0	The speech .
Bro019.B.dialogueact550	1186.83	1187.06	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.D.dialogueact551	1187.79	1188.03	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.D.dialogueact552	1188.03	1190.17	D	PhD	s	-1	0	But I guess it 's the s exactly the same thing
Bro019.D.dialogueact553	1190.17	1197.04	D	PhD	s^bu^df	-1	0	because on the heads uh , handset they just applied this Wiener filter and then compute cepstral features ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact555	1197.27	1197.52	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact557	1197.52	1200.8	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	the cepstral f The difference is like {disfmarker} There may be a slight difference in the way {disfmarker}
Bro019.D.dialogueact554	1197.04	1197.31	D	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro019.D.dialogueact556	1197.31	1197.38	D	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact558	1201.21	1206.19	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because they use exactly the baseline system for converting the cepstrum once you have the speech .
Bro019.A.dialogueact560	1206.84	1211.0	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , if we are using our own code for th I mean that {disfmarker} that could be the only difference .
Bro019.D.dialogueact559	1206.77	1207.11	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro019.A.dialogueact561	1211.0	1212.41	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , there is no other difference .
Bro019.D.dialogueact562	1211.47	1211.97	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.A.dialogueact563	1213.1	1213.19	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact564	1213.42	1215.09	C	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	But you got some sort of different result .
Bro019.C.dialogueact565	1215.09	1216.22	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	So I 'm trying to understand it .
Bro019.C.dialogueact566	1216.39	1216.58	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	But uh ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact568	1218.02	1218.67	C	Professor	%	-1	0	I th
Bro019.D.dialogueact567	1217.86	1221.29	D	PhD	s^bk|s^cs	-1	0	Yeah , well I think we should uh , have a table with all the result
Bro019.D.dialogueact569	1221.29	1225.0	D	PhD	s^df^no	-1	0	because I don't know I uh , I don't exactly know what are your results ?
Bro019.D.dialogueact570	1225.12	1225.26	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	But ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact571	1225.63	1225.87	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.A.dialogueact572	1226.08	1226.42	A	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.D.dialogueact573	1226.28	1226.46	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro019.D.dialogueact574	1227.68	1228.77	D	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , but so we did this ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact575	1228.77	1234.48	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and another difference I guess is that we just applied uh , proposal - one system after this
Bro019.D.dialogueact576	1234.61	1240.59	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	without {disfmarker} well , with our modification to reduce the delay of the {disfmarker} the LDA filters ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact578	1240.92	1241.33	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro019.D.dialogueact577	1240.59	1240.92	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	and
Bro019.B.dialogueact580	1242.11	1242.87	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	And the filter {disfmarker}
Bro019.D.dialogueact579	1242.03	1243.09	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Well there are slight modifications ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact581	1243.09	1244.88	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but it was the full proposal - one .
Bro019.D.dialogueact582	1244.88	1250.06	D	PhD	s^cs^rt	-1	0	In your case , if you tried just putting LDA , then maybe on - line normalization {disfmarker} ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact583	1246.56	1247.22	A	PhD	s^2	-1	0	Only LDA .
Bro019.A.dialogueact584	1248.3	1248.57	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact585	1249.81	1252.13	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Af - I {disfmarker} after that I added on - line normalization ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact586	1252.24	1252.45	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah .
Bro019.D.dialogueact587	1252.24	1252.35	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.D.dialogueact588	1252.93	1257.7	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	So we just tried directly to {disfmarker} to just , keep the system as it was
Bro019.D.dialogueact589	1258.74	1259.56	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	and ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact590	1260.69	1261.37	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact591	1261.48	1267.06	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	when we plug the spectral subtraction it improves uh , signif significantly .
Bro019.D.dialogueact592	1268.18	1269.31	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact593	1269.77	1276.25	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but , what seems clear also is that we have to retune the time constants of the on - line normalization .
Bro019.A.dialogueact594	1275.72	1276.14	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .

Bro019.D.dialogueact596	1276.6	1282.1	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Because if we keep the value that was submitted uh , it doesn't help at all .
Bro019.D.dialogueact597	1282.1	1285.81	D	PhD	s^df	+1	1	You can remove on - line normalization , or put it , it doesn't change anything .
Bro019.D.dialogueact598	1287.18	1289.05	D	PhD	s^e	+1	1	Uh , uh , as long as you have the spectral subtraction .
Bro019.D.dialogueact599	1290.21	1293.81	D	PhD	s	-1	0	But , you can still find some kind of optimum somewhere ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact600	1294.11	1295.87	D	PhD	s^no	-1	0	and we don't know where exactly
Bro019.A.dialogueact602	1296.26	1296.41	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.D.dialogueact601	1295.87	1296.14	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	but ,

Bro019.A.dialogueact604	1297.69	1298.53	A	PhD	s^na	-1	0	Yeah , I assume .
Bro019.C.dialogueact605	1299.32	1302.77	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	So it sounds like you should look at some tables of results or something
Bro019.D.dialogueact606	1302.3	1302.55	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bro019.A.dialogueact609	1302.88	1303.05	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bro019.C.dialogueact607	1302.77	1306.44	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and see where i where the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} where they were different and what we can learn from it .
Bro019.D.dialogueact610	1303.68	1304.42	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.D.dialogueact611	1307.04	1307.41	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.A.dialogueact612	1322.56	1323.4	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	without any change .
Bro019.A.dialogueact615	1324.12	1324.37	A	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.B.dialogueact614	1324.02	1324.46	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	But it 's {disfmarker}
Bro019.D.dialogueact613	1323.76	1323.82	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.D.dialogueact616	1324.21	1324.44	D	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	Well ,
Bro019.B.dialogueact617	1324.79	1325.48	B	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's the new .
Bro019.D.dialogueact618	1324.87	1326.71	D	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	with {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} with changes ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact619	1325.71	1325.98	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	with
Bro019.B.dialogueact620	1326.0	1326.45	B	PhD	s^r	-1	0	The new .
Bro019.D.dialogueact621	1326.71	1328.84	D	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	because we change it the system to have {disfmarker}
Bro019.A.dialogueact622	1328.09	1328.24	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh yeah ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact623	1328.24	1329.73	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean the {disfmarker} the new LDA filters .
Bro019.B.dialogueact624	1329.06	1329.5	B	PhD	s^r	-1	0	The new .
Bro019.A.dialogueact625	1329.73	1330.01	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	I mean {disfmarker}
Bro019.A.dialogueact627	1330.4	1330.65	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.D.dialogueact626	1329.95	1330.11	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.D.dialogueact628	1330.61	1331.38	D	PhD	s^m^rt	-1	0	LDA filters .
Bro019.D.dialogueact629	1331.76	1335.54	D	PhD	s	-1	0	There are other things that we finally were shown to improve also
Bro019.D.dialogueact630	1335.54	1337.65	D	PhD	s^e^rt	-1	0	like , the sixty - four hertz cut - off .
Bro019.A.dialogueact632	1338.2	1338.93	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.B.dialogueact631	1337.84	1338.29	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.D.dialogueact633	1339.16	1342.46	D	PhD	s^e^rt	-1	0	w Uh , it doesn't seem to hurt on TI - digits , finally .
Bro019.A.dialogueact634	1342.68	1343.0	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.D.dialogueact635	1343.57	1345.2	D	PhD	s^df^rt	-1	0	Maybe because of other changes .
Bro019.A.dialogueact636	1345.4	1345.72	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.D.dialogueact637	1345.92	1346.72	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact638	1346.94	1349.64	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	well there are some {vocalsound} minor changes ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact639	1349.93	1350.04	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact640	1351.1	1351.63	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.D.dialogueact641	1351.78	1362.92	D	PhD	s	+1	1	And , right now if we look at the results , it 's , um , always better than {disfmarker} it seems always better than France Telecom for mismatch and high - mismatch .
Bro019.D.dialogueact642	1364.16	1367.23	D	PhD	s	+1	1	And it 's still slightly worse for well - matched .
Bro019.B.dialogueact644	1369.53	1369.69	B	PhD	s^2.%--	-1	0	But
Bro019.D.dialogueact643	1369.34	1370.01	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact645	1370.31	1371.75	D	PhD	s	+1	1	but this is not significant .
Bro019.D.dialogueact646	1371.92	1374.27	D	PhD	s	-1	0	But , the problem is that it 's not significant ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact647	1374.27	1380.99	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but if you put this in the , mmm , uh , spreadsheet , it 's still worse .
Bro019.D.dialogueact648	1381.33	1382.89	D	PhD	s^e.%--	-1	0	Even with very minor {disfmarker}
Bro019.D.dialogueact649	1384.07	1384.61	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact650	1385.3	1387.88	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	even if it 's only slightly worse for well - matched .
Bro019.C.dialogueact651	1388.29	1388.69	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.D.dialogueact652	1388.78	1390.98	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	And significantly better for HM .
Bro019.D.dialogueact653	1392.59	1392.93	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact654	1392.93	1393.45	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	but , well .
Bro019.D.dialogueact655	1394.94	1396.28	D	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	I don't think it 's importa important
Bro019.D.dialogueact656	1396.28	1398.92	D	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	because when they will change their metric ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact657	1399.3	1399.67	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact658	1400.33	1409.62	D	PhD	s^df^rt	-1	0	uh , mainly because of uh , when you p you plug the um , frame dropping in the baseline system , it will improve a lot HM , and MM ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact659	1410.29	1410.44	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.D.dialogueact660	1410.62	1411.17	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	so ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact661	1412.34	1414.86	D	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	um , I guess what will happen {disfmarker}
Bro019.D.dialogueact662	1417.5	1418.52	D	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I don't know what will happen .
Bro019.D.dialogueact663	1418.52	1423.99	D	PhD	s	-1	0	But , the different contribution , I think , for the different test set will be more even .
Bro019.A.dialogueact664	1422.2	1428.25	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Because the {disfmarker} your improvement on HM and MM will also go down significantly in the spreadsheet
Bro019.A.dialogueact665	1428.25	1428.57	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so .
Bro019.A.dialogueact666	1428.9	1432.0	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But the {pause} the well - matched may still {disfmarker}
Bro019.D.dialogueact667	1430.06	1430.57	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.A.dialogueact668	1432.46	1437.36	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean the well - matched may be the one which is least affected by adding the endpoint information .
Bro019.C.dialogueact669	1437.67	1437.91	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro019.A.dialogueact670	1438.33	1438.5	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact671	1438.58	1438.91	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	So the {disfmarker}
Bro019.A.dialogueact672	1439.04	1439.83	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	the MM {disfmarker}
Bro019.D.dialogueact673	1439.12	1439.71	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.A.dialogueact674	1440.37	1443.05	A	PhD	s	-1	0	MM and HM are going to be v hugely affected by it .
Bro019.A.dialogueact677	1443.18	1443.43	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.D.dialogueact675	1442.73	1443.11	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact676	1443.11	1443.77	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	so um ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact678	1444.75	1444.99	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact679	1445.38	1445.53	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact680	1445.96	1448.16	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But they d the {disfmarker} everything I mean is like ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact681	1448.49	1449.08	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	but there
Bro019.A.dialogueact682	1449.8	1454.13	A	PhD	s	-1	0	that 's how they reduce {disfmarker} why they reduce the qualification to twenty - five percent or some {disfmarker} something on .
Bro019.D.dialogueact683	1454.38	1454.72	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact684	1455.2	1456.33	C	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	But are they changing the weighting ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact685	1458.14	1459.59	A	PhD	h|s^ar	-1	0	Uh , no ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact686	1459.59	1462.38	A	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	I guess they are going ahead with the same weighting .
Bro019.D.dialogueact687	1462.96	1463.18	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact688	1463.57	1463.86	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact689	1465.13	1465.82	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So there 's nothing on {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact690	1465.43	1466.42	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I don't understand that .
Bro019.A.dialogueact692	1466.57	1466.86	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact691	1466.52	1469.34	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	I guess I {disfmarker} I haven't been part of the discussion ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact693	1469.34	1470.38	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so , um ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact694	1471.38	1474.54	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it seems to me that the well - matched condition is gonna be unusual ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact696	1475.74	1476.1	A	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	Usual .
Bro019.C.dialogueact695	1475.37	1476.14	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	in this case .
Bro019.C.dialogueact697	1476.26	1476.76	C	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	Unusual .
Bro019.A.dialogueact698	1476.87	1477.15	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro019.C.dialogueact699	1478.56	1488.07	C	Professor	s^df^rt	-1	0	Because , um , you don't actually have good matches ordinarily for what any @ @ {disfmarker} particular person 's car is like ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact700	1488.25	1488.64	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	or
Bro019.A.dialogueact701	1489.93	1490.6	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact702	1490.0	1490.8	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact703	1490.6	1490.99	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact704	1491.72	1497.08	C	Professor	s	-1	0	It seems like something like the middle one is {disfmarker} is more natural .
Bro019.A.dialogueact705	1496.11	1496.52	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro019.A.dialogueact707	1498.83	1499.1	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro019.C.dialogueact706	1498.63	1501.43	C	Professor	s^no.%--	-1	0	So I don't know why the {pause} well - matched is
Bro019.C.dialogueact708	1503.39	1503.61	C	Professor	%	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bro019.D.dialogueact709	1503.86	1504.13	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.A.dialogueact710	1504.8	1508.9	A	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah , but actually the well {disfmarker} well the well - matched
Bro019.A.dialogueact711	1509.34	1509.82	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact712	1512.81	1513.33	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact713	1514.01	1518.83	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean the {disfmarker} the well - matched condition is not like , uh , the one in TI - digits
Bro019.A.dialogueact714	1518.83	1526.51	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	where uh , you have all the training , uh , conditions exactly like replicated in the testing condition also .
Bro019.A.dialogueact715	1526.68	1529.63	A	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's like , this is not calibrated by SNR or something .
Bro019.A.dialogueact716	1529.63	1534.43	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	The well - matched has also some {disfmarker} some mismatch in that which is other than the {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact717	1535.15	1536.64	C	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	The well wa matched has mismatch ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact718	1536.21	1538.59	A	PhD	s^aap	-1	0	has {disfmarker} has also some slight mismatches ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact719	1538.59	1541.2	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	unlike the TI - digits where it 's like prefectly matched
Bro019.F.dialogueact720	1540.42	1541.08	F	PhD	s^2	-1	0	Perfect to match .
Bro019.A.dialogueact722	1541.31	1543.22	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because it 's artificially added noise .
Bro019.C.dialogueact721	1541.05	1541.23	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact724	1543.42	1544.94	A	PhD	s	-1	0	But this is natural recording .
Bro019.C.dialogueact723	1543.14	1543.31	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact725	1545.24	1546.75	C	Professor	s^co	-1	0	So remind me of what well - matched meant ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact727	1547.06	1548.5	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	The {disfmarker} the well - matched is like {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact726	1546.75	1547.78	C	Professor	s	-1	0	You 've told me many times .
Bro019.A.dialogueact728	1548.5	1554.01	A	PhD	s	-1	0	the {disfmarker} the well - matched is defined like it 's seventy percent of the whole database is used for training and thirty percent for testing .
Bro019.D.dialogueact729	1554.44	1554.56	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.D.dialogueact730	1554.78	1558.49	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , so it means that if the database is large enough , it 's matched .
Bro019.A.dialogueact731	1558.29	1559.15	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker}
Bro019.D.dialogueact732	1558.49	1560.29	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Because it
Bro019.A.dialogueact733	1560.02	1560.39	A	PhD	b	-1	0	OK ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact734	1560.39	1560.79	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	it 's {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact735	1560.67	1560.82	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.D.dialogueact736	1560.98	1563.42	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	in each set you have a range of conditions {disfmarker}
Bro019.D.dialogueact737	1563.53	1563.75	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact738	1564.12	1564.4	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bro019.C.dialogueact739	1564.66	1565.49	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So , I mean ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact740	1565.49	1570.32	C	Professor	s^bk|s	-1	0	yeah , unless they deliberately chose it to be different , which they didn't because they want it to be well - matched ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact741	1570.32	1571.29	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it is pretty much {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact742	1571.29	1573.05	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	You know , so it 's {disfmarker} so it 's sort of saying if you {disfmarker}
Bro019.F.dialogueact743	1572.15	1573.67	F	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} it 's not guaranteed though .
Bro019.A.dialogueact744	1574.4	1574.58	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact745	1574.43	1575.67	C	Professor	h|s^na	-1	0	Uh , it 's not guaranteed .

Bro019.A.dialogueact750	1577.05	1579.62	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Yeah because the m the main {disfmarker} major reason for the m
Bro019.C.dialogueact749	1576.74	1576.92	C	Professor	s^aa^r	-1	0	Right .
Bro019.A.dialogueact751	1579.62	1585.24	A	PhD	s	-1	0	the main mismatch is coming from the amount of noise and the silence frames and all those present in the database actually .
Bro019.C.dialogueact752	1585.62	1587.91	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Again , if you have enough {disfmarker} if you have enough {disfmarker}

Bro019.A.dialogueact754	1586.8	1587.48	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah , yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact755	1587.66	1587.93	A	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact756	1588.24	1590.34	C	Professor	s:s^bk	-1	0	So it 's sort of i i it 's sort of saying OK ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact757	1590.34	1597.57	C	Professor	s:s	-1	0	so you {disfmarker} much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer , um , you {disfmarker} you have a car ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact758	1597.57	1601.14	C	Professor	s:s	-1	0	and so you drive it around a bunch and {disfmarker} and record noise conditions , or something ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact759	1601.24	1603.21	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	and then {disfmarker} I don't think that 's very realistic ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact760	1603.21	1603.66	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	I mean I th
Bro019.A.dialogueact761	1603.72	1604.2	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact762	1604.82	1605.28	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I you know ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact763	1605.37	1605.75	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	so I {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact764	1606.59	1607.18	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} you know ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact765	1607.18	1614.82	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I guess they 're saying that if you were a company that was selling the stuff commercially , that you would have a bunch of people driving around in a bunch of cars ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact766	1614.82	1617.82	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and you would have something that was roughly similar
Bro019.C.dialogueact767	1617.82	1619.07	C	Professor	s^am	-1	0	and maybe that 's the argument ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact768	1619.07	1620.07	C	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	but I 'm not sure I buy it ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact769	1620.31	1620.42	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so .
Bro019.A.dialogueact770	1621.32	1622.55	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah , yeah , yeah .

Bro019.C.dialogueact773	1629.52	1630.12	C	Professor	qw^tc	-1	0	What else is going on ?
Bro019.D.dialogueact774	1630.67	1632.11	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .

Bro019.D.dialogueact777	1635.8	1645.76	D	PhD	s	+1	2	We are playing {disfmarker} we are also playing , trying to put other spectral subtraction mmm , in the code .
Bro019.D.dialogueact778	1646.04	1647.01	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact779	1648.92	1654.77	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	2	it would be a very simple spectral subtraction , on the um , mel energies
Bro019.D.dialogueact780	1656.35	1660.92	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which I already tested but without the um frame dropping actually ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact781	1660.92	1665.76	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and I think it 's important to have frame dropping if you use spectral subtraction .
Bro019.F.dialogueact782	1664.04	1670.37	F	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Is it {disfmarker} is spectral subtraction typically done on the {disfmarker} after the mel , uh , scaling
Bro019.F.dialogueact783	1670.37	1672.35	F	PhD	qrr	-1	0	or is it done on the FFT bins ?
Bro019.D.dialogueact784	1673.0	1673.95	D	PhD	h	-1	0	Um ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact785	1675.1	1675.64	F	PhD	qy	-1	0	Does it matter ,

Bro019.D.dialogueact789	1679.13	1682.73	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Well , it 's both {disfmarker} both uh , cases can i
Bro019.F.dialogueact790	1682.82	1683.07	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bro019.D.dialogueact791	1683.38	1683.5	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.D.dialogueact792	1684.15	1688.0	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	So - some of the proposal , uh , we 're doing this on the bin {disfmarker} on the FFT bins ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact793	1688.04	1688.36	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro019.D.dialogueact794	1688.65	1691.47	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	others on the um , mel energies .
Bro019.D.dialogueact795	1692.39	1693.31	D	PhD	s	-1	0	You can do both ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact796	1693.31	1697.81	D	PhD	s^no	-1	0	but I cannot tell you what 's {disfmarker} which one might be better
Bro019.D.dialogueact797	1697.81	1697.93	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	or {disfmarker}
Bro019.D.dialogueact799	1698.39	1698.58	D	PhD	%--	-1	0	I {disfmarker}
Bro019.F.dialogueact798	1697.96	1698.23	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro019.A.dialogueact800	1700.05	1703.91	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	I guess if you want to reconstruct the speech , it may be a good idea to do it on FFT bins .
Bro019.D.dialogueact801	1700.55	1701.02	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	I don't know .
Bro019.D.dialogueact803	1704.78	1705.06	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact804	1705.06	1705.18	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	but
Bro019.F.dialogueact802	1704.61	1704.9	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro019.A.dialogueact805	1705.99	1708.65	A	PhD	s	-1	0	But for speech recognition , it may not .
Bro019.A.dialogueact806	1709.26	1714.21	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	I mean it may not be very different if you do it on mel warped or whether you do it on FFT .
Bro019.A.dialogueact808	1715.0	1716.91	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So you 're going to do a linear weighting anyway after that .
Bro019.F.dialogueact807	1714.6	1714.99	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bro019.A.dialogueact809	1719.08	1719.34	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bro019.A.dialogueact810	1719.7	1719.96	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bro019.F.dialogueact811	1720.23	1720.49	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro019.A.dialogueact812	1721.02	1722.67	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So , it may not be really a big different .
Bro019.D.dialogueact813	1723.96	1725.15	D	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	Well , it gives something different ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact814	1725.15	1730.16	D	PhD	s^df^no	-1	0	but I don't know what are the , pros and cons of both .
Bro019.A.dialogueact815	1727.37	1727.54	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	It
Bro019.A.dialogueact816	1728.96	1729.42	A	PhD	b	-1	0	I Uh - huh .
Bro019.C.dialogueact817	1732.28	1732.62	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro019.A.dialogueact818	1733.34	1733.67	A	PhD	z	-1	0	So
Bro019.C.dialogueact819	1734.53	1734.81	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.A.dialogueact820	1735.21	1739.33	A	PhD	s^tc	-1	0	The other thing is like when you 're putting in a speech enhancement technique ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact821	1739.55	1739.87	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact822	1740.98	1742.78	A	PhD	qy	-1	0	is it like one stage speech enhancement ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact823	1742.78	1746.52	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Because everybody seems to have a mod two stages of speech enhancement in all the proposals ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact824	1746.52	1748.28	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which is really giving them some improvement .

Bro019.A.dialogueact828	1752.01	1754.67	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean they just do the same thing again once more .
Bro019.C.dialogueact829	1754.31	1754.66	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.A.dialogueact830	1758.03	1761.51	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} So , there 's something that is good about doing it {disfmarker}
Bro019.A.dialogueact831	1761.51	1763.44	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	I mean , to cleaning it up once more .
Bro019.D.dialogueact832	1763.79	1764.36	D	PhD	s^aa|s^am	-1	0	Yeah , it might be .
Bro019.A.dialogueact834	1764.73	1765.1	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact833	1764.36	1764.5	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact835	1765.1	1765.84	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	so we can {disfmarker}
Bro019.D.dialogueact836	1765.68	1772.21	D	PhD	s	-1	0	So maybe in my implementation I should also try to inspire me from this kind of thing
Bro019.A.dialogueact837	1768.9	1769.29	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact838	1771.38	1771.91	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	That 's what
Bro019.C.dialogueact840	1772.53	1774.41	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Well , the other thing would be to combine what you 're doing .
Bro019.D.dialogueact839	1772.21	1772.62	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker} Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact841	1774.41	1778.74	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	I mean maybe one or {disfmarker} one or the other of the things that you 're doing would benefit from the other happening first .
Bro019.A.dialogueact842	1776.6	1777.25	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	That 's wh

Bro019.C.dialogueact845	1779.74	1779.89	C	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	Right ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact846	1779.89	1781.49	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so he 's doing a signal subspace thing ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact847	1781.49	1784.61	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	maybe it would work better if you 'd already done some simple spectral subtraction ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact848	1784.61	1786.25	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	or maybe vi maybe the other way around ,

Bro019.A.dialogueact854	1787.1	1790.2	A	PhD	s^tc	-1	0	So I 've been thinking about combining the Wiener filtering with signal subspace ,

Bro019.A.dialogueact855	1790.2	1794.72	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	I mean just to see all {disfmarker} some {disfmarker} some such permutation combination to see whether it really helps or not .

Bro019.C.dialogueact862	1800.35	1801.62	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I guess I 'm ignorant about this ,

Bro019.C.dialogueact864	1802.95	1811.7	C	Professor	qw	-1	0	I mean , since Wiener filter also assumes that you 're {disfmarker} that you 're adding together the two signals , how is {disfmarker} how is that differ from signal subspace ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact865	1812.62	1813.59	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	The signal subspace ?

Bro019.A.dialogueact871	1821.34	1823.93	A	PhD	s	-1	0	It is like a KL transform followed by a Wiener filter .
Bro019.A.dialogueact872	1824.31	1826.39	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Is the signal is {disfmarker} is a signal substrate .
Bro019.C.dialogueact873	1824.42	1825.08	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , oh , OK
Bro019.C.dialogueact874	1825.08	1826.08	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so the difference is the KL .
Bro019.A.dialogueact875	1827.26	1828.86	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So , the {disfmarker} the different {disfmarker}
Bro019.A.dialogueact876	1828.86	1837.49	A	PhD	s	-1	0	the c the {disfmarker} the advantage of combining two things is mainly coming from the signal subspace approach doesn't work very well if the SNR is very bad .

Bro019.C.dialogueact880	1845.08	1849.04	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	So essentially you could do simple spectral subtraction , followed by a KL transform , followed by a

Bro019.A.dialogueact896	1880.06	1882.23	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So that {disfmarker} that 's one reason maybe we could combine
Bro019.A.dialogueact897	1882.52	1887.43	A	PhD	s^cs^df	-1	0	s some {disfmarker} something to improve SNR a little bit , first stage ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact898	1886.45	1886.64	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact899	1887.43	1889.29	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	and then do a something in the second stage
Bro019.A.dialogueact900	1889.29	1891.28	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which could take it further .
Bro019.D.dialogueact901	1893.17	1896.1	D	PhD	qw^br^rt	-1	0	What was your point about {disfmarker} about colored noise there ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact902	1896.35	1897.36	A	PhD	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	Oh , the colored noise
Bro019.A.dialogueact904	1897.6	1897.95	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bro019.D.dialogueact903	1897.46	1897.87	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact905	1898.87	1907.09	A	PhD	s	-1	0	the colored noise {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the v the signal subspace approach has {disfmarker} I mean , it {disfmarker} it actually depends on inverting the matrices .
Bro019.A.dialogueact906	1907.18	1907.99	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	So it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} ac
Bro019.A.dialogueact907	1908.55	1911.35	A	PhD	s	-1	0	the covariance matrix of the noise .
Bro019.A.dialogueact909	1912.14	1915.12	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So if {disfmarker} if it is not positive definite ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact908	1911.76	1911.98	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.A.dialogueact910	1915.12	1916.4	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I mean it has a {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker}
Bro019.A.dialogueact911	1916.46	1918.57	A	PhD	s	-1	0	It doesn't behave very well if it is not positive definite
Bro019.A.dialogueact912	1918.57	1918.8	A	PhD	%	-1	0	ak
Bro019.A.dialogueact913	1919.0	1923.45	A	PhD	s	-1	0	It works very well with white noise because we know for sure that it has a positive definite .
Bro019.C.dialogueact914	1923.09	1924.97	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	So you should do spectral subtraction and then add noise .
Bro019.A.dialogueact915	1927.7	1930.2	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So the way they get around is like they do an inverse filtering ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact916	1930.57	1932.7	A	PhD	s	-1	0	first of the colo colored noise
Bro019.C.dialogueact917	1930.89	1931.11	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact918	1932.7	1933.92	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and then make the noise white ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact919	1932.9	1933.05	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact920	1933.92	1937.09	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and then finally when you reconstruct the speech back , you do this filtering again .
Bro019.D.dialogueact921	1934.12	1934.6	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , right .
Bro019.C.dialogueact922	1937.3	1938.07	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I was only half kidding .
Bro019.C.dialogueact923	1938.07	1942.07	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean if you {disfmarker} sort of {vocalsound} you do the s spectral subtraction , that also gets rid {disfmarker}
Bro019.A.dialogueact925	1939.2	1939.46	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.D.dialogueact924	1938.78	1939.1	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact926	1940.96	1941.19	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact927	1942.07	1945.53	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and then you {disfmarker} then {disfmarker} then add a little bit l noise {disfmarker} noise addition {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact928	1945.53	1947.58	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , that sort of what J {disfmarker} JRASTA does , in a way .
Bro019.A.dialogueact930	1948.25	1948.39	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact929	1948.17	1952.74	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	If you look at what JRASTA doing essentially i i it 's equivalent to sort of adding a little {disfmarker} adding a little noise ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact931	1948.67	1948.98	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Huh ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact932	1949.29	1949.54	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro019.D.dialogueact933	1954.34	1955.32	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro019.C.dialogueact934	1955.14	1956.24	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	in order to get rid of the effects of noise .
Bro019.A.dialogueact935	1958.44	1958.83	A	PhD	b	-1	0	So .
Bro019.C.dialogueact937	1959.67	1959.97	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.D.dialogueact936	1959.23	1959.49	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.D.dialogueact938	1961.7	1962.21	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	Uh , yeah .
Bro019.D.dialogueact939	1962.44	1963.28	D	PhD	s^rt^tc	-1	0	So there is this .
Bro019.D.dialogueact940	1963.56	1964.12	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	And
Bro019.D.dialogueact941	1965.02	1965.49	D	PhD	%--	+1	1	maybe we {disfmarker}
Bro019.D.dialogueact942	1965.69	1971.53	D	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	well we find some people so that {vocalsound} uh , agree to maybe work with us ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact943	1971.97	1975.35	D	PhD	s	+1	1	and they have implementation of VTS techniques
Bro019.D.dialogueact944	1976.51	1990.04	D	PhD	s	+1	1	so it 's um , Vector Taylor Series that are used to mmm , {vocalsound} uh f to model the transformation between clean cepstra and noisy cepstra .
Bro019.D.dialogueact945	1992.93	1993.25	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	So . Well ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact946	1993.49	2002.75	D	PhD	s	-1	0	if you take the standard model of channel plus noise , uh , it 's {disfmarker} it 's a nonlinear eh uh , transformation in the cepstral domain .
Bro019.C.dialogueact947	1997.17	1997.91	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact948	2003.1	2003.4	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bro019.D.dialogueact949	2003.27	2003.82	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	And
Bro019.D.dialogueact950	2004.79	2011.52	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	uh , there is a way to approximate this using uh , first - order or second - order Taylor Series
Bro019.D.dialogueact951	2011.52	2011.73	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	and
Bro019.D.dialogueact952	2012.85	2018.24	D	PhD	s	+1	1	it can be used for {vocalsound} uh , getting rid of the noise and the channel effect .
Bro019.C.dialogueact953	2018.65	2019.34	C	Professor	qw^rt	-1	0	Who is doing this ?
Bro019.D.dialogueact954	2018.99	2020.71	D	PhD	qy^bu^d	-1	0	Uh w working in the cepstral domain ?
Bro019.D.dialogueact955	2021.22	2023.24	D	PhD	s	-1	0	So there is one guy in Grenada ,
Bro019.B.dialogueact956	2022.37	2023.33	B	PhD	s^bk|s^2	-1	0	Yeah , in Grenada
Bro019.B.dialogueact958	2023.39	2024.68	B	PhD	s	-1	0	one of my friend .
Bro019.D.dialogueact957	2023.24	2029.71	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and another in {pause} uh , Lucent that I met at ICASSP .
Bro019.C.dialogueact960	2031.06	2031.79	C	Professor	qw	-1	0	Who 's the guy in Grenada ?
Bro019.D.dialogueact959	2031.01	2031.8	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bro019.B.dialogueact961	2032.71	2034.16	B	PhD	h|s	-1	0	Uh , Jose Carlos Segura .
Bro019.C.dialogueact962	2036.37	2037.12	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I don't know him .
Bro019.A.dialogueact963	2036.91	2039.7	A	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	This VTS has been proposed by CMU ?
Bro019.D.dialogueact964	2038.31	2038.77	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.A.dialogueact965	2039.7	2040.96	A	PhD	qy	-1	0	Is it {disfmarker} is it the CMU ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact967	2041.23	2042.03	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , yeah , OK .
Bro019.B.dialogueact966	2040.74	2041.37	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bro019.B.dialogueact968	2041.55	2044.59	B	PhD	s^na	-1	0	Originally the idea was from CMU .
Bro019.A.dialogueact970	2042.46	2042.92	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	From C .
Bro019.D.dialogueact969	2042.24	2042.55	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.D.dialogueact971	2044.78	2044.98	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact972	2045.45	2045.77	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro019.D.dialogueact973	2047.52	2050.95	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , it 's again a different thing {vocalsound} {vocalsound} that could be tried .
Bro019.D.dialogueact974	2051.95	2053.23	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact975	2053.24	2053.43	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro019.D.dialogueact976	2056.1	2057.4	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	Mmm , yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact977	2057.7	2067.84	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , so at any rate , you 're looking general , uh , standing back from it , looking at ways to combine one form or another of uh , noise removal , uh , with {disfmarker} with these other things we have ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact978	2066.27	2068.74	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact979	2068.79	2072.9	C	Professor	fh|s^ba	-1	0	uh , looks like a worthy thing to {disfmarker} to do here .
Bro019.D.dialogueact980	2075.17	2075.63	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh , yeah .
Bro019.D.dialogueact981	2077.15	2077.48	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	But , yeah .
Bro019.D.dialogueact982	2077.59	2086.81	D	PhD	s	-1	0	But for sure there 's required to {disfmarker} that requires to re - check everything else , and re - optimize the other things
Bro019.C.dialogueact983	2084.99	2085.22	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh yeah .
Bro019.D.dialogueact984	2086.81	2087.51	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	and ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact985	2087.69	2090.76	D	PhD	s	-1	0	for sure the on - line normalization may be the LDA filter .
Bro019.D.dialogueact986	2091.88	2093.14	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact987	2093.55	2096.79	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Well one of the {disfmarker} seems like one of the things to go through next week when Hari 's here ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact988	2093.84	2094.25	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	I {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact989	2096.79	2098.83	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	cuz Hari 'll have his own ideas too {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact991	2098.83	2100.14	C	Professor	s	-1	0	or {pause} I guess not next week ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact990	2098.53	2098.72	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro019.C.dialogueact992	2100.14	2100.68	C	Professor	s^bsc	-1	0	week and a half ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact993	2101.46	2103.57	C	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	uh , will be sort of go through these alternatives ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact994	2103.57	2104.67	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	what we 've seen so far ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact995	2104.67	2106.42	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and come up with some game plans .
Bro019.C.dialogueact996	2106.53	2106.94	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro019.C.dialogueact997	2106.94	2107.26	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	You know .
Bro019.C.dialogueact998	2107.26	2108.29	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So , I mean one way would {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact999	2109.35	2110.78	C	Professor	s	-1	0	he Here are some alternate visions .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1000	2110.78	2113.8	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	I mean one would be , you look at a few things very quickly ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1001	2113.8	2115.81	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	you pick on something that looks like it 's promising
Bro019.C.dialogueact1002	2115.81	2119.02	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and then everybody works really hard on the same {disfmarker} different aspects of the same thing .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1003	2119.54	2123.96	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	Another thing would be to have t to {disfmarker} to pick two pol two plausible things ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1004	2123.96	2128.08	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and you know , have t sort of two working things for a while until we figure out what 's better ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact1005	2124.77	2125.66	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1006	2128.08	2128.36	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	and then ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1007	2129.04	2129.3	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	you know ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1008	2129.51	2129.92	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1009	2130.85	2131.8	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	but , w um ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1010	2133.04	2135.22	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh , he 'll have some ideas on that too .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1011	2137.4	2144.26	A	PhD	s^tc	-1	0	The other thing is to , uh {disfmarker} Most of the speech enhancement techniques have reported results on small vocabulary tasks .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1012	2145.28	2148.93	A	PhD	s	-1	0	But we {disfmarker} we going to address this Wall Street Journal in our next stage ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact1013	2149.04	2150.51	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which is also going to be a noisy task
Bro019.A.dialogueact1014	2150.51	2155.46	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so s very few people have reported something on using some continuous speech at all .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1015	2156.12	2157.67	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So , there are some {disfmarker}
Bro019.A.dialogueact1016	2157.85	2163.1	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , I was looking at some literature on speech enhancement applied to large vocabulary tasks
Bro019.A.dialogueact1017	2163.1	2163.46	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and
Bro019.A.dialogueact1018	2165.97	2171.64	A	PhD	s	-1	0	spectral subtraction doesn't seems to be the thing to do for large vocabulary tasks .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1019	2171.94	2172.48	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	And it 's {disfmarker}
Bro019.A.dialogueact1020	2172.48	2177.78	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Always people have shown improvement with Wiener filtering and maybe subspace approach over spectral subtraction everywhere .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1021	2178.54	2185.31	A	PhD	s	-1	0	But if we {disfmarker} if we have to use simple spectral subtraction , we may have to do some optimization {pause} to make it work @ @ .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1022	2185.54	2186.3	C	Professor	s^bu.%--	-1	0	So they 're making {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact1023	2186.3	2190.2	C	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	there {disfmarker} Somebody 's generating Wall Street Journal with additive {disfmarker} artificially added noise or something ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact1024	2190.02	2190.56	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1025	2190.74	2192.91	C	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	Sort of a {disfmarker} sort of like what they did with TI - digits , and ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact1026	2192.73	2192.91	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1028	2193.65	2193.82	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1027	2193.31	2193.82	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , OK .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1029	2193.96	2195.96	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I m I guess Guenter Hirsch is in charge of that .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1030	2196.54	2197.34	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Guenter Hirsch and TI .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1031	2196.57	2197.03	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1032	2197.34	2197.91	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Maybe Roger {disfmarker}
Bro019.A.dialogueact1033	2198.21	2199.36	A	PhD	s	-1	0	r Roger , maybe in charge of .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1034	2199.68	2203.26	C	Professor	qy^bu^d.%--	-1	0	And then they 're {disfmarker} they 're uh , uh , generating HTK scripts to {disfmarker}

Bro019.B.dialogueact1187	2527.13	2528.23	B	PhD	s^e	+1	1	sometime it 's worse ,
Bro019.B.dialogueact1188	2528.23	2529.8	B	PhD	s^e	+1	1	sometime it 's a little bit better ,
Bro019.B.dialogueact1189	2529.8	2531.04	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	but not significantly .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1191	2533.03	2534.58	A	PhD	qr.%--	-1	0	Uh , is it with TI - digits , or with {disfmarker} ?
Bro019.B.dialogueact1190	2532.94	2533.14	B	PhD	fg	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bro019.B.dialogueact1192	2535.12	2538.51	B	PhD	s^ar|s^nd	-1	0	No , I work with eh , Italian and Spanish basically .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1193	2537.88	2538.21	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1194	2538.38	2538.68	A	PhD	s^bk^r	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.B.dialogueact1195	2539.44	2549.5	B	PhD	s	-1	0	And if I don't y use the neural network , and use directly the feature the results are worse .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1196	2547.78	2548.09	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro019.B.dialogueact1197	2551.89	2553.5	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	But Doesn't help .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1199	2555.04	2557.22	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I really wonder though .
Bro019.D.dialogueact1198	2554.76	2555.35	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1200	2557.22	2558.99	C	Professor	s	+1	1	I mean we 've had these discussions before ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1201	2558.99	2578.8	C	Professor	s	+1	1	and {disfmarker} and one of the things that struck me was that {disfmarker} uh , about this line of thought that was particularly interesting to me was that we um {disfmarker} whenever you condense things , uh , in an irreversible way , um , you throw away some information .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1202	2579.46	2583.11	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And , that 's mostly viewed on as a good thing , in the way we use it ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1203	2583.16	2590.41	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because we wanna suppress things that will cause variability for uh particular , uh , phonetic units .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1204	2591.34	2591.82	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1205	2592.35	2593.75	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but , you 'll do throw something away .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1206	2594.55	2599.51	C	Professor	s:qy	+1	1	And so the question is , uh , can we figure out if there 's something we 've thrown away that we shouldn't have .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1207	2600.62	2601.56	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	And um .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1208	2601.56	2602.07	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1209	2602.68	2609.59	C	Professor	s:s^bk	+1	1	when they were looking at the difference between the filter bank and the FFT that was going into the filter bank , I was thinking " oh , OK ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1210	2609.59	2610.74	C	Professor	s:s	+1	1	so they 're picking on something
Bro019.C.dialogueact1211	2611.23	2615.79	C	Professor	s:s	+1	1	they 're looking on it to figure out noise , or voice {disfmarker} voiced property whatever . "
Bro019.C.dialogueact1212	2615.79	2616.71	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	So that {disfmarker} that 's interesting .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1213	2616.71	2620.79	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Maybe that helps to drive the {disfmarker} the thought process of coming up with the features .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1214	2621.11	2626.06	C	Professor	s:qy	+1	1	But for me sort of the interesting thing was , " well , but is there just something in that difference which is useful ? "
Bro019.C.dialogueact1215	2626.66	2632.94	C	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	So another way of doing it , maybe , would be just to take the FFT uh , power spectrum , and feed it into a neural network ,
Bro019.B.dialogueact1217	2635.28	2635.58	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	To know {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact1216	2635.15	2638.4	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and then use it , you know , in combination , or alone , or {disfmarker} or whatever
Bro019.F.dialogueact1218	2638.15	2639.21	F	PhD	qw^d^rt	-1	0	Wi - with what targets ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact1219	2640.24	2641.99	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Voiced , unvoiced is like {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact1220	2641.36	2642.21	C	Professor	h|s^ar	-1	0	Uh , no .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1221	2642.3	2642.46	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1222	2642.46	2643.09	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Or anything .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1223	2643.38	2643.52	C	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	No
Bro019.C.dialogueact1224	2643.52	2647.44	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	the {disfmarker} just the same {disfmarker} same way we 're using {disfmarker} I mean , the same way that we 're using the filter bank .
Bro019.F.dialogueact1225	2646.24	2646.62	F	PhD	s^2	-1	0	Phones .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1226	2647.81	2648.27	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1228	2649.0	2650.76	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Exact way {disfmarker} the same way we 're using the filter bank .
Bro019.D.dialogueact1227	2648.7	2649.08	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1229	2650.76	2653.68	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	I mean , the filter bank is good for all the reasons that we say it 's good .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1230	2654.06	2654.69	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	But it 's different .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1231	2655.15	2660.35	C	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	And , you know , maybe if it 's used in combination , it will get at something that we 're missing .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1233	2661.65	2680.76	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And maybe , you know , using , orth you know , KLT , or uh , um , adding probabilities , I mean , all th all the different ways that we 've been playing with , that we would let the {disfmarker} essentially let the neural network determine what is it that 's useful , that we 're missing here .
Bro019.D.dialogueact1232	2661.48	2661.97	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.D.dialogueact1234	2679.89	2680.2	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1236	2681.55	2681.85	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.D.dialogueact1235	2681.45	2685.41	D	PhD	s^bk|s^ng	-1	0	Yeah , but there is so much variability in the power spectrum .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1237	2685.94	2690.72	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , that 's probably why y i it would be unlikely to work as well by itself ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1239	2691.24	2692.83	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but it might help in combination .
Bro019.D.dialogueact1238	2691.04	2691.64	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.D.dialogueact1240	2692.93	2693.56	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1241	2693.69	2694.88	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I have to tell you ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1242	2694.88	2696.12	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I can't remember the conference ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1243	2696.12	2701.97	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but , uh , I think it 's about ten years ago , I remember going to one of the speech conferences
Bro019.C.dialogueact1244	2701.97	2703.3	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and uh ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1245	2704.05	2713.25	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I saw within very short distance of one another a couple different posters that showed about the wonders of some auditory inspired front - end or something ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1246	2713.25	2718.47	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and a couple posters away it was somebody who compared one to uh , just putting in the FFT
Bro019.C.dialogueact1247	2718.47	2719.92	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and the FFT did slightly better .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1249	2720.83	2724.01	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So I mean the {disfmarker} i i It 's true there 's lots of variability ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact1248	2720.44	2720.7	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1250	2724.01	2731.96	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but again we have these wonderful statistical mechanisms for quantifying that a that variability , and you know , doing something reasonable with it .
Bro019.D.dialogueact1251	2729.26	2729.8	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1252	2732.02	2732.5	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1253	2733.18	2733.83	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1254	2734.4	2735.09	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1255	2736.28	2743.83	C	Professor	s	-1	0	It - it 's same , you know , argument that 's gone both ways about uh , you know , we have these data driven filters , in LDA ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1256	2744.35	2752.8	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and on the other hand , if it 's data driven it means it 's driven by things that have lots of variability , and that are necessarily {disfmarker} not necessarily gonna be the same in training and test ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1257	2753.44	2756.53	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	so , in some ways it 's good to have data driven things ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1258	2756.53	2758.43	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and in some ways it 's bad to have data driven things .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1259	2758.43	2758.78	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact1260	2759.26	2759.72	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah , d
Bro019.C.dialogueact1261	2759.26	2763.65	C	Professor	s	-1	0	part of what we 're discovering , is ways to combine things that are data driven than are not .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1262	2764.17	2764.33	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1263	2765.08	2770.24	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh , so anyway , it 's just a thought , that {disfmarker} that if we {disfmarker} if we had that {disfmarker} maybe it 's just a baseline
Bro019.C.dialogueact1264	2770.97	2773.85	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	uh , which would show us " well , what are we really getting out of the filters " ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1265	2774.12	2775.22	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	or maybe i i
Bro019.C.dialogueact1266	2775.58	2776.53	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	probably not by itself ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1267	2776.53	2777.79	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	but in combination ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1269	2778.44	2779.01	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact1268	2778.29	2779.53	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1270	2779.16	2781.17	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you know , maybe there 's something to be gained from it ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1271	2781.24	2782.2	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and let the {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact1272	2783.37	2785.73	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But , you know , y you 've only worked with us for a short time ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1273	2785.73	2791.72	C	Professor	s	-1	0	maybe in a year or two you w you will actually come up with the right set of things to extract from this information .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1274	2792.12	2795.16	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But , maybe the neural net and the H M Ms could figure it out quicker than you .
Bro019.B.dialogueact1275	2796.4	2796.74	B	PhD	s^am	-1	0	Maybe .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1276	2796.59	2796.84	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro019.B.dialogueact1278	2797.41	2797.53	B	PhD	s^bk	+1	1	Yeah ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1277	2797.11	2797.97	C	Professor	s^df	+1	1	It 's just a thought .
Bro019.B.dialogueact1279	2797.82	2799.9	B	PhD	s^cc	+1	1	I can {disfmarker} I will try to do that .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1280	2800.6	2800.82	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1281	2802.11	2817.97	A	PhD	s	-1	0	What {disfmarker} one {disfmarker} one um p one thing is like what {disfmarker} before we started using this VAD in this Aurora , the {disfmarker} th what we did was like , I {disfmarker} I guess most of you know about this , adding this additional speech - silence bit to the cepstrum and training the HMM on that .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1282	2817.02	2817.35	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1283	2818.87	2820.05	A	PhD	s	-1	0	That is just a binary feature
Bro019.A.dialogueact1284	2820.05	2825.5	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and that seems to be {vocalsound} improving a lot on the SpeechDat - Car where there is a lot of noise
Bro019.A.dialogueact1285	2825.5	2826.85	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but not much on the TI - digits .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1286	2826.85	2832.3	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So , a adding an additional feature to distin to discriminate between speech and nonspeech was helping .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1287	2833.62	2833.88	A	PhD	s	-1	0	That 's it .
Bro019.D.dialogueact1288	2833.68	2834.55	D	PhD	qw^br^rt	-1	0	Wait {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm sorry ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact1289	2834.68	2837.52	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Yeah , we actually added an additional binary feature to the cepstrum ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact1290	2837.52	2838.3	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	just the baseline .
Bro019.D.dialogueact1291	2838.54	2838.7	D	PhD	qy^bh	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bro019.B.dialogueact1292	2839.35	2840.59	B	PhD	s	-1	0	You did some experiment .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1293	2840.26	2840.47	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact1294	2841.01	2841.23	A	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1295	2841.23	2844.66	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , in {disfmarker} in the case of TI - digits it didn't actually give us anything ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact1296	2844.8	2847.61	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because there wasn't any f anything to discriminate between speech ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact1297	2845.93	2846.31	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1298	2847.61	2848.35	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	and it was very short .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1300	2848.35	2853.24	A	PhD	s	-1	0	But Italian was like very {disfmarker} it was a huge improvement on Italian .
Bro019.D.dialogueact1299	2848.0	2848.31	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro019.D.dialogueact1301	2849.02	2849.17	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bro019.D.dialogueact1302	2852.64	2852.9	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.D.dialogueact1303	2853.47	2858.53	D	PhD	s	-1	0	But anyway the question is even more , is within speech , can we get some features ?
Bro019.D.dialogueact1304	2859.15	2862.16	D	PhD	qy	-1	0	Are we drop dropping information that can might be useful within speech ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact1306	2862.31	2862.55	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro019.D.dialogueact1305	2862.16	2866.13	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	I mean . To {disfmarker} maybe to distinguish between voice sound and unvoiced sounds ?
Bro019.A.dialogueact1307	2863.17	2863.53	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1308	2864.02	2864.49	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .

Bro019.A.dialogueact1353	2923.74	2926.51	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So it was on PLP derived cepstral coefficients .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1354	2927.06	2930.64	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , but again {disfmarker} You could argue that th that 's exactly what the neural network does .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1355	2928.88	2929.29	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1356	2931.51	2938.24	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	So n neural network uh , is in some sense equivalent to computing , you know , higher - order moments of what you {disfmarker}

Bro019.C.dialogueact1371	2948.77	2950.46	C	Professor	qy^rt^tc	+1	2	anything on your end you want to talk about ?
Bro019.C.dialogueact1372	2950.46	2951.08	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bro019.G.dialogueact1373	2950.68	2952.82	G	Grad	h|s^nd	-1	0	Um , nothing I wanna really talk about .
Bro019.G.dialogueact1374	2952.82	2956.67	G	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	I can {disfmarker} I can just uh , um , share a little bit {disfmarker}
Bro019.G.dialogueact1375	2956.92	2959.8	G	Grad	s^df	+1	2	Sunil hasn't {disfmarker} hasn't heard about uh , what I 've been doing .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1376	2958.76	2959.04	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.G.dialogueact1377	2960.24	2960.54	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro019.G.dialogueact1378	2961.18	2961.63	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	so ,
Bro019.G.dialogueact1379	2962.8	2966.85	G	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um , I told you I was {disfmarker} I was {disfmarker} I was getting prepared to take this qualifier exam .
Bro019.G.dialogueact1380	2967.03	2974.86	G	Grad	s^df	+1	2	So basically that 's just , um , trying to propose um , uh , your next your {disfmarker} your following years of {disfmarker} of your PHD work ,
Bro019.G.dialogueact1381	2974.86	2979.52	G	Grad	s^df	+1	2	trying {disfmarker} trying to find a project to {disfmarker} to define and {disfmarker} and to work on .
Bro019.G.dialogueact1382	2979.89	2988.45	G	Grad	s	+1	2	So , I 've been , uh , looking into , um , doing something about r uh , speech recognition using acoustic events .
Bro019.G.dialogueact1383	2988.93	2989.32	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bro019.G.dialogueact1384	2989.8	2993.59	G	Grad	s	-1	0	um , the idea is you have all these {disfmarker} these different events ,
Bro019.G.dialogueact1385	2993.59	2994.96	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	for example voicing ,
Bro019.G.dialogueact1386	2995.07	2995.85	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	nasality ,
Bro019.G.dialogueact1387	2995.85	2996.75	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	R - coloring ,
Bro019.G.dialogueact1388	2997.02	2997.76	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	you know burst
Bro019.G.dialogueact1389	2997.87	2999.65	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	or noise , uh , frication ,
Bro019.G.dialogueact1390	2999.65	3000.49	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	that kinda stuff ,
Bro019.G.dialogueact1391	3000.89	3007.41	G	Grad	s	+1	2	um , building robust um , primary detectors for these acoustic events ,
Bro019.G.dialogueact1392	3007.87	3012.73	G	Grad	s	+1	2	and using the outputs of these robust detectors to do speech recognition .
Bro019.G.dialogueact1393	3013.63	3014.07	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro019.G.dialogueact1394	3014.65	3034.26	G	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and , um , these {disfmarker} these primary detectors , um , will be , uh , inspired by , you know , multi - band techniques , um , doing things , um , similar to Larry Saul 's work on , uh , graphical models to {disfmarker} to detect these {disfmarker} these , uh , acoustic events .
Bro019.G.dialogueact1395	3035.0	3038.93	G	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	And , um , so I {disfmarker} I been {disfmarker} I been thinking about that
Bro019.G.dialogueact1396	3039.2	3046.22	G	Grad	s	-1	0	and some of the issues that I 've been running into are , um , exactly what {disfmarker} what kind of acoustic events I need ,
Bro019.G.dialogueact1397	3046.52	3054.18	G	Grad	s	-1	0	what {disfmarker} um , what acoustic events will provide a {disfmarker} a good enough coverage to {disfmarker} in order to do the later recognition steps .
Bro019.G.dialogueact1398	3054.65	3062.71	G	Grad	s	-1	0	And , also , um , once I decide a set of acoustic events , um , h how do I {disfmarker} how do I get labels ?
Bro019.G.dialogueact1399	3062.71	3065.52	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	Training data for {disfmarker} for these acoustic events .
Bro019.G.dialogueact1400	3065.92	3072.06	G	Grad	s	-1	0	And , then later on down the line , I can start playing with the {disfmarker} the models themselves ,
Bro019.G.dialogueact1401	3072.06	3073.56	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	the {disfmarker} the primary detectors .
Bro019.G.dialogueact1402	3073.91	3074.38	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro019.G.dialogueact1403	3074.85	3075.21	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	so ,
Bro019.G.dialogueact1404	3075.89	3092.62	G	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um , I kinda see {disfmarker} like , after {disfmarker} after building the primary detectors I see um , myself taking the outputs and feeding them in , sorta tandem style into {disfmarker} into a um , Gaussian mixtures HMM back - end , um , and doing recognition .
Bro019.G.dialogueact1405	3092.89	3093.21	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro019.G.dialogueact1406	3094.06	3097.85	G	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	So , that 's {disfmarker} that 's just generally what I 've been looking at .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1407	3097.38	3097.55	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.G.dialogueact1408	3098.31	3098.88	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1409	3099.09	3105.95	C	Professor	s	-1	0	By {disfmarker} by the way , uh , the voiced - unvoiced version of that for instance could tie right in to what Carmen was looking at .
Bro019.G.dialogueact1410	3100.19	3100.39	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1411	3106.06	3106.43	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact1412	3106.55	3106.79	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1413	3107.31	3111.97	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you know , um , if you {disfmarker} if a multi - band approach was helpful as {disfmarker} as I think it is ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1414	3111.97	3113.92	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it seems to be helpful for determining voiced - unvoiced ,
Bro019.G.dialogueact1415	3112.07	3112.41	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1416	3113.92	3117.11	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	that one might be another thing .

Bro019.C.dialogueact1502	3251.26	3254.81	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , last week you were doing this stuff with Pierre , you were {disfmarker} you were mentioning .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1503	3254.81	3257.23	C	Professor	qy^rt	+1	1	Is that {disfmarker} that something worth talking about ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1504	3257.23	3257.49	C	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bro019.E.dialogueact1505	3257.75	3258.03	E	Grad	h	-1	0	Um ,
Bro019.E.dialogueact1506	3258.86	3259.27	E	Grad	%--	-1	0	it 's {disfmarker}
Bro019.E.dialogueact1507	3259.43	3261.99	E	Grad	s^ng	+1	1	Well , um , it {disfmarker} I don't think it directly relates .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1508	3261.99	3266.11	E	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	Um , well , so , I was helping a speech researcher named Pierre Divenyi
Bro019.E.dialogueact1509	3266.11	3274.98	E	Grad	s	+1	1	and he 's int He wanted to um , look at um , how people respond to formant changes , I think .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1510	3274.98	3275.5	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1511	3275.84	3280.36	E	Grad	s	+1	1	So he {disfmarker} he created a lot of synthetic audio files of vowel - to - vowel transitions ,
Bro019.E.dialogueact1512	3280.98	3285.32	E	Grad	s	+1	1	and then he wanted a psycho - acoustic um , spectrum .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1513	3286.92	3293.26	E	Grad	s	+1	1	And he wanted to look at um , how the energy is moving {pause} over time in that spectrum
Bro019.E.dialogueact1514	3293.26	3295.84	E	Grad	s	+1	1	and compare that to the {disfmarker} to the listener tests .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1515	3296.45	3297.28	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	And , um .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1516	3297.73	3300.93	E	Grad	s	-1	0	So , I gave him a PLP spectrum .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1517	3300.93	3305.38	E	Grad	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} to um {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he t wanted to track the peaks so he could look at how they 're moving .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1518	3305.38	3311.73	E	Grad	s	-1	0	So I took the um , PLP LPC coefficients and um , I found the roots .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1519	3311.73	3313.42	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	This was something that Stephane suggested .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1520	3313.83	3319.84	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I found the roots of the um , LPC polynomial to , um , track the peaks in the , um , PLP LPC spectra .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1521	3322.16	3324.65	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	well there is aligned spectral pairs , is like the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}
Bro019.A.dialogueact1522	3324.65	3326.08	A	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	Is that the aligned s
Bro019.C.dialogueact1523	3325.76	3328.14	C	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's a r root LPC , uh , of some sort .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1524	3328.48	3329.12	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , no .
Bro019.D.dialogueact1525	3328.56	3328.88	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1526	3329.24	3329.77	A	PhD	s^bu.%--	-1	0	So you just {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact1527	3329.5	3329.7	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1528	3330.36	3334.04	A	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	instead of the log you took the root square , I mean cubic root or something .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1529	3334.04	3335.04	A	PhD	s	-1	0	What di w I didn't get that .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1530	3334.78	3335.03	C	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	No , no .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1531	3335.03	3337.9	C	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's taking the {disfmarker} finding the roots of the LPC polynomial .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1532	3338.11	3338.57	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Polynomial .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1533	3338.57	3338.69	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1534	3338.69	3339.84	A	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	Is that the line spectral {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact1535	3340.18	3341.3	C	Professor	s^na	-1	0	So it 's like line spectral pairs .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1536	3341.08	3341.95	A	PhD	s^bk.%-	-1	0	Oh , it 's like line sp
Bro019.C.dialogueact1537	3341.3	3344.53	C	Professor	s^bu^df	-1	0	Except I think what they call line spectral pairs they push it towards the unit circle ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1538	3344.53	3344.91	C	Professor	qy^g	-1	0	don't they ,
Bro019.A.dialogueact1540	3345.36	3346.39	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1539	3344.91	3345.49	C	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	to sort of ?
Bro019.C.dialogueact1541	3346.28	3346.54	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	But it {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact1542	3346.74	3347.3	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	But uh , you know .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1543	3347.3	3358.85	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But what we 'd used to do w when I did synthesis at National Semiconductor twenty years ago , the technique we were playing with initially was {disfmarker} was taking the LPC polynomial and {disfmarker} and uh , finding the roots .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1544	3358.85	3361.07	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	It wasn't PLP cuz Hynek hadn't invented it yet ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1545	3361.07	3362.22	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but it was just LPC ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1546	3362.22	3364.61	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and uh , we found the roots of the polynomial ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1547	3364.61	3368.84	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And th When you do that , sometimes they 're f they 're what most people call formants ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1548	3368.84	3369.65	C	Professor	s	-1	0	sometimes they 're not .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1549	3371.17	3371.62	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1550	3371.32	3372.72	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's a little ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact1551	3371.73	3373.24	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1552	3373.21	3375.56	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh {disfmarker} Formant tracking with it can be a little tricky
Bro019.C.dialogueact1553	3375.56	3378.92	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	cuz you get these funny {vocalsound} values in {disfmarker} in real speech ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact1554	3378.02	3380.56	F	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	So you just {disfmarker} You typically just get a few roots ?
Bro019.C.dialogueact1555	3378.92	3379.41	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	but .
Bro019.F.dialogueact1556	3380.68	3380.89	F	PhD	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	You know ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact1557	3381.04	3381.66	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	two or three ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1559	3382.01	3383.25	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Well you get these complex pairs .
Bro019.F.dialogueact1558	3381.66	3382.23	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	something like that ?
Bro019.C.dialogueact1560	3383.76	3385.68	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	And it depends on the order that you 're doing ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1563	3386.01	3386.2	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	but .
Bro019.D.dialogueact1561	3385.87	3386.26	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1562	3385.99	3386.35	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1564	3387.21	3388.37	E	Grad	fg	-1	0	So , um ,
Bro019.E.dialogueact1565	3389.55	3391.94	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	if {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} Every root that 's {disfmarker}
Bro019.E.dialogueact1566	3392.06	3396.47	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Since it 's a real signal , the LPC polynomial 's gonna have real coefficients .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1567	3396.47	3403.69	E	Grad	s	-1	0	So I think that means that every root that is not a real root {comment} is gonna be a c complex pair ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact1568	3401.06	3401.35	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1569	3404.8	3407.26	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	um , of a complex value and its conjugate .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1570	3408.08	3408.53	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1571	3409.0	3409.59	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So for each {disfmarker}
Bro019.E.dialogueact1572	3410.04	3417.65	E	Grad	s	-1	0	And if you look at that on the unit circle , um , one of these {disfmarker} one of the members of the pair will be a positive frequency , one will be a negative frequency , I think .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1573	3417.65	3418.17	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So I just {disfmarker}
Bro019.E.dialogueact1574	3418.87	3419.93	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	So , um ,
Bro019.E.dialogueact1575	3420.66	3423.02	E	Grad	s	-1	0	f for the {disfmarker} I 'm using an eighth - order polynomial
Bro019.E.dialogueact1576	3423.57	3425.26	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and I 'll get three or four of these pairs
Bro019.C.dialogueact1577	3427.45	3427.62	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.A.dialogueact1579	3428.05	3428.42	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1578	3427.7	3430.38	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	which give me s which gives me three or four peak positions .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1580	3430.4	3431.61	C	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	This is from synthetic speech ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1581	3431.61	3431.76	C	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bro019.E.dialogueact1582	3432.28	3432.81	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} Right .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1583	3432.92	3433.12	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1584	3433.45	3433.55	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1585	3433.55	3435.86	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So if it 's from synthetic speech then maybe it 'll be cleaner .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1586	3435.86	3443.95	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean for real speech in real {disfmarker} then what you end up having is , like I say , funny little things that are {disfmarker} don't exactly fit your notion of formants all that well .
Bro019.F.dialogueact1587	3440.7	3441.01	F	PhD	qw.%-	-1	0	How did {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact1589	3443.95	3445.13	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but mostly they are .
Bro019.D.dialogueact1588	3443.8	3443.95	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	But
Bro019.C.dialogueact1591	3445.25	3446.05	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Mostly they do .

Bro019.E.dialogueact1592	3445.33	3445.53	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1593	3446.05	3452.13	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and what {disfmarker} I mean in {disfmarker} in what we were doing , which was not so much looking at things , it was OK
Bro019.D.dialogueact1594	3446.93	3447.08	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	I {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact1595	3452.13	3453.91	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because it was just a question of quantization .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1596	3454.71	3456.24	C	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Uh , we were just you know , storing {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact1597	3456.24	3459.74	C	Professor	s	-1	0	It was {disfmarker} We were doing , uh , stored speech , uh , quantization .

Bro019.C.dialogueact1599	3459.74	3461.59	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but uh , in your case
Bro019.C.dialogueact1600	3462.57	3463.77	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um , you know {disfmarker}
Bro019.D.dialogueact1601	3463.71	3466.85	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Actually you have peaks that are not at the formant 's positions ,
Bro019.D.dialogueact1602	3466.85	3470.05	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but they are lower in energy

Bro019.C.dialogueact1611	3483.5	3484.58	C	Professor	s^am	-1	0	I bet it {disfmarker} it might have {disfmarker} may have been
Bro019.E.dialogueact1612	3483.62	3484.55	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	I {disfmarker} d d this {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact1613	3484.58	3486.36	C	Professor	qy^bu^df	-1	0	but maybe he didn't have control over it or something ?
Bro019.E.dialogueact1614	3486.29	3491.92	E	Grad	s	-1	0	In {disfmarker} in fact w we {disfmarker} we could get , um , formant frequencies out of the synthesizer , as well .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1615	3492.27	3493.17	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	And , um ,
Bro019.E.dialogueact1616	3493.75	3505.27	E	Grad	s	-1	0	w one thing that the , um , LPC approach will hopefully give me in addition , um , is that I {disfmarker} I might be able to find the b the bandwidths of these humps as well .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1617	3505.59	3510.19	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Um , Stephane suggested looking at each complex pair as a {disfmarker} like a se second - order IIR filter .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1618	3509.38	3509.59	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1619	3510.74	3511.13	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bro019.E.dialogueact1620	3511.56	3517.67	E	Grad	s	-1	0	but I don't think there 's a g a really good reason not to um , get the formant frequencies from the synthesizer instead .
Bro019.E.dialogueact1621	3517.67	3521.38	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	Except that you don't have the psycho - acoustic modeling in that .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1622	3522.26	3522.33	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1623	3522.33	3523.09	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so the actual {disfmarker}
Bro019.C.dialogueact1624	3523.09	3526.2	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So you 're not getting the actual formants per se .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1625	3526.2	3528.53	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	You 're getting the {disfmarker} Again , you 're getting sort of the ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1626	3529.32	3529.78	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bro019.D.dialogueact1627	3530.38	3530.67	D	PhD	b.x	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1628	3531.02	3535.19	C	Professor	s	-1	0	You 're getting something that is {disfmarker} is uh , af strongly affected by the PLP model .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1629	3535.19	3536.56	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And so it 's more psycho - acoustic .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1630	3536.56	3538.88	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So it 's a little {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker} It 's sort of {disfmarker} sort of a different thing .
Bro019.F.dialogueact1631	3536.81	3537.11	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh ,
Bro019.F.dialogueact1632	3537.11	3537.55	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bro019.F.dialogueact1633	3538.73	3539.71	F	PhD	s	-1	0	That 's sort of the point .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1634	3539.68	3540.22	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	But {disfmarker} Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1635	3540.22	3545.88	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i Ordinarily , in a formant synthesizer , the bandwidths as well as the ban uh , formant centers are {disfmarker}
Bro019.F.dialogueact1636	3543.21	3543.5	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1637	3546.19	3548.88	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , that 's {disfmarker} Somewhere in the synthesizer that was put in ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1638	3549.13	3550.53	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	as {disfmarker} as what you {disfmarker}
Bro019.E.dialogueact1639	3549.2	3549.48	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro019.C.dialogueact1640	3550.53	3551.21	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but yeah ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1641	3551.21	3554.26	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you view each complex pair as essentially a second - order section ,
Bro019.C.dialogueact1642	3554.67	3556.52	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	which has , uh , band center and band width ,
