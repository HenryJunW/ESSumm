Bmr005.E.dialogueact1	3.006	4.506	E	Professor	z	-1	0	it doesn't look like a crash that's great 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact2	4.506	4.966	E	Professor	z	-1	0	a crash that's great 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact3	7.741	12.191	G	Grad	z	-1	0	so i think maybe what's causing it crashes i keep starting and then stopping it to see if it's working and so i think starting 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact4	12.451	15.741	G	Grad	z	-1	0	and so i think starting and then stopping and starting it again causes it to crash 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact5	16.497	17.867	G	Grad	z	-1	0	so i won't do that anymore 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact6	18.393	24.713	B	Postdoc	z	-1	0	and it looks like you've found a way of um nothing the location to the without having people have to give their names each time it's 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact7	22.454	23.944	A	PhD	z	-1	0	people have to give their names 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact8	24.713	25.823	B	Postdoc	z	-1	0	each time it's like you have to be so no 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact10	26.053	26.883	B	Postdoc	z	-1	0	you know that 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact9	25.992	26.712	G	Grad	z	-1	0	like you have to be so you know that no 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact11	27.203	29.503	B	Postdoc	z	-1	0	i mean are you going to write down that i said here i'm going to collect the digit forms 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact12	28.576	30.936	G	Grad	z	-1	0	that i said here i'm going to collect the digit forms and write it down 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact13	31.381	31.581	B	Postdoc	z	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact14	31.875	32.355	C	PhD	z	-1	0	so 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact15	32.513	32.763	G	Grad	z	-1	0	so 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact16	33.433	34.683	G	Grad	z	-1	0	so they should be right 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact17	36.666	37.846	G	Grad	z	-1	0	with what's on the digits forms 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact18	38.106	39.736	G	Grad	z	-1	0	i guess i'll go ahead and start with the digits 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact19	44.643	44.703	G	Grad	z	-1	0	seven 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact20	72.405	76.415	G	Grad	z	-1	0	i should say that uh you just to read each line and then pause briefly 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact21	77.85	79.42	E	Professor	z	-1	0	start by giving the transcripts or 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact23	205.622	206.022	A	PhD	z	-1	0	oh frustrated oh okay 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact22	205.56	207.25	D	PhD	z	-1	0	oh frustrated oh okay 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact24	206.532	207.662	A	PhD	z	-1	0	oh oh okay 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact25	356.469	360.889	E	Professor	s^j	-1	0	so uh you done beyond bridal the excitement of the work that we have in this project is okay 
Bmr005.H.dialogueact26	360.228	360.568	H	Grad	b	-1	0	in this project is okay 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact27	360.949	362.299	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	in this project is just uh okay 
Bmr005.H.dialogueact28	363.429	363.509	H	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact29	368.09	373.54	E	Professor	h|s^na	-1	0	uh you know it doesn't seem like a bad idea to have information i'm surprised i sir i'm surprised i forgot that but 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact30	371.619	373.919	G	Grad	s	-1	0	idea to have information i'm surprised i sir i'm surprised i forgot that but 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact32	374.44	377.22	E	Professor	s^bk|s.%-	-1	0	yeah i i i think it's uh i think that would be a good thing to add after i just printed out a zillion 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact31	374.009	376.229	G	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	yeah i i i think it's uh i think that would be a good thing to add after i 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact33	376.739	378.569	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	after i just printed out a zillion of them 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact34	379.457	380.387	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah well that's um 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact35	381.027	383.727	E	Professor	s^t	-1	0	so i i do have a an agenda suggestions um 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact36	383.937	393.537	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	suggestions um we i think the things that we talk about this being um tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh monday and things and uh research points 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact37	394.147	401.887	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and um i think and he was i mean couple weeks ago that we we spent much of the time talking about the mundane some because it's easier to get out away and then 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact38	401.887	405.657	E	Professor	s	-1	0	to get out away and then we sort of drifted into research and maybe five minutes into that and dress had to leave 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact39	406.197	408.647	E	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	so uh i guess we turn around and 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact40	408.647	418.077	E	Professor	s^co	-1	0	around and uh and uh sort of we have a has some minding points that we could send an e. mail later uh oh hold on purpose and talk about uh the research kind of things 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact41	419.187	438.83	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	2	so um the one the one thing i know that we have on that is uh we had talked to a couple weeks before um uh about the uh the stuff you were doing with with uh uh tempting to locate events we have 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact42	438.83	441.43	E	Professor	s:s	-1	0	events we have to go go around trying to figure out what you meant by events but 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact43	441.43	447.5	E	Professor	s:s	+1	0	but i think you know what we had met by events i guess it was uh points of overlap between speakers but 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact44	447.87	455.27	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but i i gather from our discussion go earlier today that you also i mean uh interruptions with something else like some other noise 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact46	455.295	455.465	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	like some other noise 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact45	455.27	456.42	E	Professor	s^e	-1	0	like some other noise yes 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact48	456.81	457.54	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yes you mean that 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact47	456.76	457.22	E	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	yes you mean that 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact49	457.51	458.81	E	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	you mean that just that also 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact51	459.29	459.53	D	PhD	%--	-1	0	center you were 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact50	458.81	461.89	E	Professor	s	-1	0	just that also center you were you use done some work on that 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact52	459.53	459.86	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	center you were 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact53	462.19	473.546	E	Professor	fh|s^cs^t	+1	0	and um than the other thing would be it might be nice if we were married discussion of some of the other uh research areas that uh we're thinking about doing 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact54	473.736	480.157	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	doing especially since you haven't been and things are a little bit in some discussion discussions 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact55	480.157	484.237	E	Professor	s^t	-1	0	in some discussion discussions some of the possible things to look at how we're starting to get they 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact56	484.837	492.737	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	and one of the things i know that also came up uh is some discussions that that that uh jane what kendra 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact57	493.277	497.537	E	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	uh about some some some um uh work about 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact58	499.02	501.79	E	Professor	s	-1	0	i i i don't try to six i i'll say wrong but 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact59	501.93	506.56	E	Professor	s	+1	2	i'll say wrong but anyway some subjective cooperation there about about uh about the working at the state so 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact60	506.776	507.016	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	at the state so 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact62	507.116	507.356	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact61	506.8	507.04	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	at the state so 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact63	508.11	509.08	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	know just go around 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact64	509.128	510.108	G	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	know just go around 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact65	511.125	516.265	E	Professor	h|s^nd	-1	0	uh i don't know if this is sort of like everybody has something contribute of thing i think it's just 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact66	516.265	520.015	E	Professor	s^df^e	-1	0	thing i think it's just a couple couple merely um but 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact67	520.275	521.895	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	um but um 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact68	523.558	525.168	E	Professor	fh|qh^cs.%--	-1	0	uh went well this actually 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact69	525.788	528.358	E	Professor	s	-1	0	this actually i think that that last i just we could do for the quickly so it 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact70	528.358	530.308	E	Professor	qh^cs	-1	0	okay so it 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact71	530.35	530.64	B	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact72	531.35	532.28	B	Postdoc	qy^rt^t	-1	0	judge joseph k. um yeah just 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact74	532.28	532.49	B	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	k. um just 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact73	531.86	532.99	E	Professor	s^aa|s^co	-1	0	judge joseph k. um yeah just 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact75	532.98	542.069	B	Postdoc	fh|s	+1	2	k. um so uh he was interested in the question relating to is do the research percent recently um of infrastructure's and um just 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact76	542.069	552.751	B	Postdoc	fh|s^e	+1	0	and um the need to build and this this sort of uh mechanism for understanding uh language and he gave 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact77	552.751	555.531	B	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	language and he gave the example in his talk about how um and i'm remembering 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact78	555.531	558.311	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	um and i'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now but there's something 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact79	558.371	565.381	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	right now but there's something about how um joe slip you know john had wash the floor or something like that and i don't have a quite 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact80	565.381	566.311	B	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	that and i don't have a quite right that kind of 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact81	566.311	567.181	B	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	right that kind of thing where you have to draw 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact82	567.181	570.561	B	Postdoc	s^rt:s	-1	0	thing where you have to draw the inference that okay this this time sequence but also 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact83	570.907	578.437	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	sequence but also to the the causal aspects of the uh for and and how might have been the cause of the fall on that 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact84	578.437	582.435	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	fall on that um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact85	582.435	583.605	B	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	it and beast or things so 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact86	583.665	590.225	B	Postdoc	fh|s	+1	1	beast or things so i look to the transcript that we have so far and um so and then if i'd a couple different types of things of that type and 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact87	590.425	603.915	B	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	and um one of them was it something like uh during the course the transcript um um we we had gone to the part where everyone said which channel they were on which device iran 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact88	604.523	610.358	B	Postdoc	fh|s:qy	-1	0	and um the question was raised well should we restart the recording at this point 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact89	611.038	618.068	B	Postdoc	fh|s:s	-1	0	and and i know i said well we're just so far ahead of the game right now we really don't need to know how would you interpret 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact90	618.068	620.808	B	Postdoc	qh	-1	0	know how would you interpret that without a lot of been friends so 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact91	620.808	624.828	B	Postdoc	fh|s:s	-1	0	a lot of been friends so inferences that are involved or things like so how you interpret ahead of the game 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact92	625.218	634.578	B	Postdoc	fh|s^co^rt	-1	0	you know so it's it's what you what you where you draw you know the conclusions that you need to draw our that space is involved in recording uhhuh metaphor klee 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact93	626.266	627.176	G	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	it's what you what uhhuh metaphor klee 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact94	635.245	639.835	B	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	that um that we have enough space and 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact95	640.005	643.875	B	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	he continues like we are sort of the game because now we have built in down sampling 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact96	644.595	650.685	B	Postdoc	s^co:s	-1	0	so you have to sort of get the idea that um had a game is speaking with respect to space limitations that 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact97	650.685	655.885	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that um that in fact down sampling is gaining is enough space 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact98	656.225	659.095	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and that therefore we can keep the recording we've done so far 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact99	660.539	661.989	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but there a lot of different things like that 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact100	662.285	666.985	G	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	so do you think his interest is in using this as data source or 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact101	666.985	670.745	G	Grad	qrr^rt	-1	0	source or training material or what 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact102	670.745	671.265	G	Grad	qrr	-1	0	well i i or what 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact103	671.368	675.328	E	Professor	fg|s^df	-1	0	well i i should interject is at this started off of discussions i have him so 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact104	675.578	680.188	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	2	him so um we were trying to think of ways that isn't as good interactive hours and and um 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact105	679.523	679.943	G	Grad	b	-1	0	good interactive hours 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact106	680.388	700.788	E	Professor	fh|s^cs.x	+1	1	and and um uh i thought that if we were going to protect into the future and we had a lot of page uh uh and um such things might be useful for that that in or before we invested too much uh effort into that teach it uh with chains help look into some of the data they were already have uhhuh 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact108	701.388	703.218	E	Professor	s^e:qy	-1	0	and see is there anything to this at all is there any 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact107	700.957	701.327	G	Grad	b	-1	0	already have and see is uhhuh 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact109	703.718	708.058	E	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	is there any point which you think that you know you could gain some advantage in some potential use for it because it could be looking 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact110	708.058	713.858	E	Professor	s^df.%--:s	-1	0	because it could be looking through it and say well this is just the wrong task for for him to pursue his right yeah 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact111	711.618	711.888	G	Grad	s^2	-1	0	task right 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact112	712.288	712.518	G	Grad	b	-1	0	for for him to yeah 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact113	714.104	724.194	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	it's possible i he and and uh i got the impression from your mail but in fact there was enough things like this just in a little sample that that you looked at that that it's plausible at least 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact114	723.885	724.555	B	Postdoc	s^am	-1	0	it's possible i he plausible at least 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact115	724.805	729.345	B	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	possible i he to you've been we met he was going to go and uh you know you look through the morse medically and then 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact116	724.824	725.024	E	Professor	b.%	-1	0	possible i he to you've been we met 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact117	729.615	731.155	B	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	and then uh meet again so it's you know not 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact118	729.889	730.109	E	Professor	b	-1	0	and then uh meet again 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact119	731.155	732.875	B	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	so it's you know not a matter of uh 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact120	732.711	732.901	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	a matter of uh 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact121	733.578	736.432	B	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	but yeah i think think it was i mean that's that's a quite different 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact122	735.493	740.463	E	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	think it was i mean that's that's a quite different things anything to talk about that you know might might might not us 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact123	741.327	742.867	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	but he can use tax 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact124	744.294	746.724	C	PhD	s	-1	0	this is a major he's talking about just using text 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact125	744.888	745.568	B	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	this is a major he's talking about just using 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact126	747.491	752.001	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i mentioned several that we had to do with implications drawn from international controversy and that was has struck abstract 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact127	747.554	748.024	C	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	i mentioned several that we had to

Bmr005.B.dialogueact133	756.921	759.161	B	Postdoc	s^e	+1	2	knowledge structures inferences that you draw i mean he certainly 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact134	759.585	760.735	E	Professor	fg|s^cs.x	-1	0	i mean he certainly could use tax there were 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact135	760.735	767.295	E	Professor	s^df	+1	0	could use tax there were in fact looking to see if there is there is there's something in common in our interest and meeting interesting and stuff so 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact136	767.765	767.965	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	stuff so 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact137	770.062	778.352	G	Grad	s	-1	0	and i imagine that transcripts of speech you mean tax that is beach probably has more of those then sort of prepared writing i 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact138	778.922	781.292	G	Grad	s^no.x	-1	0	i don't know probably depends i i don't know whether it would or not but it seems like it would 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact139	779.635	780.075	E	Professor	s^no	-1	0	i don't know i don't know whether it would or not but it seems like it would 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact140	780.265	783.605	E	Professor	s	-1	0	probably depends on what the word writing but it seems like it would 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact141	784.215	784.365	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr005.B.dialogueact142	785.291	786.741	B	Postdoc	s^bk|s^nd	-1	0	yeah i don't think i would make that leap because 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact143	786.741	791.511	B	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	would make that leap because in narratives you know i mean if you spell out everything in they're ticket can be really tedious so yeah 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact144	786.965	787.305	G	Grad	b	-1	0	would make that leap because in narratives 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact145	791.641	791.911	B	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	so yeah 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact146	791.925	795.245	G	Grad	s	-1	0	so yeah i'm just thinking you know when you're when you're face to face you know a lot of back channel one 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact147	795.245	797.043	G	Grad	%-	-1	0	oh that aspect one and yeah and 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact148	796.36	796.64	B	Postdoc	s^fe	-1	0	oh that and 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact149	796.93	797.7	B	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	oh that aspect and yeah and 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact150	797.503	797.913	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	aspect yeah and 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact151	797.913	803.353	G	Grad	s	-1	0	aspect yeah and so i think it's just easier to do that sort of brought inference tromping it's face to face 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact152	803.353	808.383	G	Grad	s^rt:s	-1	0	me so if i just read that dan was saying we're headed the game in that in that context i 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact153	804.051	804.241	B	Postdoc	%	-1	0	me so if i just read 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact154	808.454	808.684	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	i 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact155	808.933	812.993	G	Grad	s.x	-1	0	i might not realize he was talking about disk space as opposed to anything else 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact156	813.38	817.1	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i you know i i had several that had to do with back channels and this wasn't one of them this this one really does uhhuh 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact157	816.146	816.446	G	Grad	b	-1	0	and this wasn't one of them uhhuh 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact158	817.1	820.33	B	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	this this one really does um make make you leap from so he said 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact159	820.51	823.82	B	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	so he said you know where the game we we have built in downtown like 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact160	823.734	824.044	G	Grad	b	-1	0	in downtown like and 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact161	824.861	828.271	B	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	and be in see if if you had a written down would be uhhuh but i guess it would be the same 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact162	827.576	828.536	G	Grad	s^2	-1	0	down would be uhhuh but i guess it would be the same 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact163	828.627	828.867	B	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	uhhuh but the same 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact164	828.987	830.357	B	Postdoc	s^arp	-1	0	uhhuh but there are others that have actually is just he was less the same 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact165	830.357	832.037	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	is just he was less interested in us sorry to interrupt 
Bmr005.F.dialogueact166	830.699	830.959	F	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	is just he was less

Bmr005.B.dialogueact246	954.378	958.508	B	Postdoc	s^t	+1	0	i i came up with something from the human subject of people that i wanted to mention i mean it's it's in 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact247	958.508	960.208	B	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	mention i mean it's it's in the area monday in but they did say 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact248	960.208	960.998	B	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	in but they did say 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact249	961.218	968.358	B	Postdoc	s:s	+1	1	you know last very specifically about this closet how um you know it says no individuals will be identified 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact250	969.778	971.408	B	Postdoc	fh|s^e:s	-1	0	yeah in any publication using the data okay well individual's 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact251	971.408	973.408	B	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	the data okay well individual's being identified and say you have 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact252	973.408	980.728	B	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	and say you have a snippet that says joe's uh think such and such about about this field but i think he's wrong headed now i mean 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact253	980.828	983.588	B	Postdoc	s^cc:s	-1	0	he's wrong headed now i mean we're we're going to be careful not to have the wrong headed part in there but but 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact254	983.588	990.988	B	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	part in there but but you know let's say we say you know joe used to think so and so about this area and in this publication he says that but i think he's changed his mind or whatever 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact256	991.438	1001.36	B	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	then the issue of of being able to trace joe because we know he's well known in this field all this and and tied to the speaker whose name was just mention a moment ago can be sensitive so i think it's but i 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact255	991.048	991.548	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	then the issue but i 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact257	1001.36	1006.25	B	Postdoc	s^bs^cs	-1	0	so i think it's really really kind of adaptive unwise to not mention names anymore been we have to because if there's a flanders 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact258	1006.25	1011.11	B	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	have to because if there's a flanders aspect to it then how much do we want to be able to to have to remove yeah 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact259	1011.74	1012.78	E	Professor	s^na	-1	0	yeah well there's that but 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact260	1012.97	1017.55	E	Professor	s^arp	-1	0	well there's that but i i mean i think also sound extend is just educating the same subject people away because

Bmr005.G.dialogueact506	1652.98	1658.84	G	Grad	s	+1	1	the mixed signals here i mean if i'm tapping on the table you it's not going to show up on any of the mics it's going to show up rather loudly in the pgm 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact507	1656.84	1657.08	D	PhD	b	-1	0	it's going to show up rather loudly

Bmr005.D.dialogueact510	1659.71	1676.69	D	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	so i i i i say is dot said they will do you say on t. v. cause i i i i eat mean my opinion he necessary to a to live the books that that patient on the speech five court to buy date it what you t. face i not i so 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact511	1659.9	1660.26	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	so i i i so 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact512	1676.98	1692.56	D	PhD	s	-1	0	i not i mean they they they say not to played it it until we got to my team to future in the public type to too good corporate date each other hey segment they shouldn't we've it if we have a speech and you hostile that's a far too yeah 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact513	1677.02	1677.45	E	Professor	b	-1	0	mean they they 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact514	1682.38	1683.9	E	Professor	s^2	+1	1	in the public type to that's a far too yeah 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact515	1684.03	1684.25	E	Professor	b	-1	0	too good 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact516	1692.56	1693.8	D	PhD	s^co	-1	0	speech and you hostile applies to 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact517	1693.93	1695.32	D	PhD	s^co	-1	0	applies to hostile purses 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact518	1697.23	1699.27	D	PhD	s^df	+1	1	because i i found it to be friends yeah well 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact519	1699.73	1709.4	E	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah well just i mean just in that that one it's ten second or whatever was example that adam had that that we we passed on to others two months ago there was 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact520	1709.82	1714.1	E	Professor	s	-1	0	ago there was that business were i guess was adamant jane were talking at the same time and and 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact521	1714.1	1721.25	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and and uh and the close talking because you couldn't hear the overlap and then the distant like a good so yeah 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact522	1721.25	1728.74	E	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	so yeah it's clear that if you want to study you want to find all the places rather overlap it's probably better to use distant mike on the other 
Bmr005.F.dialogueact523	1722.69	1723.12	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	it's clear that if you want to study 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact524	1728.74	1734.97	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	mike on the other hand there's other phenomena other going at the same time which might be useful to look at the close talking mike so

Bmr005.C.dialogueact663	2072.35	2072.7	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	then point and 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact662	2071.93	2072.23	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	then beginning and then point and 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact665	2072.98	2077.5	B	Postdoc	s	+1	0	then point and and sometimes you know it's like you could have in our lab where someone says something in the middle but 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact664	2072.88	2073.17	D	PhD	b	-1	0	then point and and sometimes 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact666	2077.5	2085.29	B	Postdoc	s	+1	0	the middle but it was just was an important for a purpose is to have it that it disrupt that you in in order to have uh you know the words in the order in which they were spoken it would've it would have 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact668	2085.29	2087.47	B	Postdoc	s	+1	0	it would've it would have been hard with the interface that we have now my adam's 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact667	2085.12	2085.38	D	PhD	b	-1	0	it would've it would have 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact670	2087.67	2090.84	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that we have now my adam's working of course in the revised overlapping interface but i i seem he's 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact671	2087.75	2088.0	D	PhD	b	-1	0	that we have now my adam's working of course i 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact669	2087.58	2087.86	G	Grad	b	-1	0	that we have now my adam's 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact672	2089.0	2092.56	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	in the revised overlapping interface but i seem he's he said with to walk but 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact673	2090.84	2091.01	B	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	interface but he's he said with to 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact674	2092.83	2096.07	D	PhD	s	-1	0	walk but today i think we need today and more from him no of course i i expected always 
Bmr005.F.dialogueact675	2095.55	2096.48	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	more from him no of course i i expected always 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact677	2096.81	2097.04	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	course i i expected to find more overlap always need more 
Bmr005.F.dialogueact676	2096.48	2099.62	F	PhD	s.x	-1	0	so i course i i expected to find more overlap than than saying because you're always need more 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact678	2097.01	2097.78	G	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	to find more overlap need more 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact680	2099.38	2099.66	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	so i than saying because you're 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact679	2099.2	2101.09	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	so i i take off to go to if they want to than saying because you're looking at it that much more detail level 
Bmr005.F.dialogueact681	2099.62	2101.87	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	so i i take off to go to if they want to than saying because you're looking at it that much more detail level 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact682	2101.09	2105.36	D	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	if they want to they want to come in the computer well more detail level but if it takes sixty one

Bmr005.G.dialogueact683	2104.53	2105.93	G	Grad	s^nd.%--	-1	0	well but if it takes sixty one 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact685	2106.02	2107.88	E	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	i put i have a suggestion about that um 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact686	2107.97	2111.49	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	about that um i was this is very very time consuming and you're finding lots of things i'm temperature 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact687	2111.49	2113.94	E	Professor	s^ba^df	-1	0	of things i'm temperature are going to be very interesting 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact688	2114.56	2118.87	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but in the interests of making progress uh my how 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact689	2118.87	2123.71	E	Professor	qw^cs	-1	0	my how how would it affect your time if you only marked speaker overlap 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact690	2124.23	2124.52	D	PhD	s^bu^r	-1	0	or yes 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact691	2124.86	2125.15	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	or yes did not mark any

Bmr005.E.dialogueact692	2125.32	2127.17	E	Professor	s^co	-1	0	did not mark any other events but on the market speaker 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact695	2127.37	2127.76	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	but on the market speaker 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact694	2127.17	2128.19	E	Professor	s^co^rt	-1	0	but on the market speaker do you think that would speed 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact696	2128.25	2130.02	E	Professor	qy	-1	0	do you think that would speed it up quite a bit do do 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact697	2129.76	2130.1	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	it up quite a bit do do 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact698	2130.61	2138.03	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i i i you i i wanted to a nice do do you think that would speed it up uh speed up your you're you're marking 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact699	2130.74	2132.19	E	Professor	qy^r^rt	-1	0	do do you think that would speed it up uh speed up 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact700	2132.33	2134.31	E	Professor	h|qy^d^rt	-1	0	i i uh speed up your you're you're marking

Bmr005.E.dialogueact702	2140.41	2143.56	E	Professor	s	+1	0	i just uh it took you a long time to mark twelve minutes now 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact703	2141.94	2142.13	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	time to mark twelve minutes 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact704	2143.3	2144.21	D	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	i just uh now my suggestion 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact705	2143.98	2146.81	E	Professor	s^cs.%-	+1	0	i just uh or forty two mark now my suggestion was but the other thirty three 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact706	2146.01	2148.34	D	PhD	s.%-	+1	2	forty two mark wanted to mother went up and so that's three yeah and my 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact707	2148.44	2155.51	E	Professor	fg|qy	+1	0	that's yeah and my question is if you did that if you follow my suggestion would you take much less time 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact708	2156.48	2156.67	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	uh yeah 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact709	2156.99	2157.29	D	PhD	s^aa	+1	0	uh yeah sure 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact711	2158.78	2159.02	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah okay that i think it's 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact710	2158.29	2158.88	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah okay 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact712	2159.02	2159.32	D	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	that i think it's 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact713	2159.53	2160.85	E	Professor	s^ba	+1	1	that i think it's a good 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact715	2162.38	2162.84	D	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	for that uh sure that i think it's a good idea 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact714	2162.13	2163.64	E	Professor	s^ba^r.%-	-1	0	for that uh sure because i i need that i think it's a good idea because it 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact716	2163.06	2163.15	D	PhD	s^r	-1	0	because i i need because it 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact717	2163.4	2167.31	D	PhD	s	-1	0	because i i need to do those things to to put it out and go through through that because it yeah i mean 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact718	2167.54	2167.68	D	PhD	b	-1	0	that yeah i mean 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact719	2167.58	2170.0	E	Professor	s	-1	0	that yeah i mean we we know that there's no ice there's 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact720	2167.89	2168.07	G	Grad	%-	-1	0	that yeah i mean we we know 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact721	2170.34	2170.7	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	there's 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact722	2170.73	2175.07	E	Professor	s	-1	0	there's there's a continual noise uh from fans and so forth and and there is uh 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact723	2175.07	2180.05	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and and there is uh more impulsive noise from uh taps and so forth and and something 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact724	2179.71	2179.89	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and so forth 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact725	2180.05	2182.64	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and and something between the paper rustling 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact726	2183.05	2184.27	E	Professor	s	-1	0	we know that all that there and it's a worthwhile 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact727	2184.27	2186.02	E	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	there and it's a worthwhile thing to study but obviously takes 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact728	2186.32	2189.63	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but obviously takes a lot of time to mark all of these things whereas 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact729	2188.05	2188.23	D	PhD	b	-1	0	to mark all of these 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact730	2190.06	2197.44	E	Professor	s	-1	0	well i would think that uh you weekend study more or less distinct phenomenon the overlapping of people talking 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact731	2197.56	2197.97	D	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr005.D.dialogueact732	2198.3	2198.65	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr005.D.dialogueact734	2199.02	2199.4	D	PhD	b	-1	0	then you can get 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact733	2198.92	2200.65	E	Professor	h|s.%-	-1	0	then you can get because you need 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact735	2201.12	2208.88	E	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	if it's three hundred uh it sounds like you probably only have fifty or sixty or seventy events right now that are really 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact736	2208.4	2208.71	D	PhD	b	-1	0	are really 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact737	2209.23	2217.26	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	no and and you need to have a lot more than that to have any kind of uh even visual sense of what's going on much less any kind of reasonable statistics 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact738	2216.29	2216.5	G	Grad	b.%	-1	0	of reasonable statistics 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact739	2217.85	2223.32	C	PhD	qw.%-	+1	0	no i do need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy and the i mean you shouldn't well that's that's what i was going to bring up 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact740	2221.91	2222.22	G	Grad	%-	-1	0	it from the relative energy and well that's that's 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact741	2222.95	2223.96	G	Grad	s	-1	0	energy and the i mean you shouldn't that's that's what i was going to bring up 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact742	2223.5	2226.15	C	PhD	s	-1	0	the i mean you shouldn't need to do this completely by hand um okay yes what i was going to bring up 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact743	2225.65	2229.61	E	Professor	h|s^co	-1	0	completely by hand um okay yes so let's back up because you were here for an earlier conversation so 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact744	2226.15	2226.35	C	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	okay yes 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact745	2229.08	2229.45	C	PhD	s^fa	-1	0	so 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact746	2230.03	2236.27	E	Professor	s^bs	+1	1	the idea was that what he's going to be doing was experiment with different measures such as 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact747	2236.62	2242.12	E	Professor	s^e.%--	+1	1	such as the increase in energy such as the energy in l. p. c. residuals such as i mean there's a bunch of things 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact748	2242.2	2246.8	E	Professor	s	-1	0	in the far field my as i mean there's a bunch of things mean increased energy is is sort of an obvious one 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact749	2243.3	2243.64	C	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact750	2245.36	2246.37	C	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	in the far field my is is sort of an obvious one 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact751	2247.08	2247.37	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah um 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact752	2247.58	2248.05	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah um and 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact753	2248.0	2252.08	E	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	and uh it's not obvious mean you could you could do 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact754	2252.08	2256.32	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	mean you could you could do the dumbest thing and get get it ninety percent of the time but when you 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact755	2256.32	2264.02	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but when you start going past and trying to do better it's not obvious what combination of teachers is going to give you the you know the right actors the idea is to have some 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact756	2264.02	2266.0	E	Professor	s	+1	0	the idea is to have some ground truth first and so 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact757	2266.56	2271.61	E	Professor	s	+1	1	but i think and so that the idea the manual marking was to say okay this it you know it's it's it's really here 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact758	2271.58	2274.24	A	PhD	s^bu:qw^cs	-1	0	but i think was the same why not get it out of the transcripts what i mean get it from the coast talking right really here 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact759	2272.45	2275.18	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	was the same why not get it out of the transcripts what i mean get it from the coast talking right 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact760	2276.16	2277.05	E	Professor	h|s^no^rt	-1	0	uh or get get a first uh yeah we we we 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact761	2276.77	2279.62	C	PhD	s^cs^rt	-1	0	uh or get get a first pass from those and uh yeah we we we we we talked about that 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact762	2277.05	2279.87	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	get get a first pass from those and we we we we we talked about that 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact763	2279.91	2281.26	C	PhD	s^e.%--	-1	0	those and then go through sort of it'd be a lot faster talked about that and 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact764	2281.26	2283.14	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	of it'd be a lot faster probably to we we we talked and you can if this is uh 
Bmr005.F.dialogueact765	2281.99	2282.68	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	of it'd be a lot faster probably to we and you can if this is uh 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact766	2282.43	2283.21	G	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	probably to we we we talked you can if this is uh 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact767	2282.93	2284.47	E	Professor	s^aa^r	-1	0	probably to we we we talked about that this is a boot you can if this is uh 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact768	2284.53	2286.55	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	about that this is a boot strapping thing and the thing is the 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact769	2286.43	2287.3	C	PhD	s^bk|%-	-1	0	is the idea was we 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact770	2286.93	2290.81	E	Professor	s^bs^rt	+1	0	is the idea was we we we to be useful for him to look at the data anyway 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact771	2291.65	2294.4	E	Professor	s	+1	0	and and then whatever he could mark would be helpful and we 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact772	2294.65	2294.95	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and we 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact773	2294.8	2295.65	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and we could uh it's question 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact774	2295.65	2297.28	E	Professor	s	-1	0	could uh it's question would you bootstrap from unity bootstrap 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact775	2297.28	2301.65	E	Professor	qy	-1	0	unity bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you get a better 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact776	2302.07	2308.69	E	Professor	qrr	-1	0	pretty bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then then do your simple measurements uh from the close talking mike i mean the 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact777	2308.69	2311.33	E	Professor	s	-1	0	well that's what i mike i mean the close talking like you're not going to get it right all the time 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact778	2311.56	2313.51	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	well that's what i wonder because um or how bad 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact779	2313.51	2314.5	C	PhD	s	-1	0	um or how bad it is i'm 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact780	2313.6	2313.85	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	um or how bad 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact782	2314.98	2318.0	C	PhD	fg|s^ba	-1	0	it is um because that would be interesting especially i'm working on a program to do that and 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact781	2314.87	2316.9	G	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	it is um because i'm working on a program to do that and 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact783	2318.17	2321.12	C	PhD	s	-1	0	especially because the bottle neck as the transcription right and we've got 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact784	2321.38	2321.71	C	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right and we've got 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact785	2321.71	2324.66	C	PhD	s	-1	0	right and we've got a lot more data than we have transcription for we have the 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact786	2324.66	2325.62	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	for we have the audit with the 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact788	2325.83	2327.03	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	audit with the close talking like so i mean it seems 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact787	2325.39	2325.58	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	audit with the 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact789	2327.4	2330.7	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so i mean it seems like one kind of project it's not 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact790	2330.7	2332.18	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	of project it's not perfect but 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact791	2333.24	2337.91	C	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	um that you can get the training data for pretty quickly is you know if

Bmr005.G.dialogueact802	2349.87	2352.52	G	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and so but it's it's usually very very simple it just takes 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact803	2352.53	2355.88	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	well you can set the special simple it just takes a threshold based on on the volume 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact804	2354.01	2354.36	C	PhD	b	-1	0	well you can on on 
Bmr005.F.dialogueact805	2354.67	2359.04	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	right by hand well you can set the special oh and then weed out the false alarms by hand yeah on on the volume um 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact806	2358.31	2358.63	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right by hand by hand

Bmr005.G.dialogueact809	2359.48	2363.12	G	Grad	fg|s^e	-1	0	yeah um and then it does a median filter in that looks for runs 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact810	2364.09	2365.38	G	Grad	s	-1	0	and it seems to work i've i'm sort 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact811	2365.38	2370.21	G	Grad	s	-1	0	work i've i'm sort of fiddling with the parameters to get it to actually generate something and i

Bmr005.G.dialogueact813	2371.6	2378.32	G	Grad	s	-1	0	haven't i don't what i'm working on what i was working on was getting it to a former we can import it into the user interface that we have and the transcriber and so 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact814	2378.7	2380.9	G	Grad	fh|s^cc	-1	0	and so i told i said it would take about a day i've 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact815	2380.9	2382.49	G	Grad	s	-1	0	it would take about a day i've worked on it for about half a day so

Bmr005.G.dialogueact817	2382.73	2385.78	G	Grad	fh|s^cc	-1	0	see a day so give me another half day and i will have something we can play with

Bmr005.E.dialogueact819	2385.97	2388.88	E	Professor	s^co	-1	0	see this is where we really need to meeting recorder gray stuff to be working because we can play with 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact820	2388.88	2393.66	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	right i'm sorry i just stuff to be working because they had these meetings we had this discussion about this disorder remembering a little bit about what we decided 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact821	2392.11	2392.35	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right i'm sorry i just a little bit about what we 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact822	2392.35	2392.84	C	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	right i'm sorry i just a little bit about what we

Bmr005.E.dialogueact824	2394.06	2395.3	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but i could brawl itself i think was but 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact825	2395.12	2395.44	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	itself i think was but 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact826	2395.36	2407.54	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	or itself i think was partly that you know give somebody a chance to actually look at today and see what these are like partly that we have eat some ground truth to compare against you know when when he he gets his thing going but 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact827	2395.78	2396.14	G	Grad	fg	-1	0	or itself i think was partly that but 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact828	2408.13	2409.06	E	Professor	fh|%-	-1	0	it's definitely good to have somebody uh and 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact829	2408.65	2410.5	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	it's definitely good to have somebody look at i was just thinking uh and 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact830	2410.5	2414.71	C	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	look at i was just thinking as a way to speed up now i'm going to that was that was exactly the notion

Bmr005.E.dialogueact831	2413.68	2416.66	E	Professor	s	-1	0	nothing we now i'm going to that was that was exactly the notion that that that we discuss

Bmr005.C.dialogueact837	2416.97	2417.44	C	PhD	s^ba^t3	-1	0	nothing we discussed was um it's good that we discuss 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact836	2416.92	2417.05	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	nothing we discussed was um it's good that we discuss 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact838	2418.69	2419.26	C	PhD	s^cc^t3	-1	0	but be mean 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact839	2419.26	2419.6	C	PhD	s^ft^t3	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact840	2419.3	2419.79	E	Professor	s^t3	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bmr005.B.dialogueact842	2424.36	2431.64	B	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	was that um there there was this already a script i believe uh that down in written that uh handles we threw me 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact843	2431.64	2437.08	B	Postdoc	fh|s^df	-1	0	we threw me because you have this this close you have contamination from other people who speak loudly 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact844	2438.27	2438.39	G	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah and i haven't tried 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact845	2438.39	2439.55	G	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah and i haven't tried using that it would probably 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact846	2439.55	2443.44	G	Grad	s	-1	0	using that it would probably help the program that i'm doing two first feed it through that that 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact847	2444.06	2445.41	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	cross correlation filter 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact848	2448.09	2452.64	G	Grad	s	-1	0	so this some thought maybe having having i haven't tried that but that if if it might be something it might be a good way of cleaning it up a little 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact849	2449.3	2450.78	B	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	so this some thought maybe having that if if it might be something it 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact850	2452.95	2455.42	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	having that b. p. processor and then run it through yores but but that's a it up a little exactly yep 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact851	2454.24	2455.48	G	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	and then run it through yores but but that's a exactly yep 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact852	2455.22	2456.7	E	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	discussing but but that's a refinement and i think yep 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact853	2456.26	2457.0	B	Postdoc	s^t	-1	0	discussing refinement and i think we want to see tried simple 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact854	2456.7	2458.73	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	discussing refinement and i think we want to see tried simple thing first because you got 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact855	2458.73	2464.61	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	thing first because you got this complex thing up uh afterwards that does something good you sort of want to see with the simple thing spurs yep 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact856	2461.67	2461.89	G	Grad	b	-1	0	that does something good yep 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact857	2465.37	2471.63	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but uh having having somebody has some experience again with with uh with our came from a human standpoint we're i 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact858	2471.63	2477.22	E	Professor	s	-1	0	we're i i don't expect jose to to do it for uh fifty hours a speech but i mean 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact859	2477.22	2486.23	E	Professor	s^cs	+1	2	sure but i mean if uh if you could speed up what he was doing by just getting the relapse of the we had to for forty five minutes then at least we have three hundred examples of it and when when 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact860	2483.42	2483.8	D	PhD	b	-1	0	sure five minutes 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact861	2484.19	2484.69	D	PhD	b	-1	0	then at least we have 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact862	2486.23	2490.84	E	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	you know i did oh yeah definitely it and when when uh adam was doing his automatic thing he could then compare that to what was 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact863	2489.55	2490.37	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	you know i did oh yeah definitely then compare that to what was 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact864	2490.66	2496.51	A	PhD	s	-1	0	you know i did i did uh something almost identical to this is one of my previous jobs and it works pretty well i mean to what was 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact865	2496.77	2501.94	A	PhD	s	-1	0	well i mean it almost exactly what you described in energy detector with a median filter you look for runs 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact866	2502.57	2503.19	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and uh you know you 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact867	2503.7	2504.43	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	you know you can yeah seemed like there 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact868	2504.02	2505.57	G	Grad	s	-1	0	can yeah i mean you you seemed like there 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact869	2505.1	2508.33	A	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	i mean you you can get you you mean you get them pretty close and that was with a zero literature search 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact870	2507.55	2509.18	G	Grad	s	-1	0	you mean you get them pretty close and so i think doing that was with a zero literature search 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact871	2509.04	2516.7	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	so i think doing that to generate possibilities and then going through and saying yes or no on that's good validation 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact872	2515.89	2516.82	G	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	that's good validation

Bmr005.G.dialogueact927	2627.5	2631.12	G	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	we're recording what we're saying who's talking on what microphone and things like that and that seems to be 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact928	2630.82	2631.15	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and things like that and that seems to be 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact929	2631.42	2633.05	G	Grad	s	-1	0	and that seems to be a lot of overlap 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact931	2634.3	2635.86	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i think it's an empirical question i think yep 
Bmr005.D.dialogueact930	2634.2	2634.61	D	PhD	b	-1	0	i think it's an empirical 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact932	2635.86	2636.74	B	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	question i think we could find that i'm not i'm yep

Bmr005.G.dialogueact934	2635.99	2636.28	G	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	question i think we could find that i'm not i'm yep 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact935	2636.74	2638.67	B	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	we could find that i'm not i'm not sure that the beginning had more 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact936	2640.7	2646.09	E	Professor	s^t	-1	0	so so if they ask i guess about any any other things that that that if you want to talk about especially since 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact937	2646.13	2648.9	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	especially since this in five minutes but 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact938	2648.9	2650.42	E	Professor	s	-1	0	can i just that's about the data five minutes but 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact939	2649.49	2651.02	C	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	can i just that's about the data like very straight 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact940	2651.02	2656.89	C	PhD	qw^rt	+1	1	like very straight for crushes where we are um the amount of data and the amount of transcribe did it just 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact941	2656.89	2657.49	C	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	transcribe did it just because i'm 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact942	2658.82	2660.19	C	PhD	s	-1	0	i wanted to get a feel for that 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact943	2660.91	2663.9	C	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	be able to know what what can be done person 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact944	2663.9	2667.26	C	PhD	qw	-1	0	be done person how many meetings are we recording and right so there's this this this is forty 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact945	2664.14	2670.03	E	Professor	fg|s	+1	1	how many meetings are we recording and right so there's this this this is forty five minute piece the chain transcribe that

Bmr005.E.dialogueact947	2670.99	2676.58	E	Professor	s	-1	0	that piece was then uh sent an i. b. m. so they could transcripts because comparison point 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact948	2677.14	2684.48	E	Professor	s.x	-1	0	then there's uh larger piece it's been recorded and uh put on c. d. rom and sent uh type

Bmr005.E.dialogueact981	2725.75	2727.92	E	Professor	s	-1	0	they do with and we talked about recording some more and 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact982	2727.92	2728.7	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	recording some more and we're going to 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact983	2729.43	2736.5	E	Professor	fh|s^rt	+1	2	uh we started having morning meeting today uh starting a week or two ago on the front and issues in recording 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact984	2736.85	2738.11	E	Professor	s	+1	2	in recording goes uh 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact985	2738.75	2744.29	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	2	uh there's uh network services in applications group here who's agreed to have their meetings recorded and we're going to 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact986	2743.94	2744.33	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	meetings recorded and we're going to 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact987	2744.68	2745.9	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and we're going to start recording them they're 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact988	2745.9	2748.75	E	Professor	s	-1	0	start recording them they're the i mean tuesdays we're going to start recording on next week so 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact989	2749.01	2752.01	E	Professor	s	-1	0	actually we're going to start having a a pretty significant chunk and so you 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact990	2752.01	2752.23	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	and so you 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact991	2752.75	2760.33	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and so you know i'm sort of struggling with trying to get things to be less buggy and come up recur when they do crash and stuff and things like that now that the 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact992	2760.44	2762.46	E	Professor	s	-1	0	now that the things are starting to happen so right 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact993	2762.74	2767.03	E	Professor	s	-1	0	to happen so right now i'd i'd say it the data is predominantly meeting meetings but there 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact994	2767.59	2771.32	E	Professor	s^e	-1	0	but there are scattered other meetings in it and that that amount is going to grow uh so 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact995	2771.59	2774.38	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh so that the meeting means pool probably healthily if 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact996	2774.95	2779.47	E	Professor	s	+1	0	if if we if a collective to sixty hours a meeting meetings will probably be you know twenty or thirty percent of it 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact997	2779.47	2781.22	E	Professor	s^e	-1	0	so of it 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact998	2781.43	2781.61	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact999	2782.07	2784.5	C	PhD	s^bs	+1	0	there's probably there's three to four a week 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1000	2785.39	2786.34	G	Grad	s^na	-1	0	that were even for that's what we're aiming for 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1001	2786.01	2786.98	C	PhD	s^bk^m	-1	0	were even for for 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1002	2786.96	2787.26	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	were even for and there for 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1003	2787.78	2789.8	C	PhD	s^bu	+1	0	and there each about an hour or something although 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1004	2789.36	2789.97	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	something although 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1005	2789.67	2790.02	G	Grad	%--	-1	0	something although yeah 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1006	2790.24	2790.47	G	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1007	2791.1	2793.3	G	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	yeah and at the at we'll find out tomorrow whether we can really do this or not 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1008	2792.84	2793.05	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	yeah and at the at we can really do this or not 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1010	2793.41	2793.94	C	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah and at the at not 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1009	2793.27	2795.3	E	Professor	s^no.%--	-1	0	yeah and at the at the other things i'm not pas i'm sort of thinking not 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1011	2795.3	2799.39	E	Professor	s^no.%--	-1	0	i'm sort of thinking is we've been through this a few times that i really don't know maybe want to 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1012	2799.5	2801.48	E	Professor	s^cs^rt	-1	0	maybe want to do it once for the novelty but i don't 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1013	2801.82	2807.5	E	Professor	s^no	-1	0	but i don't know if in general we want to have meetings every record from outside this group do the dishes right 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1014	2807.6	2807.9	G	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1015	2808.31	2810.74	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because it's just an added bunch of weird stuff and 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1016	2809.9	2810.15	C	PhD	b	-1	0	added bunch of weird stuff and 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1017	2811.02	2813.15	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	you know we we were highly motivated in fact 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1018	2813.78	2815.39	E	Professor	s	-1	0	in fact the morning group is really motivated because they're working 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1019	2815.39	2816.91	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because they're working unconnected is it's 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1020	2816.91	2817.61	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	unconnected is it's so it's actually that's 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1021	2817.77	2819.24	G	Grad	s	-1	0	so it's actually that's something i wanted to ask is i have a bunch of 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1022	2819.24	2822.61	G	Grad	s	-1	0	is i have a bunch of scripts to help with the transcription of the digits 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1023	2822.91	2823.41	E	Professor	b	-1	0	the digits we don't have to hand 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1024	2823.09	2826.77	G	Grad	s	-1	0	we don't have to hand transcribed digits because we're reading them and i have those 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1027	2827.32	2827.52	C	PhD	b	-1	0	i some scripts 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1025	2826.95	2827.19	E	Professor	b	-1	0	i have those i some scripts 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1026	2827.19	2832.16	G	Grad	s	+1	0	i some scripts that let you very quickly extract the sections of each other it's but i haven't 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1028	2832.6	2834.53	G	Grad	s	-1	0	but i haven't been rock i haven't been doing that 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1029	2835.34	2838.48	G	Grad	fh|qy^rt	+1	0	uh um if i did that if someone going to be working on it 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1030	2839.04	2840.11	E	Professor	h|s^aa	-1	0	yeah i i think they sell i mean is it something 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1032	2840.7	2842.48	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	they sell sell absolutely yeah whoever i mean is it something of interest okay 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1031	2840.52	2841.81	G	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	they sell sell absolutely i mean is it something of interest 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1033	2842.48	2848.38	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	yeah whoever we have working um you who sticks for the meeting recorder aren't going to start with that okay i mean i i'm i'm interested in it i just don't have time to do 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1034	2842.6	2842.81	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah whoever okay 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1035	2845.1	2848.02	G	Grad	s	-1	0	who sticks for the meeting recorder aren't going to start with that mean i i'm i'm interested in it i just don't have time to do 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1036	2848.02	2849.45	G	Grad	s	-1	0	has i just don't have time to do it now 
Bmr005.F.dialogueact1037	2850.03	2858.57	F	PhD	s	-1	0	the media i'm sure someone thought of this but these this uh reading up the numbers would be extremely helpful to do um adaptation so yep 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1038	2850.45	2850.71	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	the media so 
Bmr005.F.dialogueact1040	2859.36	2860.1	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	actually yep 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1039	2858.91	2860.2	G	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	actually yep yep 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1041	2860.91	2861.56	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	actually i i i would really 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1042	2861.23	2863.61	G	Grad	s	+1	0	i i i would really like someone to do adaptation so 
Bmr005.F.dialogueact1043	2862.77	2863.31	F	PhD	b	-1	0	like someone to do adaptation so 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1044	2863.91	2867.58	G	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	well i mean one so if we got someone interested in that i think it would be great for meeting recorder 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1045	2866.01	2866.19	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	it would be great for meeting 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1046	2867.74	2877.22	E	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	i mean one of the things i wanted to do uh that that i talked to two done is one of the possible things you could do or unless if someone else do it is to do block echo cancellation to try recorder the same people over and over 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1047	2868.92	2870.28	G	Grad	s^df	-1	0	of the things i wanted to do uh that that i talked to the same people over and over 
Bmr005.F.dialogueact1048	2871.99	2872.56	F	PhD	b	-1	0	two done is one of the possible things you could 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1049	2877.76	2881.78	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	to try to get rid of some of the effects of the the the far afield effects 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1051	2882.31	2889.12	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	the party line has been that echo cancellation is not the right way to handle the situation because people move around 
Bmr005.F.dialogueact1050	2881.95	2882.62	F	PhD	b	-1	0	effects 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1052	2889.12	2890.55	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because people move around 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1053	2891.37	2902.16	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh if if it's if it's uh not a simple that go like uh cross talk kind of echo but it's actually room acoustics it's it's it's you can't really do and version and even echo cancellation 
Bmr005.F.dialogueact1054	2897.41	2898.36	F	PhD	b	-1	0	but it's actually room acoustics it's it's 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1055	2902.16	2909.4	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and even echo cancellation is going into uh uh be something to eat someone may be moving enough that you are not able to adapt quickly and so 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1056	2909.39	2919.38	E	Professor	s	+1	0	and so the packet we've taken is more let's come up with feature approaches multi stream approaches and so forth that will be robust to it for the recognize or and not try to create a clean signal uh 
Bmr005.F.dialogueact1057	2909.71	2910.34	F	PhD	b	-1	0	and so the packet 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1058	2920.11	2921.18	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	that's a party line that it occurred to me 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1059	2921.37	2925.88	E	Professor	s	-1	0	that it occurred to me a few months ago that uh party lines are always you know sort of dangers is 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1060	2925.88	2928.42	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	you know sort of dangers is good it's good to sort of test them actually and so 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1061	2928.42	2934.88	E	Professor	s	-1	0	actually and so we haven't had anybody try to do a good serious job on echo cancellation and we should know how well that can do so 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1062	2934.95	2945.09	E	Professor	fh|s^cs	+1	1	well that can do so that's something i like somebody do some point just take these to just take that far field like signaled close um like signal and like really good echo cancellation um there 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1063	2945.18	2950.44	E	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	um there was uh it's nice talked recently my loose and 
Bmr005.F.dialogueact1064	2945.97	2946.82	F	PhD	b	-1	0	um there was uh it's 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1065	2951.1	2953.31	E	Professor	s	-1	0	the block i cook inflation sickly appeal to me uh you know trying 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1066	2953.42	2960.25	E	Professor	fh|s.%-	-1	0	what what is the um yeah me uh you know trying to change it sample by simple but have some reasonable size box 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1067	2959.58	2963.73	A	PhD	qw^rt.x	-1	0	what what is the um yeah artifact you try to trying to get rid of when you do that 
Bmr005.F.dialogueact1068	2962.66	2962.74	F	PhD	s.%	-1	0	to trying to get 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1069	2964.16	2967.38	E	Professor	h|s.%--	-1	0	um so it's it you have a a directs uh 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1070	2969.16	2974.01	E	Professor	qw.%--	-1	0	what's the difference in if you were trying to construct a linear filter that would um signing 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1071	2974.07	2974.54	E	Professor	fh.x	-1	0	um signing 
Bmr005.F.dialogueact1072	2974.88	2975.39	F	PhD	s	-1	0	um yeah signing 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1073	2975.71	2975.95	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1074	2976.73	2985.53	E	Professor	s^e	+1	0	that would subtract off uh parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close talking to distance 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1075	2986.25	2990.44	E	Professor	fh|s^e	-1	0	so so uh i guess most echo cancellation 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1076	2991.54	2994.53	E	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	yeah so you given 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1077	2999.3	3006.4	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	yeah so you're trying to to to be there's uh the distance between the close in the distant mikes so there's a time delay there and that's 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1078	3006.78	3009.57	E	Professor	s	-1	0	there and that's the time delay there's these various reflections and 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1079	3010.13	3011.57	E	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	if you figure out what's the there's 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1080	3011.9	3021.34	E	Professor	s	-1	0	the there's uh at least graze algorithm that adjusts itself adjust the weight so that you tried to distract essentially subtract off uh different uh different reflections 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1081	3022.22	3027.85	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so let's take the simple case where you just had you had some uh some delay the satellite connection or something and then 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1082	3027.85	3029.65	E	Professor	s	-1	0	or something and then there's uh there's an echo 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1083	3030.06	3035.99	E	Professor	s	-1	0	comes back and you want to it justice filters so that they will maxim only reduce the effect of the second 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1084	3036.13	3039.79	A	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	so that would mean like if you were listening to the day that it was court of them one of those 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1085	3040.88	3042.1	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	uh just the raw data you would you might hear kind 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1086	3042.1	3043.8	A	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	you would you might hear kind of an echo 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1087	3044.49	3047.28	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and and then this noise cancellation but well and and and say that that's a simplified 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1088	3045.95	3051.16	E	Professor	s^ng.%--	-1	0	then this noise cancellation but well and and and say that that's a simplified version of what's really had what's really happening is uh well i'll talk to 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1089	3051.16	3055.03	E	Professor	s	-1	0	uh well i'll talk to you right now you games direct sound for my speech but you're also getting 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1090	3055.03	3059.77	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but you're also getting uh the interact sounds bounced around the room a number of times 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1091	3060.28	3060.64	E	Professor	qy^d^f^rt	-1	0	okay so 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1092	3060.96	3068.86	E	Professor	s	-1	0	okay so now if you um try to refute to completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons but i 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1093	3068.86	3069.62	E	Professor	%--	-1	0	reasons but i but 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1094	3070.31	3073.63	E	Professor	s	+1	0	not to try to completely remove it that is in for their the room response but just 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1095	3073.63	3077.89	E	Professor	s	+1	0	response but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the the effect some of the echoes 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1096	3078.66	3080.17	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um a never people have done this so that if you're talking 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1097	3080.17	3086.47	E	Professor	s	-1	0	this so that if you're talking to a speaker phone uh it makes it more like it would be if you were talking right up to it so this is sort 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1098	3086.47	3089.2	E	Professor	s	-1	0	up to it so this is sort of this this straight forward approach you say i 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1099	3089.65	3096.82	E	Professor	s	-1	0	you say i i i want to use this uh this item that i want to distract off various kinds of can see construct 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1100	3096.82	3107.5	E	Professor	s	-1	0	kinds of can see construct a filter and you have this this filter version uh of the speech gets uh uh gets attracted off from the original speech and 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1101	3107.95	3111.11	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and you try to you try to minimize the energy in some sense 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1102	3111.78	3115.38	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	kind of a clean up thing with some constraints it's a clean 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1103	3114.47	3115.82	A	PhD	s^bu.%--	-1	0	kind of a clean up thing with some constraints it's a clean 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1104	3115.69	3116.93	E	Professor	s^aa^m	-1	0	up thing it's a clean up thing right so 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1105	3116.66	3116.92	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	up thing right so 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1106	3116.93	3120.88	E	Professor	fg|s	+1	0	up thing right so i go cancelling is is you know calmly done until off and 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1107	3121.16	3129.38	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	and and and it's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you if you know you're going to be talking some distant from 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1108	3130.62	3139.79	A	PhD	s	-1	0	when uh i would have meetings with these folks in cambridge and that's b. b. n. over the phone they had a um some kind of a special speaker phone and 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1109	3139.79	3143.83	A	PhD	s	-1	0	speaker phone and when they would first connect me it would come on and we hear all this noise 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1111	3144.54	3147.52	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and then it was uh and then it would come on and it was very clear right 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1110	3144.15	3144.34	E	Professor	b	-1	0	and then it was 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1112	3147.82	3148.28	A	PhD	qy^d^f	-1	0	right so it's taking samples 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1113	3147.88	3151.3	E	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	right so it's taking samples is doing adaptations adjusting weights and then it's getting 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1114	3151.3	3152.38	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and then it's getting so 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1115	3153.4	3158.86	E	Professor	fh|s.x	-1	0	uh anyway that's that's kind of every single thing that like that somebody's trying somebody 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1116	3158.86	3162.93	E	Professor	s	+1	1	that somebody's trying somebody like and and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with i think 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1117	3162.93	3165.23	E	Professor	s	-1	0	to do that with i think they'd be enough days body of data to do with and 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1118	3165.23	3171.13	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and for that sort of task you wouldn't care but it was large particulars teacher 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1119	3171.55	3177.06	E	Professor	b	-1	0	it's pretty kinks varies work really it's a different type or racial um right things 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1120	3172.54	3174.8	B	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	it's pretty kinks varies work really it's a different 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1121	3174.8	3176.06	B	Postdoc	qrr	-1	0	really it's a different type or racial um 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1122	3177.68	3183.12	E	Professor	s	-1	0	right things various work as an example of what we did from the opposite dogma right which is 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1123	3183.23	3183.49	E	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right which is 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1124	3183.67	3188.88	E	Professor	s:s	-1	0	right which is uh was calling party line which is that uh doing that sort of thing it's not really what we want 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1125	3189.02	3194.27	E	Professor	s	-1	0	we want something more flexible where people might change their position and and it might be 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1126	3194.27	3195.4	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and it might be 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1127	3196.1	3197.23	E	Professor	%--	-1	0	there's also um oh yeah 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1128	3197.76	3198.02	E	Professor	s^fe	-1	0	oh yeah annoys so that 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1129	3198.07	3198.56	E	Professor	s	-1	0	annoys so that 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1130	3198.65	3202.55	E	Professor	s	-1	0	annoys so that echo cancellation does not really allow for noise 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1131	3203.27	3206.16	E	Professor	s	-1	0	it's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays then we'll figure 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1132	3206.55	3212.8	E	Professor	s	-1	0	then we'll figure out the right the right side of weights for your taps filter in order to reduce the effectiveness those echo 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1133	3213.92	3218.95	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	but um if there's noise in the very signal that it's looking at is corrupted so 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1134	3218.95	3226.31	E	Professor	s	-1	0	is corrupted so that it's decision about what the right right right uh delays our's is regulate sicknesses is uh is incur and so 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1135	3226.87	3238.09	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and so in a noisy situation also in a in a situation that's very river was really long reverberations times really long delays it's it's sort of typically impractical so for those kind 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1136	3238.45	3240.01	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so for those kind of reasons and also a 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1137	3240.53	3242.37	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and also a complete inversion if you actually 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1138	3242.55	3246.53	E	Professor	s	-1	0	if you actually i mentioned that it's kind of hard to really do the version of the room acoustics 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1139	3247.19	3264.71	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um that's difficult because um often times uh the the system transfer function is such that when it's inverted you get something that's unstable 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1140	3265.76	3275.18	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and so if you you do your estimate of what the system is tried idea in verde you get a filter that actually uh rings and uh goes to infinity so it's so 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1141	3275.18	3280.25	E	Professor	s	-1	0	so it's so this this is that sort of technical reason and the fact that things move in his air currents i mean there's all sorts of 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1142	3280.31	3283.77	E	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean there's all sorts of all sorts of reasons why it's not really practical so for 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1143	3283.77	3289.22	E	Professor	s	-1	0	really practical so for all those kinds of reasons uh we we sort of um include we didn't want to do inversion and we even pretty 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1144	3289.22	3293.08	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and we even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation which isn't really inversion 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1145	3293.79	3308.07	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and um we decided to do this approach of taking it just picking uh features which for uh we'll give you more something is more stable in the presence of or absence of from reverberations and that's what brian prime time 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1146	3308.07	3309.36	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and that's what brian prime time 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1147	3311.57	3317.35	E	Professor	fh|s^tc	-1	0	so um let me just say a couple things that as as 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1148	3317.35	3324.54	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	see i guess you you actually already said this thing about thee uh about the consent forms which was 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1149	3324.77	3326.44	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	which was that we now don't have to just 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1150	3326.85	3329.74	E	Professor	qy^d.%--	-1	0	but uh have to just as a human subjects folks or something i said 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1151	3329.52	3333.55	B	Postdoc	s	+1	1	but uh apparently i mean we're going to do a revised form course 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1152	3333.98	3334.34	B	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	course but 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1153	3334.97	3340.98	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but once person assigned it once then that's valid for a certain number of meetings she 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1154	3340.98	3344.2	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	certain number of meetings she want to meet actually estimate how many meetings to put that on the consent form tore 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1155	3344.77	3346.79	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	tore that would be a little bit difficult to say so i think 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1156	3346.79	3351.3	B	Postdoc	s	+1	1	to say so i think from a practical standpoint my we could have them do it once every ten meetings or something it won't be that many people 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1157	3351.3	3353.79	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it won't be that many people do it that often but 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1158	3353.79	3358.79	B	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	that often but they don't forget that they've done and i guess 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1159	3359.69	3359.99	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1160	3361.75	3363.43	E	Professor	fg|s^t	-1	0	um back of data thing so there's 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1161	3363.66	3367.54	E	Professor	s	-1	0	thing so there's this sort of one hour ten hour hundred hours sort of thing that we have we 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1162	3368.01	3371.98	E	Professor	s	+1	1	have we have an hour uh that that is transcribed we 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1163	3371.98	3375.69	E	Professor	s	+1	1	is transcribed we have we have twelve hours it's recorded but not transcribed

Bmr005.C.dialogueact1180	3410.4	3414.88	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	well so much what we talked about with it energy detection in a close talking mike 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1181	3415.22	3422.28	C	PhD	s	-1	0	their number of interesting questions but you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting that don't require any transcription so what are the patterns 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1182	3422.54	3425.51	C	PhD	qw	-1	0	so what are the patterns of you'd be energy patterns over to me 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1183	3426.27	3431.66	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and i'm really interested in this but we don't have a whole lot of data so i 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1184	3431.76	3434.4	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	lot of data so i was thinking when we got the room set up 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1185	3435.59	3445.74	C	PhD	fh|s^cs	-1	0	and you can always think of also for political reasons of x. e. collected you know two hundred dollars that looks different than forty hours even if we don't transcribe it ourselves but i don't think 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1186	3445.61	3448.08	E	Professor	s^arp	-1	0	it ourselves so but i don't think we're going to stop at the end of the semester right so i 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1187	3446.95	3447.34	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	so we're going to stop at the end of the semester 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1188	3448.28	3448.55	E	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right so i 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1189	3448.55	3454.91	E	Professor	s	+1	1	right so i i think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months we are going to have more like a hundred hours 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1190	3459.23	3463.44	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	especially meetings that have some kind of conflict in them or some kind of just it i mean 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1191	3463.64	3464.92	C	PhD	s^bsc.%--	-1	0	of just it i mean that are less 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1192	3465.19	3465.96	C	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	well i don't 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1193	3466.68	3470.36	C	PhD	fh|qy^rt	-1	0	uh that have some more emotional aspect to them or 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1194	3470.36	3471.55	C	PhD	qrr.%-	-1	0	or drop we had some good ones earlier 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1195	3471.12	3472.36	G	Grad	s	-1	0	drop there's we had some good ones earlier 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1196	3472.89	3473.86	C	PhD	s	-1	0	there's laughter um 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1197	3473.86	3477.16	C	PhD	s	-1	0	laughter um i'm talking more about strong differences of opinion meaning me with 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1198	3477.61	3479.45	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	me with manager types or 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1199	3480.17	3481.36	G	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	think it's hard to record this 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1200	3482.2	3483.56	C	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	so selectivity should be allowed to record okay uh people 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1203	3483.64	3486.0	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so selectivity people cancel out afterwards but by one to raise to record okay okay uh people get 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1202	3483.56	3484.2	C	PhD	b	-1	0	so selectivity people cancel to record okay uh people get 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1201	3483.2	3484.43	E	Professor	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	so selectivity people cancel to record okay uh people get 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1204	3486.1	3488.09	B	Postdoc	s^t	-1	0	but by one to raise the kid p. s. a. i. d. okay well if there's anyway yeah i was going 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1205	3486.54	3487.15	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	but by one to raise the kid p. s. a. i. d. okay well if there's anyway 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1206	3487.15	3488.41	C	PhD	s	-1	0	the kid p. s. a. i. d. well if there's anyway yeah i was going 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1207	3488.62	3489.58	E	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah i was going to mention that yeah that's a good idea 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1208	3489.11	3489.89	G	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	to mention that yeah that's a good idea 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1209	3490.02	3491.29	G	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	yeah that's that would be a good match 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1210	3491.9	3509.47	E	Professor	s	+1	1	yeah so yeah so i i attention to have them in those things can talk and attention to them before that uh there's uh it it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data he talking to uh acquaintances and local broadcast 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1211	3510.71	3518.54	E	Professor	s	-1	0	because that we had talked before about the problem but using found they that that uh it's just set up however they have it set up and we don't 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1212	3518.54	3520.22	E	Professor	s	-1	0	set up and we don't have any say about it and it's typically 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1213	3520.22	3521.88	E	Professor	s	-1	0	it and it's typically one microphone 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1214	3522.47	3527.77	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and uh or and and so it doesn't really give us character sixty one 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1215	3528.79	3532.42	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um and so i do think we're going to continue recording here and record we can't but 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1216	3532.98	3544.21	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	can't but um it did occur to me that we could go to friends broadcast media and say hey you have this panel show or this know this discussion show and um can you record multi channel 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1217	3545.41	3550.29	E	Professor	fh|s.%-	-1	0	and uh they may be willing to record it's uh with 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1218	3550.07	3551.91	C	PhD	qy^2^d^rt	-1	0	well 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1219	3551.87	3553.34	E	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	well they probably already use lapel but they might be able 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1220	3553.34	3557.64	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but they might be able to have it it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant wouldn't be 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1221	3557.02	3557.27	C	PhD	b	-1	0	somewhat distant wouldn't be 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1222	3557.64	3560.81	E	Professor	s	-1	0	somewhat distant wouldn't be exactly the set up to be that sort of thing 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1223	3561.08	3566.88	E	Professor	s	-1	0	right no i and what we're going to get from u. w. you know something they they they start recording isn't also also is not going to be this exact set up 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1224	3566.79	3567.87	C	PhD	s^ba^rt	-1	0	right no i think would be great exact set up 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1226	3568.29	3569.2	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	get more data so i i i 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1225	3568.26	3571.34	E	Professor	s	-1	0	get more data so i i i i was thinking of looking into that see other thing 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1227	3571.79	3584.21	E	Professor	s	+1	1	that see other thing occur to me after we had that discussion in fact is that is even possible since course many radio shows are not lie uh that we could invite them to have some of the record some of their shows here 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1228	3585.33	3585.93	B	Postdoc	s^ba^fe	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1229	3586.41	3590.44	C	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	well or the thing is they're not as averse to wearing one of these and i mean they're on the radio right that's we are 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1231	3590.44	3591.27	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and i mean they're on the radio or that's we are 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1230	3590.05	3590.96	G	Grad	s	-1	0	and i mean they're on the radio that's we are 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1232	3591.27	3591.41	C	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	or 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1233	3591.48	3593.88	C	PhD	fh|s^ba	-1	0	or um i think that'd be fantastic because 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1234	3591.88	3592.16	E	Professor	b	-1	0	or um i think 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1235	3593.88	3597.03	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	that'd be fantastic because those kinds of panels and those have interesting 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1236	3597.42	3597.71	E	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1237	3598.52	3601.47	C	PhD	s	-1	0	but that's an aside and stuff so that we're not clicking here so and 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1238	3601.47	3601.78	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	here so and 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1240	3601.91	3602.75	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	here so great and and the i mean the other side 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1239	3601.88	3608.87	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	here so great and and the i mean the other side to it was what which is where we're coming from out of talk more about later is that is that there's there's uh 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1241	3609.66	3621.1	E	Professor	s	-1	0	the radio stations and television stations are ready stuff worked out personably uh related to legal issues and and permissions and all that i mean they already 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1242	3621.1	3624.09	E	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean they already do with what they do so it's 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1243	3624.3	3627.77	E	Professor	s	-1	0	so it's it's so it's so it's another source so i think 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1244	3627.77	3630.39	E	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	it's another source so i think it's something we should look into you know we'll collect 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1245	3630.39	3631.82	E	Professor	s	-1	0	you know we'll collect we talk here hopefully 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1246	3631.82	3634.3	E	Professor	s	-1	0	we talk here hopefully they will collect more you w. also 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1247	3635.19	3637.82	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and um and they do have this other source but 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1248	3637.82	3644.11	E	Professor	s	+1	1	this other source but yeah i i think that it's not unreasonable to aim at getting yet significantly in excess of a hundred hours and that was sort of our goal 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1249	3644.11	3645.39	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and that was sort of our goal the 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1250	3646.05	3652.5	E	Professor	s	-1	0	thing was i was hoping that we could in the under this control situation weeks at least like you know thirty to fifty hours 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1251	3653.05	3656.99	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and at the rate we're going we'll get pretty close to that i think this semester 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1252	3657.47	3661.57	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	right if we continue to collect some next semester i think we should 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1253	3661.9	3662.1	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	right yeah i was mostly trying 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1254	3662.1	3669.42	C	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah i was mostly trying to think okay you start a project within say a month you know how much dated you have to work with and you 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1255	3669.42	3674.42	C	PhD	s	-1	0	with and you you want to you want to sort of freight freeze your your data for a while so 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1256	3675.06	3677.26	C	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	right now and we don't have the 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1257	3677.43	3679.78	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and we don't have the transcripts back yet for my b. m. right where 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1258	3679.78	3680.01	C	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	for my b. m. right where we didn't have it for this 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1260	3680.33	3682.19	C	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	oh we know so we didn't have it for this you know forty five minutes away 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1259	3680.06	3682.84	E	Professor	s^nd.%-	-1	0	oh we know so we didn't have it for this you know forty five minutes away 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1261	3682.19	3689.12	C	PhD	fh|s^df^t	+1	0	so um not complaining i'm just trying to think you know what kinds of projects can you do now versus uh six months from now and they're pretty different minutes away 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1262	3685.25	3685.54	E	Professor	b	-1	0	you know what kinds of projects 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1263	3689.12	3690.53	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and they're pretty different because yes i've seen the right 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1265	3690.3	3698.27	E	Professor	s	-1	0	because um right right yes i've seen the right now it's sort of this exploratory stuff for you you look at the data use primitive measures and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like and and 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1264	3690.24	3690.42	G	Grad	b	-1	0	because yes i've seen the right 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1266	3691.44	3691.7	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	um now it's sort of this exploratory 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1267	3693.84	3694.22	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	you look at the data use primitive 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1269	3698.59	3699.16	C	PhD	b	-1	0	right right and and and uh 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1268	3698.27	3706.13	E	Professor	s	-1	0	right right because i'm not actually sure just logistically and and and uh any well would collect and then it's more like you have three months from now or six months from now you can you can do a lot of other things 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1270	3705.35	3708.3	C	PhD	s^no.%--	-1	0	because i'm not actually sure just logistically that i can spend yeah i don't want do a lot of other things 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1271	3708.63	3714.77	C	PhD	s	+1	0	yeah i don't want to charge the time that they have on the project too early before there's enough data to make good use of the time that's right 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1272	3714.77	3716.24	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	good use of the time that's and especially with the student uh for right 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1273	3714.85	3715.22	G	Grad	b	-1	0	good use of the time that's and especially with the student right 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1274	3716.85	3718.2	C	PhD	s	-1	0	uh for instance uh 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1275	3717.33	3717.72	E	Professor	b	-1	0	instance 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1276	3719.08	3719.18	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	animation say too 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1277	3719.32	3720.36	C	PhD	s	-1	0	animation say too much but um 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1278	3720.36	3730.95	C	PhD	fh|qy	-1	0	much but um if someone came that was great and wanted to do some real work and they have to and by the end of the school year in the spring how much did well i have to work with with that person 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1279	3730.95	3731.83	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	with that person yes right 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1280	3731.87	3736.13	E	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	yes i would take exploratory things now uh three months from now uh i right 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1281	3736.42	3741.2	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh i mean the transcription i think are bit of on known because we haven't gotten those back yet as far as the timing i think as 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1282	3741.55	3757.31	E	Professor	s	+1	0	i think as far as the collection it doesn't seem to me like unreasonable to say that uh in january you know roughly uh just roughly three months from now we should have at least something like you know twenty five thirty hours 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1283	3758.07	3761.21	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and we need to i think that there's a and we just don't know about the transcription part of i mean it so that's 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1284	3758.16	3759.22	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	and we just don't know about the transcription part of so that's 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1285	3760.6	3765.44	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and we need to i think that there's a possibility transferable need to be adjusted afterwards and uh i mean it yep 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1286	3761.21	3761.27	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	i think that there's a mean it 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1287	3761.27	3762.04	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	i think that there's a possibility transferable mean it 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1288	3765.44	3771.8	B	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	and uh especially since these people won't be uh used to dealing with multi channel transcription so i 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1289	3766.19	3766.51	C	PhD	b	-1	0	especially since 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1290	3766.32	3766.68	E	Professor	b	-1	0	especially since 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1291	3771.8	3773.81	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	transcription so i think that will need to just some and 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1292	3773.93	3782.79	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	just some and also if we want to add things like more refined coating of overlaps and definitely i think we should kind of having through 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1293	3783.19	3786.09	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i want to ask another aspect of the data collection there'd be no reason 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1294	3786.54	3790.95	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	there'd be no reason a white person couldn't get together several and you know friends and 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1295	3790.95	3793.09	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know friends and coming argue about a topic if they wanted to write 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1296	3793.09	3793.35	B	Postdoc	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	write

Bmr005.E.dialogueact1298	3797.59	3800.64	E	Professor	s	-1	0	to something uh i mean we're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions but i think 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1299	3800.64	3801.75	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but i think it's a real

Bmr005.G.dialogueact1303	3803.89	3805.13	G	Grad	s^cs^rt	-1	0	you can do and i'm thinking politically well station political debates 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1304	3805.69	3806.26	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you can do well yeah or 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1305	3805.72	3806.76	C	PhD	h|s^aa	-1	0	you can do well yeah or 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1306	3806.26	3807.26	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yeah or just if you're 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1307	3806.76	3822.99	C	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah or just if you're if you have their meetings here that happened that we can record even if we don't having to the ditches or maybe have them do a shorter digit thing like this you know one string of digits or something i'd probably be willing to we don't have to do that is all we don't want to 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1308	3818.88	3820.79	G	Grad	s	-1	0	like this you know one string of we don't have to do that is all we don't want to 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1309	3823.87	3826.09	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	then having the data is very valuable because i think it's 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1310	3826.09	3834.8	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because i think it's politically better for us to say we have this many hours of audio data especially with t. i. t. r. if we put in a proposal and 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1311	3835.15	3838.49	C	PhD	s	-1	0	they'll just look like exceeds collected a lot more audio data um whether 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1312	3838.61	3842.56	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	data um whether transcribed or not um is another issue but there's 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1313	3842.56	3849.15	C	PhD	s	+1	0	it seems like you could hold some issue but there's there are research question you can answer without the transcription for at least you can start to answer 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1315	3849.04	3850.56	B	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	seems like you could hold some meetings you know you so 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1314	3848.95	3849.18	G	Grad	b	-1	0	it seems like you could hold some can start to answer 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1317	3850.56	3851.81	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	meetings you know you and maybe um so

Bmr005.B.dialogueact1318	3851.87	3854.63	B	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	would it help at all and maybe um you could you could hold some additional meetings 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1319	3854.43	3855.34	A	PhD	qw^rt.%--	-1	0	would it help at all i mean and we're already 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1320	3855.34	3859.73	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean and we're already talking about for two levels of detail and meetings one is 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1321	3859.73	3869.55	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and meetings one is um without doing the digits i guess the the full blown ones we get the digits and everything and talk about doing without digits what if we 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1322	3869.55	3876.52	A	PhD	qw	-1	0	digits what if we had another level just to collect data which is without the head sets and we just did that table now need that close talking 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1323	3876.17	3877.56	C	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	need that close talking mike 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1324	3877.48	3878.04	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	mike i mean absolutely

Bmr005.G.dialogueact1328	3880.28	3884.08	G	Grad	s	-1	0	i'm really scary um or at least like me personally it seems like it's a big part of this corpus is to have the close talking like 
Bmr005.A.dialogueact1330	3883.25	3883.82	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	or at least like talking like 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1329	3882.89	3886.82	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um or at least like me personally i couldn't use idea corpus is to have the close talking like

Bmr005.B.dialogueact1335	3888.47	3890.12	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	also we had this came up when she she she was here that support so 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1336	3890.12	3890.71	B	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	that support so 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1338	3890.91	3892.07	C	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	that support so it's a great idea and if it were true then i 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1337	3890.69	3891.16	E	Professor	b	-1	0	that support so it's a great idea 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1339	3891.16	3908.03	E	Professor	s	-1	0	it's a great idea and if it were true then i would just do that but it's not that bad like the room is not the bottle neck and we have enough time in the room and getting the people to come in and put on the i guess the setup going but the i don't think the transcription are actually in the long run such a big bottle neck i think the issues just 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1340	3892.07	3893.82	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and if it were true then i would just do that but it's 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1341	3893.82	3894.95	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	would just do that but it's not that bad like 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1342	3895.04	3897.28	C	PhD	s	-1	0	the room is not the bottle neck and we have enough

Bmr005.C.dialogueact1344	3898.95	3902.96	C	PhD	s	-1	0	time in the room and getting the people to come in and put on the i guess the setup going 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1345	3908.03	3911.6	E	Professor	s	-1	0	i think the issues just that were were blazing that 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1346	3911.73	3912.06	E	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	and and 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1347	3912.21	3919.81	E	Professor	fh|qy^rt	+1	0	and and um do you have any idea when when uh the you'd be able to send uh well i've been burning 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1348	3918.93	3924.02	G	Grad	h|s	-1	0	well i've been burning to c. d. today which is about all i can do with uh time i have so it'll be early next 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1349	3921.32	3921.59	E	Professor	b	-1	0	which is about all i can do 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1350	3924.1	3924.36	E	Professor	b	-1	0	so it'll be early next

Bmr005.E.dialogueact1354	3927.99	3930.31	E	Professor	s	-1	0	next week to send it to them and then then we check with them to see if they've got it and we we 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1355	3930.31	3934.19	E	Professor	s	-1	0	it and we we start you know asking about timing for so i think 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1356	3931.09	3931.29	G	Grad	b	-1	0	start you know 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1357	3934.19	3941.93	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	so i think once they get it sorted out about how they were going to do it which i think they're pretty well along on because they were able to read the uh so 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1358	3940.74	3940.93	G	Grad	b.%	-1	0	because they were able to read

Bmr005.G.dialogueact1396	4018.61	4020.62	G	Grad	s	-1	0	right i so i just throw meeting i guess none of you were there for circle ball meeting 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1398	4019.19	4021.45	C	PhD	s	-1	0	i so i just throw it out there if anyone knows you were there for circle ball meeting that was hilarious 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1400	4021.45	4029.3	C	PhD	s	+1	2	it out there if anyone knows of one more or two more we meetings per week that happen a dixie um that we can record i think it would be worth it yeah well we should also check that was hilarious 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1399	4021.05	4021.87	G	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	it out there if anyone knows that was hilarious 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1401	4029.23	4039.09	E	Professor	fg|s^co	+1	0	it yeah well we should also check with ari again because they because they were really intending maybe just didn't happen that they're really intending to be duplicating this and some level so then that would double 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1402	4039.09	4040.98	E	Professor	s	-1	0	so then that would double only 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1403	4043.28	4046.45	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and there's a lot of different meetings that you'd up you uh 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1404	4046.45	4050.49	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	you uh i mean really more a lot more we have here it because we're not right on campus so 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1405	4049.02	4049.44	G	Grad	b	-1	0	it because we're not right on 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1406	4050.49	4050.74	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	campus so

Bmr005.E.dialogueact1411	4061.9	4066.74	E	Professor	s	-1	0	juries open so i mean we have to speech beatings one uh network meeting 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1412	4067.36	4069.72	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i jerry was open to it but it i ice 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1413	4070.4	4078.65	E	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	the thing that i think is a little little bit of limitation there's i think when people are not involved uh you know at work you probably can't do it every week 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1414	4079.71	4086.17	E	Professor	s	+1	0	i i i i think that that people are going to are going to feel a little bit constrained i might get 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1415	4086.61	4089.52	E	Professor	s	-1	0	i might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time and yep 
Bmr005.E.dialogueact1417	4089.67	4093.7	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	the time and uh it so that they could just really sort of chart you put the mics on the discharge in and yep 
Bmr005.G.dialogueact1416	4089.4	4089.63	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	the time and yep 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1418	4094.43	4099.44	C	PhD	qw	-1	0	you know what if we give people you know we cater lunch in exchange for them having a meeting here so 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1419	4099.65	4103.36	B	Postdoc	s^ng	-1	0	you know i i do think eating why you're doing the meeting it's going to be increasing the noise i have another question so okay all right all right 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1420	4102.09	4102.55	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	it's going to be increasing the all 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1422	4103.42	4110.56	B	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	noise i have another question which is um you know in principle um i know that you don't want artificial topics but right all right 
Bmr005.C.dialogueact1421	4102.93	4103.79	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	it's going to be increasing the noise i have another question all right all right 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1423	4110.56	4120.52	B	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	but um it does seem to me that we want to be able to get subjects from campus to come down and and do something that wouldn't be too artificial i mean 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1424	4120.52	4124.65	B	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	i mean we political discussions or or something or other and definitely

Bmr005.B.dialogueact1428	4127.13	4129.21	B	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	because you know there's also this constraint we it's like you know 
Bmr005.B.dialogueact1429	4129.21	4133.71	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it's like you know the e. gold diggers golden goldilocks like you
