Two research teams , one from the US and the other from Germany , meet to discuss SmartKom , a multi-modal tourist information system.
A German version of the tool has already been developed , and the objective is to collaborate to develop an English version.
The researchers discuss whether to develop the English parser from scratch or to adopt the style used for ther German parser.
They make an appointment to meet later in the week to discuss their progress.
The goal of the system is being presented as to provide directions to toourists based not only on their destination , but also on their intentions , eg . taking a picture or bying souvenirs.
The researchers discuss various design issues , e.g . how the components of the system should interact and whether the approach to the English system needs to be fundamentally different from that of ther German.
Improvements for the German version , such as adding a syntactic analysis , are also discussed.
Concluding the dialogue , a researcher from the US team recommends that the German team hear a forthcoming talk on using deep semantics in applications.
