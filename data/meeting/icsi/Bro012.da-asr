Bro012.B.dialogueact1	1.597	3.197	B	PhD	s^bk|s^t^tc	-1	0	okay so okay we're on 
Bro012.E.dialogueact0	1.111	1.371	E	Grad	z	-1	0	okay we're 
Bro012.A.dialogueact2	3.43	7.91	A	Professor	fg|s^t^tc	+1	4	okay so uh that's an interesting mail from uh down ellis actually 
Bro012.A.dialogueact3	7.91	11.39	A	Professor	s	-1	0	down ellis actually i think he he re directed to everybody also so uh 
Bro012.A.dialogueact4	11.39	17.15	A	Professor	s	-1	0	also so uh d. p. a. mike's i have uh a big bunch of energy at at uh five hurts 
Bro012.A.dialogueact5	18.01	18.39	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro012.A.dialogueact6	19.24	23.77	A	Professor	s	+1	3	where this came up was that uh i was showing off this way forms that we have on the web and 
Bro012.A.dialogueact7	23.77	33.75	A	Professor	fh|s	+1	3	have on the web and and uh i just sort of have noticed this but the the major major component in they way in the second way for him and a pair reforms is actually the air conditioner 
Bro012.C.dialogueact8	34.127	34.307	C	Grad	x	-1	0	so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact9	34.726	34.956	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact10	35.816	36.036	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	after 
Bro012.A.dialogueact11	36.036	41.739	A	Professor	s	+1	2	after we're careful about using that as a as a as a good illustration in fact 
Bro012.A.dialogueact12	41.799	45.633	A	Professor	s	+1	2	in fact it's not of of the sexes reverberations british is 
Bro012.A.dialogueact13	45.633	53.109	A	Professor	s	+1	2	british is isn't a bad illustration of the effects of uh room noise some bikes 
Bro012.A.dialogueact14	54.77	56.01	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro012.A.dialogueact15	59.147	59.517	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	and then 
Bro012.A.dialogueact16	59.517	64.392	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and then we have this other discussion about um whether this affects the dynamic range because i know 
Bro012.A.dialogueact17	64.392	68.852	A	Professor	s	-1	0	range because i know although you start off with thirty two bits you end up with a sixteen bits and 
Bro012.A.dialogueact18	68.852	71.035	A	Professor	qo	-1	0	bits and you know are we getting hurt there but uh dance 
Bro012.A.dialogueact19	71.035	79.8	A	Professor	s.x	-1	0	but uh dance pretty confident that we're not that that connotation errors that some amount a significant 
Bro012.A.dialogueact20	80.57	80.92	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact21	81.511	84.651	A	Professor	s	-1	0	so was a question of whether we should change things here whether we should 
Bro012.A.dialogueact22	84.651	88.871	A	Professor	s	-1	0	here whether we should change a capacitor on uh put box for that or 
Bro012.A.dialogueact23	88.871	89.921	A	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	for that or whether we should yeah he suggested 
Bro012.B.dialogueact24	89.43	91.24	B	PhD	fg|s^bu	-1	0	whether we should right yeah he suggested a smaller capacitor right for the 
Bro012.B.dialogueact25	91.24	91.51	B	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right right for the 
Bro012.A.dialogueact27	91.778	92.078	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right but then i had some other right for the a.'s 
Bro012.A.dialogueact28	92.078	94.838	A	Professor	s	-1	0	but then i had some other uh thing discussions and the a.'s 
Bro012.B.dialogueact26	91.65	92.56	B	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right but then i had some other right for the a.'s 
Bro012.A.dialogueact29	94.838	101.248	A	Professor	s	-1	0	discussions and the feeling was once we start my my came with that many other problems could have happened and 
Bro012.A.dialogueact30	101.789	105.699	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and additionally we we already have a lot of data this collected that so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact31	105.699	106.019	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	that so uh 
Bro012.B.dialogueact32	105.72	106.17	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	that so uh 
Bro012.A.dialogueact33	106.639	108.599	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh simple thing to do is he 
Bro012.A.dialogueact34	108.699	112.329	A	Professor	s	-1	0	is he he has uh i forget if this was in that or in the following mail but he has 
Bro012.A.dialogueact35	112.329	116.219	A	Professor	s	-1	0	mail but he has a a a simple filter uh that you felt that he suggested we just 
Bro012.A.dialogueact36	116.823	118.943	A	Professor	s	-1	0	we just run over the data for we deal with it 
Bro012.B.dialogueact37	118.182	118.672	B	PhD	b	-1	0	for we deal with it 
Bro012.A.dialogueact38	119.938	128.79	A	Professor	fg|s^tc	+1	1	um the other thing i don't know the answer to but when people are using seek out here uh whether they're using it with a high pass filter option uh 
Bro012.A.dialogueact39	130.075	133.382	A	Professor	s	-1	0	i don't know if anybody knows 
Bro012.E.dialogueact40	132.42	135.64	E	Grad	h|s^cs^no^rt	-1	0	if anybody knows go check 
Bro012.A.dialogueact41	133.512	133.672	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro012.A.dialogueact42	136.4	136.7	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah so we're 
Bro012.A.dialogueact43	136.7	139.2	A	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	yeah so we're doing all these things using a software there is um 
Bro012.A.dialogueact44	139.937	158.238	A	Professor	s	-1	0	um if it's if it's based on the rest guilty program which does both guilty and drastic guilty uh there is an option there which then comes up through the few calc which a lot of junior high test filtering in general we like 
Bro012.A.dialogueact45	158.238	161.078	A	Professor	s	-1	0	in general we like to do that because of things like this 
Bro012.A.dialogueact46	161.078	164.14	A	Professor	s	+1	1	it's it's pretty it's not ever of here filter 
Bro012.A.dialogueact47	164.999	167.229	A	Professor	s	+1	1	filter doesn't affect speech frequencies even pretty low 
Bro012.A.dialogueact48	167.229	169.469	A	Professor	s	-1	0	even pretty low speech frequencies at all but it's 
Bro012.A.dialogueact49	169.469	169.899	A	Professor	%--	-1	0	at all but it's 
Bro012.B.dialogueact50	170.3	172.75	B	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	what's he cutoff frequency frequencies 
Bro012.A.dialogueact51	174.575	175.035	A	Professor	h	-1	0	oh i don't know i wrote this a 
Bro012.A.dialogueact52	175.275	175.545	A	Professor	s^no	-1	0	i don't know i wrote this a 
Bro012.A.dialogueact53	175.545	176.635	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	i don't know i wrote this a while ago was like twenty 
Bro012.B.dialogueact54	176.57	177.35	B	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	while ago was like twenty 
Bro012.A.dialogueact55	177.84	178.52	A	Professor	s^am	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro012.B.dialogueact56	178.569	178.859	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro012.A.dialogueact57	179.15	179.39	A	Professor	b	-1	0	i mean i think there's 
Bro012.A.dialogueact58	179.44	181.28	A	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean i think there's some effective of twenty but it's it's 
Bro012.A.dialogueact59	181.28	183.15	A	Professor	s	-1	0	but it's it's it's it's mild 
Bro012.A.dialogueact60	185.28	189.97	A	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean it probably just for some affect up to a hundred hertz or something but it's it's pretty 
Bro012.A.dialogueact61	191.132	197.312	A	Professor	qr.%--	-1	0	i don't know in the in the strut implementation of the stuff is there i test filter are pretty pretty emphasis or something 
Bro012.F.dialogueact62	198.31	200.42	F	PhD	h|s^am	-1	0	uh i think we use a preempt these 
Bro012.F.dialogueact63	201.02	201.19	F	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro012.F.dialogueact64	202.6	202.69	F	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro012.A.dialogueact65	203.834	209.864	A	Professor	s	+1	1	so we we we want to go and check that and and for anything they were going to use to be a mike for 
Bro012.A.dialogueact66	210.311	215.351	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and he says that there's a pretty good roll off and they pgm so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact67	215.781	219.128	A	Professor	s	-1	0	so you know they need to worry about them one way or the other but if we do make use 
Bro012.A.dialogueact68	219.128	226.912	A	Professor	s	+1	1	but if we do make use of the cheap bikes we want to be sure to do that that filtering before we process and then 
Bro012.A.dialogueact69	226.912	227.752	A	Professor	%--	-1	0	process and then again if it's 
Bro012.A.dialogueact70	228.381	234.771	A	Professor	s	-1	0	uh depending on the option that uh our our suffers being runways it's it's quite possible that's already being taken care of 
Bro012.A.dialogueact71	237.679	241.599	A	Professor	s	-1	0	um but i also have to pick a different picture so the affection for for british 
Bro012.A.dialogueact72	243.292	243.662	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro012.B.dialogueact73	244.17	245.63	B	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	uh did somebody it during your talk 
Bro012.A.dialogueact74	245.985	246.595	A	Professor	h|s^ar	-1	0	uh no your talk 
Bro012.B.dialogueact75	246.936	247.146	B	PhD	b	-1	0	no 
Bro012.A.dialogueact76	247.529	247.719	A	Professor	%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro012.A.dialogueact77	248.422	248.692	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh well female 
Bro012.A.dialogueact78	248.692	249.492	A	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	uh well female but they were 
Bro012.A.dialogueact79	249.492	252.082	A	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	but they were you say anything 
Bro012.B.dialogueact80	251.12	251.7	B	PhD	qy^2^bu^d	-1	0	you say anything 
Bro012.A.dialogueact81	253.926	255.679	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but i think it it was 
Bro012.A.dialogueact82	256.971	260.611	A	Professor	s^rt	+1	2	since i was talking about reverberations showing this thing was noise it wasn't a good match but it certainly 
Bro012.A.dialogueact83	260.611	267.689	A	Professor	s	-1	0	good match but it certainly was still uh an indication of the fact that you get no it's assistant mike's 
Bro012.A.dialogueact85	268.155	273.165	A	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	it's just not a great example because i only isn't reverberations it's annoys that we definitely know what to do something it 
Bro012.B.dialogueact84	267.682	268.222	B	PhD	b	-1	0	mike's it's just not a great 
Bro012.A.dialogueact86	273.634	278.936	A	Professor	s	-1	0	something it doesn't take deep i knew bold new methods to get rid of five hurts it's so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact87	278.936	279.186	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	five hurts it's so yeah 
Bro012.B.dialogueact88	279.063	279.333	B	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bro012.A.dialogueact89	280.41	282.654	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	um um but so it was 
Bro012.A.dialogueact90	282.744	284.504	A	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	but so it was it was a bad example in that way but it's 
Bro012.A.dialogueact91	284.504	290.274	A	Professor	s	-1	0	in that way but it's it's still is it's a real thing that we did get out of the microphone distance so it wasn't 
Bro012.A.dialogueact92	290.274	294.194	A	Professor	s	-1	0	so it wasn't it was wrong it was inappropriate 
Bro012.A.dialogueact93	295.044	297.893	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	so so uh but uh 
Bro012.A.dialogueact94	298.806	301.896	A	Professor	fg|s:s	-1	0	if someone noticed it later right now to man oh man 
Bro012.A.dialogueact95	302.026	303.326	A	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	and and i noticed that 
Bro012.B.dialogueact96	302.697	303.127	B	PhD	b	-1	0	and and i noticed that 
Bro012.A.dialogueact97	304.637	308.274	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro012.A.dialogueact98	309.387	312.177	A	Professor	s.%--	+1	2	so i think we'll change our our picture on the web and oh they were but i think i was 
Bro012.A.dialogueact99	312.497	318.025	A	Professor	s	-1	0	were but i think i was i was trying to figure out what what's the best way to show the difference and and i had a couple thoughts one was that 
Bro012.A.dialogueact100	318.025	322.52	A	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	one was that specter ground that we show is okay but the thing 
Bro012.A.dialogueact101	322.52	333.386	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	okay but the thing is yeah i is and behind them so good at picking out patterns from from no lines that in first glance you look at them 
Bro012.A.dialogueact102	333.386	335.806	A	Professor	s^e	-1	0	you look at them it doesn't seem like it's that bad 
Bro012.A.dialogueact103	336.683	340.033	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	uh because there's many features there are still preserved so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact104	340.882	347.349	A	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so one thing to do might be just take a piece of the specter of of the specter gram where you can see that something looks different and and 
Bro012.A.dialogueact105	347.499	351.279	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and and blow it up have that be the part is just to show as well 
Bro012.A.dialogueact107	351.619	351.839	A	Professor	s^f	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro012.B.dialogueact106	351.46	352.764	B	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro012.A.dialogueact108	352.638	355.008	A	Professor	s	-1	0	some things are going to be hurt 
Bro012.A.dialogueact109	355.868	360.988	A	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	another i was thinking of was um taking some slices 
Bro012.A.dialogueact110	361.888	364.538	A	Professor	s^cs^e	-1	0	like uh bikes we look at with recognizing 
Bro012.A.dialogueact111	365.242	367.862	A	Professor	s^cs^e	+1	1	look at the spectrum or from that you get out of there 
Bro012.A.dialogueact112	368.458	374.933	A	Professor	s	-1	0	the reverberations does make it does change that 
Bro012.A.dialogueact114	375.273	377.673	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and so maybe maybe that would be more obvious 
Bro012.B.dialogueact113	375.1	375.44	B	PhD	b	-1	0	and so maybe maybe 
Bro012.C.dialogueact115	378.22	379.19	C	Grad	qy^bu^d^g^rt	-1	0	spectra spices 
Bro012.A.dialogueact116	379.92	380.12	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	well 
Bro012.C.dialogueact117	380.96	382.21	C	Grad	qw^rt	-1	0	well well what do what do you mean 
Bro012.A.dialogueact118	382.927	386.687	A	Professor	s	+1	1	well i mean um oh recognizes looking frames so like 
Bro012.A.dialogueact120	386.917	387.787	A	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	frames so that they look at like one instant in time 
Bro012.B.dialogueact119	386.77	388.14	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	frames so that they look at you know look at like one instant in time 
Bro012.A.dialogueact122	388.601	389.201	A	Professor	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	you know look at it so 
Bro012.C.dialogueact121	388.47	388.64	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	you know look at 
Bro012.A.dialogueact123	389.949	390.509	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it so it's yeah at 
Bro012.A.dialogueact124	390.709	390.889	A	Professor	b	-1	0	it's yeah at 
Bro012.A.dialogueact125	390.889	396.241	A	Professor	s	+1	1	it's yeah at one point in time or twenty over twenty no seconds or something you have a spectrum or custom assignment yeah 
Bro012.C.dialogueact126	394.16	394.41	C	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bro012.A.dialogueact127	396.411	397.671	A	Professor	s	-1	0	assignment ice size i see

Bro012.A.dialogueact129	397.831	398.091	A	Professor	b	-1	0	ice size i see 
Bro012.A.dialogueact130	398.361	400.533	A	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	if you look at you could just you could just 
Bro012.B.dialogueact131	400.0	405.932	B	PhD	s^cs^j	-1	0	you look at you could just you could just throw up you know uh he uh some m. s. c. c. feature victors 
Bro012.B.dialogueact132	406.102	409.622	B	PhD	s^j	-1	0	you know one from one one for the other and then you know you can look and see how different the numbers are 
Bro012.A.dialogueact133	410.549	411.339	A	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	right well that's i saying either 
Bro012.A.dialogueact135	411.339	413.899	A	Professor	s	-1	0	saying either well spectrum recapture but 
Bro012.B.dialogueact134	410.975	411.635	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	right well that's i saying either 
Bro012.A.dialogueact136	413.899	415.609	A	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	spectrum recapture but i think the thing is you want to i don't mean a graph i 
Bro012.A.dialogueact138	415.679	415.779	A	Professor	b	-1	0	you want to i don't mean a graph i 
Bro012.B.dialogueact137	415.248	415.948	B	PhD	s	-1	0	you want to i don't mean a graph i 
Bro012.B.dialogueact139	415.948	417.038	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	you want to oh i see i don't mean a graph i mean the actual numbers 
Bro012.A.dialogueact140	417.109	417.649	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	oh i see 
Bro012.A.dialogueact141	418.696	418.816	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	oh 
Bro012.A.dialogueact142	418.886	419.626	A	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	oh the lovely yeah see how 
Bro012.A.dialogueact144	419.626	419.856	A	Professor	b	-1	0	the lovely yeah see how

Bro012.F.dialogueact189	559.0	562.68	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i don't think it indicates something 
Bro012.F.dialogueact190	563.15	566.63	F	PhD	s.%-	+1	1	i don't i think it means that you see things more robust

Bro012.F.dialogueact203	583.3	596.198	F	PhD	s	+1	1	but i mean from d. c. seventy eight um percent commission rate system i could change the transition probably for the uh the first h. m. m. between that and up to eighteen nine so

Bro012.F.dialogueact214	614.081	614.711	F	PhD	s^aa^m	-1	0	i mean are the really a 
Bro012.B.dialogueact215	614.61	619.63	B	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	i mean are the only difference is you change the south loop transition probably buy a tenth of a percent really a 
Bro012.F.dialogueact216	614.711	614.921	F	PhD	b	-1	0	i mean are the really a 
Bro012.A.dialogueact217	615.387	615.467	A	Professor	b	-1	0	only difference is you 
Bro012.B.dialogueact218	620.18	623.58	B	PhD	s	+1	1	chancellor percent and it causes ten percent difference in the word aerate 
Bro012.A.dialogueact219	622.932	623.922	A	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	chancellor percent difference in the word aerate

Bro012.B.dialogueact222	624.95	625.67	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah from point even tenth person 
Bro012.F.dialogueact220	624.59	625.52	F	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	yeah from point even tenth person 
Bro012.B.dialogueact224	626.94	627.39	B	PhD	s^fa	-1	0	i'm sorry for i'm but we try we try 
Bro012.F.dialogueact223	626.76	628.5	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i'm sorry for i'm from reaching the point want but we try we try went one 
Bro012.B.dialogueact225	627.39	629.07	B	PhD	s	-1	0	sorry for i'm from reaching the point want and then we try went one 
Bro012.F.dialogueact226	628.5	628.61	F	PhD	b	-1	0	from reaching the point want went one 
Bro012.A.dialogueact228	629.57	629.67	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	and then 
Bro012.B.dialogueact229	629.65	631.43	B	PhD	s	+1	1	and then not ten service and one ten 
Bro012.F.dialogueact227	629.213	629.533	F	PhD	b.%	-1	0	and then 
Bro012.A.dialogueact231	631.612	631.912	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	ten

Bro012.B.dialogueact232	632.05	633.93	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	um so from point five 
Bro012.B.dialogueact233	634.31	638.48	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so from point six point five and you get ten percent better 
Bro012.A.dialogueact234	637.849	638.379	A	Professor	b	-1	0	you get ten percent better 
Bro012.B.dialogueact236	639.49	647.0	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i think it's what you basically hypothesized in the last meeting about uh just being very i think you mentioned this in 
Bro012.F.dialogueact235	639.056	639.386	F	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro012.B.dialogueact237	647.0	648.64	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	think you mentioned this in your you know too it's just 
Bro012.B.dialogueact239	648.64	649.82	B	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	your you know too it's just very um 
Bro012.F.dialogueact238	648.408	648.988	F	PhD	b	-1	0	your you know too it's just 
Bro012.B.dialogueact240	650.6	653.18	B	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	you know you get stuck in some local minimum and this 
Bro012.B.dialogueact241	653.59	655.59	B	PhD	s	+1	1	and this thing throws you out of it i guess 
Bro012.F.dialogueact242	653.654	654.104	F	PhD	b	-1	0	and this thing throws you out 
Bro012.A.dialogueact243	656.15	660.73	A	Professor	qw	+1	1	well what's what're according to the rules what what are we supposed to do about the transition probably supposed 
Bro012.A.dialogueact244	660.73	662.49	A	Professor	qr	-1	0	probably supposed to be before five point six i think you're not allowed to 
Bro012.B.dialogueact245	662.31	663.1	B	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	six i think you're not allowed to yeah it's supposed 
Bro012.B.dialogueact246	663.27	663.62	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah it's supposed 
Bro012.B.dialogueact247	663.76	666.2	B	PhD	s^na	+1	1	it's supposed to point six yeah it's supposed to be point six so 
Bro012.F.dialogueact248	663.789	664.039	F	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah it's supposed to be point six 
Bro012.A.dialogueact249	665.58	667.06	A	Professor	s^bu^m	-1	0	it's supposed to point six so but 
Bro012.B.dialogueact250	666.75	667.06	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	supposed to point six but 
Bro012.B.dialogueact251	667.92	669.66	B	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	but changing into point five i think is 
Bro012.B.dialogueact252	670.33	671.89	B	PhD	s	+1	1	which gives you much better results but 
Bro012.B.dialogueact253	671.89	673.49	B	PhD	s	+1	1	better results but that's not allowed 
Bro012.A.dialogueact254	673.63	674.13	A	Professor	s^bk^m	-1	0	not allowed

Bro012.F.dialogueact257	675.26	680.26	F	PhD	fg|s^aap^df	+1	1	yeah but even if you use point five i'm not sure it's too always gives you the better results on other tests 
Bro012.B.dialogueact259	680.43	680.64	B	PhD	s^aa^rt	-1	0	on other tests 
Bro012.F.dialogueact258	680.26	681.53	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	right we on other tests that's so 
Bro012.B.dialogueact260	681.84	684.3	B	PhD	fg|s^bu	+1	1	right we only tested it on the the media mismatch right you that's so and on their training set i mean 
Bro012.F.dialogueact261	682.2	683.39	F	PhD	s	-1	0	only tested it on the the media mismatch and on their training set i mean 
Bro012.B.dialogueact262	684.3	684.54	B	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right you 
Bro012.B.dialogueact264	684.98	687.02	B	PhD	qy^bu^d.%--	-1	0	right you said on the other cases you didn't notice i think yeah i think 
Bro012.F.dialogueact263	684.752	685.022	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right you said on the other cases 
Bro012.F.dialogueact265	685.949	686.999	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	said on the other cases you didn't notice i think 
Bro012.F.dialogueact266	686.999	687.259	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	you didn't notice i think yeah i think 
Bro012.F.dialogueact267	687.719	688.759	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah i think the reason he's yeah 
Bro012.F.dialogueact268	688.759	690.059	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	the reason he's yeah i and it 
Bro012.F.dialogueact269	691.429	699.729	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	question i mean i think also the fact that the mismatch he's trained only um this far microphone 
Bro012.F.dialogueact270	701.92	707.36	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but in sort of makes my skate everything is um using the far microphone training and testing 
Bro012.F.dialogueact271	708.301	711.971	F	PhD	s	-1	0	whereas forth uh i mean you snatch training is down cause microphone so 
Bro012.F.dialogueact272	711.971	714.57	F	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	cause microphone so it's can speech basically 
Bro012.F.dialogueact273	715.26	718.08	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so you don't have this program if look i mean movie probably and for 
Bro012.F.dialogueact274	718.624	723.384	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and for the wedding match it's it makes us cause microphone in houston

Bro012.F.dialogueact278	725.911	728.941	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i did notice something i think the mismatch is the more difficult for the training 
Bro012.B.dialogueact279	729.93	736.33	B	PhD	s	+1	1	somebody he was morgan suggested at the last meeting that i actually count to see how many parameters and how many frames and

Bro012.B.dialogueact294	759.937	763.667	B	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	yeah i did one quick experiments to make sure i had everything worked out and i just 
Bro012.B.dialogueact295	763.667	767.512	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	worked out and i just uh for the for most of the um 
Bro012.B.dialogueact296	768.452	773.952	B	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	for for the digit models they and that that's three mixtures per state 
Bro012.B.dialogueact297	774.374	777.364	B	PhD	s	+1	1	and so i just did a quick fix i changed it so that went to four and 
Bro012.B.dialogueact298	777.727	785.87	B	PhD	s	+1	1	and um it it it didn't have or any significant effect as the media mismatch in high mismatch cases and i had 
Bro012.B.dialogueact299	785.87	788.64	B	PhD	s	-1	0	high mismatch cases and i had was just barely significant for the well match better 
Bro012.B.dialogueact300	788.64	789.0	B	PhD	s	-1	0	the well match better uh so time 
Bro012.B.dialogueact301	789.488	795.244	B	PhD	s	+1	1	yeah because it's forty uh so time it's going to run that again but um with many more uh mixtures per state 
Bro012.A.dialogueact302	795.22	797.71	A	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	yeah because it's forty five i mean you could you could have uh 
Bro012.A.dialogueact303	797.71	797.97	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	could have uh 
Bro012.A.dialogueact304	799.774	803.394	A	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	yeah he's only four times as many parameters and i think also 
Bro012.B.dialogueact305	801.818	802.258	B	PhD	b	-1	0	many parameters 
Bro012.B.dialogueact306	803.31	811.066	B	PhD	s^rt.%--	-1	0	and i think also just seeing what we saw uh in terms of the expected duration of the silence model when we did the speaking 
Bro012.B.dialogueact307	811.066	812.926	B	PhD	s^rt.%--	-1	0	when we did the speaking of self loop 
Bro012.B.dialogueact309	813.446	816.116	B	PhD	s	-1	0	the silence model expected ration was really different and so in the case where 
Bro012.F.dialogueact308	813.06	813.23	F	PhD	b	-1	0	the silence 
Bro012.B.dialogueact310	816.116	822.656	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and so in the case where um it had a better score the silence model expected is much longer it was 
Bro012.F.dialogueact311	816.365	816.665	F	PhD	b	-1	0	and so in the case where 
Bro012.B.dialogueact312	822.656	824.556	B	PhD	s	-1	0	longer it was like it was a better match i think 
Bro012.B.dialogueact313	824.556	829.496	B	PhD	s	-1	0	a better match i think you know if we make a better silence model i think that will help a lot too 
Bro012.B.dialogueact314	830.206	831.656	B	PhD	s	-1	0	um a lot of these cases 
Bro012.B.dialogueact315	832.146	832.566	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro012.B.dialogueact316	833.309	848.396	B	PhD	s	+1	1	but one one thing i i wanted to check out before i increased the um number mixtures per state what is uh in there do you training script they do an initial set of three rearrested the nations and 
Bro012.B.dialogueact317	848.857	851.587	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and then they build the silence model and then 
Bro012.B.dialogueact318	851.807	854.977	B	PhD	s	+1	1	model and then they do seven iterations then they add mixtures they 
Bro012.B.dialogueact319	854.977	856.927	B	PhD	s	+1	1	add mixtures they do another seven then they had mixers 
Bro012.B.dialogueact320	857.258	858.968	B	PhD	s	+1	1	and they do a final set a seven and a quit 
Bro012.B.dialogueact321	859.344	860.954	B	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	seven seems like a lot to me and 
Bro012.B.dialogueact322	860.954	864.194	B	PhD	s^df	+1	1	a lot to me and it also makes the experiments go take a really long time i mean to do 
Bro012.B.dialogueact323	864.604	868.584	B	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean to do one turnaround of the well matched case takes like a day 
Bro012.A.dialogueact324	865.369	865.939	A	Professor	b	-1	0	one turnaround 
Bro012.A.dialogueact325	869.0	869.57	A	Professor	b	-1	0	and so 
Bro012.B.dialogueact326	869.24	876.53	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and so you know in trying to run these experiments i notice you know it's difficult to find machines you know compute to run on and so one 
Bro012.B.dialogueact327	876.53	880.765	B	PhD	s	+1	1	run on and so one of the things i did was i compiled h. t. k. for the linux machines because 
Bro012.A.dialogueact328	880.262	880.772	A	Professor	b	-1	0	machines because 
Bro012.B.dialogueact329	880.875	884.345	B	PhD	s	+1	1	machines because we have this one for my b. and it's got like five processors in it 
Bro012.A.dialogueact330	884.69	884.93	A	Professor	b	-1	0	in it 
Bro012.B.dialogueact331	885.025	894.437	B	PhD	s	+1	1	and so now i'm you can run stuff on that and that really helps a lot because now we've got you know extra machines that we can use for compute and mm 
Bro012.B.dialogueact333	894.757	900.617	B	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	and if i do running extra right now where i'm changing the number of iterations from seven to three to see mm 
Bro012.D.dialogueact332	894.73	895.01	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and if i do running mm 
Bro012.A.dialogueact334	899.3	899.64	A	Professor	b	-1	0	from seven 
Bro012.B.dialogueact335	900.687	903.117	B	PhD	s	+1	1	to three to see how it affects the baseline system and so 
Bro012.B.dialogueact336	903.699	909.399	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	and so if we can get away with just doing three we can do many more experiment's more quickly and if 
Bro012.B.dialogueact337	909.858	917.269	B	PhD	s^df	+1	1	and if it's not uh a huge difference from running with seven iterations um you know we should be able to get a lot more experiments done 
Bro012.F.dialogueact338	914.085	914.555	F	PhD	b	-1	0	um 
Bro012.B.dialogueact339	918.158	921.238	B	PhD	s	+1	1	so oh you know what happens with that but if we can 
Bro012.B.dialogueact340	921.238	930.018	B	PhD	s	-1	0	but if we can you know run all of these back ins with many fewer iterations and on linux boxes we should be able to get a lot more experimenting down 
Bro012.A.dialogueact341	930.357	930.857	A	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro012.B.dialogueact342	931.58	931.92	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro012.B.dialogueact343	932.89	938.48	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so i wanted to experiment with cutting down the number of iterations before i increased the number of counseling 
Bro012.A.dialogueact344	937.187	937.277	A	Professor	b	-1	0	the number of 
Bro012.A.dialogueact345	937.277	937.407	A	Professor	s^fa	-1	0	the number of 
Bro012.A.dialogueact346	941.574	944.254	A	Professor	qw.%--	-1	0	so um how is it going on me 
Bro012.F.dialogueact347	941.622	942.312	F	PhD	fg.%	-1	0	so um how 
Bro012.A.dialogueact348	945.87	947.49	A	Professor	s	-1	0	so you you did some things that didn't 
Bro012.A.dialogueact349	947.49	952.03	A	Professor	s	-1	0	that didn't improve things in a way to convince too it substantially improved anything but 
Bro012.F.dialogueact350	951.477	951.577	F	PhD	b.%	-1	0	improved anything 
Bro012.A.dialogueact351	952.696	955.816	A	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	but they're not making things worse and we have reduce latency right 
Bro012.A.dialogueact352	955.816	956.116	A	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	reduce latency right 
Bro012.F.dialogueact353	957.453	957.683	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah but 
Bro012.F.dialogueact354	957.863	964.713	F	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	yeah but actually um actually seems to do what he the big twirls for the when much gays 
Bro012.F.dialogueact355	965.751	967.881	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and we just no taste that 
Bro012.F.dialogueact356	968.391	972.461	F	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	i carried away the science course scores computed it's quite funny it's not the mean 
Bro012.F.dialogueact357	972.461	975.521	F	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	funny it's not the mean of word ever rate it's not the way 
Bro012.F.dialogueact358	975.521	977.431	F	PhD	s	+1	1	rate it's not the way can mean if we're ever rate it's so we can 
Bro012.F.dialogueact359	977.431	979.761	F	PhD	s	+1	1	rate it's so we can mean off improvements 
Bro012.A.dialogueact360	980.74	981.4	A	Professor	b	-1	0	so which 
Bro012.F.dialogueact361	981.464	981.814	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	so which 
Bro012.F.dialogueact362	981.974	986.014	F	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	so which means that actually do weights on the wedding match 
Bro012.F.dialogueact363	987.384	1001.57	F	PhD	s	+1	1	but i what what what happened is that if you have a small improvement uh small it's on the web much gays you could have uh you would you through ones and uh being proven on compared to the reference because the reference 
Bro012.F.dialogueact364	1001.57	1007.61	F	PhD	s	+1	1	reference because the reference systems he's quite good for my my much gays also 
Bro012.B.dialogueact365	1008.09	1012.64	B	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	so it waits the improve manuel match case really heavily compared to the improvement on the other cases no but 
Bro012.F.dialogueact366	1012.55	1015.14	F	PhD	s^ar|s	-1	0	the other cases no but it's a waking up two of the improvement nothing that ever 
Bro012.F.dialogueact367	1015.14	1016.5	F	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah nothing that ever rates 
Bro012.B.dialogueact368	1016.37	1016.59	B	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah rates 
Bro012.B.dialogueact369	1017.55	1019.78	B	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	and it's hard to improve on the on the best case because it's 
Bro012.B.dialogueact370	1019.78	1020.92	B	PhD	s	-1	0	the best case because it's already so good 
Bro012.B.dialogueact371	1021.13	1021.4	B	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right 
Bro012.F.dialogueact372	1022.12	1027.35	F	PhD	s^bk|s^aap^rt	-1	0	yeah but what i mean east that you can is a huge improvement on the h. h. and gain 
Bro012.F.dialogueact373	1028.42	1031.57	F	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	uh like five percent uh absolute 
Bro012.F.dialogueact374	1033.25	1036.66	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and been in that aspect of the finest gore almost 
Bro012.F.dialogueact375	1037.27	1045.4	F	PhD	s^df^rt	-1	0	uh they said almost nothing to find this girl because she improvement because the improvement uh read i tasted it debated ninety smoltz 
Bro012.A.dialogueact377	1047.83	1052.25	A	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	+1	1	so they do improvement in terms of uh accuracy rather than worker right 
Bro012.F.dialogueact376	1047.35	1048.12	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	so they do improvement in 
Bro012.F.dialogueact378	1054.24	1055.6	F	PhD	s^m.%--	-1	0	uh improvement no 
Bro012.A.dialogueact380	1055.91	1056.15	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	no it's compared to the whatever 
Bro012.F.dialogueact379	1055.88	1059.07	F	PhD	s^ar|s	+1	1	okay no it's compared to the whatever it's improvements on the whatever right yeah sorry 
Bro012.A.dialogueact383	1059.51	1059.83	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay yeah sorry 
Bro012.F.dialogueact381	1059.07	1059.23	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	okay yeah sorry 
Bro012.F.dialogueact382	1059.45	1059.72	F	PhD	s^fa	-1	0	okay yeah sorry 
Bro012.A.dialogueact384	1060.26	1069.82	A	Professor	s^bu	+1	1	so if you have uh ten percent there and you get five percent absolutes uh improvement then that's fifty percent 
Bro012.F.dialogueact385	1070.55	1071.04	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	okay 
Bro012.A.dialogueact386	1071.81	1086.73	A	Professor	s^bk|s^bs	+1	1	okay so what you're saying then is that if it's something that has a small word error rate then uh a even a relatively small improvement on it an absolute terms showbiz quite quite large and is that 
Bro012.F.dialogueact387	1078.06	1078.55	F	PhD	b	-1	0	then uh 
Bro012.A.dialogueact388	1086.88	1087.54	A	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	and is that what you're saying yes 
Bro012.F.dialogueact389	1086.97	1087.18	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and is that what you're saying yes 
Bro012.A.dialogueact390	1087.64	1087.93	A	Professor	s^bk^m	-1	0	what you're saying yes 
Bro012.F.dialogueact391	1087.72	1087.89	F	PhD	b	-1	0	what you're saying yes 
Bro012.A.dialogueact392	1088.34	1088.65	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay but yeah 
Bro012.A.dialogueact393	1088.65	1091.73	A	Professor	s	+1	1	okay but yeah that's that's that's the notion of relative improvement yeah

Bro012.F.dialogueact396	1095.09	1103.57	F	PhD	fg|s^arp^df	-1	0	but when you think about the way thing we just point five point three point two it's an absolute i don't read it to figures not 
Bro012.A.dialogueact398	1103.9	1104.02	A	Professor	b	-1	0	not so when we look at 
Bro012.F.dialogueact397	1103.78	1103.99	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	not 
Bro012.A.dialogueact400	1104.52	1104.72	A	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	so when we look at 
Bro012.F.dialogueact399	1104.4	1106.08	F	PhD	s^rt.%--	-1	0	no that's so when we look at these error rate 
Bro012.A.dialogueact401	1106.71	1106.89	A	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	no that's 
Bro012.A.dialogueact403	1106.89	1112.76	A	Professor	s^ba	+1	1	no that's why i've been saying we should be looking at where they're right uh and not not a and actors it's 
Bro012.F.dialogueact402	1106.74	1107.39	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	no that's why i've been saying

Bro012.A.dialogueact417	1125.93	1130.75	A	Professor	s^arp^df	+1	1	yeah but it but when you look at the numbers are sense of the relative size of things is quite different because see i mean oh i see yeah

Bro012.B.dialogueact419	1130.11	1130.33	B	PhD	b	-1	0	is quite different yeah 
Bro012.A.dialogueact420	1131.18	1134.42	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	if you had ninety percent uh correct and five percent five over ninety 
Bro012.A.dialogueact421	1134.42	1136.68	A	Professor	s	-1	0	percent five over ninety does look like it's a big difference but

Bro012.B.dialogueact521	1306.93	1307.22	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	the small i mean i think we can be completely 
Bro012.F.dialogueact522	1307.24	1309.22	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i think we can be completely fooled by this thing but 
Bro012.F.dialogueact523	1309.22	1309.37	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	thing but

Bro012.A.dialogueact525	1313.73	1314.5	A	Professor	fg|s^am	-1	0	well yeah so there is first 
Bro012.F.dialogueact526	1314.13	1315.54	F	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	yeah so there is first these thing and then the 
Bro012.F.dialogueact527	1315.54	1316.68	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	these thing and then the uh yeah i 
Bro012.F.dialogueact528	1316.75	1322.05	F	PhD	fh|s^rt	-1	0	uh yeah i computed um like the confidence level on the different that's that's and 
Bro012.F.dialogueact529	1322.87	1331.59	F	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	and for the wedding match they are around um one six uh percent 
Bro012.F.dialogueact530	1332.65	1336.88	F	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	for of me snatched they are on like the two one point five percent 
Bro012.F.dialogueact531	1337.35	1340.4	F	PhD	s	-1	0	for the women uh it h. and there are so wrong one point five 
Bro012.A.dialogueact532	1341.12	1346.1	A	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	but okay say the these these degradation so we're talking about we're on the well match case uh 
Bro012.F.dialogueact533	1342.23	1342.49	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	these these degradation 
Bro012.A.dialogueact535	1346.84	1351.35	A	Professor	qy	+1	1	uh did it this the new filter make things uh better or worse for the other case 
Bro012.F.dialogueact534	1346.4	1346.65	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	uh 
Bro012.F.dialogueact536	1347.31	1347.49	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	did it this the new filter 
Bro012.F.dialogueact537	1352.3	1354.7	F	PhD	s	-1	0	uh about the same and doesn't 
Bro012.F.dialogueact538	1354.7	1355.26	F	PhD	s	-1	0	about the same and doesn't 
Bro012.F.dialogueact539	1355.36	1355.46	F	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro012.A.dialogueact540	1356.6	1358.41	A	Professor	s^bu^m	+1	1	there's never does get a little better or something 
Bro012.F.dialogueact541	1358.04	1358.25	F	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	something 
Bro012.A.dialogueact542	1358.64	1358.83	A	Professor	s^bk^m	-1	0	something 
Bro012.A.dialogueact543	1359.6	1372.58	A	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	okay so um i guess the argument on my neck is that yeah if you look at one of these cases and you tickle something it changes then uh uh you're not quite sure what to make of it but when you look 
Bro012.A.dialogueact544	1372.58	1375.72	A	Professor	%--	-1	0	to make of it but when you look across a bunch of these and there's some some pattern 
Bro012.A.dialogueact545	1376.73	1377.35	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro012.A.dialogueact546	1378.18	1391.19	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and so he he hears all the if if in all these different cases it never gets better and there's significant number of cases where it gets worse than you probably many things so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact547	1391.91	1401.67	A	Professor	s	-1	0	so um meet the very least that would be a reasonable prediction of what what happened with with a different tests at the turn taking things 
Bro012.A.dialogueact548	1402.6	1406.09	A	Professor	qo^d	-1	0	so i guess the question is if you can do better than this know we can 
Bro012.A.dialogueact549	1406.22	1412.03	A	Professor	s	-1	0	know we can approximate the old numbers well still keeping the latency down

Bro012.A.dialogueact642	1602.16	1604.29	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but i'm meeting digits maybe is yes 
Bro012.A.dialogueact643	1604.69	1604.96	A	Professor	s^am	-1	0	is yes 
Bro012.F.dialogueact644	1604.79	1604.94	F	PhD	b	-1	0	is yes 
Bro012.A.dialogueact646	1605.32	1605.62	A	Professor	s^am	-1	0	it could be for the first 
Bro012.F.dialogueact645	1604.94	1606.43	F	PhD	s	-1	0	is yes it could be for the first time

Bro012.A.dialogueact649	1608.78	1613.47	A	Professor	fg|s	+1	1	yeah so i mean i i think that you could certainly start looking at at the issue uh 
Bro012.A.dialogueact650	1613.74	1624.14	A	Professor	fh|s.%--	+1	1	uh but but uh i think it's probably on some from what stuff and saying it's it's unlikely to get sort of active participation two cents to talk to the well i could 
Bro012.B.dialogueact651	1624.7	1625.8	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	well i could at least 
Bro012.B.dialogueact652	1626.97	1628.2	B	PhD	s	-1	0	well i'm going to be out next week but i could 
Bro012.B.dialogueact653	1628.2	1633.75	B	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	but i could tried to look into like this uh c. b. s. over the web that 
Bro012.B.dialogueact654	1633.88	1641.58	B	PhD	s^df	+1	1	over the web that seems to be very popular way of people distributing changes and over you know multiple sites and things so maybe 
Bro012.A.dialogueact655	1639.69	1640.5	A	Professor	b	-1	0	and over you know multiple sites 
Bro012.B.dialogueact656	1641.58	1649.76	B	PhD	s	+1	1	and things so maybe i can figure out how to do that easily and then pass the information on everybody so that it's you know is easy to do as possible and 
Bro012.B.dialogueact657	1649.76	1653.06	B	PhD	s^df	+1	1	as possible and and people don't want to interfere with their regular work and maybe that would be good 
Bro012.B.dialogueact658	1653.06	1654.0	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and maybe that would be good 
Bro012.B.dialogueact659	1656.03	1658.07	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and i think we could use it for other things around here too so 
Bro012.B.dialogueact660	1658.07	1658.37	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact661	1661.95	1662.15	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro012.A.dialogueact675	1678.61	1681.64	A	Professor	s	+1	1	today the other thing actually is is this talk this way for me and 
Bro012.A.dialogueact676	1681.64	1690.05	A	Professor	s^cs	+1	2	way for me and i can talk a little bit some point but but the better uh demonstration of the saxon reverberations for where page so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact677	1690.32	1690.48	A	Professor	%--	-1	0	so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact678	1690.48	1692.89	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bro012.A.dialogueact679	1692.89	1694.45	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	um actually that

Bro012.A.dialogueact681	1697.23	1708.38	A	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	made a good good audio demonstration because when you play that clip theses the really obvious difference is that you can hear two voices and in the second one and down here maybe we could just like talking 
Bro012.B.dialogueact682	1707.32	1709.51	B	PhD	s^cs^j	-1	0	the second one and down here yeah maybe we could just like talking to uh 
Bro012.A.dialogueact683	1709.78	1709.88	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah to uh 
Bro012.B.dialogueact684	1712.0	1712.87	B	PhD	s^j	-1	0	some good river 
Bro012.A.dialogueact685	1714.02	1715.75	A	Professor	s^ar^bd|s^ba	-1	0	i mean it not it sounds pretty river but i mean 
Bro012.A.dialogueact686	1715.75	1720.34	A	Professor	s	+1	2	pretty river but i mean you can't when you play back in the room with a you know a big room nobody can hear that difference really they hear that it's lower yeah 
Bro012.C.dialogueact687	1718.74	1719.04	C	Grad	b	-1	0	big room nobody can hear that difference yeah 
Bro012.A.dialogueact689	1720.34	1723.15	A	Professor	s	-1	0	really they hear that it's lower aptitude to hear the second voice um 
Bro012.C.dialogueact688	1720.18	1720.67	C	Grad	b	-1	0	really they hear that it's lower 
Bro012.A.dialogueact690	1723.33	1724.96	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	um but uh that 
Bro012.A.dialogueact691	1725.02	1727.06	A	Professor	s	-1	0	actually that makes for a perfectly good demo because it's real obvious 
Bro012.A.dialogueact692	1727.06	1729.38	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because it's real obvious thing that you hear two voices yeah but not reverberations 
Bro012.B.dialogueact693	1728.23	1729.24	B	PhD	s^2^aap	-1	0	thing that you hear two voices yeah but not reverberations 
Bro012.A.dialogueact694	1729.59	1729.83	A	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bro012.C.dialogueact695	1730.03	1730.69	C	Grad	s	-1	0	but that 
Bro012.A.dialogueact696	1730.53	1731.49	A	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	but that that's okay but for the 
Bro012.A.dialogueact697	1731.49	1737.01	A	Professor	s^co	+1	1	that's okay but for the the visual just you know i'd like to have uh uh you know the specter gram again because your your yeah 
Bro012.C.dialogueact698	1733.57	1733.98	C	Grad	b	-1	0	just you know i'd like to have yeah 
Bro012.A.dialogueact699	1737.01	1743.42	A	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	because your your your visual uh abilities as a human being are so good you can pick out you know you 
Bro012.A.dialogueact700	1743.52	1749.0	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	out you know you look at the good when you look at the crew the screwed up on and and you can see the features in it that trying to i noticed that in the pictures i think you know i 
Bro012.B.dialogueact701	1748.19	1749.27	B	PhD	s^na	-1	0	it that trying to i noticed that in the pictures i think you know i 
Bro012.A.dialogueact702	1749.19	1749.29	A	Professor	b	-1	0	i think you know i 
Bro012.B.dialogueact703	1749.27	1750.35	B	PhD	s.%--:s.%--	-1	0	i think you know i my initial thought 
Bro012.B.dialogueact704	1750.35	1752.32	B	PhD	s:s^ba	-1	0	right my initial thought was this is not too bad 
Bro012.A.dialogueact705	1752.62	1752.9	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	right 
Bro012.A.dialogueact706	1753.46	1757.6	A	Professor	s:s	-1	0	you have to if you look at closely see well here's a place where this one has a big foreman it uh 
Bro012.A.dialogueact707	1757.6	1762.19	A	Professor	fh|s^rt	-1	0	it uh the informant major major form it's here are moving quite a bit and then you look and the 
Bro012.A.dialogueact708	1762.19	1764.83	A	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	and then you look and the other one and they don't practically five 
Bro012.B.dialogueact709	1765.13	1765.78	B	PhD	b	-1	0	so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact710	1765.93	1771.74	A	Professor	s:s	-1	0	so i mean you could that's why i was thinking is section like that you could take a look at look at this that part of the specter granny say oh yeah this 
Bro012.A.dialogueact711	1771.74	1773.69	A	Professor	s:s	-1	0	say oh yeah this this really sort of quite a bit yeah the main 
Bro012.B.dialogueact712	1773.4	1773.85	B	PhD	b	-1	0	of quite a bit yeah the main 
Bro012.B.dialogueact713	1773.9	1777.53	B	PhD	s	-1	0	of quite a bit yeah the main thing that struck me in looking at the specter grams was the difference in the high frequencies hook like 
Bro012.B.dialogueact714	1777.53	1782.1	B	PhD	s	-1	0	right hook like for the one i was farther wait you know really everything was anyway waited 
Bro012.A.dialogueact716	1782.4	1782.7	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	right 
Bro012.B.dialogueact715	1782.1	1782.23	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	right 
Bro012.B.dialogueact717	1783.39	1785.67	B	PhD	s	-1	0	that was the main visual thing that i notice 
Bro012.A.dialogueact718	1785.92	1786.25	A	Professor	b	-1	0	that i notice 
Bro012.A.dialogueact719	1787.12	1788.2	A	Professor	%--	-1	0	but it's it's uh so yeah 
Bro012.A.dialogueact720	1788.2	1788.44	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh so yeah 
Bro012.A.dialogueact721	1788.44	1788.78	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh so yeah 
Bro012.A.dialogueact722	1788.87	1789.02	A	Professor	fg	-1	0	uh so yeah so they're clearly are structural 
Bro012.A.dialogueact723	1789.02	1790.6	A	Professor	s	-1	0	so they're clearly are structural effect since you're getting 
Bro012.A.dialogueact724	1790.6	1796.32	A	Professor	s	-1	0	effect since you're getting all this indirect energy than a lot of it does have have uh reduced high frequencies but um 
Bro012.A.dialogueact725	1796.32	1803.93	A	Professor	s	-1	0	but um yeah the thing is the temple courses of things really are changed in and uh we want to show that in some obvious way reason 
Bro012.A.dialogueact726	1803.93	1808.53	A	Professor	s	-1	0	some obvious way reason i put the way forms in there was because uh they they do look quite different 
Bro012.A.dialogueact727	1809.05	1810.91	A	Professor	s:s^ba	-1	0	uh and so i oh this is good but 
Bro012.A.dialogueact728	1810.91	1812.19	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i oh this is good but i i just 
Bro012.A.dialogueact729	1812.54	1812.9	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro012.A.dialogueact730	1813.91	1817.21	A	Professor	s	-1	0	after after they're put in there i didn't really look at them anymore just 
Bro012.A.dialogueact731	1817.21	1818.97	A	Professor	s	-1	0	just are different so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact732	1818.97	1823.26	A	Professor	s	-1	0	are different so want something that has a has a more interesting explanation for why the different 
Bro012.A.dialogueact733	1825.42	1826.02	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	and so maybe we can just substitute 
Bro012.C.dialogueact734	1825.8	1825.83	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	and so 
Bro012.C.dialogueact735	1825.99	1828.74	C	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	and so maybe we can just substitute one of these way farms and 
Bro012.C.dialogueact736	1828.74	1833.74	C	Grad	s	-1	0	way farms and um and do some kind of zoom in on this doctor come on an interesting area 
Bro012.A.dialogueact737	1834.16	1834.74	A	Professor	s^am	-1	0	something like that yeah 
Bro012.A.dialogueact738	1834.74	1834.96	A	Professor	fg	-1	0	something like that yeah 
Bro012.C.dialogueact739	1834.78	1835.05	C	Grad	b	-1	0	something like that yeah the other thing we had 
Bro012.A.dialogueact740	1835.28	1844.37	A	Professor	s	+1	1	the other thing we had in there that i didn't like was that um the most obvious characteristic of the difference uh when they listen to it is that there's a second voice and 
Bro012.A.dialogueact741	1844.96	1851.54	A	Professor	s	+1	1	and uh the the the the uh the cuts that we have there actually don't correspond to the full away form it's just the 
Bro012.A.dialogueact742	1851.54	1852.43	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	form it's just the first i think there's something 
Bro012.A.dialogueact743	1852.43	1855.15	A	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	first i think there's something where he was having some trouble getting so much and they're i i forget the 
Bro012.A.dialogueact744	1855.15	1855.31	A	Professor	%--	-1	0	they're i i forget the 
Bro012.A.dialogueact745	1855.42	1856.91	A	Professor	s^no	-1	0	they're i i forget the reason behind it but 
Bro012.A.dialogueact746	1856.91	1862.76	A	Professor	s	+1	1	reason behind it but it it's um it's the first six seconds or something of it and it's 
Bro012.A.dialogueact747	1862.76	1867.31	A	Professor	s	+1	1	of it and it's in the seven thirty second or something where the second voice comes and so we we would like 
Bro012.A.dialogueact748	1867.31	1871.28	A	Professor	s	+1	1	and so we we would like to actually see voice coming into since 
Bro012.A.dialogueact750	1871.84	1874.28	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	since it's most obvious thing when you listen to it 
Bro012.C.dialogueact749	1871.68	1871.98	C	Grad	b	-1	0	since 
Bro012.A.dialogueact751	1880.45	1880.79	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro012.F.dialogueact755	1890.49	1895.66	F	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah i brought some figures here whether i 
Bro012.F.dialogueact756	1895.66	1898.3	F	PhD	s	+1	1	figures here whether i that we started to work on specter subtraction 
Bro012.F.dialogueact757	1898.3	1904.15	F	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	the preliminary results where very bad so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact759	1904.91	1905.55	A	Professor	b	-1	0	so the things that we did 
Bro012.F.dialogueact758	1904.85	1914.15	F	PhD	s	+1	1	so the things that we did it just do i'd stick inspection before uh process you can think that 
Bro012.F.dialogueact760	1915.8	1918.5	F	PhD	s^ba	+1	1	it's uh it's uh a lot 
Bro012.A.dialogueact761	1919.04	1919.37	A	Professor	b	-1	0	and so we 
Bro012.F.dialogueact762	1919.68	1922.94	F	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	and so we started to look at that um things like this 
Bro012.F.dialogueact763	1922.94	1923.6	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	things like this is

Bro012.F.dialogueact797	1986.8	1992.37	F	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	uh them when we mean meaner my education looks like the second figure 
Bro012.F.dialogueact798	1995.16	1995.68	F	PhD	s	-1	0	it just not 
Bro012.F.dialogueact799	1997.65	1998.38	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	which is good well

Bro012.F.dialogueact805	2019.67	2024.69	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	this is still but also what happens on the noisy portion is that the parents something is

Bro012.F.dialogueact808	2026.99	2028.22	F	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	easier can i ask yeah just says see hero 
Bro012.B.dialogueact810	2028.39	2031.71	B	PhD	qw	-1	0	can i ask them what this variance normalization do what 
Bro012.B.dialogueact811	2032.01	2033.26	B	PhD	qw^e^rt	-1	0	is the effect of that 
Bro012.A.dialogueact812	2034.2	2035.42	A	Professor	s^j	-1	0	unless it's the parents so it

Bro012.F.dialogueact815	2036.42	2038.82	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean yeah it's normal nice the the stuff that deviation so 
Bro012.B.dialogueact818	2038.9	2039.56	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah no that deviation so it you 
Bro012.F.dialogueact817	2038.82	2039.28	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	yeah no that deviation so it you 
Bro012.B.dialogueact820	2039.91	2040.61	B	PhD	s^ar|s	-1	0	no i understand that but i mean it you you get 
Bro012.F.dialogueact819	2039.85	2042.97	F	PhD	s	-1	0	no i understand that but i mean it you you get an estimate of the standard deviation 
Bro012.B.dialogueact821	2040.61	2041.05	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	i understand that but i mean you get an estimate of the standard 
Bro012.F.dialogueact822	2043.15	2043.67	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	no that's uh 
Bro012.B.dialogueact824	2043.99	2044.23	B	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	no no i understand what that's uh 
Bro012.F.dialogueact823	2043.67	2044.3	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	no no i understand what that's uh 
Bro012.B.dialogueact825	2044.23	2045.23	B	PhD	s	-1	0	no i understand what it is but i mean what is it 
Bro012.B.dialogueact826	2045.23	2046.95	B	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	it is but i mean what is it what's what is uh 
Bro012.F.dialogueact827	2045.46	2045.97	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	it is but i mean what is it 
Bro012.B.dialogueact828	2046.95	2047.37	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	that's the rationale what's what is uh 
Bro012.A.dialogueact829	2047.56	2048.4	A	Professor	qw^2^bu^rt	-1	0	that's the rationale yeah yeah 
Bro012.B.dialogueact830	2048.15	2048.23	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	yeah yeah 
Bro012.B.dialogueact831	2048.23	2049.06	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah yeah why 
Bro012.B.dialogueact832	2049.98	2051.02	B	PhD	qw	-1	0	well i mean why why do it 
Bro012.F.dialogueact833	2050.49	2051.0	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	well i mean why do it 
Bro012.A.dialogueact834	2051.59	2059.38	A	Professor	s	-1	0	well i mean because everything uh if you have a system based tango scenes everything is based on means in variance is 
Bro012.B.dialogueact835	2059.31	2059.62	B	PhD	b	-1	0	is 
Bro012.A.dialogueact836	2060.05	2062.96	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so if there's an overall reason you 
Bro012.A.dialogueact837	2063.05	2066.35	A	Professor	s	-1	0	know it's like um if you're doing uh image processing and 
Bro012.A.dialogueact838	2066.88	2071.06	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and some of the pictures you're looking at uh there was a lot of light uh 
Bro012.A.dialogueact839	2071.88	2074.1	A	Professor	s	-1	0	uh and and some there was low light you know you'd want to 
Bro012.B.dialogueact840	2072.32	2072.74	B	PhD	b	-1	0	and and some 
Bro012.A.dialogueact841	2074.17	2077.19	A	Professor	s	-1	0	you know you'd want to adjust to that nordic compare things and the very 
Bro012.B.dialogueact842	2074.23	2074.6	B	PhD	b	-1	0	you know you'd want to 
Bro012.A.dialogueact843	2077.69	2079.67	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and the very it's just sort of like the next moment you know 
Bro012.A.dialogueact844	2079.76	2080.01	A	Professor	s^f	-1	0	moment you know so uh 
Bro012.A.dialogueact845	2080.01	2092.64	A	Professor	qo	-1	0	so uh what if um one set of pictures was taken uh so that throughout the course it was one to daylight and night um ten times another time 
Bro012.A.dialogueact846	2092.64	2093.45	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	times another time with i mean it 
Bro012.A.dialogueact847	2093.45	2096.47	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	with i mean it is you know how how much how much very hurt no i guess oh okay 
Bro012.B.dialogueact848	2094.68	2095.82	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	is you know how how much how much oh okay 
Bro012.A.dialogueact849	2096.47	2096.84	A	Professor	s^bsc	-1	0	very hurt no i guess 
Bro012.A.dialogueact850	2096.84	2100.88	A	Professor	qo	-1	0	very hurt no i guess better example would be how much of the light was coming in from outside rather 
Bro012.A.dialogueact851	2100.88	2102.2	A	Professor	s	-1	0	in from outside rather than artificial light so food a lot 
Bro012.A.dialogueact852	2102.2	2108.01	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so food a lot if more was coming in from outside than to be the bigger effect of the of the of the change in so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact853	2108.47	2115.74	A	Professor	s	-1	0	so every mean every all of the the parameters that you have especially the variance is are going to be affected by the overall variance oh okay 
Bro012.B.dialogueact854	2110.77	2111.82	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	every all of the the parameters oh okay 
Bro012.B.dialogueact855	2116.21	2116.61	B	PhD	b	-1	0	and uhhuh 
Bro012.A.dialogueact856	2116.97	2121.06	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and some principle you your move that source then you know you can uhhuh i see okay so would the major 
Bro012.B.dialogueact857	2117.23	2118.77	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	some principle you i see okay 
Bro012.B.dialogueact858	2121.43	2125.82	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so would the major effect is that you're going to get is five normalized in the means 
Bro012.A.dialogueact860	2126.57	2128.55	A	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	that's the first order but the saying but then the second but it may help first order effect and it may help 
Bro012.B.dialogueact859	2126.44	2127.33	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	that's the first order but the but it may help first order 
Bro012.B.dialogueact861	2127.78	2128.38	B	PhD	s^2	-1	0	order but the saying but then the second first order effect and it may help 
Bro012.A.dialogueact863	2128.55	2130.69	A	Professor	s^bk^m	-1	0	saying but then the second orders is a variance is effect and it may help to do the variance okay 
Bro012.B.dialogueact862	2128.38	2130.02	B	PhD	s^2	-1	0	saying but then the second orders is a variance is effect and it may help to do the variance okay 
Bro012.B.dialogueact864	2130.39	2130.79	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	variance is okay 
Bro012.A.dialogueact866	2131.57	2135.19	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	because again if you if you try and distinguish between he and n. b. it just 
Bro012.B.dialogueact865	2131.15	2131.44	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	because again 
Bro012.A.dialogueact868	2135.65	2143.82	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it just so happens that the e.'s were more you know recorded when when thee energy was was was larger or something or the 
Bro012.B.dialogueact867	2135.42	2135.84	B	PhD	b	-1	0	it just 
Bro012.B.dialogueact869	2142.93	2143.08	B	PhD	b	-1	0	was was larger or something or the

Bro012.F.dialogueact882	2167.17	2168.15	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	sure he figured yeah

Bro012.F.dialogueact884	2168.96	2169.13	F	PhD	b	-1	0	he figured yeah i look at 
Bro012.F.dialogueact885	2169.62	2175.53	F	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	i look at the chili that yeah perhaps a good place keep detectors is good before and i my edition and 
Bro012.F.dialogueact886	2175.97	2180.11	F	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	edition and that's what we've already observed

Bro012.F.dialogueact888	2182.47	2182.65	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	what's 
Bro012.F.dialogueact889	2182.92	2185.75	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	but after you do this what's the key sections that and you think either 
Bro012.B.dialogueact890	2184.99	2188.74	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but after you do this after you do the variance normalization that and you think either 
Bro012.B.dialogueact892	2189.06	2189.43	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	i mean 
Bro012.F.dialogueact891	2188.85	2189.2	F	PhD	b	-1	0	i mean 
Bro012.B.dialogueact893	2190.54	2195.55	B	PhD	s	-1	0	i don't know it seems like this would be a lot easier than this signal to work with yeah so but i know see that's 
Bro012.F.dialogueact894	2193.71	2193.91	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	this signal yeah 
Bro012.F.dialogueact895	2194.35	2199.65	F	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	to work with so but i know see that's what i prefer to look at the second figure then the third one 
Bro012.F.dialogueact896	2200.61	2202.36	F	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	but because you could issue where speech is 
Bro012.A.dialogueact898	2202.62	2202.84	A	Professor	fg	-1	0	is 
Bro012.B.dialogueact897	2202.19	2202.78	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	is 
Bro012.F.dialogueact899	2203.31	2214.3	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but for the purposes but the the brother me that on the speech portion jenna zero each other ones are more different then when you use virus from my addition our ten as you in general and become closer 
Bro012.A.dialogueact900	2212.91	2213.1	A	Professor	b	-1	0	ten as you in general and become closer 
Bro012.B.dialogueact901	2214.44	2217.36	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but for the purposes of finding this beach yeah but you yeah 
Bro012.F.dialogueact902	2214.89	2215.05	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	but for the purposes of finding this 
Bro012.F.dialogueact903	2217.21	2217.87	F	PhD	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	yeah but you yeah 
Bro012.B.dialogueact905	2218.4	2220.86	B	PhD	qy^bu^d	-1	0	you're more interesting the difference between the speech and then on speech right 
Bro012.F.dialogueact904	2217.98	2218.2	F	PhD	b	-1	0	you're more interesting yeah but you yeah 
Bro012.B.dialogueact907	2220.86	2221.16	B	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	and then on speech right so i think yeah 
Bro012.F.dialogueact906	2220.74	2220.89	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and then on speech right 
Bro012.F.dialogueact908	2221.39	2221.86	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so i think yeah 
Bro012.F.dialogueact909	2221.86	2222.03	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	so i think yeah for i 
Bro012.F.dialogueact910	2222.28	2235.31	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	for i i think that wretched shows that uh the army too is that the voice acute sector should use after you was should be different departments of that has to be used for speech recognition 
Bro012.A.dialogueact911	2236.85	2238.88	A	Professor	fg|s^bs	-1	0	yeah so basically you want to reduce this effect so 
Bro012.F.dialogueact912	2237.05	2237.85	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	basically you want to reduce 
Bro012.A.dialogueact913	2238.88	2241.62	A	Professor	s	-1	0	this effect so you can do that by doing was voice two detection also could 
Bro012.A.dialogueact914	2241.62	2245.98	A	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	detection also could do it i suspect destruction before the france no a edition right 
Bro012.A.dialogueact915	2245.98	2246.33	A	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	no a edition right yeah 
Bro012.F.dialogueact916	2246.94	2248.46	F	PhD	s^aap|s^arp	-1	0	yeah but that's not pretty

Bro012.F.dialogueact943	2289.49	2289.69	F	PhD	qw^br	-1	0	it applied here

Bro012.F.dialogueact947	2295.17	2295.89	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so it's a good thing because 
Bro012.B.dialogueact949	2296.3	2296.46	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i guess 
Bro012.F.dialogueact948	2295.96	2301.34	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	yeah is it applied so it's a good thing because i guess we're sick easy detection on base it could be worse 
Bro012.B.dialogueact950	2299.36	2299.64	B	PhD	fg	-1	0	yeah 
Bro012.B.dialogueact951	2301.13	2304.3	B	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	is it applied all the way back here 
Bro012.F.dialogueact952	2305.22	2306.11	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	it's a died uh um

Bro012.F.dialogueact954	2309.94	2310.08	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	maybe yeah something like this 
Bro012.F.dialogueact955	2310.22	2310.92	F	PhD	s	-1	0	maybe something like this 
Bro012.B.dialogueact957	2311.02	2312.8	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	that's why it doesn't work for channel one 
Bro012.F.dialogueact956	2310.92	2311.22	F	PhD	b	-1	0	maybe that's why it doesn't work something like this

Bro012.A.dialogueact959	2314.62	2315.04	A	Professor	qy.%-	-1	0	so we could perhaps do just

Bro012.A.dialogueact964	2323.97	2335.52	A	Professor	qw^rt	+1	2	level question which is um if if most of what deogee guy folklore working with is trying to integrate this other other uh spectra subtraction where we weren't about it

Bro012.F.dialogueact969	2339.78	2341.67	F	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	it's just uh whether it's another 
Bro012.F.dialogueact970	2342.29	2346.68	F	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	that trying to to use um the ericsson and you're trying 
Bro012.F.dialogueact971	2346.68	2348.95	F	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	ericsson and you're trying to do something something else 
Bro012.F.dialogueact972	2349.88	2350.3	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah and also 
Bro012.F.dialogueact973	2350.69	2352.61	F	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	yeah and also to understand what happens because

Bro012.F.dialogueact976	2354.04	2359.53	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but when we do spectra subtraction actually i think the dishes the it two last figures 
Bro012.A.dialogueact977	2359.96	2360.21	A	Professor	b	-1	0	um 
Bro012.F.dialogueact978	2360.14	2369.18	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	speech is more what um it seems that after spectra subtraction speeches smart emerging that and than before whether 
Bro012.A.dialogueact979	2367.34	2368.04	A	Professor	b	-1	0	speech is more what and than before 
Bro012.B.dialogueact980	2368.07	2369.08	B	PhD	qw^br^rt	-1	0	speech is more what and than before whether 
Bro012.F.dialogueact981	2369.61	2378.23	F	PhD	s	-1	0	whether the difference between the energy of the speech and the energy of been specter supply subtracting nice portion she's larger 
Bro012.A.dialogueact982	2380.08	2380.54	A	Professor	b	-1	0	but if you compare 
Bro012.F.dialogueact983	2380.49	2382.73	F	PhD	s^rt.%--	-1	0	but if you compare to fess figure this one 
Bro012.F.dialogueact984	2384.57	2385.89	F	PhD	s	-1	0	could just get used not the same but 
Bro012.F.dialogueact985	2385.89	2396.86	F	PhD	s	-1	0	get used not the same but if you look at the the numbers if you see that the difference between b. c. zero the speech and seaworld in those portions voucher 
Bro012.F.dialogueact986	2397.94	2404.13	F	PhD	s	-1	0	uh but what happens is that after expect inspection you also increase the variance of this it's easier so sure 
Bro012.A.dialogueact988	2404.66	2405.59	A	Professor	b	-1	0	so sure upright 
Bro012.F.dialogueact987	2404.65	2410.66	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so sure upright variance in my addition and they see complexities school

Bro012.A.dialogueact1057	2579.91	2580.89	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1058	2581.06	2584.64	A	Professor	qo	+1	1	this there was this experiment of uh what if you just take the baseline 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1059	2581.29	2581.88	F	PhD	b	-1	0	this there was this experiment 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1060	2585.57	2586.78	A	Professor	s	-1	0	says as as teachers just smoke 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1061	2586.78	2587.74	A	Professor	s	-1	0	as teachers just smoke after 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1062	2588.16	2591.22	A	Professor	s	+1	1	and you incorporate the different v. h. d.'s and 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1063	2591.82	2596.63	A	Professor	s^ba	+1	1	and it looks like the the french eighties is actually better improve the baseline 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1064	2596.45	2597.31	B	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	improve the baseline

Bro012.F.dialogueact1069	2605.47	2607.11	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i think it's on 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1070	2609.1	2610.18	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i think it's easy to do better because it doesn't 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1071	2610.18	2611.77	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because it doesn't work at all

Bro012.F.dialogueact1073	2614.14	2615.62	F	PhD	s^no	-1	0	i i don't know which which one it's speculative 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1074	2615.62	2618.55	F	PhD	s	+1	1	which one it's speculative did this experiment 
Bro012.D.dialogueact1075	2619.48	2619.81	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	yeah 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1076	2619.83	2624.26	F	PhD	s	+1	1	yeah she i i think we should ask which he 
Bro012.D.dialogueact1077	2620.49	2620.77	D	PhD	s^no	-1	0	we should 
Bro012.D.dialogueact1078	2623.42	2629.77	D	PhD	s	+1	1	she i i think that she say we did goat a probably keep 
Bro012.D.dialogueact1079	2630.26	2632.33	D	PhD	s	-1	0	um they they i got to be 
Bro012.D.dialogueact1080	2633.09	2636.03	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and the well it's something that something worse yeah but they it's uh 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1081	2636.06	2643.05	F	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	but they it's uh i think you're talking about the other means that use the the um the riff surrounds features

Bro012.A.dialogueact1088	2651.29	2659.98	A	Professor	s	+1	1	ms enough better that that too but uh count for a fair amount of the difference between the performance actually 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1089	2658.08	2658.46	F	PhD	b	-1	0	between the performance

Bro012.A.dialogueact1091	2662.8	2664.79	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	um so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1092	2664.91	2666.27	A	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	um so they better on which use it i mean 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1093	2666.27	2666.62	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it i mean 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1094	2668.31	2668.75	A	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	you know it's 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1095	2668.75	2669.06	A	Professor	%--	-1	0	you know it's can't 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1096	2669.81	2670.75	A	Professor	s	-1	0	can't work and everything

Bro012.A.dialogueact1098	2671.37	2678.37	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah so we should find out if it's really better mean if it's the comparison 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1099	2675.33	2677.08	F	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	yeah so we should find out if it's really better mean if it's 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1100	2677.08	2677.63	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	mean if it's 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1101	2678.55	2681.37	F	PhD	s	-1	0	the comparison small big that's

Bro012.F.dialogueact1163	2821.43	2821.82	F	PhD	b	-1	0	think you some but the voice 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1164	2823.03	2823.31	A	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	enough position yeah 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1166	2823.39	2824.66	A	Professor	s^e	-1	0	enough position speech yeah well

Bro012.B.dialogueact1170	2826.4	2829.95	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	that you know even with voice none bush than waste 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1171	2827.5	2827.78	F	PhD	b	-1	0	even with voice 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1172	2830.16	2830.64	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1173	2831.89	2834.8	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	well yeah i thought that you were he was talking about 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1174	2834.5	2834.84	A	Professor	fg	-1	0	well yeah talking about 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1176	2834.84	2837.21	A	Professor	s^bk|s^co	-1	0	well yeah know and finish who who's going to sing talking about okay um 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1175	2834.83	2834.96	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	well yeah talking about 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1177	2836.52	2836.86	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	who who's going to okay 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1178	2837.21	2837.42	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	sing um

Bro012.F.dialogueact1180	2837.97	2843.8	F	PhD	h|s^cs.%--	+1	1	sing um yeah so yeah i think if we try to up the second stream 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1181	2845.25	2849.38	F	PhD	s	+1	1	it they would be otherwise stream it to the end of it opened the second could be interesting to be in that's something 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1182	2849.65	2853.04	F	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	to be in that's something that small relate to define structure of the spectrum

Bro012.F.dialogueact1184	2856.13	2856.88	F	PhD	fh|s^no	-1	0	yeah so i don't know we were 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1185	2856.88	2861.71	F	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	yeah so i don't know we were thinking about like using ideas from from every soul 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1186	2862.13	2863.9	F	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	as a good advice detect or 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1187	2864.84	2865.49	F	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	my 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1188	2865.71	2870.44	F	PhD	fh|s^cs^rt	+1	1	my voice speech detector that's working 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1189	2870.44	2872.31	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	larry 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1191	2873.07	2873.54	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	so it could be an idea 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1190	2872.95	2874.45	F	PhD	s^cs^rt	+1	1	larry so it could be an idea we are 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1192	2874.45	2879.24	F	PhD	s^cs^rt	+1	1	we are thinking about just taking the spectrum 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1193	2880.13	2888.28	F	PhD	s	+1	1	so okay so so compute the variance i resolution spectrum 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1194	2886.7	2888.19	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	so okay so so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1195	2888.56	2888.81	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay so so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1196	2888.81	2890.77	A	Professor	s	-1	0	okay so so many decision about that uh we 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1197	2890.77	2903.73	A	Professor	s	+1	1	about that uh we had a guy here some years ago who did some work on making use of voicing information uh to help in reducing the noise 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1198	2900.47	2900.85	F	PhD	b	-1	0	uh to 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1200	2904.42	2909.46	A	Professor	s	+1	1	so what he was doing is basically you you you do estimates pitch 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1199	2903.93	2904.28	F	PhD	b	-1	0	the noise so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1201	2910.57	2911.23	A	Professor	%--	-1	0	and um 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1202	2911.3	2911.91	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1203	2912.09	2914.09	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	you from that you you asked me or you asked 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1204	2914.09	2916.37	A	Professor	s	+1	1	or you asked me if i how my structure maturity either 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1205	2916.37	2916.61	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	maturity either 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1206	2916.61	2917.44	A	Professor	s	-1	0	maturity either way it's more the same 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1207	2917.44	2918.45	A	Professor	s	-1	0	way it's more the same but 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1208	2918.45	2926.96	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but uh the thing is that um can't get rid of things that are not if 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1209	2926.96	2932.38	A	Professor	s	+1	1	that are not if there's strong harmonic structure you can throw away stuff it's it's not how harmonic 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1210	2930.97	2931.34	F	PhD	b	-1	0	throw away stuff it's it's not how harmonic 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1211	2933.05	2933.38	F	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1212	2933.74	2938.14	A	Professor	s^rt	+1	1	and that that is another way of getting rid of part of the noise so 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1213	2938.07	2938.24	F	PhD	b	-1	0	so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1215	2938.96	2944.66	A	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	so um that's something that is sort of finer 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1214	2938.93	2939.21	F	PhD	b	-1	0	so um 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1216	2945.01	2947.56	A	Professor	s	+1	1	things a little more information introspective subtraction 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1217	2948.52	2949.08	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	and he had some 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1218	2948.52	2948.88	F	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro012.A.dialogueact1219	2949.42	2952.56	A	Professor	s^rt	+1	1	and he had some i he did that serving combination ross process kind of 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1220	2952.56	2955.19	A	Professor	s	-1	0	process kind of crosses taken care of loose smells uh and he was and 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1221	2953.55	2953.94	F	PhD	b	-1	0	crosses taken care 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1223	2955.19	2955.53	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and he was and 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1222	2955.1	2955.5	F	PhD	b	-1	0	and he was and 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1224	2956.05	2959.06	A	Professor	s	+1	1	and that some some decent results doing that so that that's another 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1225	2959.06	2960.83	A	Professor	s	+1	1	so that that's another another way 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1227	2961.21	2961.94	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but yeah there's there's writers 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1226	2960.94	2961.42	F	PhD	b	-1	0	another way but yeah there's there's writers 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1228	2961.42	2961.58	F	PhD	b	-1	0	but yeah there's there's writers 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1229	2961.94	2962.13	A	Professor	b	-1	0	but yeah there's there's writers always accuse 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1230	2962.13	2963.12	A	Professor	s	-1	0	always accuse we've actually 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1231	2963.17	2963.37	A	Professor	%--	-1	0	we've actually 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1233	2963.94	2969.26	A	Professor	s	-1	0	we've actually back and chuck was here we did some poison voiced uh classification using bunch of these 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1232	2963.8	2963.94	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	we've actually

Bro012.A.dialogueact1242	2977.03	2986.61	A	Professor	s	-1	0	the constraints of this task we can't in a very nice way feed forward to recognize or information but probably 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1243	2986.61	2990.88	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but probably stick information that you might get about whether it's western voice twenty 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1245	2990.88	2995.39	A	Professor	s	-1	0	voice twenty you can't you know affect though situations or anything

Bro012.A.dialogueact1248	3003.0	3003.77	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	guess we could

Bro012.B.dialogueact1250	3007.4	3009.38	B	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	didn't ahead dude send around that message q. 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1251	3009.38	3011.78	B	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	q. sent this all a copy of the message 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1252	3012.55	3013.6	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	where he was saying that 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1253	3014.85	3016.97	B	PhD	s^bd^no	-1	0	i'm not sure exactly what the gist of what he was saying but 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1254	3016.97	3020.53	B	PhD	s	-1	0	gist of what he was saying but something having to do with the voice activity detector in that it will 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1255	3020.53	3023.64	B	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	in that it will people shouldn't put their own or something was going to be 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1256	3023.64	3024.22	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	that but okay or something was going to be 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1257	3024.46	3024.92	A	Professor	%--	-1	0	that but okay 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1258	3025.0	3025.27	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	so that's voice activities 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1259	3025.27	3028.48	A	Professor	s	-1	0	so that's voice activities sectors opposed to voicing detector so we're talking about 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1260	3025.65	3025.95	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so that's voice activities 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1261	3028.48	3030.03	A	Professor	s	-1	0	so we're talking about something little different oh i'm sorry 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1262	3028.87	3029.42	F	PhD	b	-1	0	so we're talking about something little different oh 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1263	3029.89	3030.54	B	PhD	s^bk|s^fa	-1	0	something little different oh i'm sorry 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1266	3030.92	3031.17	A	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	i guess i'm sorry i missed it 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1265	3030.63	3031.97	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	i guess i'm sorry i missed it 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1264	3030.31	3030.73	F	PhD	b	-1	0	i'm sorry 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1267	3031.74	3032.87	A	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	i guess what you could do maybe is i missed it 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1268	3032.87	3036.82	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	what you could do maybe is should do you so if if you have if you view this second strain 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1269	3039.0	3041.64	A	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	before you before you do kale peace and so forth 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1270	3042.43	3044.19	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	you do views probabilities 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1271	3045.28	3046.7	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and it's an independent so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1272	3046.8	3051.69	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	independent so if it's if it's uh not so much i'm blow pace but find structure based uh looking 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1273	3051.69	3053.94	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	based uh looking at harm in city or something like that 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1274	3054.79	3057.9	A	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	if you get a probability from that information and 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1275	3057.9	3064.11	A	Professor	s	-1	0	that information and then multiply it by you know multiply by all the voice uh but smelly the voice supplements you know then 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1276	3064.11	3067.41	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	you know then use that as the uh take a lot 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1277	3064.21	3064.75	F	PhD	b	-1	0	you know then 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1278	3067.41	3068.45	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	the uh take a lot of that or 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1279	3068.45	3073.19	A	Professor	fh|s^rt.%--	-1	0	of that or uh pretty pretty uh pretty not money already uh 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1280	3071.9	3072.2	F	PhD	b	-1	0	pretty uh pretty not money already 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1281	3073.14	3073.62	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	uh 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1282	3073.82	3077.54	A	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh and do the kale tiana on on that 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1283	3076.71	3077.01	F	PhD	b	-1	0	on on that 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1284	3078.47	3084.18	A	Professor	s	-1	0	then that would that would i guess be uh reasonable use of independent information 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1285	3085.49	3086.4	A	Professor	s	-1	0	so maybe that's what you meant 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1286	3086.74	3088.13	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	you meant 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1287	3089.11	3090.69	F	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	yeah when i was thinking yeah 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1288	3090.92	3091.96	F	PhD	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	thinking yeah this could be 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1289	3092.19	3092.34	F	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro012.F.dialogueact1290	3094.86	3098.83	F	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	so i mean at some kind of probably the the advice thing and then 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1292	3098.92	3100.33	A	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	right she was second romantic to be pretty small advice thing and then use it and then 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1291	3098.84	3101.72	F	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	right she was second romantic to be pretty small advice thing and then use it and then just then 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1293	3100.33	3101.42	A	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	romantic to be pretty small use it and then just then 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1294	3102.18	3103.2	A	Professor	fg|s^rt	-1	0	yeah you was kind of system is they have some kind of 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1295	3103.2	3105.59	A	Professor	s	-1	0	is they have some kind of can be pretty small that at 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1296	3103.62	3103.87	F	PhD	b	-1	0	is they have some kind of 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1297	3106.11	3107.82	A	Professor	s	-1	0	least we get to some of the stuff 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1298	3108.1	3109.87	A	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh i i did some years ago and it 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1299	3108.38	3108.71	F	PhD	b	-1	0	uh i i did 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1300	3109.87	3115.51	A	Professor	s	-1	0	some years ago and it and and you use but the thing is to use information primarily that's different 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1301	3116.04	3119.35	A	Professor	s	-1	0	as you say it's more fine structure based then then i'm slow paced uh 
Bro012.F.dialogueact1302	3119.41	3119.79	F	PhD	b	-1	0	uh 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1303	3119.94	3124.74	A	Professor	s	-1	0	uh so that you you you can pretty much guarantee it's stuff that you're not looking at very well with the other one 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1304	3125.47	3129.04	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and uh then you only use it for this one distinction

Bro012.A.dialogueact1343	3228.76	3236.07	A	Professor	s^rt	+1	2	in fact if you get if you go into uh yeah harmonic related thing it's definitely going to be different and what they're doing and uh

Bro012.A.dialogueact1346	3239.13	3241.01	A	Professor	s^rt	+1	2	should have some interesting properties annoys 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1347	3241.44	3255.41	A	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	i know that when people have done uh sort of the obvious thing of taking uh you're featured actor and adding in some variables which are pitch related or uh

Bro012.B.dialogueact1475	3550.29	3552.34	B	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	i just mentioned one other interesting thing um 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1476	3551.12	3551.4	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	mentioned one other interesting 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1477	3552.77	3559.6	B	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	thing um one of the ideas that we have come up with last week for things to try to improve the system 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1478	3560.5	3561.05	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1479	3562.9	3565.8	B	PhD	s	-1	0	actually i i see we didn't i guess i wrote this and after the meeting but 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1480	3565.8	3574.87	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and after the meeting but if i had was um looking at e. language model that you used in d. h. d. k. recognize or 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1481	3575.28	3578.24	B	PhD	s	-1	0	which is basically just a big loop right you 
Bro012.E.dialogueact1482	3577.59	3577.96	E	Grad	b	-1	0	loop 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1483	3578.47	3578.72	B	PhD	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right you 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1484	3578.72	3579.7	B	PhD	s	-1	0	right you goes digits and then that 
Bro012.D.dialogueact1485	3578.76	3579.06	D	PhD	b	-1	0	right you goes digits and then that 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1486	3579.7	3582.87	B	PhD	s	-1	0	goes digits and then that can be either go to silence or go to another digit 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1487	3583.17	3583.53	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	which that 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1488	3583.88	3589.15	B	PhD	s	-1	0	which that my motto well for the production of infinitely long sequences of digits right 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1489	3589.39	3589.68	B	PhD	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1490	3590.02	3590.24	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	so 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1491	3590.58	3596.98	B	PhD	s:s	-1	0	so i thought well i'm uh just look at thee what actual digit strings do occur in the training data 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1492	3597.31	3597.58	A	Professor	b	-1	0	an interesting 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1493	3597.8	3605.5	B	PhD	s	-1	0	an interesting thing was it turns out that there are no sequences of too long or three long did you strings in any of they were training data so it's either 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1494	3605.62	3608.61	B	PhD	s	-1	0	data so it's either one four five six 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1495	3609.58	3611.99	B	PhD	fh|s^rt	-1	0	uh up to eleven 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1496	3612.23	3613.16	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and then it skips and then there's some at 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1497	3613.16	3614.65	B	PhD	s	-1	0	what and then there's some at sixteen 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1498	3614.96	3616.12	A	Professor	qw	-1	0	what about testing there sixteen um 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1499	3616.8	3617.84	B	PhD	h|s^no	-1	0	um i don't know i didn't 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1500	3617.84	3619.1	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	yeah i mean if there's i don't know i didn't look at the testing i so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1501	3619.1	3619.36	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	i mean if there's so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1503	3619.6	3623.13	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i mean if there's some testing data that has has this two or three so yeah but i just 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1502	3619.51	3619.86	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	i mean if there's so 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1504	3623.39	3623.66	B	PhD	fg	-1	0	yeah but i just 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1505	3623.66	3625.63	B	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	yeah but i just thought that was a little odd 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1506	3626.29	3627.76	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but there were no two or three long 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1507	3628.9	3629.02	B	PhD	s^fa.%	-1	0	so i i just 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1508	3629.24	3639.15	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so i i just for the heck of it i've made a little grammar which um you know had separate paths for each link did you string you could get so there was a 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1509	3639.15	3641.04	B	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	so there was a one long path and there was a for 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1510	3641.04	3642.75	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and there was a for long enough i'll 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1511	3641.97	3642.98	A	Professor	b	-1	0	and there was a for long enough i'll 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1512	3643.14	3645.69	B	PhD	s	-1	0	i tried that and it got way worse or throughout 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1513	3645.69	3646.83	B	PhD	s	-1	0	way worse or throughout the deletion so 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1515	3647.24	3647.92	A	Professor	b	-1	0	it was 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1514	3646.98	3650.13	B	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	the deletion so it was you know i i don't have any weights on these paths right in anything like 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1516	3650.13	3651.24	B	PhD	s	-1	0	right in anything like that i played 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1517	3650.71	3651.36	A	Professor	b	-1	0	right in anything like that i played 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1518	3651.24	3654.53	B	PhD	s	-1	0	that i played with we can uh or transition penalties a bunch but couldn't go 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1519	3654.53	3655.39	B	PhD	s	-1	0	a bunch but couldn't go anywhere but 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1521	3656.06	3656.49	A	Professor	b	-1	0	i thought well if i 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1520	3655.57	3656.03	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	anywhere but i thought well if i 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1522	3656.31	3657.76	B	PhD	s.%--:s.%--	-1	0	i thought well if i only allow 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1523	3658.57	3666.1	B	PhD	s	-1	0	i guess i should have looked to see how often there was a mistake where it too long or three long path was actually put out a that this this 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1524	3666.83	3667.82	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro012.A.dialogueact1525	3668.65	3668.85	A	Professor	b	-1	0	so to 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1526	3668.8	3671.8	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so to do that right you'd probably want to have for them all but then 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1527	3671.8	3673.19	B	PhD	s	-1	0	for them all but then have waiting something so i just thought 
Bro012.B.dialogueact1528	3673.19	3677.27	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so i just thought that was an interesting think about the data 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1529	3681.29	3681.62	A	Professor	s^bk^rt^t^tc	-1	0	okay so we're going 
Bro012.A.dialogueact1530	3681.62	3683.91	A	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	okay so we're going to reach more just i guess
