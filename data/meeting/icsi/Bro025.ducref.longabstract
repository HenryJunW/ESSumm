ICSI's Meeting Recorder Group have returned from a meeting with some important decisions to make.
They have developed a piece of software which allows them to implement their two main approaches to dealing with noise.
The base rate is currently set at the second best rate as of the last project evaluation , and it does not yet include everything the group have been working on.
With this in mind , they have decided to set most things , and concentrate on studying only a few key aspects , the neural network , the voice activity detector , and the noise estimation.
By the time a senior member of their research partners OGI returns , they want to have a firm plan of what they will be doing.
System latency is still an issue , but limits have still not been set by the project heads.
The group have encountered problems with frame-dropping , and will need to bear that in mind since their neural network would come after that stage.
While deciding which of two approaches to finally adopt , the group put together one piece of software for all to use that implements both spectral subtraction and wiener filtering.
Speaker me026 has done his quals , and is looking at some of the feedback he received.
