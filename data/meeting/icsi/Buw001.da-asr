Buw001.D.dialogueact184	310.137	313.987	D	Professor	s	-1	0	well i mean supposed to broaden out and go to arrange meetings besides just the these internal ones there's 
Buw001.D.dialogueact185	313.987	320.066	D	Professor	s	-1	0	right the these internal ones there's going to be lots of things that any group people know each other have in college common that we will not now 
Buw001.A.dialogueact187	318.142	318.462	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	common that we 
Buw001.H.dialogueact186	317.69	317.93	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	have in college 
Buw001.A.dialogueact189	320.663	320.943	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right

Buw001.A.dialogueact190	321.123	325.773	A	Professor	s	+1	1	so that they will be jargon but we had and still be transcription errors 
Buw001.H.dialogueact191	321.534	321.744	H	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	so that they will 
Buw001.D.dialogueact192	323.34	323.56	D	Professor	b.%	-1	0	we 
Buw001.H.dialogueact193	326.518	326.748	H	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Buw001.D.dialogueact194	327.09	329.63	D	Professor	s	-1	0	they were we were originally going to do this with feel if i design and 
Buw001.D.dialogueact195	329.63	336.01	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i design and and mission we didn't go straight to that was because immediately ninety percent of what we heard would be to drive so that was just one of the reasons 
Buw001.D.dialogueact196	336.01	336.15	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	was just one of the reasons 
Buw001.G.dialogueact197	336.013	337.023	G	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	was just one of the reasons but yeah definitely 
Buw001.G.dialogueact198	337.023	337.893	G	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	but yeah definitely 
Buw001.D.dialogueact199	337.57	337.77	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	but yeah definitely 
Buw001.H.dialogueact200	337.64	337.85	H	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	but yeah definitely 
Buw001.D.dialogueact201	338.37	338.87	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	that's that's right around 
Buw001.D.dialogueact202	338.87	339.67	D	Professor	s	-1	0	that's that's right around this course 
Buw001.D.dialogueact203	339.96	340.06	D	Professor	b.%	-1	0	this course 
Buw001.H.dialogueact204	341.491	344.771	H	Postdoc	fg|s^t^tc	-1	0	okay so were on the data collection and the summary issue 
Buw001.D.dialogueact205	343.29	343.54	D	Professor	b	-1	0	and the summary 
Buw001.D.dialogueact206	343.54	343.95	D	Professor	s.%	-1	0	and the summary 
Buw001.A.dialogueact207	345.792	346.152	A	Professor	fg	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Buw001.A.dialogueact208	346.663	347.013	A	Professor	%--	-1	0	so actually 
Buw001.A.dialogueact209	347.463	349.353	A	Professor	s	+1	0	so actually there's kind of three issues there's across 
Buw001.A.dialogueact210	349.453	350.843	A	Professor	s	+1	0	there's across that issue 
Buw001.A.dialogueact211	351.395	353.915	A	Professor	qh	+1	0	should we do it and if so what we have them too 
Buw001.A.dialogueact212	355.195	357.225	A	Professor	qh	+1	0	um do we have people write summaries everybody 
Buw001.A.dialogueact213	358.031	359.391	A	Professor	qh	+1	0	or one person 
Buw001.A.dialogueact214	360.519	364.019	A	Professor	qh	+1	0	and then do we ask people for how they would quare things 
Buw001.A.dialogueact216	366.25	366.64	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	there's there's some problems 
Buw001.F.dialogueact215	366.115	367.635	F	PhD	s	-1	0	there's there's some problems in that in that 
Buw001.F.dialogueact217	367.635	371.065	F	PhD	qh^e	+1	0	in that in that where or when do you actually ask him about that i mean that was 
Buw001.A.dialogueact219	371.469	371.869	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	i mean that was 
Buw001.F.dialogueact218	371.065	380.766	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean that was one thing i was thinking about was is that dan said earlier that you know maybe two weeks later which is when you would want to query you think you might ask that 
Buw001.A.dialogueact220	379.542	379.982	A	Professor	b	-1	0	you think you might 
Buw001.F.dialogueact221	381.504	386.43	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	there's a problem with that in that you're not if you don't have 
Buw001.F.dialogueact222	386.62	391.14	F	PhD	s	-1	0	right not if you don't have an interactive system it's going to be hard to go beyond sort of the first level of question right 
Buw001.A.dialogueact223	391.527	391.777	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right right 
Buw001.F.dialogueact224	391.77	392.02	F	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right right and for them to explore 
Buw001.F.dialogueact225	392.15	394.16	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and for them to explore the data further 
Buw001.A.dialogueact226	394.692	394.982	A	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Buw001.F.dialogueact227	394.863	395.353	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	there's there's another 
Buw001.D.dialogueact229	395.479	396.689	D	Professor	s	-1	0	there's there's another problem which is 
Buw001.G.dialogueact228	395.178	395.468	G	Grad	%--	-1	0	there's there's another 
Buw001.D.dialogueact230	396.689	402.649	D	Professor	s	-1	0	problem which is um we certainly do want to branch out beyond uh uh recording meetings about meeting recorder 
Buw001.D.dialogueact231	403.171	409.21	D	Professor	s	+1	1	and i once we get out beyond our little group people's motivation factor uh reduces enormously if we start giving them 
Buw001.D.dialogueact232	409.21	411.61	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	if we start giving them a bunch of other things to do 
Buw001.D.dialogueact233	412.121	414.991	D	Professor	s	-1	0	that you know we we did you know another meeting here for another group and 
Buw001.D.dialogueact234	414.991	416.741	D	Professor	s	-1	0	here for another group and and uh they were fine with it but if we 
Buw001.D.dialogueact235	416.741	421.923	D	Professor	qh^df.%-	-1	0	were fine with it but if we said okay now all ahead of you have to have to come up with uh i have some well i asked them to and 
Buw001.G.dialogueact236	421.115	422.025	G	Grad	s	-1	0	i have some well i asked them to and none of them do 
Buw001.G.dialogueact237	422.025	422.745	G	Grad	s	-1	0	none of them do 
Buw001.D.dialogueact238	423.81	424.18	D	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	so i i asked 
Buw001.D.dialogueact241	424.38	425.15	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so i i asked them to send me 
Buw001.G.dialogueact240	424.32	428.25	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	so i i asked them to send me ideas for quarries after the meeting and no one 
Buw001.H.dialogueact239	423.88	424.19	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	so i i asked 
Buw001.A.dialogueact242	424.908	425.068	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	so i i asked them to send me 
Buw001.G.dialogueact243	428.46	429.42	G	Grad	s	-1	0	and no one ever did i didn't follow 
Buw001.E.dialogueact244	429.631	429.901	E	PhD	b	-1	0	ever did i didn't follow 
Buw001.G.dialogueact245	429.66	430.79	G	Grad	s^bd^df	-1	0	ever did i didn't follow up either 
Buw001.A.dialogueact247	431.379	431.759	A	Professor	b	-1	0	so i didn't track 
Buw001.G.dialogueact246	431.293	434.153	G	Grad	s^bd^e:s	-1	0	so i didn't track them down and say please do it do it now but uh 
Buw001.G.dialogueact248	434.153	438.442	G	Grad	s	-1	0	i'm worried that but uh no one spontaneously provided anything 
Buw001.D.dialogueact249	437.753	437.963	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	provided 
Buw001.D.dialogueact250	438.582	442.902	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i'm worried that if you did even if you did push them into it it it might be semi random anything 
Buw001.A.dialogueact251	443.239	443.609	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	uh i suppose 
Buw001.D.dialogueact252	443.381	446.421	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	uh i suppose what you'd really want to know if you were going to use this thing 
Buw001.E.dialogueact253	443.73	443.99	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	uh i suppose 
Buw001.A.dialogueact255	447.26	447.66	A	Professor	b	-1	0	i just don't know how else to generate 
Buw001.G.dialogueact254	447.02	452.92	G	Grad	s^df^no:s	+1	2	i just don't know how else to generate decrease other than getting an expert to actually listen to the meeting and say that's important 
Buw001.G.dialogueact256	453.07	454.14	G	Grad	s^df^e:s	-1	0	that might be a corey 
Buw001.H.dialogueact257	454.936	455.036	H	Postdoc	%	-1	0	well there 
Buw001.H.dialogueact258	455.486	462.476	H	Postdoc	s^df^ng	-1	0	well there is this other thing which we you are literature really which is um there's certain keywords like you know action item things like that which 
Buw001.H.dialogueact259	462.476	467.52	H	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	like that which could be used to to some degree fining the structure and and i also 
Buw001.A.dialogueact261	466.51	466.84	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	to some degree fining the 
Buw001.E.dialogueact260	466.14	466.47	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	to some degree fining the 
Buw001.A.dialogueact262	466.84	466.93	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	to some degree fining the 
Buw001.H.dialogueact263	467.52	472.095	H	Postdoc	s	+1	0	structure and and i also um was thinking with reference to mm i know taking these it vanished 
Buw001.H.dialogueact264	472.445	477.405	H	Postdoc	s	+1	0	these it vanished areas that you get structure without the person having to do something artificial later on for third 
Buw001.H.dialogueact265	477.495	479.715	H	Postdoc	s	+1	2	later on for third thing on say is the summaries afterwards 
Buw001.H.dialogueact266	480.209	482.499	H	Postdoc	s	+1	0	um i think they should be recorded instead of written 
Buw001.H.dialogueact267	483.099	487.639	H	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because i think that um it would take so long for people to write that i think you wouldn't get as good a summary 
Buw001.A.dialogueact268	488.251	489.621	A	Professor	qw	-1	0	how about this idea that 
Buw001.A.dialogueact269	489.801	495.425	A	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	idea that normally at most meeting somebody is delegated to be a note taker a good good 
Buw001.H.dialogueact270	495.321	495.751	H	Postdoc	s^aa|s^ba	-1	0	a good good 
Buw001.H.dialogueact271	495.971	496.391	H	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	and a good good point yeah 
Buw001.A.dialogueact273	496.578	500.238	A	Professor	qh^cs	+1	2	and so why don't we just use the notes that somebody takes and that point yeah 
Buw001.H.dialogueact272	496.511	496.741	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	and point yeah 
Buw001.G.dialogueact274	500.804	502.204	G	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	and that gives you a summary but it doesn't really 
Buw001.G.dialogueact275	502.204	503.414	G	Grad	s^nd.%--	-1	0	but it doesn't really uh how do you generate curries 
Buw001.G.dialogueact276	503.414	504.984	G	Grad	qh^df^ng	-1	0	well uh how do you generate curries from that 
Buw001.E.dialogueact277	504.839	508.539	E	PhD	s	-1	0	well but i mean maybe a summary is one of things that one from the output of the system right from that 
Buw001.H.dialogueact278	505.49	505.63	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	but i mean maybe 
Buw001.A.dialogueact280	508.793	509.143	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	of the system right into something it's

Buw001.D.dialogueact293	527.807	535.935	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	well i think that we i mean that that of course thing is that the once we get some of these issues snail down we need to do a bunch of recordings me 
Buw001.A.dialogueact294	528.329	528.499	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	think that we i mean that 
Buw001.D.dialogueact295	536.214	537.574	D	Professor	s^cs^e	-1	0	and some unmarked i. b. m. and get a bunch 
Buw001.D.dialogueact296	537.574	538.904	D	Professor	s	-1	0	b. m. and get a bunch transcription is even yep 
Buw001.D.dialogueact297	538.904	540.334	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	transcription is even if they're slightly flawed or need some other yep

Buw001.D.dialogueact300	541.421	542.991	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and then we'll have some data there 
Buw001.A.dialogueact302	543.756	544.026	A	Professor	b	-1	0	and then we can start 
Buw001.D.dialogueact301	543.455	548.139	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and then we can start looking at thinking what we want to know about these things and the very least 
Buw001.D.dialogueact303	548.139	549.409	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	i actually and the very least

Buw001.B.dialogueact307	551.66	568.977	B	PhD	s	+1	1	about the no pets so if you could sense just when people are right and you tell them not to doodle or try not to be using that for other purposes and each person has an okay to just get it when they come in then you you can just have a plot of you know who's writing when 
Buw001.D.dialogueact308	552.403	552.643	D	Professor	b	-1	0	if you

Buw001.B.dialogueact313	572.559	578.279	B	PhD	s	+1	1	the meeting but i bet that's that will allow you to go into the so the hot places where people rankings that i mean you can tell when 
Buw001.D.dialogueact314	573.07	573.25	D	Professor	b	-1	0	that's that will allow

Buw001.D.dialogueact330	595.214	595.834	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but that just 
Buw001.D.dialogueact331	596.094	596.794	D	Professor	s^bd^df	-1	0	maybe i'm missing something that's 
Buw001.D.dialogueact332	596.854	600.134	D	Professor	s^bu|qy^d^g	-1	0	well what it does well then you maybe i'm missing something that's a and get to the question of how we come up with aquarius right 
Buw001.A.dialogueact334	600.162	601.182	A	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	well what it does well then you can go to the point 
Buw001.B.dialogueact333	600.103	604.833	B	PhD	fg|s^df	-1	0	well what it does well then you can go to the point where the you can actually go to those points in time and find 
Buw001.B.dialogueact335	604.833	606.723	B	PhD	s^df^e	-1	0	points in time and find out what they were talking about and you 
Buw001.B.dialogueact336	606.723	607.083	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	talking about and you 
Buw001.A.dialogueact338	608.312	610.602	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	well what it does is provide a different i i 
Buw001.D.dialogueact337	607.89	608.22	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	well what it 
Buw001.B.dialogueact339	608.49	608.9	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	well what it 
Buw001.G.dialogueact340	608.667	609.117	G	Grad	%	-1	0	well what it does is provide 
Buw001.A.dialogueact341	610.792	612.152	A	Professor	s	-1	0	a different i i think it's an interesting thing i don't think he gets that 
Buw001.A.dialogueact342	612.152	614.755	A	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	i don't think he gets that the the chorus per se but it 
Buw001.A.dialogueact343	614.755	624.397	A	Professor	s	-1	0	per se but it does give us and information fusion sort of thing that you know you want to what were the high points of the meeting but that's what i mean 
Buw001.B.dialogueact344	622.02	622.37	B	PhD	b	-1	0	what were 
Buw001.D.dialogueact345	624.512	626.672	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but that's what i mean is that i think it gets something interesting but if 
Buw001.D.dialogueact346	626.672	639.603	D	Professor	s^df	+1	2	but i interesting but if we're asking question which i thought we were of of of um how do we figure out what's the nature of aquarius the people are going to want to ask if such a system knowing what's important doesn't tell you what people are going to be asking 
Buw001.B.dialogueact347	639.792	642.032	B	PhD	s^df^ng	+1	0	but i bet it's a good super person what's 
Buw001.D.dialogueact348	640.091	640.491	D	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	bet it's a good 
Buw001.A.dialogueact350	643.282	644.222	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	well yeah i think you could it there 
Buw001.E.dialogueact349	642.912	643.532	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	well yeah what's it there 
Buw001.A.dialogueact351	644.222	653.411	A	Professor	s	-1	0	i think you could say they're going to ask about when did so and so's talk about lot and at least 
Buw001.A.dialogueact352	653.611	657.411	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and at least that gives you the word that they might run aquarium if you can find a location where there 
Buw001.B.dialogueact353	656.292	659.162	B	PhD	s	-1	0	that they might run aquarium if you can find a location where there may maybe keywords maybe this would tell you what 
Buw001.D.dialogueact355	658.43	658.77	D	Professor	s^am	-1	0	may maybe keywords maybe this 
Buw001.G.dialogueact354	658.388	660.728	G	Grad	s	-1	0	may maybe keywords maybe this would tell you what the kid is not what 
Buw001.B.dialogueact356	659.162	659.432	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	would tell you what 
Buw001.G.dialogueact357	660.728	661.668	G	Grad	s	-1	0	right right the kid is not what the koreans what 
Buw001.A.dialogueact360	661.99	662.38	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right it'll tell you the right right but i think the koreans what 
Buw001.B.dialogueact359	661.81	662.53	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right it'll tell you the right right but i think the koreans what

Buw001.A.dialogueact361	662.38	664.2	A	Professor	s^na	-1	0	it'll tell you the hip but not where wary right but i think i think thinking about queer eases so you could you can generate a corey from 
Buw001.B.dialogueact362	662.53	666.53	B	PhD	s	-1	0	it'll tell you the hip but not where wary right right but i think i think thinking about queer eases a little bit dangerous right now we don't even so you could you can generate a corey from the hits but 
Buw001.G.dialogueact363	663.194	665.674	G	Grad	s	-1	0	hip but not where wary right i think thinking about queer eases a little bit dangerous so you could you can generate a corey from the hits but 
Buw001.A.dialogueact365	665.833	666.043	A	Professor	b	-1	0	right a little bit dangerous right now we don't even the hits but 
Buw001.G.dialogueact364	665.754	665.984	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	right a little bit dangerous the hits but 
Buw001.B.dialogueact366	666.53	667.55	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	right now we don't even know what 
Buw001.B.dialogueact367	668.16	673.24	B	PhD	s	-1	0	mean if you want to find out what any user will use that might be true for one domain and one user but i mean a different 
Buw001.D.dialogueact368	668.91	669.24	D	Professor	b	-1	0	mean if you want to find out what any user 
Buw001.B.dialogueact369	673.24	675.26	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	but i mean a different domain a different user yeah we're just looking 
Buw001.H.dialogueact370	674.383	674.633	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	domain a different user 
Buw001.D.dialogueact371	675.57	677.45	D	Professor	fg|s^df	-1	0	yeah we're just looking for a place to start with that because you 
Buw001.B.dialogueact372	676.724	677.084	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	for a place to start with that because you 
Buw001.D.dialogueact373	677.45	682.873	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	with that because you know what what what james is going to be doing is looking at the user interface and he's 
Buw001.D.dialogueact374	682.873	684.333	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	user interface and he's looking at square in in 
Buw001.D.dialogueact375	684.928	687.958	D	Professor	s	+1	1	in we we have five hours a pilot data of the other stuff that 
Buw001.D.dialogueact376	687.958	690.478	D	Professor	s	+1	0	of the other stuff that we have zero hours of of korea so he's just sort 
Buw001.D.dialogueact377	690.478	693.046	D	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	well you could do so he's just sort of going where early 
Buw001.A.dialogueact378	692.869	692.979	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Buw001.A.dialogueact379	693.199	694.249	A	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	well you could do i think the summaries 
Buw001.A.dialogueact380	694.249	697.389	A	Professor	s	-1	0	i think the summaries actually may help get us there for 
Buw001.D.dialogueact381	696.495	696.875	D	Professor	b	-1	0	get us 
Buw001.A.dialogueact382	697.86	699.26	A	Professor	s^e	-1	0	there for a couple of reasons one 
Buw001.A.dialogueact383	699.26	711.757	A	Professor	s	-1	0	one if you have a summary if you have a bunch of summaries you can do the word frequency count and see what words come up and different types of meetings 
Buw001.D.dialogueact384	711.851	712.151	D	Professor	b.%	-1	0	of meetings so action 
Buw001.A.dialogueact385	712.553	717.653	A	Professor	s	-1	0	so action item is going to come up whether it's the deal assign meaning or speech me or whatever 
Buw001.A.dialogueact386	718.072	722.722	A	Professor	s	-1	0	so words that come up in different types of meetings maybe something that you would want to korea about 
Buw001.G.dialogueact387	722.798	723.098	G	Grad	b	-1	0	korea about um 
Buw001.A.dialogueact388	723.665	736.854	A	Professor	s:qw	+1	0	um the same thing you could possibly do with it it's just run a little pilot experiment with somebody saying here's a summary of the meeting what questions might you want to ask about it to go back yeah i think 
Buw001.G.dialogueact389	736.652	737.582	G	Grad	fg|s^ba^nd	-1	0	to go back yeah i think that's difficult because 
Buw001.G.dialogueact390	737.582	740.332	G	Grad	s^df	-1	0	that's difficult because then they're not going to ask the questions that are in the summary 
Buw001.A.dialogueact391	743.165	743.585	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	well but i 
Buw001.G.dialogueact392	743.567	744.887	G	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	well that's one but i think it would give 
Buw001.A.dialogueact393	744.668	748.118	A	Professor	s	-1	0	that's one plus one possible scenario though is you have the summary and think it would give 
Buw001.G.dialogueact394	748.09	748.37	G	Grad	b	-1	0	and 
Buw001.A.dialogueact395	748.911	751.041	A	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and you want to ask questions to get more detail yeah 
Buw001.G.dialogueact396	751.818	753.468	G	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah i think it has to be a participant well it doesn't 
Buw001.G.dialogueact397	753.468	754.688	G	Grad	s	-1	0	well it doesn't have to be 
Buw001.G.dialogueact398	755.128	758.488	G	Grad	s	-1	0	because of that that is another use of meeting recorder that we never really talked about which is 
Buw001.G.dialogueact399	758.791	760.211	G	Grad	s	-1	0	about which is for someone else as opposed 
Buw001.G.dialogueact400	760.469	762.679	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	as opposed to as uh remembrance agent which is what 
Buw001.G.dialogueact401	762.679	767.285	G	Grad	s	-1	0	agent which is what the that my primary thought in the information retrieval part of it would be 
Buw001.G.dialogueact402	768.632	769.312	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	but uh 
Buw001.G.dialogueact403	770.483	776.402	G	Grad	s	+1	0	i guess if you had a meeting participant they could use the summer to refresh themselves about the meeting and then makeup korea's but it's not 
Buw001.G.dialogueact404	776.402	776.982	G	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	but it's not 
Buw001.D.dialogueact405	777.827	778.357	D	Professor	b	-1	0	i i don't 
Buw001.G.dialogueact406	778.83	780.93	G	Grad	s^no	-1	0	i i don't know how to do it if until you have a system 
Buw001.B.dialogueact407	781.543	783.753	B	PhD	s	-1	0	the summer is actually going to drive the east then i mean 
Buw001.A.dialogueact409	782.356	782.646	A	Professor	b	-1	0	actually going to drive the 
Buw001.E.dialogueact408	781.868	782.168	E	PhD	b	-1	0	the summer is actually going to drive the 
Buw001.B.dialogueact410	783.753	786.113	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	east then i mean your research is going to be very circular but there is this yeah that that sort of thing 
Buw001.A.dialogueact412	784.56	784.82	A	Professor	b	-1	0	your research is going yeah that that sort of thing 
Buw001.G.dialogueact411	784.112	785.152	G	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	your research is going to be very circular but yeah that that sort of thing 
Buw001.E.dialogueact413	785.97	792.215	E	PhD	s	+1	0	to be very circular but there is this um there's cost of queer e.'s which of the things that you didn't realize from poland to the time that some in 
Buw001.E.dialogueact414	792.215	795.553	E	PhD	s^df^e:qy	+1	0	that some in much thinking i wanted and we talk about that and 
Buw001.E.dialogueact415	796.01	798.07	E	PhD	s.%--	+1	0	the that didn't attend summary but you and that's kind of what that's kind

Buw001.E.dialogueact417	798.13	801.53	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and that's kind of what that's kind of uh complete they can capture it's kind of nice it's full because 
Buw001.A.dialogueact418	801.511	802.051	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	it's full because of the things that

Buw001.E.dialogueact420	801.944	805.774	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	it's full because of the things that you wouldn't bother to make an effort to recall it but they get recorded 
Buw001.E.dialogueact422	807.14	811.44	E	PhD	s	-1	0	you so i mean and but no way generating as until we just plastic uh you know it's like 
Buw001.B.dialogueact424	811.86	813.5	B	PhD	s^cs^df	-1	0	you can always post hoc label them uh you know it's like right right 
Buw001.E.dialogueact423	811.44	812.07	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	you can always post hoc label uh you know it's like 
Buw001.E.dialogueact425	813.693	814.633	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	them right right exactly but i mean it's 
Buw001.B.dialogueact426	814.273	814.493	B	PhD	b	-1	0	exactly but i mean it's 
Buw001.B.dialogueact428	815.086	815.246	B	PhD	b	-1	0	difficult for the site 
Buw001.E.dialogueact427	814.633	818.423	E	PhD	s:qw	-1	0	exactly but i mean it's difficult for the site and if i was going to uh full questions about this what they they was 
Buw001.E.dialogueact429	819.013	820.433	E	PhD	s	-1	0	on the kind of things that come up 
Buw001.G.dialogueact430	821.128	822.368	G	Grad	s^df	-1	0	oh yeah but at least it would get this started 
Buw001.E.dialogueact431	822.81	823.11	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	oh yeah yeah so i also think that 
Buw001.E.dialogueact432	823.11	823.55	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah so i also think that 
Buw001.H.dialogueact433	823.24	831.619	H	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	yeah so i also think that if you if you can use these summaries as an indication of the important points of the of the meeting then you might get something like so 
Buw001.H.dialogueact434	831.861	836.101	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	something like so if the if the obscurity you want to know more about was some form of data collection you know maybe the 
Buw001.H.dialogueact435	836.476	840.026	H	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	you know maybe the summer i would say you know we discussed types of made date collection and you 
Buw001.H.dialogueact436	840.323	843.133	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and you know and maybe you could get to it by that if you if you have the the 
Buw001.H.dialogueact437	843.133	853.43	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	if you if you have the the larger structure of the of the discourse than if you can categorize what it is that you're looking for with reference to those those larger headings then you can find even if you 
Buw001.H.dialogueact438	853.43	856.453	H	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	find even if you don't have uh direct route to that 
Buw001.G.dialogueact439	855.413	855.613	G	Grad	b.%	-1	0	uh direct route 
Buw001.G.dialogueact441	857.392	861.749	G	Grad	s^ba^df^ng	-1	0	although it seems like that's um a high burden on the note taker i think that 
Buw001.H.dialogueact440	857.367	857.757	H	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	although it seems like i think that 
Buw001.G.dialogueact442	862.089	865.079	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	maybe it then they that's a pretty fine grain but in the take will have to take 
Buw001.B.dialogueact443	865.222	868.362	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	maybe it then they can put a student in to be an electric 
Buw001.A.dialogueact444	869.062	869.412	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	i know uh i 
Buw001.A.dialogueact445	869.412	869.872	A	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	i know uh i 
Buw001.A.dialogueact446	869.872	878.071	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	i know uh i think you got to have somebody was the topic or you know whose job it is delegated to be the note taker somebody who's been no i 
Buw001.B.dialogueact447	869.938	870.148	B	PhD	qw^br^m	-1	0	i know uh i think you got to have somebody 
Buw001.D.dialogueact448	874.812	875.242	D	Professor	b	-1	0	the topic or you know whose job it 
Buw001.A.dialogueact449	878.271	879.411	A	Professor	s^e	-1	0	somebody who's been meaning no i mean but someone 
Buw001.B.dialogueact450	878.831	885.461	B	PhD	s^ar|s^df.%--	-1	0	somebody who's been meaning no i mean but someone who can come sit in on the meetings and then takes the notes with them that the real note taker but they 
Buw001.G.dialogueact451	882.139	882.409	G	Grad	%-	-1	0	and then takes but they 
Buw001.B.dialogueact452	886.119	891.199	B	PhD	s	-1	0	that way that one student has you know a rough idea of what was going on and they can 
Buw001.B.dialogueact453	891.667	893.077	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and they can use it for their research i mean this isn't really necessarily 
Buw001.B.dialogueact454	893.077	896.447	B	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean this isn't really necessarily what you would do in a real system 
Buw001.G.dialogueact455	896.504	896.874	G	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Buw001.B.dialogueact456	897.09	898.48	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because that that's a lot of trouble and maybe it's 
Buw001.D.dialogueact457	897.114	897.514	D	Professor	b	-1	0	because that that's a lot of 
Buw001.B.dialogueact458	898.55	900.04	B	PhD	s	-1	0	trouble and maybe it's not the best way to do it but if you had some students 
Buw001.B.dialogueact460	900.38	906.299	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	but if you had some students that want to study that then they should sort of get to know the people and attend those meetings and get 
Buw001.D.dialogueact459	900.205	900.715	D	Professor	b	-1	0	but if you had some students 
Buw001.B.dialogueact461	906.299	908.655	B	PhD	s^cs^e	-1	0	and get the notes from the no takers well 
Buw001.G.dialogueact462	907.09	907.31	G	Grad	b	-1	0	the notes from the no takers 
Buw001.D.dialogueact463	908.867	909.167	D	Professor	b.%	-1	0	well i think that's a little 
Buw001.G.dialogueact464	908.905	910.685	G	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	well i think that's a little bit of a problem there 
Buw001.G.dialogueact465	910.685	914.145	G	Grad	s	-1	0	bit of a problem there sort of note-taking application stuff they've been doing for the last couple 
Buw001.G.dialogueact466	914.145	915.585	G	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	they've been doing for the last couple of years and i don't think 
Buw001.G.dialogueact467	915.585	917.225	G	Grad	s	-1	0	of years and i don't think anyone is still working on it think they've 
Buw001.D.dialogueact469	917.971	918.331	D	Professor	b	-1	0	it think they've done 
Buw001.G.dialogueact468	917.761	918.461	G	Grad	s	-1	0	it think they've done 
Buw001.G.dialogueact470	919.336	923.161	G	Grad	s	-1	0	i'm so i'm not sure that they have anyone currently working on notes of what we have to interest 
Buw001.G.dialogueact471	923.161	927.251	G	Grad	s	-1	0	of what we have to interest someone in is the combination of known speech 
Buw001.B.dialogueact472	927.852	928.142	B	PhD	b	-1	0	and so the question is is there 
Buw001.G.dialogueact473	928.08	929.68	G	Grad	qh	-1	0	and so the question is is there such a person i think 
Buw001.G.dialogueact474	929.68	931.7	G	Grad	s	-1	0	such a person i think right now the answer's no 
Buw001.A.dialogueact476	932.367	933.037	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	been taking i've been thinking just to see 
Buw001.D.dialogueact475	932.21	933.16	D	Professor	s	-1	0	been taking i've been thinking just to see 
Buw001.G.dialogueact477	932.463	933.143	G	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	been taking i've been thinking just to see 
Buw001.D.dialogueact478	933.48	936.93	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i've been thinking about a little bit here about this this that um 
Buw001.D.dialogueact479	937.392	938.262	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i think that uh 
Buw001.D.dialogueact480	939.557	946.037	D	Professor	s	+1	1	now i'm thinking that the summary summary uh is actually a reasonable uh bootstrap into this into what we'd like to get out it's it's not ideal 
Buw001.D.dialogueact481	946.037	947.077	D	Professor	s^ba^bd	-1	0	it's it's not ideal but we you know we 
Buw001.D.dialogueact482	947.077	949.317	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but we you know we we could start someplace place i 
Buw001.D.dialogueact483	949.696	953.467	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	place i just thinking about um suppose we wanted to get we have this 
Buw001.D.dialogueact484	953.467	954.667	D	Professor	s	-1	0	to get we have this collection mainly five 
Buw001.D.dialogueact485	954.667	955.757	D	Professor	s	-1	0	collection mainly five hours of stuff 
Buw001.D.dialogueact486	956.291	957.531	D	Professor	s	-1	0	uh we get that transcribe sally five 
Buw001.D.dialogueact487	957.531	959.051	D	Professor	s	+1	1	sally five hours of meetings and 
Buw001.D.dialogueact488	959.484	964.074	D	Professor	s:qw	+1	0	and uh you ask me uh uh morgan what what you know what kind of questions you want to ask i 
Buw001.D.dialogueact489	964.871	966.871	D	Professor	s^no	+1	1	i wouldn't have any idea what kind of questions i want to ask i'd have 
Buw001.D.dialogueact490	966.871	968.001	D	Professor	s	-1	0	questions i want to ask i'd have to get started someplace so in fact if i looked 
Buw001.D.dialogueact491	968.001	971.901	D	Professor	s:s	+1	0	in fact if i looked at a summary of it i go oh yeah i was in that meeting 
Buw001.D.dialogueact492	972.498	973.338	D	Professor	s:s	-1	0	i remember that 
Buw001.D.dialogueact493	973.901	975.801	D	Professor	s.%--:qw.%--	-1	0	what was the part that and 
Buw001.D.dialogueact494	975.943	985.515	D	Professor	s	+1	1	the part that and and that i think that might and help me to think of things even things aren't listed in the summary just as or as a reserve refreshed of what the general things going on meeting 
Buw001.G.dialogueact495	981.051	981.491	G	Grad	b	-1	0	just as or as 
Buw001.A.dialogueact496	986.174	988.244	A	Professor	s	-1	0	i think it serves two purposes purposes one as sort 
Buw001.A.dialogueact497	988.244	991.822	A	Professor	s	-1	0	one as sort of a refreshed to help bootstrap but 
Buw001.D.dialogueact498	990.4	990.8	D	Professor	b	-1	0	bootstrap 
Buw001.D.dialogueact499	991.311	991.731	D	Professor	b	-1	0	but 
Buw001.A.dialogueact500	991.822	995.602	A	Professor	s	-1	0	but also i mean maybe we do want to generate summaries and then oh yeah that's true too 
Buw001.A.dialogueact502	995.652	998.708	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and then it's you know it's kind of a key oh yeah that's true too yeah absolutely then you want to have it 
Buw001.D.dialogueact501	995.263	996.133	D	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	and then it's oh yeah that's true too 
Buw001.E.dialogueact503	997.015	997.385	E	PhD	b	-1	0	you know it's kind of yeah absolutely then 
Buw001.G.dialogueact504	997.063	998.723	G	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	you know it's kind of a key yeah absolutely then you want to have it 
Buw001.A.dialogueact506	999.465	999.745	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	so how does this summer 
Buw001.B.dialogueact505	999.32	1000.94	B	PhD	qw	-1	0	so how does this summer and get generated i'm 
Buw001.A.dialogueact508	1001.29	1002.14	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	not against the idea of a summary but by hand 
Buw001.B.dialogueact507	1000.94	1002.63	B	PhD	s^df^rt	-1	0	and get generated i'm not against the idea of a summary but by hand 
Buw001.G.dialogueact509	1001.38	1001.88	G	Grad	s	-1	0	not against the idea by hand 
Buw001.B.dialogueact510	1002.63	1006.08	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	of a summary but i wanted to think carefully about how it was generating it and how because the 
Buw001.A.dialogueact511	1004.49	1005.09	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	carefully about how it was generating it 
Buw001.B.dialogueact512	1006.08	1006.52	B	PhD	s^df^e.%--	-1	0	and how because the 
Buw001.B.dialogueact513	1006.59	1009.45	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	what and how because the summary will dry 
Buw001.A.dialogueact515	1009.93	1013.06	A	Professor	s	-1	0	what i i think you know you in most meetings this one being 
Buw001.B.dialogueact514	1009.79	1010.22	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	what i i think 
Buw001.A.dialogueact516	1013.34	1014.85	A	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	this one being different but 
Buw001.A.dialogueact517	1014.95	1021.89	A	Professor	s	+1	0	different but in most meetings that i attend there's somebody explicitly taking notes frequently on a laptop 
Buw001.A.dialogueact518	1022.57	1025.07	A	Professor	s	-1	0	um you can just make it be on a laptop so then you're dealing 
Buw001.B.dialogueact519	1022.72	1023.07	B	PhD	b	-1	0	um you can just make it 
Buw001.A.dialogueact520	1025.07	1026.68	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	so then you're dealing with asking and nothing 
Buw001.A.dialogueact521	1026.68	1027.25	A	Professor	s^df^e.%--	-1	0	with asking and nothing that you have to go 
Buw001.A.dialogueact522	1027.25	1029.68	A	Professor	s^df^e	-1	0	that you have to go through handwriting recognition 
Buw001.A.dialogueact523	1030.49	1035.99	A	Professor	s	+1	0	um and then they post edited into a a summary 
Buw001.A.dialogueact524	1035.99	1037.4	A	Professor	s	+1	0	a summary in the email it up ten minutes and it happens 
Buw001.A.dialogueact525	1037.4	1038.87	A	Professor	s	-1	0	minutes and it happens in most meetings i 
Buw001.H.dialogueact526	1039.01	1042.59	H	Postdoc	s^df^rt	-1	0	i think that um there's freezing summary two different ways so what 
Buw001.H.dialogueact527	1042.65	1045.21	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	ways so what you just described i would describe as minutes and what 
Buw001.G.dialogueact528	1044.16	1044.5	G	Grad	s^2	-1	0	describe as minutes 
Buw001.A.dialogueact530	1045.53	1045.78	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	and what 
Buw001.B.dialogueact532	1045.79	1046.43	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and what i originally thought was 
Buw001.E.dialogueact529	1045.43	1045.67	E	PhD	b.%	-1	0	and what 
Buw001.H.dialogueact531	1045.58	1049.72	H	Postdoc	s.%--:qw	-1	0	and what i originally thought was um if you ask someone what was the meeting about 
Buw001.B.dialogueact533	1046.63	1047.01	B	PhD	b	-1	0	i originally thought was um if you 
Buw001.A.dialogueact535	1050.47	1050.8	A	Professor	b	-1	0	and then they would 
Buw001.H.dialogueact534	1050.35	1052.4	H	Postdoc	s^e:s	-1	0	and then they would say well we talked about this and then we talked 
Buw001.H.dialogueact536	1052.4	1053.54	H	Postdoc	s^e:s	-1	0	this and then we talked about that it's also 
Buw001.H.dialogueact537	1053.54	1054.6	H	Postdoc	s^e:s	-1	0	about that it's also talked about and then 
Buw001.H.dialogueact538	1054.88	1055.79	H	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	talked about and then you'd have like 
Buw001.H.dialogueact539	1056.11	1061.87	H	Postdoc	s	+1	2	eight at my thought was you to have multiple people summarize it on recording rather than writing because 
Buw001.H.dialogueact540	1061.87	1063.18	H	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	rather than writing because writing takes time and you get irrelevant 
Buw001.H.dialogueact541	1063.18	1066.27	H	Postdoc	s^e.%--	-1	0	and you get irrelevant other things that it takes time that whereas if you 
Buw001.A.dialogueact542	1066.2	1066.56	A	Professor	b	-1	0	that whereas if you 
Buw001.H.dialogueact543	1066.65	1068.83	H	Postdoc	s.%--	+1	0	that whereas if you just say it immediately after the meeting 
Buw001.H.dialogueact544	1069.5	1072.48	H	Postdoc	s	+1	2	you know but two minute summary of what the meeting was about i think you get uh 
Buw001.H.dialogueact545	1072.89	1073.72	H	Postdoc	s^e.%--	-1	0	get uh with most see i i 
Buw001.H.dialogueact546	1073.72	1075.7	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	with most see i i also worry about having a single note taker because 
Buw001.H.dialogueact547	1075.7	1077.78	H	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	note taker because that's just one person's perception 
Buw001.H.dialogueact548	1078.21	1079.22	H	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and um you know it 
Buw001.H.dialogueact549	1079.63	1083.18	H	Postdoc	s^df^e	-1	0	you know it it's relevant it's relative to what your focus was on that meeting and people have 
Buw001.D.dialogueact550	1080.64	1081.34	D	Professor	b	-1	0	it's relevant it's relative to what your focus 
Buw001.H.dialogueact551	1083.18	1086.72	H	Postdoc	s^df^e	-1	0	and people have different major topics that they're interested in so 
Buw001.D.dialogueact552	1087.04	1087.26	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	my proposal would 
Buw001.H.dialogueact553	1087.04	1095.0	H	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	2	my proposal would be that you may be worth considering both of those types of note-taking and a spontaneous oral summary afterwards no longer than two minutes 
Buw001.A.dialogueact554	1091.49	1091.86	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	of note-taking

Buw001.D.dialogueact703	1289.88	1294.45	D	Professor	s	-1	0	the key thing there's this is description no database collection effort that they're talking about doing and

Buw001.D.dialogueact705	1294.92	1300.79	D	Professor	s	-1	0	doing and it's a database existing include some visual information it doesn't mean and then the two researchers going to make any sense 
Buw001.D.dialogueact706	1301.39	1301.59	D	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	right so 
Buw001.H.dialogueact707	1301.4	1301.8	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	right so

Buw001.B.dialogueact747	1362.92	1372.78	B	PhD	s	+1	0	group and they have said i talked to the student who done dennis that with two fairly inexpensive cameras they they just recorder all the time and were 
Buw001.D.dialogueact748	1371.38	1371.73	D	Professor	b	-1	0	they just recorder

Buw001.B.dialogueact750	1378.55	1388.21	B	PhD	s^df	+1	0	so i think we would be we might lose the chance to use his yeah for somebody later who wants to do some kind of processing on it if we don't i i i don't disagree i think that if you have that

Buw001.G.dialogueact753	1392.08	1397.55	G	Grad	s	+1	1	the problem with it is you'll have more people who don't want to be filmed then who don't want to be recorded so well she's

Buw001.B.dialogueact830	1518.37	1518.59	B	PhD	b	-1	0	um 
Buw001.D.dialogueact831	1518.44	1518.91	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Buw001.A.dialogueact833	1519.41	1519.57	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	i i i'm not worried 
Buw001.D.dialogueact832	1519.33	1521.74	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i i i'm not worried about the cost of setting it up i'm 
Buw001.D.dialogueact834	1521.83	1524.34	D	Professor	s	-1	0	it up i'm worried about the cost people looking at another it's 
Buw001.D.dialogueact835	1524.59	1528.33	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	at another it's just it you'd be kind of silly the collected all the not look at his at all and so 
Buw001.D.dialogueact836	1528.33	1534.43	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	all and so i i i think that we do have to do some picking and choosing of the stuff they were doing but i 
Buw001.D.dialogueact837	1534.88	1540.5	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	doing but i i haven't i do think that we minimally what something we might want to look at at some some uh some sense of that bike 
Buw001.D.dialogueact838	1540.5	1545.89	D	Professor	s^cs^e	+1	2	of the board or at least make of that bike for meeting like this at least uh take a polaroid of it of the of the boards and exactly 
Buw001.B.dialogueact839	1544.02	1544.75	B	PhD	s^2	-1	0	of the board of the of the

Buw001.B.dialogueact841	1545.46	1550.36	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	or at least make sure that the note taker takes so yeah snapshot of the boards and and know the position exactly 
Buw001.D.dialogueact843	1545.95	1546.42	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	or at least make sure that the note taker boards and exactly 
Buw001.H.dialogueact842	1545.51	1545.98	H	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	or at least make boards and exactly 
Buw001.D.dialogueact844	1549.71	1549.95	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	snapshot of the 
Buw001.D.dialogueact845	1550.39	1552.19	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	that'll make it a lot easier for meetings and know the position of the people exactly 
Buw001.B.dialogueact846	1551.22	1554.09	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	that'll make it a lot easier for meetings that are structured i mean otherwise of the people exactly 
Buw001.H.dialogueact847	1552.13	1552.59	H	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	easier for meetings exactly 
Buw001.A.dialogueact848	1553.6	1554.04	A	Professor	b	-1	0	that are structured i mean otherwise 
Buw001.B.dialogueact849	1554.09	1561.7	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	i mean otherwise later on if nobody wrote this stuff on the board down we have a harder time summarize either agreeing on some especially 
Buw001.H.dialogueact850	1560.42	1560.75	H	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	either agreeing 
Buw001.H.dialogueact851	1561.68	1563.19	H	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	on some especially this is common knowledge i mean this is shared knowledge 
Buw001.H.dialogueact852	1563.19	1565.47	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i mean this is shared knowledge among all the participants and it's a shame 
Buw001.H.dialogueact853	1565.47	1567.36	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and it's a shame to keep it off the recording 
Buw001.G.dialogueact855	1569.32	1570.28	G	Grad	s^nd.%--	-1	0	except in or if we

Buw001.G.dialogueact856	1570.33	1573.94	G	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	or if we weren't recording this this this would get lost right 
Buw001.D.dialogueact858	1575.65	1575.96	D	Professor	b	-1	0	well i 
Buw001.H.dialogueact857	1575.53	1577.05	H	Postdoc	s^bd^no	-1	0	well i don't understand that point and i just think that d. 
Buw001.H.dialogueact859	1577.05	1578.14	H	Postdoc	s^df.%-	-1	0	point is that we're not and i just think that d. 
Buw001.G.dialogueact860	1578.33	1580.21	G	Grad	s	-1	0	point is that we're not saving it anyway 
Buw001.G.dialogueact861	1581.39	1581.71	G	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right in 
Buw001.G.dialogueact863	1581.71	1583.88	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	right in in our real life setting 
Buw001.H.dialogueact862	1581.49	1581.74	H	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	right in 
Buw001.A.dialogueact864	1584.08	1585.71	A	Professor	qw	-1	0	what do you mean we're not saving it anyway i've written 
Buw001.A.dialogueact865	1585.71	1588.3	A	Professor	s	-1	0	it anyway i've written all of this down and it's getting e. mailed to you and you're going to set it up i know too well it's 
Buw001.C.dialogueact866	1587.47	1589.03	C	Professor	s^na	-1	0	it's getting e. mailed to you and you're going to set it up i know too well it's in that case we don't need to take 
Buw001.G.dialogueact867	1588.67	1590.81	G	Grad	s	-1	0	you it up i know too well it's in that case we don't need to take pictures of it 
Buw001.B.dialogueact868	1591.67	1596.96	B	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	well that's what that's what i'm saying right that would be the other alternatives to make sure that anything that was on the board um it's in the record 
Buw001.A.dialogueact869	1592.21	1592.56	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	would be the other alternatives 
Buw001.C.dialogueact870	1592.44	1593.02	C	Professor	b	-1	0	would be the other alternatives to make sure that anything 
Buw001.H.dialogueact871	1592.86	1593.0	H	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	would be the other alternatives to make sure that anything 
Buw001.A.dialogueact872	1595.73	1600.44	A	Professor	s	-1	0	well that's what that's what i'm saying that i think the taking would be i think in many um it's in the record 
Buw001.A.dialogueact873	1600.5	1604.47	A	Professor	s	-1	0	be i think in many for many meetings there will be some sort of taking 
Buw001.A.dialogueact874	1605.5	1609.22	A	Professor	s	-1	0	in which case that's a useful thing to have it 
Buw001.A.dialogueact875	1609.86	1611.98	A	Professor	s^bd^df	-1	0	it i mean we we don't need to require it just 
Buw001.A.dialogueact877	1611.98	1612.72	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	need to require it just like that i 
Buw001.G.dialogueact876	1611.94	1612.31	G	Grad	b	-1	0	need to require it just like that i 
Buw001.A.dialogueact878	1613.19	1616.34	A	Professor	s	-1	0	mean i think it would be great if we try to get a picture with every meeting 
Buw001.A.dialogueact879	1617.15	1617.78	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Buw001.H.dialogueact880	1617.17	1617.35	H	Postdoc	s^na.%	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Buw001.A.dialogueact881	1618.71	1621.05	A	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	so so we won't worry about requiring these things but the more things 
Buw001.A.dialogueact882	1621.05	1626.89	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but the more things that we can get it for more useful it will be for various applications 
Buw001.A.dialogueact884	1627.45	1627.7	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	so so 
Buw001.D.dialogueact883	1627.26	1627.5	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	so so 
Buw001.D.dialogueact885	1628.03	1633.41	D	Professor	s^t^tc	-1	0	i mean departing for a moment from the data collection question but actually talking about you know this group and but we actually want to do uh 
Buw001.D.dialogueact886	1634.05	1641.77	D	Professor	s^bu^rt	-1	0	so i guess that's the way you where you were figuring on doing was was was uh putting together some notes and sending them to to everybody 
Buw001.D.dialogueact887	1642.52	1643.56	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Buw001.D.dialogueact888	1643.83	1644.15	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Buw001.D.dialogueact889	1645.73	1646.01	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Buw001.D.dialogueact890	1647.28	1647.67	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Buw001.H.dialogueact891	1647.28	1647.53	H	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Buw001.D.dialogueact892	1650.73	1656.4	D	Professor	s^t	+1	2	so so the question that we started with was whether there is anything else we should do during during the during the collection i guess across 
Buw001.B.dialogueact893	1653.43	1653.51	B	PhD	s^ba^t1.%	-1	0	whether there is anything else 
Buw001.D.dialogueact894	1656.4	1658.51	D	Professor	s	+1	2	collection i guess across pads are certain one idea 
Buw001.D.dialogueact895	1659.4	1661.55	D	Professor	s	-1	0	uh and look at them from him one just do that right and 
Buw001.D.dialogueact896	1661.69	1661.98	D	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	do that right and 
Buw001.D.dialogueact897	1662.05	1666.22	D	Professor	s	-1	0	then the next thing we talked about was the it was the summaries and 
Buw001.D.dialogueact898	1667.01	1671.53	D	Professor	qh	-1	0	every going to do anything about that 
Buw001.A.dialogueact899	1672.45	1676.08	A	Professor	s	-1	0	well before we leave the cross paths and in college done so if oh okay 
Buw001.D.dialogueact900	1674.35	1674.81	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	and oh okay 
Buw001.A.dialogueact901	1676.64	1683.57	A	Professor	s.x	-1	0	so if i'm collecting data then there is this question of do i use cross paths 
Buw001.D.dialogueact902	1678.32	1678.62	D	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Buw001.A.dialogueact903	1684.39	1695.92	A	Professor	s	-1	0	so i think that yes we really seriously have me collect data and they can't use cross paths it's probably less useful for you guys to go to the trouble of using it 
Buw001.A.dialogueact904	1696.81	1700.16	A	Professor	fh|s^df.%--	-1	0	unless you think that the cross paths are going to 
Buw001.A.dialogueact905	1700.38	1700.46	A	Professor	%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Buw001.A.dialogueact906	1701.58	1703.22	A	Professor	s^no	-1	0	i'm not i'm not sure what they're going to do but but having 
Buw001.A.dialogueact907	1703.22	1706.0	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but but having a small percentage of the data with it i'm not sure 
Buw001.A.dialogueact908	1706.0	1708.81	A	Professor	s	-1	0	not sure whether that's useful or not 
Buw001.A.dialogueact910	1709.17	1710.36	A	Professor	s^bd^df^rt	-1	0	maybe maybe something get they we just do 
Buw001.D.dialogueact909	1709.1	1709.42	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	maybe maybe something 
Buw001.A.dialogueact911	1710.36	1711.97	A	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	get they we just do it and see what happens 
Buw001.D.dialogueact912	1712.33	1718.94	D	Professor	s	+1	0	i guess the point was to try again to try to collect more information that could be useful later for for the life stuff 
Buw001.A.dialogueact913	1718.92	1719.34	A	Professor	b	-1	0	life stuff that sort of landing 
Buw001.D.dialogueact914	1719.55	1720.92	D	Professor	s	-1	0	that sort of landing supplying it so 
Buw001.D.dialogueact915	1720.92	1723.28	D	Professor	s	-1	0	supplying it so that my new stuff can easy to do so it 
Buw001.A.dialogueact916	1722.33	1722.62	A	Professor	b	-1	0	can easy to do 
Buw001.D.dialogueact917	1723.28	1726.93	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so it right now you can operating from zero and 
Buw001.A.dialogueact918	1726.07	1726.5	A	Professor	s^2	-1	0	zero and 
Buw001.D.dialogueact919	1726.93	1731.93	D	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	zero and so even if we didn't get done for me to w. it seems like that would still for 
Buw001.A.dialogueact920	1731.68	1732.03	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	i think for me at least try it 
Buw001.D.dialogueact921	1731.93	1732.79	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	i think for me at least try it 
Buw001.B.dialogueact922	1732.86	1736.39	B	PhD	s	+1	0	right i think if useful to have a small amount of it just as a proof of concept me at least try it and 
Buw001.D.dialogueact923	1734.62	1734.94	D	Professor	b	-1	0	amount of 
Buw001.B.dialogueact924	1736.39	1736.58	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	right and 
Buw001.A.dialogueact925	1736.9	1737.37	A	Professor	b	-1	0	right okay you know what you can do with things and and they seem to 
Buw001.A.dialogueact928	1737.45	1737.83	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay you know what you can do with things and they seem to 
Buw001.B.dialogueact927	1737.12	1738.5	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	okay you know what you can do with things and they seem to not be able to give 
Buw001.G.dialogueact926	1736.96	1739.99	G	Grad	s	-1	0	right okay you know what you can do with things and and they seem to not be able to give enough of them away so 
Buw001.G.dialogueact929	1739.99	1741.8	G	Grad	s	-1	0	that's yeah enough of them away so we could probably get more as well 
Buw001.B.dialogueact930	1741.37	1745.29	B	PhD	s^aa|s^cs	-1	0	that's true so it it it it seems to be really useful to you guys yeah but not not to rely on them for basic modeling as well 
Buw001.A.dialogueact931	1741.96	1742.61	A	Professor	s^na	-1	0	that's true so it it yeah but not not to rely as well 
Buw001.A.dialogueact932	1742.61	1747.79	A	Professor	s	-1	0	true so it it it it seems to be really useful to you guys we could probably get a donation to me but not not to rely on them for basic modeling yeah 
Buw001.G.dialogueact933	1747.9	1748.63	G	Grad	s^aa|s^no	-1	0	to me yeah i'm not sure i think it it 
Buw001.G.dialogueact934	1748.63	1751.35	G	Grad	s	-1	0	i'm not sure i think it it it will again depend on land day and he has a student 
Buw001.G.dialogueact935	1751.35	1753.01	G	Grad	s	-1	0	day and he has a student who's interested and how much infrastructure will 
Buw001.G.dialogueact936	1753.01	1754.38	G	Grad	s	-1	0	how much infrastructure will need it's easy 
Buw001.G.dialogueact937	1754.69	1756.19	G	Grad	s	-1	0	need it's easy we can just do it um 
Buw001.D.dialogueact938	1756.54	1756.81	D	Professor	b	-1	0	it um 
Buw001.G.dialogueact939	1756.96	1759.62	G	Grad	s	-1	0	it um but if it requires a lot of our time we probably won't do it 
Buw001.A.dialogueact940	1760.2	1760.46	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	guess a lot of stuff for 
Buw001.D.dialogueact941	1760.22	1762.27	D	Professor	s	+1	1	guess a lot of stuff for doing how really is pilot months after another yeah yeah 
Buw001.D.dialogueact942	1762.36	1763.23	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	months after another and so we try it out yeah yeah we have to sort of figure out where 
Buw001.G.dialogueact943	1762.53	1764.61	G	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	months after another and so we try it out and see how it works yeah yeah we have to sort of figure out where we're going to do right 
Buw001.D.dialogueact944	1763.29	1765.13	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and so we try it out and see how it works we have to sort of figure out where we're going to do right 
Buw001.G.dialogueact945	1764.61	1764.93	G	Grad	qy^d^g	-1	0	and see how it works we're going to do right 
Buw001.A.dialogueact946	1765.33	1765.73	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Buw001.B.dialogueact947	1766.28	1768.72	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	i just want they send in the modeling i'm having those right 
Buw001.A.dialogueact949	1769.17	1769.5	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right i agree i agree 
Buw001.B.dialogueact950	1769.21	1769.48	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	right i agree i agree 
Buw001.G.dialogueact948	1768.95	1770.48	G	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	right having those right i agree i agree with that 
Buw001.B.dialogueact951	1769.89	1770.12	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	right i agree i agree with that 
Buw001.A.dialogueact952	1770.7	1771.03	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	with that i 
Buw001.A.dialogueact953	1771.63	1772.01	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	i think the the importance 
Buw001.G.dialogueact954	1771.97	1774.67	G	Grad	s^ba	+1	0	i think the the importance marking is a good idea though 
Buw001.G.dialogueact955	1775.62	1777.94	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	to be sort of cool i mean it would that if people have something in front of them 
Buw001.B.dialogueact956	1776.2	1777.04	B	PhD	s^ba^na	-1	0	to be sort of cool i mean it would people have something in front of them

Buw001.B.dialogueact958	1778.35	1778.79	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah 
Buw001.B.dialogueact959	1779.24	1780.53	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	that we shouldn't be hard for yeah 
Buw001.G.dialogueact960	1780.39	1780.62	G	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	for yeah 
Buw001.G.dialogueact961	1781.31	1783.84	G	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	do throughout pilots are laptops or something

Buw001.H.dialogueact1038	1900.33	1900.61	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	what i was thinking is though they 
Buw001.G.dialogueact1039	1902.05	1903.9	G	Grad	s	-1	0	and you have to hook them up the recorder 
Buw001.G.dialogueact1040	1904.4	1906.37	G	Grad	s	-1	0	so if they're already here i think that's good but if they're not already 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1042	1906.7	1907.1	A	Professor	b	-1	0	good but if they're not already here 
Buw001.G.dialogueact1041	1906.37	1909.16	G	Grad	s	-1	0	good but if they're not already here for i'd rather do e. mail i much yeah i just

Buw001.H.dialogueact1237	2196.32	2197.97	H	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because in terms of like informative that's it 
Buw001.B.dialogueact1238	2196.82	2197.44	B	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	because in terms of like informative that's it 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1239	2197.97	2204.31	H	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	damn doesn't know be the most likely thing like informative that's it might be you know that the summary would would nodding even include what the person thought was the most interesting 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1240	2203.5	2205.16	D	Professor	s	-1	0	damn doesn't know what section be the most likely thing 
Buw001.B.dialogueact1241	2204.39	2206.24	B	PhD	s^j	-1	0	damn doesn't know what section be the most likely thing 
Buw001.E.dialogueact1242	2206.84	2207.41	E	PhD	s^j^na	-1	0	everything 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1243	2208.05	2214.13	A	Professor	s^na	-1	0	but actually i would say that's a better thing to ask than have them summarize the meaning i think you get two different 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1244	2214.3	2215.93	H	Postdoc	s^df^na	-1	0	you get too i think you get two different types of information 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1245	2215.44	2216.01	A	Professor	s^m.%--	-1	0	you get too yeah that's true types of information because you get 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1246	2216.01	2216.82	A	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	yeah that's true because you get 
Buw001.E.dialogueact1247	2216.21	2216.41	E	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah that's true because you get 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1248	2216.53	2220.83	H	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	yeah that's true because you get like the general structure of important points to what the what the meeting was about 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1249	2220.16	2220.35	D	Professor	s^t3	-1	0	was about 
Buw001.B.dialogueact1250	2221.25	2221.82	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	we're still here 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1251	2221.53	2221.72	D	Professor	s^aa^t3	-1	0	we're still here 
Buw001.G.dialogueact1252	2221.55	2222.11	G	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	we're still here 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1253	2223.24	2227.19	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so you get the general structure the port important point so what the meeting was about with a summary but with the 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1254	2227.63	2229.89	H	Postdoc	qh	-1	0	but with the what's the most interesting thing you learn 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1255	2230.21	2235.95	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you can keep them um so the fact that uh i know the transcriber uses snack is something that i thought was interesting in 
Buw001.B.dialogueact1256	2233.43	2234.35	B	PhD	s^t3	-1	0	you can keep them uses snack is something that 
Buw001.E.dialogueact1257	2234.07	2234.93	E	PhD	s^t3	-1	0	you can keep them is something that 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1258	2235.95	2237.93	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i thought was interesting in that in that down worked on on that 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1259	2238.24	2239.3	H	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	so that that that was really yeah so 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1260	2239.77	2239.93	H	Postdoc	s^f	-1	0	yeah so 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1261	2239.93	2244.58	H	Postdoc	s	+1	0	yeah so i mean you you could get pick up some of the micro items it wouldn't even brokerage major headings but 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1262	2242.84	2243.38	A	Professor	b	-1	0	items it wouldn't even brokerage major 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1263	2244.88	2246.38	H	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	headings but could be very informative 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1264	2250.81	2252.25	A	Professor	s^aa|s^ba^na	-1	0	yeah that's actually a really good idea 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1265	2253.24	2255.47	H	Postdoc	s^df^e	+1	0	i think it wouldn't be too it cost intensity there and he's like something 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1266	2255.47	2258.6	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	there and he's like something someone can do pretty easily on the spur of the moment 
Buw001.C.dialogueact1267	2261.51	2264.12	C	Professor	qr	-1	0	i was thinking about this asking one participant or all of them because many 
Buw001.G.dialogueact1268	2264.8	2265.91	G	Grad	s	-1	0	because many are willing to do it 
Buw001.C.dialogueact1269	2267.57	2268.77	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	make it a voluntary thing and yeah because you can't because you got 
Buw001.E.dialogueact1270	2267.74	2267.97	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	make it a voluntary yeah because 
Buw001.E.dialogueact1271	2267.97	2270.49	E	PhD	s^df|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	make it a voluntary thing and yeah that's yeah because you can't because you got very different for everybody right 
Buw001.C.dialogueact1272	2268.77	2269.18	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	thing and you can't because you got very different for everybody 
Buw001.C.dialogueact1273	2270.36	2271.94	C	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah that's why it's unreal right well maybe 
Buw001.E.dialogueact1274	2270.81	2270.96	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah that's right 
Buw001.G.dialogueact1275	2271.68	2274.63	G	Grad	s^cs.%--	-1	0	why it's unreal well maybe one thing we could do is for the meetings we've already done 
Buw001.G.dialogueact1276	2275.58	2277.77	G	Grad	s^bd	-1	0	and we didn't take minutes and we don't have summaries but 
Buw001.G.dialogueact1277	2277.77	2282.0	G	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	summaries but uh people could like listen to them a little bit and generate some 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1278	2283.12	2283.29	H	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Buw001.G.dialogueact1279	2285.25	2286.21	G	Grad	s	-1	0	course changes need to i'm sure you have that 
Buw001.G.dialogueact1280	2286.21	2288.29	G	Grad	s	-1	0	to i'm sure you have that meeting memorized by 
Buw001.E.dialogueact1281	2287.84	2288.2	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	meeting memorized by 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1282	2290.83	2295.97	A	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	but actually would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say what was most interesting thing 
Buw001.G.dialogueact1283	2291.4	2291.8	G	Grad	b	-1	0	actually would be an easy 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1284	2296.87	2296.96	H	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Buw001.H.dialogueact1285	2297.04	2297.1	H	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Buw001.A.dialogueact1286	2298.3	2299.92	A	Professor	s^e	-1	0	for those two people willing to 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1287	2301.03	2303.14	H	Postdoc	s^na.%--	-1	0	that's i think would pick up the micro structure some 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1288	2303.99	2305.46	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and and that might be something some some little things 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1289	2304.65	2307.58	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and and that might be something people are willing to stay for some little things 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1290	2308.93	2310.53	D	Professor	s^no.%-	-1	0	yeah but when you go around the room and i i don't know how we get it or want to get up and leave features 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1291	2309.21	2309.91	H	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	yeah and i i don't know how we get or want features 
Buw001.C.dialogueact1293	2309.99	2313.93	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	yeah but when you go around the room you might just get defect that somebody says something and and i i don't know how we get it or want to get up and leave features 
Buw001.G.dialogueact1292	2309.71	2310.82	G	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	yeah but when you go around the room and i i don't know how we get it or want to get up and leave features 
Buw001.C.dialogueact1294	2313.93	2316.78	C	Professor	s:s^aa|s^na	-1	0	says something and then you go around the room and they say yeah me too i agree me too me too me too 
Buw001.G.dialogueact1295	2314.6	2315.61	G	Grad	s^2:s	-1	0	then you go around the room and they say yeah me too me too me too me too 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1296	2317.0	2317.47	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	that's fine on the other hand people 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1298	2317.58	2318.2	A	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	that's fine on the other hand people might try college if 
Buw001.C.dialogueact1299	2317.82	2318.18	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	that's fine on the other hand people might try college if 
Buw001.E.dialogueact1297	2317.43	2319.58	E	PhD	s|qy^d^g	-1	0	that's fine on the other hand people might try college if someone tried to myself 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1300	2318.8	2319.1	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	might try college if someone tried to myself 
Buw001.E.dialogueact1301	2319.58	2320.77	E	PhD	s:s	-1	0	someone tried to myself that woman asking well 
Buw001.E.dialogueact1303	2320.77	2321.66	E	PhD	s^e:s	-1	0	that woman asking something out well you have 
Buw001.G.dialogueact1302	2320.43	2320.72	G	Grad	%-	-1	0	that woman asking well 
Buw001.G.dialogueact1304	2321.75	2324.21	G	Grad	s	-1	0	something out you have the other thing that that they know why we're doing it what 
Buw001.G.dialogueact1305	2325.07	2330.48	G	Grad	s^e	+1	1	mean we'll we'll be telling him the reason we're trying to do this is is to generate crease in the future so try to pick 
Buw001.G.dialogueact1306	2330.48	2332.95	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	the future so try to pick things that other people didn't say 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1307	2334.07	2334.76	D	Professor	s	-1	0	it takes and so i mean 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1308	2334.76	2335.08	D	Professor	%--	-1	0	it takes and so i mean 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1309	2336.26	2347.23	D	Professor	s	-1	0	it the kind of uh interest that i had in this thing initially was uh that basically the form that you're doing something else later 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1310	2347.92	2348.44	A	Professor	b	-1	0	and you want to pick 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1311	2348.22	2352.69	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and you want to pick up something from this meeting related to something else 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1312	2353.11	2356.84	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so it's really being the the list what's important in the something else 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1314	2357.24	2357.74	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	rather than that 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1315	2357.33	2357.97	D	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	rather than that 
Buw001.E.dialogueact1313	2357.09	2357.33	E	PhD	b	-1	0	rather than that 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1316	2358.03	2360.99	D	Professor	s	+1	0	and it might be something minor minor importance to the me 
Buw001.C.dialogueact1318	2361.72	2361.91	C	Professor	b	-1	0	uh right 
Buw001.G.dialogueact1317	2361.29	2361.54	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	uh right 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1319	2361.95	2368.62	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh in fact if if was really majors the thing that really stuck in your head and you might not need to go back and and and check on right 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1320	2369.45	2372.1	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so it's it's that you're trying to find you you now you weren't interested 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1321	2372.18	2373.05	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	you weren't interested say oh i said well it 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1322	2373.05	2375.52	D	Professor	s:s	-1	0	say oh i said well it wasn't that much interested in dialogue on more acoustic 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1323	2375.52	2376.74	D	Professor	s^e:s	-1	0	on more acoustic person 
Buw001.E.dialogueact1324	2376.06	2376.35	E	PhD	b	-1	0	person 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1325	2377.2	2384.39	D	Professor	s^e:qw	-1	0	but but three months from now for some reason i get really interested in dialogue what is what was that part that that @reject@ anyway you like jim bass is that if you lied on dialogue 
Buw001.G.dialogueact1326	2383.07	2386.09	G	Grad	fg|s.%-:s.%-	-1	0	@reject@ anyway yeah like jim bass is that if you lied on dialogue in your next for 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1327	2383.99	2384.25	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	@reject@ anyway like jim bass is that if you lied on dialogue 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1328	2385.34	2385.66	D	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah in your next for 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1329	2386.43	2386.71	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Buw001.A.dialogueact1330	2387.3	2387.59	A	Professor	b	-1	0	and then i'm trying to i 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1331	2392.95	2395.4	D	Professor	s	+1	0	something that didn't really stick in my head the first time around and but for some 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1332	2395.4	2401.24	D	Professor	s	+1	1	and but for some new reason i'm i'm i'm interested in in in the old stuff but that 
Buw001.G.dialogueact1333	2401.77	2403.87	G	Grad	s	-1	0	i that's i don't i don't know but that that's going to be very hard to generate 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1335	2402.35	2404.82	A	Professor	s^na	-1	0	i that's hard to dinner and i don't i don't know that's going to be very hard to generate 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1334	2402.12	2403.19	D	Professor	s^no	-1	0	i that's i don't i don't know that's going to be very hard to generate 
Buw001.C.dialogueact1337	2403.92	2404.4	C	Professor	b	-1	0	that's hard to dinner and to generate 
Buw001.F.dialogueact1336	2403.65	2403.83	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	that's to generate 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1338	2404.82	2408.95	A	Professor	s	-1	0	hard to dinner and and i think that's half of what it i would use it for but 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1339	2408.95	2415.18	A	Professor	s:s	-1	0	i would use it for but i also a lot of times make you know i think to myself this is interesting i've got to come back 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1340	2411.07	2411.48	D	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Buw001.A.dialogueact1341	2415.18	2418.03	A	Professor	s^e:s	-1	0	i've got to come back and follow up on it so 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1342	2416.97	2417.47	D	Professor	b	-1	0	and follow up on it 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1343	2418.4	2418.8	D	Professor	b	-1	0	so 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1344	2418.99	2426.74	A	Professor	s	-1	0	so things i think are interesting or um i would be you know wanting to do aquarius about 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1345	2427.62	2430.47	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and also i like the idea of going around the room because 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1346	2430.87	2435.11	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	the room because if somebody else thought something was interesting i kind of want to know about it and then i'd want to follow up

Buw001.D.dialogueact1349	2438.25	2440.3	D	Professor	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	yeah that that like it some of what i was i was concerned 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1350	2440.75	2449.16	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i was concerned about uh being interested in something later uh i didn't consider to be important the first time which for me is actually 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1351	2449.16	2451.15	D	Professor	s	-1	0	which for me is actually the dominant thing because i thought it was 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1352	2451.15	2454.99	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because i thought it was really important it tends to stick more than if i didn't but 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1353	2454.99	2458.08	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i didn't but some new cast comes along it makes me want to look up but but what's interesting to me may not

Buw001.D.dialogueact1359	2462.97	2463.03	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	it some yeah i i think 
Buw001.G.dialogueact1360	2463.14	2465.12	G	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	yeah i i think you can't get it all of it right 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1362	2465.57	2465.88	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right 
Buw001.G.dialogueact1361	2465.12	2465.42	G	Grad	qy^d^g	-1	0	right 
Buw001.G.dialogueact1363	2466.06	2467.52	G	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah the we we just need to start somewhere 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1364	2467.9	2469.12	D	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	yeah this is a starting point the question the question then is how how somewhere 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1366	2468.0	2468.15	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	this is a starting point question the question 
Buw001.F.dialogueact1365	2468.0	2475.58	F	PhD	qh	-1	0	this is a starting point question the question then is how how much biased introduce by you know intrigued by saying you know this is important now and you know 
Buw001.F.dialogueact1367	2475.58	2477.75	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	now and you know maybe that is something else is important later 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1368	2478.19	2478.52	D	Professor	b	-1	0	i mean does 
Buw001.F.dialogueact1369	2478.23	2480.89	F	PhD	qy	-1	0	i mean does it there's a bias matter 
Buw001.F.dialogueact1370	2481.37	2482.35	F	PhD	s^no	-1	0	i i don't know i mean that 
Buw001.F.dialogueact1371	2482.77	2485.08	F	PhD	s	-1	0	know i mean that that's i guess the question for you guys well okay 
Buw001.F.dialogueact1372	2485.24	2485.45	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	well okay 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1373	2485.7	2489.18	H	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	yeah well okay and one thing we were saying important and we're saying interesting and and 
Buw001.F.dialogueact1375	2489.91	2490.42	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah yeah and and those those can be two different 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1374	2489.67	2491.42	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yeah yeah sure sure and and those those can be two different things 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1377	2491.7	2492.09	A	Professor	b	-1	0	sure sure i i things 
Buw001.F.dialogueact1376	2491.38	2491.92	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	sure sure things 
Buw001.F.dialogueact1378	2492.1	2495.34	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i i i guess that's the question really is that i mean 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1379	2494.26	2494.52	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	is that i mean 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1380	2496.69	2497.3	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	because building 
Buw001.F.dialogueact1381	2496.88	2505.06	F	PhD	qy	-1	0	well reversible because building query based on what's important now introduce and your reversible bias on being able to do what morgan wants to do later that's okay good 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1383	2505.28	2506.28	D	Professor	s	-1	0	well reversible i i i mean that's that's okay good 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1382	2505.16	2505.57	H	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	well reversible that's okay good 
Buw001.F.dialogueact1384	2505.74	2506.3	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	well reversible i i i mean that's that's okay good 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1386	2506.28	2515.82	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	i i i mean it's i guess it but like like keep coming back in my own mind is that um as soon as they can do it we need to get up some kind of system that's 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1385	2506.21	2506.35	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	i i i mean that's 
Buw001.F.dialogueact1387	2507.39	2507.72	F	PhD	b	-1	0	it's i guess it but like 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1388	2516.46	2520.61	D	Professor	s	+1	0	so that people who've been involved in the meeting kin go back later even 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1389	2521.03	2523.06	D	Professor	s^e	+1	0	if it's support system in some ways and uh 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1390	2523.14	2526.47	D	Professor	s	+1	0	and uh and ask the questions that they actually want to know 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1391	2527.43	2536.78	D	Professor	s	+1	1	if it if it soon as they can get that going in any kind of level then i think we'll have a much better handle on what kind of questions people want to ask and any anything that you for that but obviously 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1392	2536.78	2539.27	D	Professor	s	-1	0	that you for that but obviously we have to put strep somehow sure

Buw001.A.dialogueact1964	3421.38	3422.75	A	Professor	s^ba|s	-1	0	great that's also a problem

Buw001.A.dialogueact1966	3426.86	3427.56	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1967	3429.52	3432.84	A	Professor	fg|s^t	-1	0	okay i think that's good and that's that's pretty much all i can think of can ask 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1968	3432.83	3434.22	H	Postdoc	qy	-1	0	i can think of can ask uh one thing it really sedated 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1969	3434.22	3435.89	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it really sedated today the question i 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1970	3435.89	3439.15	H	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	today the question i and we mentioned earlier today this question of um so 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1971	3439.58	3440.22	H	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	um so um 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1972	3440.86	3448.4	H	Postdoc	s	+1	0	um ice i know that from with the near field mike's some of the problems that come with overlapping speech uh are lessened but 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1973	3448.8	3463.47	H	Postdoc	qr^cs	-1	0	but i wonder if guy is that sufficient or should we consider maybe getting some day that gathered in such a way that um we would kind of have to have a meeting with less overlap and what otherwise be the case so either by rules 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1974	3463.47	3466.1	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	the case so either by rules of participation or whatever now i mean you 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1975	3464.38	3465.27	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	of participation or whatever 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1976	3466.42	3467.91	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	now i mean you know it's true i mean 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1977	3467.91	3469.29	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	know it's true i mean we were discussing this earlier that depending 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1978	3469.35	3470.96	H	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	that depending on the task so 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1979	3470.96	3474.06	H	Postdoc	s	+1	0	on the task so if you've got someone giving a report you're not going to have as much overlap but um 
Buw001.F.dialogueact1980	3472.0	3472.18	F	PhD	s^t1	-1	0	a report you're not going 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1981	3474.11	3475.04	H	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	but um it uh 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1982	3475.55	3479.47	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it uh so we're going to have you know non overlapping samples anyway but 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1983	3479.87	3489.31	H	Postdoc	qr	+1	0	i anyway but um in a meeting which would otherwise be highly overlapping is in your field mike enough or should be have some reels of participation for some of our samples less an overlap 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1984	3486.02	3486.15	D	Professor	b	-1	0	have some reels of participation 
Buw001.E.dialogueact1985	3487.39	3487.54	E	PhD	s^t1.%	-1	0	for some of 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1986	3490.04	3492.32	A	Professor	s	+1	1	don't think we should have rules of participation but i think we should 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1987	3492.32	3496.44	A	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	but i think we should try to get a variety of meanings that's something 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1988	3496.59	3504.48	A	Professor	s	+1	1	that's something that if we get the the meaning stuff going at u. w. i probably can't do more than you guys because you guys 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1989	3498.85	3499.05	H	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	the meaning stuff going at u. w. 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1990	3504.48	3507.72	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	guys because you guys are probably mostly going to get it exceed people here 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1992	3508.28	3513.39	A	Professor	s	-1	0	but we can get anybody in me over and and possibly 
Buw001.D.dialogueact1991	3508.0	3508.31	D	Professor	b	-1	0	but we can get 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1993	3513.39	3518.11	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and and possibly also some c. s. people right u. w. so i 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1994	3518.11	3523.33	A	Professor	s	-1	0	so i think that that there's a good chance we can get more variety there's still we should have been updated okay good 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1995	3518.61	3518.77	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	so i 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1996	3521.57	3522.8	H	Postdoc	s^df.%-	-1	0	chance we can get more variety we should have been updated 
Buw001.A.dialogueact1999	3523.92	3524.21	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	there's still going to overlap but okay good 
Buw001.B.dialogueact1998	3523.7	3525.02	B	PhD	s	-1	0	there's still going to overlap but okay good 
Buw001.H.dialogueact1997	3523.47	3523.97	H	Postdoc	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	there's still okay good 
Buw001.B.dialogueact2000	3525.02	3531.88	B	PhD	s	+1	0	mark and others have said that there's quite a lot of found data from the discourse community that has this characteristic and also 
Buw001.B.dialogueact2001	3531.88	3533.2	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	this characteristic and also the political 
Buw001.B.dialogueact2002	3534.15	3540.14	B	PhD	s	-1	0	you know anything that was televised for third party has the characteristic of not very much overlap but 
Buw001.D.dialogueact2003	3534.98	3535.41	D	Professor	b	-1	0	you know anything that was televised for third 
Buw001.A.dialogueact2006	3541.13	3541.5	A	Professor	b	-1	0	but i think were saying 
Buw001.D.dialogueact2004	3540.85	3544.9	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but but i think were saying before also that uh natural language group here have less overlap so 
Buw001.H.dialogueact2005	3540.9	3541.16	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	but but i think were saying 
Buw001.B.dialogueact2007	3541.77	3542.31	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	but i think were saying before also that uh natural 
Buw001.D.dialogueact2008	3544.9	3547.35	D	Professor	s	+1	1	like he um dominance less overlap so it also depends on the style of the people don't ask him to task 
Buw001.A.dialogueact2010	3546.64	3547.13	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	like he um dominance of the people don't ask him to task 
Buw001.B.dialogueact2009	3546.46	3550.07	B	PhD	s	-1	0	like he um dominance relations of the people in the media of the people uhhuh don't ask him to task it's just i just want to do and because you know it 
Buw001.H.dialogueact2011	3546.68	3546.82	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	like he of the people 
Buw001.H.dialogueact2012	3547.05	3548.11	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	um dominance relations of the don't ask him to task it's just

Buw001.D.dialogueact2016	3550.03	3550.36	D	Professor	b	-1	0	do and because you know it 
Buw001.H.dialogueact2017	3550.37	3555.37	H	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	do and because you know it is true people can modify the amount of overlap that they do if if they're ass too 
Buw001.D.dialogueact2018	3555.88	3556.16	D	Professor	b	-1	0	too not not entirely 
Buw001.H.dialogueact2019	3556.12	3557.67	H	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	not not entirely modified but 
Buw001.H.dialogueact2020	3557.67	3559.61	H	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	modified but lesson it if if it's just 
Buw001.H.dialogueact2021	3561.35	3562.9	H	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	but if if that's sufficient data i just 
Buw001.H.dialogueact2022	3562.9	3567.62	H	Postdoc	s	+1	1	sufficient data i just want to be sure that we will not be having a lot of data which can't be process 
Buw001.A.dialogueact2023	3573.07	3573.44	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay so i'm just 
Buw001.A.dialogueact2024	3573.44	3578.51	A	Professor	s	+1	1	okay so i'm just writing here we're not going to try to specify rules of interaction but we're going to try 
Buw001.A.dialogueact2025	3578.51	3584.58	A	Professor	s	+1	1	but we're going to try to get more variety by using different groups of people 
Buw001.H.dialogueact2026	3581.77	3582.08	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	using different 
Buw001.A.dialogueact2027	3587.91	3589.03	A	Professor	s^e^rt	+1	0	and different sizes 
Buw001.H.dialogueact2028	3589.69	3594.66	H	Postdoc	s^bk|s	-1	0	and and i can i i know that the near your field mice will take care of also the problem is certainly swanson 
Buw001.A.dialogueact2029	3591.93	3592.24	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	that the near your field mice will take care of also 
Buw001.A.dialogueact2030	3594.36	3594.49	A	Professor	b	-1	0	and certainly swanson 
Buw001.A.dialogueact2032	3595.01	3603.85	A	Professor	s	-1	0	then the other thing might be uh technical verses administrator 
Buw001.H.dialogueact2031	3594.66	3595.56	H	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	and then the other thing certainly swanson 
Buw001.A.dialogueact2033	3606.17	3611.24	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because if i recorded some administrative meetings then that may have less overlap because you might have 
Buw001.A.dialogueact2034	3611.24	3615.37	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because you might have more overlap when you're doing something technical and disagreeing 
Buw001.H.dialogueact2035	3613.14	3613.28	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	doing something technical 
Buw001.H.dialogueact2036	3614.98	3615.15	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	and disagreeing 
Buw001.H.dialogueact2037	3616.46	3618.96	H	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	well i you just just as it uh contribute 
Buw001.H.dialogueact2038	3619.16	3625.14	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it so i i know that in in legal depositions people are per our prevented from overlapping to just say you know in 
Buw001.H.dialogueact2039	3625.14	3628.39	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	to just say you know in a way tell each person is finished before you say something so is 
Buw001.H.dialogueact2040	3628.85	3630.5	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	something so is pasta lesson if we wanted to but but 
Buw001.H.dialogueact2041	3630.5	3632.1	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	we wanted to but but these other factors if i just to the 
Buw001.H.dialogueact2042	3632.35	3633.41	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	well the reason why i didn't i just to the 
Buw001.A.dialogueact2043	3633.13	3643.75	A	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	well the reason why i didn't want to is be why i personally want to is because i wanted it to be i'm interested as possible you could 
Buw001.H.dialogueact2044	3636.63	3636.85	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	want to is because
