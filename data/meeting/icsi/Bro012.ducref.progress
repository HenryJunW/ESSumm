Speaker mn007 and fn002 have been working on improving the recogniser performance as well as reducing it's latency.
Work on new filters has reduced latency , but made no improvement , though a slight reduction in performance occurred in the well matched case.
Also tried adding some spectral subtraction , but it doesn't work will with on-line normalization and at this stage is just hurting results.
They have also been considering the possibility of using a second stream of data looking at the voicedness of the data , which would draw some ideas from previous work.
Me018 has been looking at the baseline system and feels it may be possible to decrease the run time of experiments by decreasing the iteration , and he has also got the five processor Linux machine capable of running HTKs.
