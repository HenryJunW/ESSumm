The Berkely Meeting Recorder group discussed efforts by speaker mn005 to measure energy levels in cases of speaker overlap in which the time window analyzed was 200 milliseconds or greater.
Preliminary results were presented showing that log domain analyses did not reveal a significant difference in mean energy levels for windows of overlapping versus non-overlapping speech.
In contrast , raw energy analyses were successful in showing the two groups to be distinct.
Participants discussed alternate strategies for examining energy and the importance of categorizing types of speaker overlap.
Participants also reviewed the latest iteration of speaker forms , and discussed recent changes to the Transcriber tool.
