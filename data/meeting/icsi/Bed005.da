Bed005.B.dialogueact5	71.479	72.059	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and I think it 'll be enough .
Bed005.A.dialogueact6	80.968	82.868	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Mmm {disfmarker} Doesn't , uh {disfmarker} It should be the other way .
Bed005.A.dialogueact7	82.868	83.748	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , now it 's on .
Bed005.F.dialogueact8	83.685	84.695	F	PhD	s^bk^rt	-1	0	Right . OK .
Bed005.B.dialogueact9	140.12	140.41	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.B.dialogueact10	140.41	141.37	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	So , we all switched on ?
Bed005.A.dialogueact11	142.74	144.18	A	Grad	s^na|s^aa	-1	0	We are all switched on , yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact12	144.55	144.86	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Alright .
Bed005.B.dialogueact14	145.51	154.13	B	Professor	fg|s^t	-1	0	Anyway . So , uh , before we get started with the , uh , technical part , I just want to review what I think is happening with the {disfmarker} our data collection .
Bed005.F.dialogueact13	145.11	145.93	F	PhD	s^m^na	-1	0	We are all switched on .
Bed005.B.dialogueact15	154.69	159.741	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , probably after today , {vocalsound} that shouldn't come up in this meeting .
Bed005.B.dialogueact16	159.741	164.101	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Th - this {disfmarker} this is s should be im it isn't {disfmarker} There 's another thing going on of gathering data ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact17	164.576	167.216	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and that 's pretty much independent of this .
Bed005.B.dialogueact18	167.638	171.348	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But , uh , I just want to make sure we 're all together on this .
Bed005.B.dialogueact19	171.813	190.084	B	Professor	s:s	+1	2	What we think is gonna happen is that , uh , in parallel starting about now {vocalsound} we 're gonna get Fey {vocalsound} to , where you 're working with me and Robert , draft a note that we 're gonna send out to various CogSci c and other classes saying , " here 's an opportunity to be a subject .
Bed005.B.dialogueact20	190.671	191.831	B	Professor	s^e:s	-1	0	Contact Fey . "
Bed005.B.dialogueact21	192.446	197.676	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And then there 'll be a certain number of um , hours during the week which she will be available
Bed005.B.dialogueact22	197.676	199.676	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and we 'll bring in people .
Bed005.B.dialogueact23	199.676	200.696	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	Uh , roughly how many , Robert ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact24	201.271	201.801	B	Professor	qy^e	-1	0	We d Do we know ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact25	201.482	203.732	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	Um , fifty was our {disfmarker} sort of our first {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact26	202.972	205.512	B	Professor	s^bk|s	+1	0	OK . So , we 're looking for a total of fifty people ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact27	205.712	208.242	B	Professor	s	+1	1	not necessarily by any means all students
Bed005.B.dialogueact28	208.242	210.222	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but we 'll s we 'll start with {disfmarker} with that .
Bed005.B.dialogueact29	210.705	214.235	B	Professor	s	+1	1	In parallel with that , we 're gonna need to actually do the script .
Bed005.B.dialogueact30	215.134	227.422	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And , so , I guess there 's a plan to have a meeting Friday afternoon Uh , with {disfmarker} uh , Jane , and maybe Liz and whoever , on actually getting the script worked out .
Bed005.B.dialogueact31	227.992	235.053	B	Professor	s	+1	3	But what I 'd like to do , if it 's O K , {vocalsound} is to s to , as I say , start the recruiting in parallel and possibly start running subjects next week .
Bed005.B.dialogueact32	235.773	237.243	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	The week after that 's Spring Break ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact33	237.243	239.863	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and maybe we 'll look for them {disfmarker} some subjects next door
Bed005.C.dialogueact34	239.06	239.57	C	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact35	239.863	240.703	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	or {pause} i
Bed005.C.dialogueact36	240.562	242.662	C	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah . Also , Fey will not be here during spring break .
Bed005.B.dialogueact37	242.62	243.49	B	Professor	s^bk|s^cs	-1	0	Oh , OK , then we won't do it .
Bed005.C.dialogueact38	242.662	242.932	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bed005.B.dialogueact39	243.84	244.04	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.B.dialogueact40	244.11	244.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So that 's easy .
Bed005.B.dialogueact41	245.89	246.89	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bed005.B.dialogueact42	249.38	252.032	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	So , is {disfmarker} Is that make sense to everybody ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact43	251.944	252.204	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.C.dialogueact44	252.724	259.831	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Also , um , F {vocalsound} both Fey and I will , um , {vocalsound} do something of which I may , eh {disfmarker} kindly ask you to {disfmarker} to do the same thing ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact45	259.831	264.381	C	Grad	s	+1	1	which is we gonna check out our social infrastructures for possible subjects .
Bed005.C.dialogueact46	264.381	268.071	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Meaning , {vocalsound} um , kid children 's gymnastic classes ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact47	268.071	269.791	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	pre - school parents and so forth .
Bed005.C.dialogueact48	270.18	272.31	C	Grad	s	-1	0	They also sometimes have flexible schedules .
Bed005.C.dialogueact49	272.713	276.533	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So , if you happen to be sort of in a non - student social setting ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact50	276.533	279.273	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and you know people who may be interested in being subjects {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact51	279.774	283.824	C	Grad	s	-1	0	We also considered using the Berkeley High School and their teachers , maybe ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact52	284.476	287.316	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and get them interested in stuff .
Bed005.B.dialogueact53	286.41	286.98	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	That 's a good idea .
Bed005.C.dialogueact54	288.324	289.754	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	And , um .
Bed005.C.dialogueact55	289.915	292.085	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So that 's as far as our brainstorming was concerned .
Bed005.B.dialogueact56	292.354	293.714	B	Professor	s^aa|s^ba^r	-1	0	Oh , yeah . The high school 's a great idea .
Bed005.C.dialogueact57	298.699	299.099	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bed005.C.dialogueact58	299.937	302.647	C	Grad	s^cc^rt	-1	0	But I {disfmarker} I will just make a first draft of the , uh , note ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact59	303.017	303.647	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	the " write - up " note ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact60	303.647	304.567	C	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	send it to you and Fey
Bed005.C.dialogueact61	304.567	305.007	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	and then {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact62	306.04	307.48	B	Professor	qh^cs	-1	0	And why don't you also copy Jane on it ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact63	310.882	311.502	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	And , um ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact64	311.872	317.822	C	Grad	qy	-1	0	Are we {disfmarker} Have we concurred that , uh , these {disfmarker} these forms are sufficient for us , and necessary ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact65	318.46	320.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh , th I think they 're necessary .
Bed005.B.dialogueact66	321.149	322.159	B	Professor	s	+1	1	This {disfmarker} The permission form .
Bed005.C.dialogueact67	321.878	322.268	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact69	322.919	324.039	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh , there has to be one ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact68	322.618	323.368	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Nuh . N .
Bed005.B.dialogueact70	324.039	325.949	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and I think we 're just gonna use it as it is ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact71	326.049	327.659	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {pause} Um
Bed005.C.dialogueact72	326.129	326.499	C	Grad	b.%	-1	0	N .
Bed005.C.dialogueact73	328.382	329.052	C	Grad	qy	-1	0	You happy with that ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact74	329.06	329.38	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Well , yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact75	329.57	332.227	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	There 's one tricky part about ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact76	332.867	333.877	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact77	334.107	335.167	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	they have the right
Bed005.B.dialogueact78	336.156	336.826	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um
Bed005.B.dialogueact79	337.806	343.686	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	I The last paragraph {comment} " if you agree to participate you have the opportunity to have anything excised which you would prefer not to have included in the data set . "
Bed005.B.dialogueact80	344.37	344.75	B	Professor	s^f	-1	0	OK ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact81	345.28	348.71	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Now that , we had to be included for this other one
Bed005.B.dialogueact82	348.71	351.75	B	Professor	s	-1	0	which might have , uh , meetings , you know , about something .
Bed005.C.dialogueact83	349.11	349.47	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact84	351.75	354.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	In this case , it doesn't really make sense .
Bed005.B.dialogueact85	355.426	364.196	B	Professor	fh|s:s	+1	0	Um , so what I 'd like to do is also have our subjects sign a waiver saying " I don't want to see the final transcript " .
Bed005.C.dialogueact86	364.167	365.007	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact87	364.787	368.317	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	And if they don't {disfmarker} If they say " no , I 'm not willing to sign that " , then we 'll show them the final transcript .
Bed005.B.dialogueact88	368.377	370.557	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	But , um .
Bed005.C.dialogueact89	370.81	371.68	C	Grad	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	Yep . Makes sense .
Bed005.B.dialogueact90	371.984	373.544	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	That , uh {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact91	374.134	375.414	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah , so we might actually ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact92	375.414	375.964	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um
Bed005.B.dialogueact93	377.625	380.045	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	S i Jane may say that , " you know , you can't do this " ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact94	380.045	382.735	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh , " on the same form , we need a separate form . "
Bed005.B.dialogueact95	382.735	390.855	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	But anyway . I 'd {disfmarker} I 'd {disfmarker} I 'd like to , e e um , add an a little thi eh {disfmarker} a thing for them to initial , saying " nah , do I don't want to see the final transcript . "
Bed005.C.dialogueact96	387.881	388.601	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact97	390.855	393.055	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But other than that , that 's one 's been approved ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact98	393.843	395.533	B	Professor	s	-1	0	this really is the same project ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact99	396.583	397.193	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh , rec
Bed005.B.dialogueact100	397.193	397.473	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	you know .
Bed005.B.dialogueact101	397.533	398.013	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And so forth .
Bed005.B.dialogueact102	398.013	398.843	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	So I think we just go with it .
Bed005.C.dialogueact103	398.315	398.435	C	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.C.dialogueact104	399.832	399.942	C	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .

Bed005.C.dialogueact107	411.26	413.35	C	Grad	s	+1	0	except that with Munich everything is fine now .
Bed005.C.dialogueact108	413.75	415.5	C	Grad	s	+1	0	They 're gonna {vocalsound} transcribe .
Bed005.C.dialogueact109	415.5	421.49	C	Grad	s	+1	1	They 're also gonna translate the , uh , German data from the TV and cinema stuff for Andreas .
Bed005.C.dialogueact110	421.49	421.68	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bed005.C.dialogueact111	422.0	424.95	C	Grad	s	-1	0	They 're {disfmarker} they all seem to be happy now , {vocalsound} with that .
Bed005.C.dialogueact112	428.41	428.77	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bed005.C.dialogueact113	429.29	431.54	C	Grad	qy^rt^t^tc	-1	0	w c sh should we move on to the technical sides ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact114	431.664	431.824	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bed005.C.dialogueact115	432.49	435.85	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Well I guess the good {disfmarker} good news of last week was the parser .
Bed005.C.dialogueact116	437.395	438.645	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	So , um
Bed005.C.dialogueact117	438.784	441.94	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Bhaskara and I started working on the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the parser .
Bed005.C.dialogueact118	441.94	446.9	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Then Bhaskara went to class and once he came back , um , {vocalsound} it was finished .
Bed005.C.dialogueact119	448.261	448.621	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bed005.C.dialogueact120	450.491	452.131	C	Grad	s	-1	0	It , uh {disfmarker} I didn't measure it ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact121	452.131	453.941	C	Grad	s^bu^rt	-1	0	but it was about an hour and ten minutes .
Bed005.D.dialogueact122	454.403	454.703	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yep .
Bed005.C.dialogueact124	454.962	460.472	C	Grad	s	+1	3	And , um {disfmarker} and now it 's {disfmarker} We have a complete English parser that does everything the German parser does .
Bed005.D.dialogueact123	454.883	455.743	D	Grad	s	-1	0	Something like that .
Bed005.B.dialogueact125	461.255	462.465	B	Professor	s^2^ba	-1	0	Which is {vocalsound} not a lot .
Bed005.B.dialogueact127	462.555	462.695	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact126	462.261	463.661	D	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's the , uh , point .
Bed005.C.dialogueact128	463.83	465.38	C	Grad	s	-1	0	The {disfmarker} uh , that 's not a lot .
Bed005.B.dialogueact130	464.484	464.734	B	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .

Bed005.E.dialogueact134	468.831	471.52	E	Grad	qy^e	-1	0	I mean , wha Was there anything {pause} interesting about it at all ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact135	470.404	471.484	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	Well , if you , eh {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact136	470.556	471.246	D	Grad	s	-1	0	We 'll show you .
Bed005.B.dialogueact137	471.481	472.141	B	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah , we can show us ,
Bed005.E.dialogueact138	471.52	472.28	E	Grad	qrr	-1	0	or are we gonna see that ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact139	472.141	472.301	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact140	472.641	480.761	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	Well , w w We d The first we did is we {disfmarker} we tried to {disfmarker} to do {disfmarker} change the {disfmarker} the " laufen " into " run " , {vocalsound} or " running " , {vocalsound} or " runs " .
Bed005.B.dialogueact141	480.092	480.362	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bed005.C.dialogueact143	481.529	484.399	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And we noticed that whatever we tried to do , it no effect .

Bed005.C.dialogueact145	485.452	486.202	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And we were puzzled .
Bed005.E.dialogueact144	485.36	485.64	E	Grad	b	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.C.dialogueact147	487.299	491.899	C	Grad	s	+1	0	And , uh , the reason was that the parser i c completely ignores the verb .
Bed005.E.dialogueact146	487.098	487.488	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.C.dialogueact149	493.355	499.63	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So this sentence {disfmarker} sentence is {disfmarker} parses the p the same output ,
Bed005.E.dialogueact148	493.119	493.199	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed005.E.dialogueact150	494.169	495.369	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Interesting parser property .
Bed005.C.dialogueact151	500.34	506.38	C	Grad	s^e^rt	-1	0	um , even if you leave out , um , all {disfmarker} all of this .

Bed005.C.dialogueact162	516.75	519.36	C	Grad	s	-1	0	But all the rest is p simply frosting on the cake ,

Bed005.D.dialogueact295	763.17	765.976	D	Grad	s|s^f	+1	0	One thing I was wondering was , {vocalsound} those percentage signs , right ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact296	766.565	768.355	D	Grad	qw	-1	0	So , I mean , why do we even have them ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact298	768.741	769.091	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yep .
Bed005.D.dialogueact297	768.355	769.795	D	Grad	s^df.%-	-1	0	Because {disfmarker} if you didn't have them {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact299	770.24	771.03	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Uh , I 'll tell you why .
Bed005.C.dialogueact300	771.03	772.82	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Because it gives a {disfmarker} you a score .
Bed005.E.dialogueact301	773.295	773.575	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.C.dialogueact303	774.201	783.34	C	Grad	s	+1	0	And the value of the score is , v I assume , I guess , the more of these optional things that are actually in there , the higher the r score {vocalsound} it is .
Bed005.D.dialogueact302	773.853	774.663	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bed005.D.dialogueact304	780.505	780.865	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.D.dialogueact307	781.356	782.656	D	Grad	s|s^bk	-1	0	So that 's the main purpose . Alright .
Bed005.E.dialogueact306	781.262	781.772	E	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's a match .
Bed005.F.dialogueact305	781.06	781.44	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.E.dialogueact308	783.549	783.989	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact309	784.792	785.082	B	Professor	s^bk^rt	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.C.dialogueact310	789.47	791.22	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So we {disfmarker} we shouldn't belittle it too much .
Bed005.C.dialogueact311	791.22	792.66	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	It 's doing something ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact312	793.76	794.3	C	Grad	s^bsc	-1	0	some things ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact313	795.18	796.14	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and it 's very flexible .
Bed005.C.dialogueact314	797.149	797.919	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	I 've just tried to
Bed005.E.dialogueact315	797.438	797.818	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.C.dialogueact317	799.08	799.53	C	Grad	s	-1	0	be nice .
Bed005.F.dialogueact316	799.063	799.353	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.B.dialogueact318	799.727	800.037	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	No , no .
Bed005.B.dialogueact320	800.037	800.407	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Fine .
Bed005.E.dialogueact319	799.793	800.273	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Right {disfmarker} Yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact321	800.407	801.427	B	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yeah , yeah , yeah , flexible it is .
Bed005.F.dialogueact322	800.937	801.187	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact323	804.7	809.498	C	Grad	fg|s^tc	+1	0	OK . {vocalsound} Um , let 's hope that the generation will not be more difficult ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact324	809.498	812.278	C	Grad	s	-1	0	even though the generator is a little bit more complex .
Bed005.C.dialogueact325	813.194	814.254	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	Uh but we 'll {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact326	815.044	815.224	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact327	815.434	819.514	C	Grad	s	-1	0	that means we may need two hours and twenty minutes rather than an hour ten minutes ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact330	820.931	821.081	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Alright .
Bed005.C.dialogueact329	820.815	821.205	C	Grad	s	-1	0	I hope .
Bed005.D.dialogueact328	820.464	820.594	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.C.dialogueact331	822.78	840.442	C	Grad	s^tc	+1	1	And the next thing I would like to be able to do , and it seems like this would not be too difficult either , is {vocalsound} to say , " OK let 's now pretend we actually wanted to not only change the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the mapping of {disfmarker} of , uh , words to the M - three - L but we also wanted to change {disfmarker} add a new sentence type

Bed005.B.dialogueact333	841.222	841.452	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bed005.B.dialogueact334	841.784	842.104	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	So
Bed005.B.dialogueact335	842.548	842.948	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	That 'd be great .
Bed005.B.dialogueact336	842.948	846.356	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It would be a good exercise to just see {vocalsound} whether one can get that to run .
Bed005.C.dialogueact337	843.042	843.382	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	See th
Bed005.C.dialogueact338	846.39	847.34	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm . {vocalsound} Yep .
Bed005.C.dialogueact339	849.05	849.96	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	And , um ,
Bed005.D.dialogueact340	850.18	850.63	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	So , that 's {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact342	851.09	852.2	C	Grad	s	-1	0	that 's {disfmarker} shouldn't be too tough .
Bed005.D.dialogueact341	850.93	851.29	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Fine , yeah .
Bed005.D.dialogueact343	852.392	853.352	D	Grad	fg|qw.%--	-1	0	Yeah , so where are those {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact344	853.352	855.162	D	Grad	s|s^f	+1	0	those functions " Action " , " Goodbye " , and so on , right ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact345	855.162	857.92	D	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Are they actually , um , {vocalsound} Are they going to be called ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact346	858.17	860.52	D	Grad	qy^rt	+1	0	Um , are they present in the code for the parser ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact347	861.8	864.57	C	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah . I think what it does , it i i it does something sort of fancy .
Bed005.C.dialogueact348	864.57	865.03	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	It loads
Bed005.C.dialogueact349	865.93	866.47	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact350	867.29	872.0	C	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	It has these style sheets and also the , um , schemata .
Bed005.C.dialogueact351	872.55	874.59	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So what it probably does , is it takes the ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact352	874.59	878.7	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	uh , {vocalsound} um {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact353	880.802	881.932	C	Grad	qy^t1	-1	0	Is this where it is ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact354	882.172	884.412	C	Grad	s^rt^t1	-1	0	This is already the XML stuff ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact355	887.679	892.249	C	Grad	s	-1	0	This is where it takes its own , um , syntax ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact356	894.318	895.708	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and converts it somehow .
Bed005.C.dialogueact357	896.827	897.957	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bed005.C.dialogueact358	898.108	899.198	C	Grad	qw.%--	-1	0	Where is the uh {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact359	904.953	905.573	D	Grad	qw	-1	0	What are you looking for ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact360	906.442	912.632	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Um , where it actually produces the {disfmarker} the XML out of the , uh , parsed {pause} stuff .
Bed005.D.dialogueact361	910.794	911.214	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bed005.C.dialogueact362	918.85	920.44	C	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	No , this is not it .
Bed005.C.dialogueact363	921.212	922.252	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Uh . I can't find it now .
Bed005.C.dialogueact364	928.327	933.347	C	Grad	s^bu.%--	-1	0	You mean , where the {disfmarker} where the act how the action " Goodbye " maps into something {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact365	933.857	934.107	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.A.dialogueact366	935.19	936.62	A	Grad	s^aa|qw	-1	0	Yeah , where are those constructors defined ?

Bed005.C.dialogueact368	937.473	937.923	C	Grad	s^ar^t1	-1	0	Nope .
Bed005.D.dialogueact369	937.499	938.099	D	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	No , that 's not it .
Bed005.C.dialogueact370	949.52	949.78	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.C.dialogueact371	950.216	951.496	C	Grad	s	-1	0	This is sort of what happens .
Bed005.C.dialogueact372	951.686	955.056	C	Grad	s	-1	0	This is what you would need to {disfmarker} to change {disfmarker} to get the , uh , XML changed .
Bed005.C.dialogueact373	955.535	959.3	C	Grad	s.%--:s	-1	0	So when it encounts encounters " Day " , {vocalsound} it will , uh ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact374	964.86	968.33	C	Grad	s	-1	0	activate those h classes in the {disfmarker} in the XML stuff
Bed005.C.dialogueact375	969.566	970.506	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	But , um {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact376	971.6	974.27	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	I saw those actions {disfmarker} uh , the " Goodbye " stuff somewhere .

Bed005.A.dialogueact378	977.5	978.0	A	Grad	qy^bu^cs^d^rt	-1	0	Grep for it ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact379	979.777	980.647	C	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yeah . Let 's do that .
Bed005.C.dialogueact380	998.261	998.421	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .

Bed005.C.dialogueact383	1010.72	1011.16	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bed005.D.dialogueact384	1025.22	1028.63	D	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's just a {pause} specification for the XML format .
Bed005.C.dialogueact385	1027.94	1028.22	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bed005.C.dialogueact386	1040.25	1041.22	C	Grad	s^cc	+1	0	Well , we 'll find that out .
Bed005.C.dialogueact387	1062.57	1064.79	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So whatever {disfmarker} n this does {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact388	1064.79	1067.91	C	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	I mean this is , basically , looks l to me like a function call , right ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact389	1068.11	1068.22	B	Professor	qw^br	-1	0	Hmm ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact390	1068.26	1068.65	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Oh , yeah .
Bed005.C.dialogueact391	1068.87	1069.77	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	And , um {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact392	1070.59	1073.25	C	Grad	s.%--:s	-1	0	So , whenever it {disfmarker} it encounters " Goodbye " ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact393	1074.5	1076.46	C	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	which we can make it do in a second , here
Bed005.A.dialogueact394	1077.45	1081.3	A	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	That function automatically generates an initialized XML structure ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact396	1081.96	1083.02	C	Grad	%--	-1	0	I
Bed005.D.dialogueact395	1081.79	1089.25	D	Grad	s	+1	2	I think each of those functions act on the current XML structure , and change it in some way , for example , by adding a {disfmarker} a l a field to it , or something .
Bed005.B.dialogueact397	1088.51	1088.58	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	y
Bed005.B.dialogueact398	1089.12	1090.61	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah . They also seem to affect state ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact399	1089.38	1090.03	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact400	1090.61	1091.34	B	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	cause some of them {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact401	1091.61	1096.87	B	Professor	s	+1	2	there were other actions uh , that {disfmarker} that s seemed to step {disfmarker} state variables somewhere ,
Bed005.D.dialogueact402	1093.26	1093.61	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.B.dialogueact403	1096.87	1099.22	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	like the n s " Discourse Status Confirm " .
Bed005.B.dialogueact405	1100.18	1102.33	B	Professor	s	-1	0	OK . So that 's going to be a call on the discourse
Bed005.C.dialogueact404	1099.74	1100.02	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bed005.B.dialogueact406	1102.33	1104.02	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	and {vocalsound} confirm that it 's {disfmarker}

Bed005.B.dialogueact410	1106.15	1106.85	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	I think that 's right .
Bed005.C.dialogueact411	1106.35	1106.86	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	e
Bed005.D.dialogueact409	1106.0	1107.28	D	Grad	s	-1	0	but it 's going to change the event .
Bed005.B.dialogueact412	1106.85	1109.34	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I think it 's actually {disfmarker} That looks like it 's state modification .
Bed005.D.dialogueact413	1107.28	1108.17	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh . Oh .
Bed005.C.dialogueact414	1108.02	1108.84	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	e mmm
Bed005.C.dialogueact415	1109.33	1110.8	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	Um , well i

Bed005.C.dialogueact419	1113.62	1118.14	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	And so whenever I just say , " Write " , it will {disfmarker} it will put this in here .
Bed005.B.dialogueact420	1118.5	1119.65	B	Professor	s^bk|s^bu.%--	-1	0	Oh , so it always just {disfmarker}

Bed005.B.dialogueact464	1191.0	1191.7	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	S so that 's funny .
Bed005.C.dialogueact463	1190.63	1190.93	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	When it {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact465	1191.7	1193.84	B	Professor	s	-1	0	You bury the s the state in the function
Bed005.B.dialogueact466	1195.43	1195.75	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Alright .
Bed005.C.dialogueact469	1196.23	1196.43	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	it {disfmarker}
Bed005.A.dialogueact468	1196.23	1198.45	A	Grad	s^bu|qy^d^g	-1	0	Well , it just automatically initializes things that are common , right ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact467	1195.75	1196.03	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh
Bed005.A.dialogueact470	1198.45	1199.38	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So it 's just a shorthand .
Bed005.B.dialogueact471	1200.23	1200.62	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.C.dialogueact472	1201.06	1201.74	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	For example {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact473	1202.37	1203.19	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Oh , this is German .
Bed005.C.dialogueact474	1203.19	1203.46	C	Grad	s^fa	-1	0	Sorry .
Bed005.C.dialogueact475	1204.49	1204.76	C	Grad	%--	-1	0	e
Bed005.C.dialogueact476	1211.53	1213.62	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So , now , this , it cannot do anymore .
Bed005.C.dialogueact477	1214.5	1215.48	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Nothing comes out of here .
Bed005.A.dialogueact478	1216.03	1217.53	A	Grad	s|s^ba	-1	0	A " not a number " is a value . Awesome .
Bed005.C.dialogueact479	1222.48	1225.29	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So , it doesn't speak German anymore ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact480	1225.42	1226.4	C	Grad	s	-1	0	but it does speak English .
Bed005.C.dialogueact481	1226.85	1229.8	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And there is , here , a reference {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact482	1231.37	1239.24	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	So , this tells us that whatever is {disfmarker} has the ID " zero " is referenced here {disfmarker} by @ @ {comment} the restriction seed
Bed005.C.dialogueact483	1239.24	1240.62	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and this is exa " I want {disfmarker} "
Bed005.C.dialogueact484	1241.69	1242.61	C	Grad	qw	-1	0	What was the sentence ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact485	1243.48	1244.3	B	Professor	s	-1	0	" I want two seats here . "
Bed005.C.dialogueact486	1244.48	1245.69	C	Grad	s^m|s^aa	-1	0	" need two seats here . " Nuh .
Bed005.C.dialogueact487	1248.09	1251.53	C	Grad	s^cs:s^am	-1	0	" And where is it playing ? " There should also be a reference to something , maybe .
Bed005.C.dialogueact488	1253.39	1254.9	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	Our d This is re um
Bed005.C.dialogueact489	1257.23	1257.34	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed005.C.dialogueact490	1257.77	1264.79	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Here , we change {disfmarker} and so , we {disfmarker} Here we add something to the Discourse - Status , that the user wants to change something that was sort of done before
Bed005.C.dialogueact491	1265.73	1266.48	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	And , uh {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact492	1267.71	1270.78	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and that , whatever is being changed has something to do with the cinema .
Bed005.A.dialogueact493	1271.55	1274.31	A	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	So then , whatever takes this M - three - L is what actually changes the state ,
Bed005.A.dialogueact494	1274.31	1274.94	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	not the {disfmarker}
Bed005.A.dialogueact495	1276.23	1276.75	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , OK .
Bed005.B.dialogueact496	1276.58	1277.92	B	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	No , right , the Discourse Maintainer ,
Bed005.A.dialogueact497	1278.03	1278.38	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact498	1278.18	1278.42	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact499	1279.93	1280.26	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bed005.B.dialogueact500	1280.26	1283.71	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And it {disfmarker} and it runs around looking for Discourse Status tags ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact501	1284.79	1286.93	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and doing whatever it does with them .
Bed005.B.dialogueact502	1287.55	1289.16	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And other people ignore those tags .
Bed005.B.dialogueact503	1290.58	1290.83	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Alright .
Bed005.B.dialogueact504	1295.29	1304.65	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	So , yeah . I definitely think it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It 's worth the exercise of trying to actually add something that isn't there .
Bed005.C.dialogueact505	1305.44	1306.36	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact506	1306.07	1307.3	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh
Bed005.B.dialogueact507	1307.88	1308.35	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	Disc
Bed005.C.dialogueact508	1307.9	1309.81	C	Grad	s^na.x	+1	0	Sort of get a complete understanding of the whole thing .

Bed005.B.dialogueact510	1310.97	1318.0	B	Professor	s^t^tc	-1	0	Then the next thing we talked about is actually , {vocalsound} um , figuring out how to add our own tags , and stuff like that .
Bed005.C.dialogueact511	1318.26	1318.57	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.C.dialogueact512	1319.8	1320.39	C	Grad	s^tc	-1	0	Point number two .
Bed005.C.dialogueact513	1321.04	1324.08	C	Grad	s	+1	1	I got the , uh , M - three - L for the routes today .
Bed005.C.dialogueact514	1325.11	1326.2	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Uh , so I got some more .
Bed005.C.dialogueact515	1326.54	1327.37	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	This is sort of the
Bed005.C.dialogueact516	1327.37	1329.5	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	uh , {vocalsound} um ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact517	1339.35	1339.57	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed005.C.dialogueact518	1339.57	1340.04	C	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Interesting .
Bed005.C.dialogueact519	1340.04	1340.85	C	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's just going up ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact520	1340.85	1343.83	C	Grad	s	-1	0	it 's not going back down .
Bed005.C.dialogueact521	1351.62	1362.79	C	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	So , this is {disfmarker} um , what I got today is {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the new {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} M - three - L for um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} the Maps ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact522	1363.23	1363.46	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bed005.C.dialogueact523	1364.3	1366.1	C	Grad	s	-1	0	uh , and with some examples {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact524	1366.1	1369.61	C	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	So , this is the XML and this is sort of what it will look like later on ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact525	1369.88	1372.18	C	Grad	s	-1	0	even though it {disfmarker} you can't see it on {disfmarker} on this resolution .
Bed005.C.dialogueact526	1372.9	1376.89	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And this is what it {disfmarker} sort of is the {disfmarker} the structure of Map requests ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact527	1377.58	1378.12	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um
Bed005.C.dialogueact528	1379.84	1380.91	C	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	also not very interesting ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact529	1381.76	1385.81	C	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and here is the more interesting stuff for us , is the routes ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact530	1386.57	1387.69	C	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	route elements ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact531	1388.26	1390.98	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and , again , as we thought it 's really simple .
Bed005.C.dialogueact532	1390.98	1396.22	C	Grad	s	-1	0	This is sort of the , uh , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} parameters .
Bed005.C.dialogueact533	1396.7	1400.96	C	Grad	s	-1	0	We have @ @ {comment} simple " from objects " and " to objects " and so forth ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact534	1401.48	1403.0	C	Grad	s	-1	0	points of interest along the way {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact535	1404.03	1404.89	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	And , um ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact536	1405.85	1409.16	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	I asked them whether or not we could , um {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact537	1409.74	1411.58	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	First of all , I was little bit {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact538	1412.33	1418.08	C	Grad	s	-1	0	It seemed to me that this m way of doing it is sort of a stack a step backwards from the way we 've done it before .
Bed005.C.dialogueact539	1418.08	1418.19	C	Grad	%--	-1	0	t
Bed005.C.dialogueact540	1418.57	1420.63	C	Grad	s	-1	0	It seems to me that some notions were missing .
Bed005.B.dialogueact542	1421.78	1422.02	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	S
Bed005.C.dialogueact541	1421.43	1422.69	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	So these are {disfmarker} these are {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact543	1422.33	1424.66	B	Professor	s^bu	+1	0	So these are {disfmarker} these are your friends back at EML .
Bed005.C.dialogueact544	1424.69	1424.94	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bed005.C.dialogueact545	1424.94	1426.09	C	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Who are doing this .
Bed005.B.dialogueact546	1425.48	1427.46	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	So this is not a complicated negotiation .
Bed005.B.dialogueact548	1427.72	1429.66	B	Professor	s^bu|qy^d^g	-1	0	There 's {disfmarker} there 's not seven committees , or anything , right ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact547	1427.69	1427.83	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	No .
Bed005.C.dialogueact549	1429.75	1432.06	C	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	No , this is very straightforward .
Bed005.B.dialogueact550	1432.07	1432.33	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Great .
Bed005.B.dialogueact551	1432.43	1433.4	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So this is just trying to {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact552	1433.84	1435.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's a design thing , not a political thing .
Bed005.B.dialogueact554	1435.86	1438.4	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Once we 've {disfmarker} eh {disfmarker} We can just sort of agree on what oughta be done .
Bed005.C.dialogueact553	1435.67	1435.83	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact556	1439.23	1439.39	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Good .
Bed005.C.dialogueact555	1439.13	1439.67	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly .
Bed005.C.dialogueact557	1440.42	1441.18	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	And , um {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact558	1442.23	1443.2	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	And , uh {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact559	1443.72	1447.3	C	Grad	s	-1	0	However , the , uh {disfmarker} e So that you understand , it is really simple .
Bed005.C.dialogueact560	1447.3	1448.51	C	Grad	s^rt	+1	1	Uh {disfmarker} You {disfmarker} you have a route ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact561	1448.71	1450.2	C	Grad	s	+1	0	and you cut it up in different pieces .
Bed005.C.dialogueact562	1451.08	1456.71	C	Grad	s:s	+1	1	And every {disfmarker} every element of that e r r f of that {disfmarker} Every segment we call a " route element " .
Bed005.C.dialogueact563	1457.62	1460.55	C	Grad	s^rt	+1	0	And so , from A to B we cut up in three different steps ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact564	1461.07	1464.56	C	Grad	s	+1	0	and every step has a " from object " where you start , a " to object "
Bed005.C.dialogueact565	1464.57	1467.91	C	Grad	s	+1	1	where y where {pause} you sort of end , and some points of interest along the way .
Bed005.C.dialogueact566	1468.88	1477.02	C	Grad	s	-1	0	What w I was sort of missing here , and uh , maybe it was just me being too stupid , is , {vocalsound} I didn't sort of get the {disfmarker} the notion of the global goal of the whole route .
Bed005.C.dialogueact567	1477.35	1480.17	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Really , s was not straightforward visibly for me .
Bed005.C.dialogueact568	1480.87	1481.77	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And some other stuff .
Bed005.C.dialogueact569	1481.77	1487.4	C	Grad	s	+1	0	And I {vocalsound} suggested that they should n be {disfmarker} k uh , kind enough to do s two things for us ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact570	1487.4	1497.59	C	Grad	s^rt:s^rt	+1	1	is one , um , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Also allocating , uh , some tags for our Action Schema Enter - Vista - Approach ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact571	1498.35	1498.71	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact572	1502.99	1514.88	C	Grad	fh|s.%--	-1	0	And also , um , since you had suggested that {disfmarker} that , um , we figure out if we ever , for a demo reason , wanted to shortcut directly to the g GIS and the Planner ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact573	1515.58	1516.47	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	of how we can do it .
Bed005.C.dialogueact574	1516.47	1519.53	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Now , what 's the state of the art of getting to entrances ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact575	1519.53	1521.11	C	Grad	qh	-1	0	um , what 's the syntax for that ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact576	1521.11	1525.57	C	Grad	qh	-1	0	how get getting to {vocalsound} vista points and calculating those on the spot .
Bed005.C.dialogueact577	1526.27	1528.58	C	Grad	s	+1	0	And the Approach mode , anyhow , is the default .
Bed005.C.dialogueact578	1529.07	1530.33	C	Grad	s	+1	0	That 's all they do it these days .
Bed005.C.dialogueact579	1530.7	1538.4	C	Grad	s.x	+1	0	Wherever you 'll find a route planner it n does nothing but get to the closest point where the street network is {vocalsound} at minimal distance to the geometric center .
Bed005.B.dialogueact580	1531.3	1531.68	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.C.dialogueact581	1539.15	1540.06	C	Grad	%	-1	0	
Bed005.C.dialogueact582	1541.33	1541.58	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bed005.B.dialogueact583	1542.49	1543.77	B	Professor	fg|s^ba	-1	0	So , well , let {disfmarker} Now , this is important .
Bed005.B.dialogueact584	1543.77	1548.49	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Let , uh {disfmarker} I want a a Again , outside of m almost managerial point ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact585	1549.11	1549.87	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact586	1554.19	1555.18	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	You 're in the midst of this ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact587	1555.18	1555.76	B	Professor	s^df^e	-1	0	so you know better .
Bed005.B.dialogueact588	1555.76	1564.07	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	But it seems to me it 's probably a good idea to li uh {disfmarker} minimize the number of uh , change requests we make of them .
Bed005.B.dialogueact589	1564.49	1567.67	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	So it seemed to me , what we ought to do is get our story together .
Bed005.B.dialogueact590	1568.78	1569.15	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	OK ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact591	1569.15	1574.23	B	Professor	s^cs^e	+1	1	And think about it some , internally , before asking them to make changes .
Bed005.C.dialogueact592	1575.06	1575.42	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact593	1575.82	1575.97	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Oh .
Bed005.B.dialogueact594	1576.06	1577.47	B	Professor	qy	-1	0	Does this {disfmarker} does this make sense to you guys ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact595	1577.47	1579.71	B	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	It {disfmarker} I mean you 're {disfmarker} you 're doing the {disfmarker} the interaction
Bed005.B.dialogueact596	1579.71	1588.03	B	Professor	s^cs^df.%--	-1	0	but it seemed to me that {vocalsound} what we ought to do is come up with a {disfmarker} uh , something where you , um {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact597	1590.18	1592.56	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And I {disfmarker} I don't know who 's mok working most closely on it .
Bed005.B.dialogueact598	1592.69	1593.42	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	Probably Johno .
Bed005.B.dialogueact599	1593.98	1594.36	B	Professor	s^f	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.B.dialogueact600	1594.9	1596.32	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh , take what they have ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact601	1598.33	1600.07	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	send it to everybody saying " this is what they have ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact602	1600.07	1601.63	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	this is what we think we should add " ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact603	1602.28	1602.56	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	OK ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact604	1602.62	1606.65	B	Professor	s.%--:s.%--	-1	0	and then have a d a {disfmarker} an iteration within our group saying " Hmm , well {disfmarker} "
Bed005.B.dialogueact605	1606.99	1607.3	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	OK ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact606	1607.51	1609.55	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And get our best idea of what we should add .
Bed005.C.dialogueact607	1609.88	1610.13	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact608	1610.49	1611.53	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And then go back to them .
Bed005.B.dialogueact609	1612.76	1613.02	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	Is i
Bed005.B.dialogueact610	1613.02	1613.68	B	Professor	s^bd^no	-1	0	or , I don't know
Bed005.B.dialogueact611	1613.68	1614.73	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	does this make sense to you ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact612	1614.73	1614.91	B	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	Or
Bed005.C.dialogueact613	1615.17	1617.13	C	Grad	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah . {vocalsound} Especially if we want {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact614	1617.94	1624.7	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	Sort of , what I {disfmarker} my feeling was eh we {disfmarker} we sort of reserved something that has a r eh an OK label .
Bed005.C.dialogueact615	1624.92	1627.59	C	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker} th that was my th first sort of step .
Bed005.B.dialogueact616	1627.02	1627.38	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.C.dialogueact617	1628.1	1628.45	C	Grad	%--	-1	0	I w
Bed005.C.dialogueact618	1629.16	1632.83	C	Grad	s	-1	0	No matter how we want to call it , {vocalsound} this is sort of our playground .
Bed005.B.dialogueact620	1633.23	1633.46	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.C.dialogueact619	1632.83	1645.73	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And if we get something in there that is a structure elaborate and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and complex enough to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to maybe enable a whole simulation , one of these days , that would be {disfmarker} u the {disfmarker} the perfect goal .
Bed005.B.dialogueact621	1642.4	1642.65	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.B.dialogueact622	1644.72	1645.1	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	That 's right .
Bed005.B.dialogueact623	1645.1	1645.29	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	So .
Bed005.B.dialogueact624	1645.29	1646.19	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	So , Yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact625	1646.19	1648.74	B	Professor	s	+1	0	The problem isn't the short ra range optimization .
Bed005.B.dialogueact626	1648.74	1651.79	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's the sort of {disfmarker} o one or two year kind of thing .
Bed005.B.dialogueact627	1651.79	1655.4	B	Professor	s^f|qh	+1	1	OK . What are the thl class of things we think we might try to do in a year or two ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact628	1655.92	1658.03	B	Professor	qh	-1	0	How {disfmarker} how would we try to characterize those
Bed005.B.dialogueact629	1658.03	1662.19	B	Professor	qw	+1	0	and what do we want to request now {vocalsound} that 's leave enough space to do all that stuff ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact630	1661.65	1661.95	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact632	1662.55	1662.79	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.C.dialogueact631	1662.14	1662.39	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yep .
Bed005.B.dialogueact633	1662.91	1664.32	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And that re that requires some thought .
Bed005.C.dialogueact634	1665.25	1665.41	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bed005.B.dialogueact635	1666.57	1671.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} so that sounds like a great thing to do {vocalsound} as the priority item
Bed005.B.dialogueact636	1672.55	1674.24	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	um , as soon as we can do it .
Bed005.C.dialogueact637	1674.39	1674.53	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yep .
Bed005.B.dialogueact638	1675.5	1685.0	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So y so you guys will {vocalsound} send to the rest of us um {pause} {vocalsound} a version of um , this ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact639	1685.6	1688.16	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} uh , description {disfmarker}
Bed005.A.dialogueact640	1687.55	1689.56	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	With sugge yeah , suggested improvements
Bed005.A.dialogueact641	1689.56	1689.9	A	Grad	%--	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact642	1689.79	1690.07	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	Well b
Bed005.B.dialogueact643	1690.07	1690.2	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact644	1690.47	1694.08	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	So , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} Not everyone uh , reads German ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact645	1694.08	1694.58	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so if you 'd
Bed005.B.dialogueact646	1695.1	1695.83	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um
Bed005.A.dialogueact647	1696.23	1696.9	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact648	1697.57	1701.84	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	tu uh , tur change the description to , uh , English
Bed005.A.dialogueact649	1701.63	1701.9	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.B.dialogueact650	1702.46	1704.92	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and , um ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact651	1706.57	1707.01	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	Then {disfmarker} then ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact652	1707.01	1710.12	B	Professor	fh|qh^cs	-1	0	yeah . Then , with some sug s suggestions about where {disfmarker} where do we go from here ?
Bed005.A.dialogueact654	1711.6	1711.75	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.B.dialogueact653	1711.57	1715.98	B	Professor	s	+1	0	Uh , this {disfmarker} and this , of course , was just the {vocalsound} {vocalsound} action end .
Bed005.B.dialogueact655	1715.98	1717.97	B	Professor	s	+1	1	Uh , at some point we 're going to have to worry about the language end .
Bed005.B.dialogueact656	1717.97	1724.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But for the moment just {vocalsound} uh , t for this class of {disfmarker} of things , we might want to try to encompass .
Bed005.B.dialogueact657	1725.42	1726.34	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bed005.A.dialogueact658	1727.22	1731.29	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Then the scope of this is beyond {pause} Approach and Vis - or Vista .
Bed005.A.dialogueact660	1731.29	1731.74	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact659	1730.82	1731.73	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Oh , yeah , yeah yeah yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact661	1731.73	1738.59	B	Professor	s	+1	1	This is {disfmarker} this is everything that {disfmarker} that , um , {pause} {vocalsound} you know , um {pause} we might want to do in the next couple years .
Bed005.A.dialogueact662	1735.85	1736.27	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bed005.A.dialogueact663	1740.81	1741.33	A	Grad	s^bu.%--	-1	0	So what would {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact664	1740.83	1741.09	C	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Hmm ?
Bed005.A.dialogueact665	1741.66	1741.97	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.B.dialogueact666	1744.48	1745.48	B	Professor	s	-1	0	We don't {disfmarker} I mean , that 's an issue .
Bed005.B.dialogueact667	1745.48	1746.54	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	We don't know what , entirely .
Bed005.A.dialogueact668	1746.87	1747.27	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Uh , yeah .
Bed005.A.dialogueact669	1747.27	1747.77	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	but I 'm just {disfmarker}
Bed005.A.dialogueact670	1751.28	1751.65	A	Grad	s^df.%--	-1	0	But the {disfmarker}
Bed005.A.dialogueact671	1751.65	1752.06	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , OK .
Bed005.A.dialogueact672	1752.12	1752.65	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So I just {disfmarker}
Bed005.A.dialogueact673	1752.95	1756.96	A	Grad	s	-1	0	this XML stuff here just has to do with Source - Path - Goal type stuff ,
Bed005.A.dialogueact674	1757.48	1760.49	A	Grad	s	-1	0	in terms of traveling through Heidelberg .
Bed005.C.dialogueact675	1758.81	1759.44	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed005.A.dialogueact677	1760.79	1762.82	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	Or travel , specifically .
Bed005.B.dialogueact676	1760.64	1760.94	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.A.dialogueact678	1763.57	1765.64	A	Grad	qy	-1	0	So , but this O Is the domain greater than that ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact679	1766.1	1766.39	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bed005.A.dialogueact681	1766.81	1767.42	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.B.dialogueact680	1766.76	1770.65	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I think {disfmarker} I think the i the idea is {pause} that {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact682	1772.38	1773.89	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	Oh . It 's beyond Source - Path - Goal ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact683	1773.89	1777.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but I think we don't need to get beyond it @ @ {comment} {disfmarker} tourists in Heidelberg .
Bed005.A.dialogueact684	1777.12	1777.43	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.B.dialogueact685	1777.94	1786.54	B	Professor	s	+1	1	It seems to me we can get {vocalsound} all the complexity we want in actions and in language without going outside of tourists in Heidelberg .
Bed005.B.dialogueact686	1787.46	1787.82	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	OK ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact687	1788.18	1793.69	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But you know , i depending on what people are interested in , one could have , {vocalsound} uh , tours ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact688	1793.69	1800.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	one could have {vocalsound} um , explanations of why something is {disfmarker} is , you know , why {disfmarker} why was this done ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact689	1800.17	1800.33	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact690	1800.33	1801.84	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , no {disfmarker} there 's no end
Bed005.B.dialogueact691	1802.3	1808.52	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	to the complexity you can build into the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , what a tourist in Heidelberg might ask .
Bed005.A.dialogueact692	1807.87	1808.37	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact693	1809.34	1818.29	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	So , at least {disfmarker} unless somebody else wants t to suggest otherwise I think {vocalsound} the general domain we don't have t to uh , broaden .
Bed005.B.dialogueact694	1819.18	1820.49	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	That is , tourists in Heidelberg .
Bed005.B.dialogueact695	1823.44	1826.38	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And if there 's something somebody comes up with that can't be done that way , then , sure .
Bed005.B.dialogueact696	1826.38	1827.45	B	Professor	s	-1	0	W we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll look at that ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact697	1827.52	1829.81	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but {vocalsound} uh
Bed005.B.dialogueact698	1831.84	1833.32	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I 'd be s I I 'd be surprised at {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact699	1833.9	1837.97	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	if there 's any {disfmarker} {vocalsound} important issue that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact700	1839.06	1840.58	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	And , um {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact701	1841.47	1847.35	B	Professor	s^ba^cs	-1	0	I mean if {disfmarker} if you want to {pause} uh , push us into reference problems , that would be great .
Bed005.F.dialogueact702	1847.59	1847.86	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.B.dialogueact703	1848.18	1851.33	B	Professor	s	-1	0	OK , so this is {disfmarker} his specialty is {disfmarker} reference ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact704	1850.27	1850.85	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact705	1851.93	1854.59	B	Professor	qh^e	-1	0	and {disfmarker} you know , what {disfmarker} what are these things referring to ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact706	1854.59	1856.37	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Not only {vocalsound} anaphora ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact707	1856.37	1863.22	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but , uh , more generally the , uh {disfmarker} this whole issue of , uh , referring expressions ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact708	1863.22	1867.45	B	Professor	qh	-1	0	and , what is it that they 're actually dealing with in the world ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact709	1867.51	1868.08	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact710	1868.16	1871.61	B	Professor	s	+1	0	And , again , this is li in the databa this is also pretty well formed
Bed005.B.dialogueact711	1871.61	1873.05	B	Professor	s	+1	0	because there is an ontology ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact712	1874.07	1875.96	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and the database , and stuff .
Bed005.B.dialogueact713	1875.96	1881.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So it isn't like , {vocalsound} um , you know , the Evening Star or stuff like that .
Bed005.F.dialogueact714	1880.9	1881.21	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.B.dialogueact715	1881.43	1881.97	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	I i it {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact716	1882.2	1885.71	B	Professor	s	+1	0	All the entities do have concrete reference .
Bed005.B.dialogueact718	1885.97	1889.13	B	Professor	s	+1	1	Although th the {vocalsound} To get at them from a language may not be trivial .
Bed005.F.dialogueact717	1885.85	1886.21	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.B.dialogueact720	1889.65	1896.71	B	Professor	s	-1	0	There aren't really deep mysteries about um , what w what things the system knows about .

Bed005.E.dialogueact864	2217.73	2218.99	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact865	2222.47	2228.45	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So once that 's done , then all the rest of it is , uh , sort of , you know , what we want to do for the research .
Bed005.B.dialogueact866	2229.24	2234.47	B	Professor	s	+1	0	And we can {disfmarker} w we can do all sorts of things that don't fit into their framework at all .
Bed005.B.dialogueact867	2235.81	2238.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Th - there 's no reason why we 're c we 're constrained to do that .
Bed005.E.dialogueact868	2235.99	2236.65	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact869	2238.53	2249.13	B	Professor	s	-1	0	If we can use all the , uh , execution engines , then we can , {vocalsound} you know , really {nonvocalsound} try things that would be too {disfmarker} too much pain to do ourselves .
Bed005.E.dialogueact870	2246.52	2247.57	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact871	2249.13	2250.73	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But there 's no obligation on any of this .
Bed005.B.dialogueact872	2251.15	2255.77	B	Professor	s	+1	0	So , if we want to turn it into u understan standing stories about Heidelberg , we can do that .
Bed005.B.dialogueact873	2257.04	2258.37	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , that would just be a t a um {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact874	2259.81	2264.44	C	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	Or , as a matter of fact , we need {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and if we if we ' r eh {disfmarker} take a ten year perspective , we need to do that ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact875	2264.99	2265.61	C	Grad	s^df.%--	-1	0	because
Bed005.C.dialogueact876	2266.29	2266.42	C	Grad	%--	-1	0	w
Bed005.C.dialogueact877	2266.99	2273.77	C	Grad	s	-1	0	e w a Assuming we have this , um , we we ta in that case we actually do have these wonderful stories , and historical anecdotes ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact878	2270.42	2270.66	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.C.dialogueact879	2273.77	2276.08	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and knights jumping out of windows ,
Bed005.E.dialogueact880	2273.94	2274.36	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed005.C.dialogueact881	2276.08	2277.39	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and - and - and {disfmarker} {comment} {comment} tons of stuff .
Bed005.C.dialogueact882	2277.92	2279.47	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So , th the database is huge ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact883	2280.12	2286.69	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and if we want to answer a question on that , we actually have to go one step before that , and understand that .
Bed005.C.dialogueact885	2287.7	2290.61	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	In order to e do sensible information extraction .
Bed005.E.dialogueact884	2287.21	2287.76	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.E.dialogueact886	2288.99	2289.22	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.E.dialogueact887	2290.12	2290.64	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact889	2291.38	2291.94	B	Professor	s^am|s^aa	-1	0	You might , yeah .
Bed005.C.dialogueact888	2290.92	2291.54	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	And so ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact891	2292.26	2309.93	C	Grad	qh	-1	0	um , this has been a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a Deep Map research issue that was {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is part of the unresolved , and to - do 's , and something for the future , is {vocalsound} how can we sort of run our our text , our content , through a machine {vocalsound} that will enable us , later , to retrieve or answer e questions more sensibly ?

Bed005.F.dialogueact899	2311.22	2312.99	F	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	So , uh {disfmarker} So , uh , I was just going to ask ,
Bed005.F.dialogueact900	2312.99	2313.86	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	um , {vocalsound} so ,
Bed005.F.dialogueact901	2314.78	2322.36	F	PhD	qw.%-	+1	0	what is the {disfmarker} the basic thing that {disfmarker} that you are , um , obligated to do , um , uh , by the summer before w uh y c we can move {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact902	2319.84	2320.42	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Ah !
Bed005.B.dialogueact903	2321.83	2322.13	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.B.dialogueact904	2322.13	2322.98	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker} eh {disfmarker} Yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact905	2322.98	2324.48	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So , what happened is ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact906	2324.98	2326.25	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	there 's this , eh , uh {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact907	2326.33	2327.31	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Robert was describing
Bed005.B.dialogueact908	2327.77	2329.7	B	Professor	s	+1	0	the {disfmarker} There 's two packages
Bed005.B.dialogueact909	2329.7	2332.02	B	Professor	s	+1	0	there 's a , uh , quote parser ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact910	2332.02	2334.74	B	Professor	s	+1	0	there 's a particular piece {vocalsound} of this big system ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact911	2335.06	2340.37	B	Professor	s	+1	1	which , in German , uh , takes these t sentence templates and produces XML structures .
Bed005.B.dialogueact913	2341.06	2345.29	B	Professor	s	+1	0	And one of our jobs was to make the English equivalent of that .
Bed005.F.dialogueact912	2340.6	2340.89	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.B.dialogueact914	2345.79	2347.95	B	Professor	s	+1	4	That , these guys did in a {disfmarker} in a day .
Bed005.F.dialogueact915	2345.84	2346.38	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.F.dialogueact916	2348.23	2348.51	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.B.dialogueact917	2348.79	2358.18	B	Professor	s	+1	0	The other thing is , at the other end , roughly at the same level , there 's something that takes , uh , X M L structures , produces an output XML structure
Bed005.B.dialogueact918	2358.18	2361.11	B	Professor	s	+1	0	which is instructions for the generator .
Bed005.F.dialogueact919	2361.25	2361.54	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.B.dialogueact920	2361.98	2362.39	B	Professor	s^f	-1	0	OK ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact921	2362.56	2364.03	B	Professor	s	+1	0	And then there 's a language generator ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact922	2364.03	2374.78	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and then after that a s a synthesizer that goes from an XML structure to , uh , language generation , to actual specifications for a synthesizer .
Bed005.B.dialogueact923	2374.78	2382.26	B	Professor	s	+1	1	Eh , but again , there 's one module in which there 's one piece {vocalsound} that we have to convert to English .
Bed005.F.dialogueact924	2374.98	2375.56	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.F.dialogueact925	2382.23	2382.51	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.F.dialogueact926	2382.67	2382.9	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Got it .
Bed005.B.dialogueact927	2383.42	2383.69	B	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	Is that {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact928	2385.32	2385.46	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.B.dialogueact929	2385.46	2391.85	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And that {disfmarker} But as I say , this is {disfmarker} all along was viewed as a kind of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a m a minor thing ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact930	2392.19	2393.56	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	necessary , but {disfmarker} but not {disfmarker}
Bed005.F.dialogueact931	2393.87	2394.1	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.B.dialogueact932	2394.38	2394.69	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	OK ?
Bed005.F.dialogueact933	2394.44	2394.71	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.B.dialogueact934	2395.16	2405.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And much more interesting is the fact that , {vocalsound} as part of doing this , we {disfmarker} we are , you know , inheriting this system that does all sort of these other {vocalsound} things .
Bed005.F.dialogueact935	2395.25	2395.73	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That 's great !
Bed005.F.dialogueact936	2404.41	2404.74	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.B.dialogueact937	2406.16	2407.84	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Not precisely what we want ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact938	2407.84	2412.65	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and that 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that 's wh where it {disfmarker} it gets difficult .
Bed005.B.dialogueact939	2412.65	2416.86	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And I {disfmarker} I don't pretend to understand yet what I think we really ought to do .
Bed005.C.dialogueact940	2421.27	2421.61	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.C.dialogueact941	2422.85	2424.08	C	Grad	fg|s^rt^t^tc	-1	0	So , e enough of that ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact942	2424.45	2425.87	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	but I , uh , um ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact943	2426.93	2427.07	C	Grad	b	-1	0	mmm ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact944	2428.05	2432.35	C	Grad	s^cc^rt	-1	0	the e sort of , Johno and I will take up that responsibility ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact945	2433.1	2436.05	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and , um , get a first draft of that .
Bed005.C.dialogueact946	2436.65	2441.53	C	Grad	s^t	-1	0	Now , we have um just , I think two more short things .
Bed005.B.dialogueact947	2441.96	2442.15	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.C.dialogueact948	2443.26	2450.9	C	Grad	fh|qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Um , y you guys sort of started fighting , uh , on the Bayes - net " Noisy - OR " front ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact949	2449.28	2449.91	D	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed005.D.dialogueact950	2451.52	2454.44	D	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah , I thought I should , um , talk a little bit about that ,
Bed005.D.dialogueact951	2454.44	2461.87	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because that might be a good , uh , sort of architecture to have , in general for , uh , problems with , {vocalsound} you know , multiple inputs to a node .
Bed005.B.dialogueact952	2458.59	2459.41	B	Professor	s^ba|s^bk	-1	0	Good ! OK .
Bed005.B.dialogueact953	2461.77	2461.91	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Good .
Bed005.B.dialogueact954	2462.21	2462.86	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	And what 's the other one ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact955	2462.86	2464.41	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	so that {disfmarker} just we know what the d agenda is ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact956	2464.37	2465.54	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Um , the Wu paper ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact957	2465.62	2466.51	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	I think maybe {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact958	2466.2	2466.53	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact959	2466.53	2468.55	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I 've got a couple new Wu papers as well .
Bed005.B.dialogueact960	2468.55	2470.26	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh , so I {disfmarker} I 've been in contact with Wu ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact961	2470.26	2477.06	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so , probably let 's put that off till I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} till I understand better , {vocalsound} uh , what he 's doing .
Bed005.B.dialogueact962	2477.06	2478.12	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's just a little embarrassing
Bed005.B.dialogueact963	2478.12	2479.31	B	Professor	s	-1	0	cause all this was in his thesis
Bed005.B.dialogueact964	2479.31	2480.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and I was on his thesis committee ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact965	2481.16	2484.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and , so , {vocalsound} I r really knew this at one time .
Bed005.F.dialogueact966	2482.65	2482.79	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Ugh .
Bed005.B.dialogueact967	2484.87	2489.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} It 's not only uh Is {disfmarker} Part of what I haven't figured out yet is {disfmarker} is how all this goes together .
Bed005.B.dialogueact968	2489.74	2492.29	B	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	So I 'll dig up some more stuff from Dekai .
Bed005.B.dialogueact969	2493.12	2495.26	B	Professor	qh^cs.%-	-1	0	And {disfmarker} so why don't we just do the , uh {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact970	2495.87	2496.19	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.D.dialogueact971	2497.02	2497.43	D	Grad	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact972	2498.23	2500.02	D	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	should I {disfmarker} Is there a white board here that I can use ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact973	2501.12	2502.1	B	Professor	s^aa|s.%-	-1	0	Yeah . You could {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact974	2501.13	2501.53	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker}
Bed005.E.dialogueact975	2501.7	2501.86	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact977	2502.41	2502.81	B	Professor	s.%	-1	0	squealing sound ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact976	2502.36	2503.36	D	Grad	qrr	-1	0	Or shall I just use this ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact978	2503.45	2504.4	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	It 's probably just as easy .
Bed005.B.dialogueact979	2504.4	2504.62	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	I
Bed005.F.dialogueact980	2504.41	2504.65	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.D.dialogueact981	2504.95	2505.31	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.A.dialogueact982	2505.55	2506.82	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	You can put the microphone in your pocket .
Bed005.D.dialogueact983	2507.31	2507.57	D	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Hey !
Bed005.A.dialogueact984	2511.96	2513.25	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I was envying you and your pocket
Bed005.A.dialogueact985	2513.25	2514.03	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	cause I don't have one .
Bed005.E.dialogueact986	2515.09	2516.03	E	Grad	s|qy^d^g	-1	0	It was a quick one , huh ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact987	2515.82	2517.32	B	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's why they invented " pocket T 's " .
Bed005.A.dialogueact989	2517.69	2518.22	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	exactly
Bed005.E.dialogueact988	2517.38	2518.1	E	Grad	s	-1	0	They have clips !
Bed005.D.dialogueact991	2519.14	2519.37	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.E.dialogueact990	2518.72	2518.92	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Huh .
Bed005.D.dialogueact992	2519.78	2527.73	D	Grad	fg|s^tc	+1	0	So , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Recall that , uh , we want to have this kind of structure in our Bayes - nets .
Bed005.D.dialogueact993	2528.47	2532.43	D	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Namely , that , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} You have these nodes that have several bands , right ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact994	2532.81	2533.26	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact995	2533.96	2535.21	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	Does I mean , they sort of {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact996	2536.73	2540.52	D	Grad	s^rt	+1	1	the typical example is that , um , these are all a bunch of cues for something ,
Bed005.D.dialogueact997	2540.72	2542.74	D	Grad	s	+1	1	and this is a certain effect that we 'd like to conclude .
Bed005.D.dialogueact998	2543.34	2543.7	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	So , uh {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact999	2544.18	2547.96	D	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Like , let 's just look at the case when , um , this is actually the {disfmarker} the final action , right ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact1000	2547.96	2551.55	D	Grad	s	-1	0	So this is like , uh , {vocalsound} you know , touch ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact1001	2551.11	2552.07	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	Y

Bed005.D.dialogueact1027	2571.87	2573.2	D	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , let me pick a random one
Bed005.E.dialogueact1029	2572.36	2573.35	E	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	I haven't heard that before .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1030	2573.2	2573.55	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and say , uh {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact1031	2573.55	2574.33	D	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I don't know ,
Bed005.D.dialogueact1032	2574.33	2576.62	D	Grad	s^df^rt	-1	0	it could be , like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} This isn't the way it really is ,
Bed005.D.dialogueact1033	2576.62	2581.3	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	but let me say {disfmarker} that , suppose someone mentioned , uh , admission fees
Bed005.D.dialogueact1034	2583.48	2584.21	D	Grad	s^ba^bd	-1	0	Ah , it takes too long .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1035	2584.21	2585.36	D	Grad	s:s	-1	0	Try {disfmarker} let me just say " Landmark " .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1036	2585.87	2593.29	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	If the thing is a landmark , you know , {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} then there 's another thing that says if {disfmarker} {vocalsound} um {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact1037	2594.56	2596.46	D	Grad	s^rt.%--	-1	0	if it 's closed or not , at the moment .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1038	2597.59	2598.39	D	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	Alright , so you have nodes .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1039	2598.9	2599.15	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact1040	2599.15	2603.48	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	And the , uh , problem that we were having was that , you know , given N - nodes , there 's " two to the N "
Bed005.D.dialogueact1041	2604.18	2610.06	D	Grad	s	+1	0	Given N - nodes , and furthermore , the fact that there 's three things here , we need to specify " three times " , uh , " two to the N " probabilities .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1042	2610.6	2610.82	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact1043	2611.31	2613.33	D	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's assuming these are all binary , which f they may not be .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1044	2613.33	2614.77	D	Grad	s	-1	0	For example , they could be " time of day " ,
Bed005.D.dialogueact1045	2614.77	2619.16	D	Grad	s	-1	0	in which case we could , uh , say , you know , " Morning , afternoon , evening , night " .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1046	2619.16	2620.31	D	Grad	s	-1	0	So , this could be more
Bed005.D.dialogueact1047	2620.9	2621.63	D	Grad	s	-1	0	So , it 's a lot , anyway .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1048	2622.41	2624.89	D	Grad	s	+1	2	And , that 's a lot of probabilities to put here , which is kind of a pain .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1049	2625.51	2630.35	D	Grad	fh|s	+1	3	So {pause} Noisy - ORs are a way to , uh , {vocalsound} sort of deal with this .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1050	2631.04	2632.06	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um
Bed005.D.dialogueact1051	2632.9	2633.74	D	Grad	qw^t1	-1	0	Where should I put this ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact1052	2634.39	2647.48	D	Grad	s:s	-1	0	So , the idea is that , um , {vocalsound} Let 's call these , uh , C - one , C - two , C - three , and C - four , and E , for Cause and Effect , I guess .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1053	2652.87	2654.71	D	Grad	s	-1	0	The idea is to have these intermediate nodes .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1054	2658.57	2658.73	D	Grad	s^f	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1055	2661.27	2666.26	D	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , actually , the idea , first of all , is that each of these things has a {disfmarker} quote - unquote distinguished state ,
Bed005.D.dialogueact1056	2666.26	2669.42	D	Grad	s	-1	0	which means that this is {vocalsound} the state in which we don't really know anything about it .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1057	2669.42	2669.58	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact1058	2669.58	2669.81	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact1059	2670.24	2678.88	D	Grad	s	+1	0	So , for example , if we don't really know {vocalsound} if the thing is a landmark or not , Or , i if that just doesn't seem relevant , then that would be th sort of the Disting - the Distinguish state .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1060	2678.88	2682.92	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	It 's a really , you know , {vocalsound} if there is something for the person talking about the admission fee ,
Bed005.D.dialogueact1061	2683.37	2685.55	D	Grad	s	-1	0	you know , if they didn't talk about it , that would be the Distinguish state .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1063	2686.42	2689.03	C	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	S so , this is a fanciful way of saying " default " ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact1062	2686.3	2686.78	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact1064	2689.36	2690.0	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1065	2689.98	2690.26	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1066	2690.14	2691.86	D	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's just what they {disfmarker} the word they used in that paper .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1067	2691.11	2691.42	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1068	2692.51	2695.27	D	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	So , the idea is that , um , {vocalsound} you have these intermediate nodes , right ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact1069	2695.27	2697.66	D	Grad	s^rt:s^rt	-1	0	E - one , E - two , E - three and E - four ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact1070	2697.88	2699.91	B	Professor	s^bu	+1	0	So , this is the Heckerman paper you 're working with ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact1072	2699.91	2700.12	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Good .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1071	2699.51	2699.75	D	Grad	s^aa	+1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1073	2701.05	2710.13	D	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	+1	0	So {pause} The idea is that , each of these EI {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} represents what this would be {disfmarker} if all the other ones were in the distinguish state . Right ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact1074	2710.57	2714.12	D	Grad	s	-1	0	So , for example , suppose that the person {disfmarker} I mean , suppose the thing that they talked about is a landmark .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1075	2714.44	2716.49	D	Grad	s^e	-1	0	But none of the other {disfmarker} {vocalsound} sort of cues really apply .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1076	2717.9	2719.36	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	Then , {vocalsound} this would be {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact1077	2720.52	2724.39	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	W The {vocalsound} this would just represent the probability distribution of this ,
Bed005.D.dialogueact1078	2724.92	2727.75	D	Grad	s	-1	0	assuming that this cue is turned on and the other ones just didn't apply ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact1079	2728.55	2733.32	D	Grad	s	+1	0	So , you know , if it is a landmark , and no none of the other things really ap applicable , then {disfmarker} this would represent the probability distribution .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1080	2733.32	2743.27	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	So maybe in this case {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Maybe we just t k Maybe we decide that , if the thing 's a landmark and we don't know anything else , then we 're gonna conclude that , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} They want to view it with probability , you know , point four .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1081	2743.47	2748.9	D	Grad	s	-1	0	They want to enter it with probability , uh {disfmarker} with probability point five
Bed005.D.dialogueact1082	2748.96	2750.97	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and they want to approach it probability point one , say {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact1083	2751.69	2751.93	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact1084	2751.93	2753.96	D	Grad	s	+1	1	So we come up with these l little tables for each of those
Bed005.D.dialogueact1085	2755.1	2755.38	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1086	2756.25	2760.88	D	Grad	s^df	+1	1	And the final thing is that , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} this is a deterministic function of these ,
Bed005.D.dialogueact1087	2761.57	2763.2	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so we don't need to specify any probabilities .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1088	2764.02	2766.65	D	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	We just have to , um , say what function this is , right ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact1089	2767.16	2774.16	D	Grad	s:s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	So we can let this be , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} G of E - one comma E - two . E - three , E - four . Right ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact1090	2774.73	2778.39	D	Grad	s^rt:s	-1	0	and our example G would be , um , {vocalsound} a majority vote ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact1091	2780.22	2780.57	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact1092	2782.11	2789.72	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Well . OK , so th so the important point {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} W not what the G function is .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1093	2790.21	2799.32	B	Professor	s	+1	0	The important point is {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} There is a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a general kind of idea of shortcutting the full CPT .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1094	2799.32	2802.35	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	Th - c the full conditional probability table {disfmarker} with some function .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1095	2803.17	2803.51	B	Professor	s^f	-1	0	OK ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact1096	2803.59	2807.09	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Which y w you choose appropriately for each case .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1097	2807.09	2812.46	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So , depending on {vocalsound} what your situation is , there are different functions which are most appropriate .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1098	2813.05	2814.23	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1099	2814.67	2819.15	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So I gave {disfmarker} eh {disfmarker} Bhaskara a copy of this , eh {disfmarker} sort of " ninety - two " {comment} paper .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1101	2819.47	2820.84	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	D and you got one , Robert .

Bed005.D.dialogueact1105	2823.71	2825.77	D	Grad	s	-1	0	it 's Heckerman and Breese .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1106	2824.44	2825.01	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	It 's short .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1107	2826.11	2826.57	B	Professor	s^m^na	-1	0	It 's short .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1108	2826.73	2826.97	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1109	2827.31	2830.47	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	So , I u w Um , yo uh {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} Have you read it yet ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact1110	2830.84	2832.47	D	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	Uh , you can {disfmarker} Yeah , you should take a look at it , I guess .
Bed005.A.dialogueact1112	2832.36	2832.59	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK
Bed005.B.dialogueact1111	2832.12	2833.09	B	Professor	s^bk|s^cs	-1	0	OK , so you should take a look .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1113	2833.09	2834.82	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Nancy , I 'm sure you read it at some point in life .
Bed005.E.dialogueact1114	2834.17	2834.34	E	Grad	%--	-1	0	I {disfmarker}
Bed005.E.dialogueact1115	2834.34	2834.55	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah .
Bed005.E.dialogueact1116	2834.55	2835.37	E	Grad	s^na|s^aa	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I think so , yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1117	2835.87	2836.21	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1118	2836.79	2839.1	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And {disfmarker} so , you other guys can decide how interested {disfmarker}
Bed005.E.dialogueact1119	2836.83	2837.08	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Yeah , @ @ .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1120	2839.3	2841.11	B	Professor	fg|s^ba	-1	0	Anyway . So the paper isn't th isn't real hard .
Bed005.F.dialogueact1121	2839.44	2840.09	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1122	2841.38	2844.39	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1123	2844.6	2849.06	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	One of the questions just come at Bhaskara is , " How much of this does JavaBayes support ? "
Bed005.D.dialogueact1124	2849.76	2850.73	D	Grad	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	Yeah , it 's a good question .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1125	2850.73	2856.02	D	Grad	h|s	+1	0	Um {pause} {vocalsound} {nonvocalsound} The {disfmarker} so what we want , is basically JavaBayes to support deterministic , uh , functions .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1126	2856.21	2856.43	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1127	2856.63	2865.06	D	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	And , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} In a sense it sup we can make it supported by , um , {vocalsound} manually , uh , entering , you know , probabilities that are one and zeros , right ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact1128	2865.2	2867.69	B	Professor	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	Right . So the little handout that {disfmarker} The little thing that I sent {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1129	2867.69	2871.73	B	Professor	s.%--:s	-1	0	I sent a message saying , uh , here is a way to take {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1130	2872.1	2879.38	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	One thing you could do , which is kind of s in a way , stupid , is take this deterministic function , and use it to build the CPT .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1131	2880.41	2882.14	B	Professor	s	+1	1	So , if Ba - JavaBayes won't do it for you ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact1132	2881.51	2881.8	C	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1133	2882.96	2886.54	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	that you can convert all that into what the CPT would be .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1134	2887.34	2896.16	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um {disfmarker} and , what I sent out about a week ago , was an idea of how to do that , for , um , evidence combination .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1135	2896.16	2901.18	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	So one of {disfmarker} one function that you could use as your " G function " is an e e Evidence - Combining .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1136	2901.18	2913.18	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	So you just take {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} uh , if each of th if each of the ones has its own little table like that , {vocalsound} then you could take the , uh , strength of each of those , times its little table ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact1137	2913.18	2917.2	B	Professor	s^cs^e	-1	0	and you 'd add up the total evidence for " V " , " E " , and " A " .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1138	2914.71	2915.08	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1139	2917.48	2918.7	D	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	I don't think you can do this ,
Bed005.D.dialogueact1141	2918.7	2926.51	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because {disfmarker} {vocalsound} G is a function from {pause} that {vocalsound} to that .
Bed005.E.dialogueact1140	2918.47	2919.26	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1142	2919.43	2919.62	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1143	2927.11	2927.39	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1144	2928.14	2928.32	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact1145	2928.45	2929.65	D	Grad	s	-1	0	So there 's no numbers .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1146	2929.65	2934.38	D	Grad	s	-1	0	There 's just {disfmarker} quadruplets of {disfmarker} well , N - duplets of , uh , E Vs .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1147	2933.14	2933.69	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	I i i
Bed005.B.dialogueact1148	2934.12	2937.93	B	Professor	s^ar|s.%--	-1	0	No , no {disfmarker} But I 'm saying is {disfmarker} There {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} There is a w
Bed005.B.dialogueact1149	2937.93	2944.99	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , if y if {disfmarker} if you decide what 's {disfmarker} what is appropriate , is probablistic evidence combination , you can write a function that does it .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1150	2944.99	2947.09	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	It 's a pui it 's actually one of the examples he 's got in there .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1151	2948.01	2951.78	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But , anyway , s skipping {disfmarker} skipping the question of exactly which functions {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1152	2952.36	2961.44	B	Professor	qy	-1	0	now is it clear that you might like to be able to shortcut the whole conditional probability table .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1153	2962.82	2970.24	C	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , in some {disfmarker} it seems very plausible in some sense , where we will be likely to not be {disfmarker} observe some of the stuff .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1154	2970.83	2972.89	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Cuz we don't have the a access to the information .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1155	2972.11	2972.64	D	Grad	s^fa^t1	-1	0	Oops , {comment} sorry .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1156	2973.5	2973.76	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1157	2973.76	2976.37	B	Professor	qh	-1	0	That 's one of the problems , is , W Is {disfmarker} is , Where would th Where would it all come from ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact1158	2974.89	2975.1	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1159	2976.53	2976.88	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1160	2976.74	2977.13	D	Grad	%--	-1	0	Is {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact1162	2977.13	2977.53	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , right .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1163	2977.53	2979.22	D	Grad	s^m.%--	-1	0	W would not be ab able to observe
Bed005.E.dialogueact1161	2977.04	2977.29	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1164	2980.24	2980.46	D	Grad	qw^br	-1	0	What ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact1165	2980.99	2986.54	C	Grad	s	-1	0	I if it 's a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a discar Discourse Initial Phrase , we will have nothing in the discourse history .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1166	2988.27	2991.37	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	So , if {disfmarker} if we ever want to wonder what was mention
Bed005.D.dialogueact1167	2989.2	2989.56	D	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Oh {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact1168	2990.08	2992.18	D	Grad	s^bk|qy^bu^d	-1	0	Oh . A are you saying that we 'll not be able to observe certain nodes ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact1169	2992.18	2992.62	D	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	That 's fine .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1170	2992.62	2994.2	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	That is sort of orthogonal thing .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1171	2993.27	2995.31	B	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah , so there 's {disfmarker} there 's two separate things , Robert .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1172	2995.67	3004.04	B	Professor	s	+1	0	The f the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the Bayes - nets in general are quite good at saying , " if you have no current information about this variable just take the prior for that . "
Bed005.B.dialogueact1173	3004.98	3006.37	B	Professor	s^f|s	-1	0	OK ? Th - that 's what they 're real good at .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1174	3006.64	3013.91	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	So , if you don't have any information about the discourse , you just use your priors of {disfmarker} of whatever {disfmarker} eh the {disfmarker} discourse {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1175	3014.42	3014.75	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact1176	3014.75	3019.02	B	Professor	s	-1	0	eh , basically whatever w it 's {disfmarker} Probabilistically , whatever it would be .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1177	3019.02	3020.66	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And it 's {disfmarker} it 's sort of not a great estimate ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact1178	3019.16	3019.43	C	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1179	3020.66	3022.27	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but {disfmarker} it 's the best one you have ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact1180	3023.14	3023.94	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and , so forth .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1181	3023.94	3024.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So that , they 're good at .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1182	3024.68	3027.5	B	Professor	qh	-1	0	But the other problem is , how do you fill in all these numbers ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact1183	3027.99	3029.26	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And I think that 's the one he was getting at .
Bed005.E.dialogueact1184	3028.02	3028.44	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1185	3028.73	3028.83	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1187	3029.16	3032.33	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	So , specifically in this case you have to {disfmarker} f have this many numbers ,
Bed005.E.dialogueact1186	3028.89	3029.06	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1188	3032.33	3035.55	D	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	whereas in this case you just have to have three for this , three for this , three for this . Right ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact1190	3036.2	3036.95	C	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1189	3035.94	3037.47	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	So you have to have just three N ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact1191	3038.6	3039.86	D	Grad	s	-1	0	So , this is much smaller than that .
Bed005.A.dialogueact1192	3041.98	3042.72	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Asymptotically .
Bed005.E.dialogueact1193	3042.97	3043.35	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1195	3044.4	3045.83	B	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	Well , pretty quickly .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1194	3044.0	3044.19	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1196	3044.47	3044.72	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.A.dialogueact1197	3045.58	3045.64	A	Grad	%--	-1	0	U
Bed005.A.dialogueact1198	3045.64	3045.98	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah , yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1200	3046.25	3046.5	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	I mean {disfmarker}
Bed005.E.dialogueact1199	3046.2	3050.1	E	Grad	s	-1	0	So , you don't need da data enough to cover {disfmarker} uh , nearly as much stuff .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1201	3046.91	3047.2	D	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I don't know .
Bed005.A.dialogueact1202	3048.41	3053.76	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So , really , i What a {disfmarker} A Noisy - OR seems to kind of {pause} " neural - net - acize " these Bayes - nets ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact1203	3053.5	3054.16	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Eh {disfmarker} well to some
Bed005.B.dialogueact1204	3054.16	3054.45	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	No , no .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1205	3054.45	3058.07	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	So , " Noisy - OR " is a funny way of referring to this ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact1206	3058.07	3061.76	B	Professor	s^df:s	-1	0	because {vocalsound} the Noisy - OR is only one instance .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1207	3061.85	3063.31	D	Grad	fg|s:s	-1	0	Yeah . This isn't a Noisy - OR anymore .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1208	3062.92	3064.32	B	Professor	s^na:s	-1	0	That one actually isn't a Noisy - OR .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1209	3064.32	3066.5	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	So we 'll have to think of {vocalsound} of a way t t
Bed005.A.dialogueact1210	3065.16	3065.5	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1211	3067.03	3069.1	D	Grad	s:s	-1	0	it 's a Noisy - arg - max or a Noisy - whatever .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1212	3068.87	3069.44	B	Professor	s^aa|s^bd	-1	0	Yeah , whatever .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1213	3069.44	3069.64	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1214	3069.94	3072.03	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker} Eh {disfmarker} {comment} Um
Bed005.A.dialogueact1215	3072.72	3074.73	A	Grad	s^df.%--	-1	0	Well , my point was more that we just {disfmarker} eh {disfmarker}
Bed005.A.dialogueact1216	3074.88	3078.41	A	Grad	s	-1	0	With the neural net , right , eh , things come in , you have a function that combines them
Bed005.A.dialogueact1217	3078.41	3078.88	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1218	3079.15	3080.33	B	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yeah , it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} Tha - that 's true .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1219	3080.33	3089.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It is a is also more neural - net - like , although {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , it isn't necessarily sum {disfmarker} uh , s you know , sum of weights or anything like that .
Bed005.A.dialogueact1220	3088.81	3089.09	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1221	3089.56	3090.4	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean i You could have ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact1222	3090.94	3096.91	B	Professor	s:s	+1	0	uh , like the Noisy - OR function , really is one that 's essentially says , uh , take the max .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1223	3097.69	3098.12	D	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	Well , the " OR " .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1224	3099.22	3099.44	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Same .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1225	3099.84	3101.05	D	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Right . I guess you 're right .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1226	3101.05	3101.29	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1227	3103.05	3103.95	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh
Bed005.B.dialogueact1228	3104.57	3104.96	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	But anyway .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1229	3104.96	3105.11	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1230	3107.51	3113.11	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	And , I thi I think that 's the standard way people get around the {disfmarker} uh
Bed005.B.dialogueact1231	3113.69	3114.6	B	Professor	s	-1	0	There are a couple other ones .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1232	3114.6	3118.58	B	Professor	s	+1	0	There are ways of breaking this up into s to {disfmarker} to subnets and stuff like that .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1233	3118.64	3120.17	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	But , um
Bed005.B.dialogueact1234	3121.73	3122.28	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	The
Bed005.B.dialogueact1235	3124.03	3127.76	B	Professor	s^ba	+1	1	I think we definitely {disfmarker} I think it 's a great idea tha to {disfmarker} to pursue that .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1236	3129.17	3129.27	D	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Yep .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1237	3129.39	3129.73	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	So
Bed005.C.dialogueact1238	3130.55	3132.87	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Wha - still sort of leaves one question .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1239	3133.38	3138.38	C	Grad	s	-1	0	It {disfmarker} I mean you {disfmarker} you can always uh {disfmarker} see easily that {disfmarker} that I 'm not grasping everything correctly ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact1240	3138.38	3151.48	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	but {vocalsound} what seemed attractive to me in im uh in the last discussion we had , was {vocalsound} that we find out a means of {disfmarker} of getting these point four , point five , point one , of C - four ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact1241	3152.57	3157.77	C	Grad	s	-1	0	not because , you know , A is a Landmark or not , but we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we label this whatever object type ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact1242	3158.38	3162.68	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	and if it 's a garden , it 's point three , point four , point two .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1243	3162.68	3165.61	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	If it 's a castle , it 's point eight , point one , point one .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1244	3165.61	3170.74	C	Grad	s^rt:s	-1	0	If it 's , {vocalsound} uh , a town hall , it 's point two , point three , point five .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1245	3166.55	3166.75	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1246	3171.2	3171.78	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	And so forth .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1247	3172.31	3176.3	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And we don't want to write this down {disfmarker} necessarily every time for something
Bed005.C.dialogueact1248	3176.3	3176.68	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	but , uh {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact1250	3177.37	3177.79	C	Grad	s	-1	0	let 's see .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1249	3177.35	3178.04	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	It 'll be students {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact1251	3178.04	3179.08	D	Grad	qw	-1	0	Where else would it be stored ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact1252	3179.08	3179.61	D	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's the question .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1253	3179.69	3181.52	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , in the beginning , we 'll write up a flat file .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1255	3181.71	3181.95	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1254	3181.52	3183.0	C	Grad	s	-1	0	We know we have twenty object types
Bed005.B.dialogueact1256	3182.59	3182.79	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1257	3183.0	3184.68	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and we 'll write it down in a flat file .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1258	3183.54	3183.75	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	No .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1259	3183.75	3184.26	B	Professor	fg|%--	-1	0	So , i is
Bed005.B.dialogueact1260	3184.82	3185.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , let me say something , guys ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact1261	3185.43	3187.97	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	cuz there 's not {disfmarker} There 's a pretty point about this we might as well get in right now .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1263	3188.29	3195.2	B	Professor	s	+1	0	Which is {disfmarker} The hierarchy that s comes with the ontology is just what you want for this .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1262	3187.91	3188.34	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1264	3195.29	3204.71	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So that {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , if you know about it {disfmarker} let 's say , a particular town hall {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that , it 's one that is a monument , {vocalsound} then , that would be stored there .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1265	3205.19	3207.48	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	If you don't , you look up the hierarchy ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact1266	3208.26	3214.81	B	Professor	s:s	+1	1	Eh {disfmarker} so , you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you may or {disfmarker} So , then you 'd have this little vector of , um , you know , Approach Mode or EVA Mode .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1267	3214.81	3218.71	B	Professor	s:s	+1	0	Let 's {disfmarker} OK , so we have {vocalsound} the EVA vector for {disfmarker} for various kinds of landmarks .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1268	3219.01	3221.19	B	Professor	s	+1	1	If you know it for a specific landmark you put it there .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1269	3221.74	3225.6	B	Professor	s	+1	1	If you don't , you just go up the hierarchy to the first place you find one .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1270	3225.85	3226.11	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1271	3226.62	3228.09	D	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	So , is the idea to put it in the ontology ?
Bed005.B.dialogueact1272	3228.12	3228.61	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Absolutely .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1273	3228.91	3229.34	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1274	3229.63	3230.84	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	Uh , or , link to {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1275	3231.07	3231.2	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1276	3231.2	3234.7	B	Professor	s	+1	0	but {disfmarker} but in any case {disfmarker} i View it logically as being in the ontology .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1277	3234.7	3240.04	B	Professor	s:s	+1	1	It 's part of what you know about {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} an object , {vocalsound} is its EVA vector .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1278	3240.72	3241.11	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1280	3241.44	3244.16	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And , if yo As I say , if you know about a specific object , you put it there .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1279	3241.43	3242.6	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1281	3244.27	3245.69	B	Professor	s	-1	0	This is part of what Dekai was doing .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1282	3246.33	3250.23	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So , when we get to Wu , The - e We 'll see w what he says about that .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1283	3247.75	3248.05	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1284	3250.61	3253.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And , then if you {disfmarker} If it isn't there , it 's higher ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact1285	3253.29	3259.18	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and if you don't know anything except that it 's a b it 's {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} building , then up at the highest thing , you have the pr what amounts to a prior .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1286	3259.18	3266.02	B	Professor	s	-1	0	If you don't know anything else about a building , {vocalsound} uh , you just take whatever your crude approximation is up at that level ,
Bed005.D.dialogueact1287	3264.1	3264.57	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1288	3266.02	3268.11	B	Professor	s	-1	0	which might be equal , or whatever it is .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1289	3267.57	3267.88	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1290	3269.03	3274.86	B	Professor	s	+1	0	So , that 's a very pretty relationship between these local vectors and the ontology .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1291	3275.24	3280.0	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And it seems to me the obvious thing to do , unless {vocalsound} we find a reason to do something different .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1292	3281.78	3282.04	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1293	3282.53	3283.44	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Does this make sense to you ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact1294	3282.7	3282.94	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1295	3283.68	3283.86	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	Bhask - ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact1296	3283.75	3283.92	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1297	3284.9	3286.47	D	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	So , we are {disfmarker} but we {disfmarker} we 're not doing the ontology ,
Bed005.D.dialogueact1298	3286.47	3288.44	D	Grad	s^bu.%-	-1	0	so we have to get to whoever is doing the {disfmarker} u ultimately ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact1299	3288.71	3289.03	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Indeed .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1301	3289.03	3292.85	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So , that 's another thing we 're gonna need to do , is {disfmarker} is , to , either {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact1300	3288.73	3289.72	D	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	we have to get them to {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1302	3293.59	3298.94	B	Professor	s	+1	0	We 're gonna need some way to either get a p tag in the ontology , or add fields ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact1303	3298.94	3302.03	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} {comment} {comment} {vocalsound} some way to associate {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1304	3302.16	3306.91	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Or , w It may be that all we can do is , um , some of our own hash tables that it {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1305	3307.87	3309.87	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Th - the {disfmarker} th you know , there 's always a way to do that .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1306	3309.87	3310.71	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	It 's a just a question of {disfmarker}
Bed005.A.dialogueact1308	3311.4	3315.39	A	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , hash on object name to , you know , uh , the probabilities or whatever .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1307	3311.23	3311.29	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	i
Bed005.B.dialogueact1309	3312.79	3312.87	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	th
Bed005.B.dialogueact1310	3313.42	3313.76	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1311	3315.19	3315.27	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	e
Bed005.B.dialogueact1312	3315.46	3315.71	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1313	3315.93	3316.63	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	And , so ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact1314	3316.84	3316.9	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	i
Bed005.B.dialogueact1315	3317.5	3317.96	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact1316	3317.65	3320.23	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	But it 's , uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Well , it strikes me as a What For
Bed005.C.dialogueact1317	3321.12	3325.64	C	Grad	s	-1	0	If we get the mechanism , that will be sort of the wonderful part .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1318	3325.64	3328.89	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And then , {vocalsound} how to make it work is {disfmarker} is the second part ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact1319	3328.89	3339.02	C	Grad	s	-1	0	in the sense that {disfmarker} I mean , m the guy who was doing the ontology {disfmarker} eh , eh , s ap apologized that i it will take him another through {disfmarker} two to three days
Bed005.C.dialogueact1320	3339.02	3342.45	C	Grad	s	-1	0	because they 're having really trouble getting the upper level straight ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact1321	3342.45	3342.62	C	Grad	%--	-1	0	and
Bed005.C.dialogueact1322	3343.22	3343.73	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	right now .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1323	3344.4	3358.77	C	Grad	s	+1	1	The reason is , {vocalsound} given the craw bet uh , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the projects that all carry their own taxonomy and , on all history , {vocalsound} they 're really trying to build one top level ontology ft that covers all the EML projects ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact1324	3358.77	3360.7	C	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	and that 's , uh , uh , sort of a tough cookie ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact1325	3360.7	3362.83	C	Grad	s	-1	0	a little bit tougher than they {vocalsound} figured .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1326	3362.83	3364.5	C	Grad	s	-1	0	I could have told them s so .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1327	3364.49	3364.75	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1329	3364.98	3365.26	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1328	3364.67	3364.85	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1330	3365.48	3369.58	C	Grad	s	+1	0	But , nevertheless , it 's going to be there by n by , uh , next Monday
Bed005.C.dialogueact1331	3369.58	3374.71	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and I will show you what 's {disfmarker} what some examples {vocalsound} from that for towers , and stuff .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1332	3375.51	3376.39	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	And , um ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact1333	3378.03	3387.88	C	Grad	s	+1	0	what I don't think is ever going to be in the ontology , is sort of , you know , the likelihood of , eh , people entering r town halls , and looking at town halls , and approaching town halls ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact1334	3388.23	3390.68	C	Grad	s^df	+1	0	especially since we are b dealing with a case - based ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact1335	3390.68	3392.3	C	Grad	s^df^e	+1	0	not an instance - based ontology .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1336	3392.69	3398.94	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So , there will be nothing on {disfmarker} on that town hall , or on the Berkeley town hall , or on the {vocalsound} Heidelberg town hall ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact1337	3398.94	3400.82	C	Grad	s	-1	0	it 'll just be information on town halls .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1338	3401.32	3404.12	B	Professor	qh^df	-1	0	Well , they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} How ar What are they gonna do with instances ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact1339	3401.4	3401.78	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	But what {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1340	3404.36	3405.2	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , you {disfmarker} y
Bed005.C.dialogueact1341	3404.39	3405.22	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	Well , that 's {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact1342	3404.8	3405.22	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Hhh .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1343	3406.48	3408.32	C	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker} that 's al different question .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1344	3408.32	3412.97	C	Grad	qh^rt	-1	0	I mean , th the {disfmarker} first , they had to make a design question , {vocalsound} " do we take ontologies that have instances ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact1345	3412.97	3415.93	C	Grad	qh^e	-1	0	or just one that does not , that just has the types ? "
Bed005.B.dialogueact1346	3416.15	3416.41	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1347	3417.0	3422.83	C	Grad	s	+1	0	And , so , since the d decision was on types , on a d simply type - based , {vocalsound} we now have to hook it up to instances .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1348	3423.37	3424.47	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	I mean this is
Bed005.B.dialogueact1350	3425.67	3427.73	B	Professor	qw^df	-1	0	But what i What is SmartKom gonna do about that ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact1349	3425.43	3425.75	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	one {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1351	3429.13	3430.72	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Cuz , they have instances all the time .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1352	3432.32	3436.55	C	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah , but the ontology is really not a SmartKom thing ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact1353	3437.07	3438.33	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	in {disfmarker} in and of itself .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1354	3438.33	3442.92	C	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's more something that {vocalsound} I kicked loose in {disfmarker} in EML .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1355	3443.19	3445.76	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So it 's a completely EML thing .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1356	3445.9	3448.5	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	But {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} SmartKom 's gonna need an ontology .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1357	3448.69	3451.03	C	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yes , u a w a lot of people are aware of that .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1358	3451.75	3453.84	B	Professor	s^bk|qy^df	-1	0	I understand , {vocalsound} but is anybody doing anything about it ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact1359	3455.51	3456.26	C	Grad	h	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1360	3456.67	3457.04	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1361	3457.23	3458.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's a political problem .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1362	3458.25	3458.97	B	Professor	s	-1	0	We won't worry about it .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1363	3459.48	3464.05	C	Grad	s^ar|s	-1	0	No , but {disfmarker} th the r eh {disfmarker} I th I still think that there is enough information in there .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1364	3464.51	3465.98	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	For example , whether {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact1365	3466.38	3469.95	C	Grad	s	-1	0	OK . So , th it will know about the twenty object types there are in the world .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1366	3470.24	3472.45	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Let 's assume there are only twenty object types in this world .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1367	3473.64	3477.69	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And it will know if any of those have institutional meanings .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1368	3478.21	3483.0	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So , in a sense , " I " used as Institutions for some s in some sense or the other .
Bed005.C.dialogueact1369	3484.1	3486.69	C	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Which makes them {disfmarker} enterable . Right ?
Bed005.C.dialogueact1370	3486.8	3487.35	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	In a sense .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1372	3487.89	3487.95	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1373	3487.95	3489.12	B	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	Anyway . So we may have to {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact1371	3487.74	3487.87	C	Grad	s^f	-1	0	You know .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1375	3489.23	3489.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	This is with the whole thing ,
Bed005.C.dialogueact1374	3488.74	3488.88	C	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Yep .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1376	3490.0	3491.46	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	we may have to build another data stru
Bed005.C.dialogueact1377	3490.27	3490.49	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1378	3491.87	3493.36	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Conceptually , we know what should be done .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1379	3494.21	3501.93	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	When we see what people have done , it may turn out that the easiest thing to do {vocalsound} is to build a {disfmarker} a separate thing that {disfmarker} that just pools i i
Bed005.B.dialogueact1380	3502.53	3506.55	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Like , i i it {disfmarker} it may be , that , the {disfmarker} the instance {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1381	3506.64	3511.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	w That we have to build our own instance , uh , things , that , with their types ,
Bed005.D.dialogueact1382	3509.3	3509.95	D	Grad	fg|%--	-1	0	Yeah , it 's {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact1383	3510.28	3511.07	D	Grad	s^aa|s.%-	-1	0	Right , we can just assume {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1384	3511.44	3513.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then it goes off to the ontology once you have its type .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1385	3513.59	3514.66	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So we build a little data structure
Bed005.B.dialogueact1386	3515.02	3521.63	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And so what we would do in that case , is , in our instance gadget have {vocalsound} our E V
Bed005.B.dialogueact1387	3522.43	3525.48	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And if we d there isn't one we 'd get the type
Bed005.B.dialogueact1388	3525.48	3527.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then have the E V As for the type .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1389	3527.17	3531.11	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So we 'd have our own little , {vocalsound} uh , EVA tree .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1391	3531.7	3534.52	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And then , for other , uh , vectors that we need .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1390	3531.21	3531.4	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1392	3531.72	3532.02	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1393	3534.52	3539.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So , we 'd have our own little {vocalsound} things so that whenever we needed one , we 'd just use the ontology to get the type ,
Bed005.D.dialogueact1394	3534.77	3535.22	D	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1396	3540.11	3542.1	B	Professor	s^fe	-1	0	and then would hash or whatever we do to say , " ah !
Bed005.D.dialogueact1395	3539.76	3540.15	D	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1397	3542.1	3546.85	B	Professor	s:s^fe	+1	1	If it 's that type of thing , and we want its EVA vector , pppt - pppt ! {comment} it 's that . "
Bed005.B.dialogueact1398	3547.95	3549.47	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So , I I think we can handle that .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1399	3549.47	3557.84	B	Professor	s	+1	1	And then {disfmarker} But , the combination functions , and whether we can put those in Java Bayes , and all that sort of stuff , is , uh {disfmarker} is the bigger deal .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1400	3558.46	3558.72	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1401	3558.96	3560.69	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I think that 's where we have to get technically clever .
Bed005.A.dialogueact1403	3562.39	3566.97	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	We could just steal the classes in JavaBayes and then interface to them with our own code .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1402	3561.9	3562.34	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1404	3567.41	3569.0	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	Well , I me ye {nonvocalsound} eh , yeah , the {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact1405	3568.35	3571.28	D	Grad	s	-1	0	That requires understanding the classes in JavaBayes , I guess . @ @ .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1406	3570.24	3572.17	B	Professor	s^aa|s^ba	-1	0	Yeah , I mean , it 's , uh , e e e e e cute .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1407	3573.76	3574.62	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , you 've been around enough to {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1408	3574.62	3575.19	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1409	3575.36	3575.87	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	Just ?
Bed005.A.dialogueact1410	3576.57	3577.83	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	Well , it depends on {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1411	3576.9	3580.15	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	I mean , there 's this huge package which {disfmarker} which may or may not be consistent
Bed005.B.dialogueact1412	3580.21	3580.46	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1413	3580.52	3580.81	B	Professor	s^f	-1	0	you know .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1414	3582.61	3583.52	B	Professor	s^aa|s^cs	-1	0	But , yeah , we could look at it .
Bed005.A.dialogueact1415	3584.35	3584.91	A	Grad	s^df.%--	-1	0	Well , I was j
Bed005.A.dialogueact1416	3584.91	3585.32	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK . Yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1417	3585.52	3585.83	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1418	3586.56	3586.97	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	It 's b It {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1419	3588.97	3590.53	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	It 's an inter sort of a kind of a {disfmarker} it {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1420	3590.53	3591.91	B	Professor	s	-1	0	The thing is , it 's kind of an interpreter
Bed005.B.dialogueact1421	3591.91	3595.77	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and i i it expects its data structures to be in a given form ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact1422	3595.77	3599.26	B	Professor	s.%-:s	-1	0	and if you say , " hey , we 're gonna {vocalsound} make a different kind of data structure to stick in there {disfmarker} "
Bed005.A.dialogueact1423	3600.36	3601.97	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , no , but that just means there 's a protocol ,
Bed005.A.dialogueact1424	3602.25	3602.54	A	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bed005.A.dialogueact1425	3602.72	3603.26	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	That you could {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1426	3603.86	3604.34	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It may or may not .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1427	3604.34	3604.69	B	Professor	s^no^rt	-1	0	I don't know .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1428	3604.69	3609.09	B	Professor	qh	+1	0	That 's the question is " to what extent does it allow us to put in these G functions ? "
Bed005.B.dialogueact1429	3610.74	3611.26	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	And I don't know .
Bed005.A.dialogueact1430	3612.24	3613.82	A	Grad	s^ar|s^df.%--	-1	0	Well , no , but {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} What I uh the {disfmarker}
Bed005.A.dialogueact1431	3613.82	3616.44	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So you could have four different Bayes - nets that you 're running ,
Bed005.A.dialogueact1432	3616.54	3620.34	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and then run your own {disfmarker} write your own function that would take the output of those four ,
Bed005.A.dialogueact1433	3620.69	3622.45	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and make your own " G function " , is what I was saying .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1434	3621.91	3622.56	B	Professor	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	Yeah , that 's fine
Bed005.B.dialogueact1435	3622.56	3623.83	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	if it 's {disfmarker} if it comes only at the end .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1436	3623.83	3624.96	B	Professor	qh	-1	0	But suppose you want it embedded ?
Bed005.A.dialogueact1437	3626.05	3628.59	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , then you 'd have to break all of your Bayes - nets into smaller Bayes - nets ,
Bed005.A.dialogueact1438	3628.59	3629.26	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	with all the {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1439	3630.21	3630.4	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	Oh , that {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1440	3630.4	3631.96	B	Professor	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	Yeah , that 's a truly horrible way to do d it .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1441	3631.96	3632.7	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	One would hope {disfmarker}
Bed005.A.dialogueact1442	3632.71	3633.57	A	Grad	s^bk|s^df.%-	-1	0	Yeah , but I 'm just {disfmarker}
Bed005.C.dialogueact1443	3632.71	3633.38	C	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1444	3633.46	3634.39	B	Professor	s^bk|s^na	-1	0	Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , you bet .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1445	3634.92	3637.89	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	But , at that point you may say , " hey , Java Bayes isn't the only package in town .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1446	3637.89	3641.91	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	Let 's see if there 's another package that 's , eh , more civilized about this . "
Bed005.D.dialogueact1447	3642.01	3642.92	D	Grad	%	-1	0	
Bed005.B.dialogueact1448	3645.21	3647.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Now , Srini is worth talking to on this ,
Bed005.D.dialogueact1449	3645.53	3645.65	D	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1450	3648.22	3654.61	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	cuz he said that he actually did hack some combining functions into
Bed005.B.dialogueact1452	3655.02	3662.84	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But he doesn't remember {disfmarker} at least when I talked to him , he didn't remember {vocalsound} whether it was an e an easy thing , a natural thing , or whether he had to do some violence to it to make it work .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1451	3654.57	3654.84	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Ah !
Bed005.B.dialogueact1453	3663.68	3664.54	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1454	3664.76	3665.53	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	But he did do it .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1455	3665.63	3665.7	D	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1456	3666.51	3669.74	D	Grad	s^no	+1	0	I don't see why the , uh , combining f functions have to be directly hacked into
Bed005.D.dialogueact1457	3669.74	3671.23	D	Grad	s^df	+1	0	I mean , they 're used to create tables
Bed005.D.dialogueact1458	3671.23	3675.41	D	Grad	s	+1	0	so we can just make our own little functions that create tables in XML .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1459	3674.2	3679.48	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	Well , I say that 's one way to do it , is {disfmarker} is to just convert it int into a {disfmarker} into a C P T that you zip {disfmarker}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1460	3679.9	3680.83	B	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	It 's blown up ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact1461	3680.83	3682.2	B	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	and is a {disfmarker} it 's , uh {disfmarker} it 's huge ,
Bed005.B.dialogueact1462	3682.2	3686.86	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it doesn't require any data fitting or complication .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1463	3684.33	3685.02	D	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1464	3686.59	3686.72	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1465	3686.94	3690.6	D	Grad	s^nd.%--	-1	0	I don't think {disfmarker} I mean , the fact that it blown u blows up is a huge issue in the sense that {disfmarker}
Bed005.D.dialogueact1466	3691.02	3691.48	D	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , OK .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1467	3691.48	3692.51	D	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	So say it blows up , right ?
Bed005.D.dialogueact1468	3692.51	3697.04	D	Grad	s	-1	0	So there 's , like , the you know , ten , f ten , fifteen , uh , things .
Bed005.D.dialogueact1469	3697.13	3699.26	D	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's gonna be like , two to the {disfmarker} that ,
Bed005.D.dialogueact1470	3699.26	3700.36	D	Grad	s	-1	0	which isn't so bad .

Bed005.B.dialogueact1472	3701.75	3702.81	B	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	I 'm just saying tha that w
Bed005.B.dialogueact1473	3702.92	3703.98	B	Professor	s	-1	0	That was wi that was my note .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1474	3704.59	3706.05	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	The little note I sent said that .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1476	3706.89	3711.35	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	It said , " Here 's the way you 'd take the logical f G function and turn it into a CPT . "
Bed005.D.dialogueact1475	3706.57	3707.01	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .

Bed005.B.dialogueact1478	3712.51	3714.56	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean that {disfmarker} the Max - the Evidence - Combining function .
Bed005.B.dialogueact1479	3715.76	3716.57	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	So we could do that .
