It was noted that the thesis proposal did not put any emphasis on metaphor or on the scalability achieved by combining constructions with general construal mechanisms: constructions cover base cases , while metaphoric and metonymic cases are resolved with the extra help provided by construal.

It was agreed that metaphors are not abundant in the spatial domain.
Some of the candidates discussed were phrases like "on the bus" , "out of film" , non-spatial uses of "where" or other fixed expressions.
