Bro017.B.dialogueact25	41.488	45.978	B	Professor	s^rt	+1	2	because it was for the first time i'd be on a friend city as the outcome but it does 
Bro017.B.dialogueact26	46.248	50.138	B	Professor	s	-1	0	sound good and it was sort of like everything was lying on the floor and yeah it 
Bro017.B.dialogueact27	50.138	50.378	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	and yeah it 
Bro017.E.dialogueact28	50.4	50.74	E	PhD	fg	-1	0	and yeah it 
Bro017.E.dialogueact29	50.97	52.49	E	PhD	s	+1	1	and yeah it seemed like there were still some issues right that they were 
Bro017.B.dialogueact30	52.45	52.7	B	Professor	b	-1	0	right that they were 
Bro017.E.dialogueact31	52.49	52.74	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right that they were 
Bro017.E.dialogueact32	52.74	53.91	E	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	there's right that they were trying to decide 
Bro017.B.dialogueact33	53.882	55.672	B	Professor	s^na	+1	2	there's plenty of that i know issues trying to decide liked uh voice 
Bro017.E.dialogueact34	54.83	57.11	E	PhD	s.%-	+1	1	plenty of that i know issues but what happened was the daily liked uh voice activity actor 
Bro017.B.dialogueact35	56.64	64.825	B	Professor	s	+1	1	but what happened was the daily life as to where eating proposal speechless instead of call my cock out of us bulls that uh voice activated i think they're activity actor 
Bro017.B.dialogueact37	65.351	72.371	B	Professor	s:s	+1	1	and i so what a big surprise i mean equal to that it and then four months able we could've didn't because nobody i suppose bringing it up would be if if they could 
Bro017.E.dialogueact36	64.9	65.26	E	PhD	b	-1	0	i think they're and i so what 
Bro017.B.dialogueact38	72.371	75.091	B	Professor	s	+1	1	it up would be if if they could have didn't want you to this information either because we were working right 
Bro017.B.dialogueact40	75.506	80.219	B	Professor	s	+1	1	because we were working on mainly on voice activated i think the full pasta seven months because that somebody right 
Bro017.E.dialogueact39	75.29	75.59	E	PhD	b	-1	0	because we were working right 
Bro017.B.dialogueact41	80.219	82.759	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because that somebody gus the most uh seem to 
Bro017.B.dialogueact42	82.759	86.019	B	Professor	s	+1	1	uh seem to everybody said well this is not saturday didn't know that and 
Bro017.B.dialogueact43	86.9	89.99	B	Professor	s	+1	1	and of course but it's not working on c. h. s. greedy 
Bro017.B.dialogueact45	90.19	91.64	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and be i agree i so what 
Bro017.E.dialogueact44	89.705	90.035	E	PhD	b	-1	0	c. h. s. greedy and be 
Bro017.B.dialogueact46	91.64	92.26	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	i agree i so what yeah you apsos you're right

Bro017.B.dialogueact86	201.832	202.982	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it's nearly that so i don't see the problem the 
Bro017.B.dialogueact87	202.982	209.826	B	Professor	s:s	+1	1	don't see the problem the biggest problem of course is that the the docket that's instead of calm before the claims well before filled the conditions the are 
Bro017.B.dialogueact88	209.826	210.626	B	Professor	s^ba	+1	1	the conditions the are the best of the

Bro017.B.dialogueact109	279.96	280.46	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	it it oh but you still have that 
Bro017.E.dialogueact110	280.24	281.85	E	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	it oh but you still have that with the m. s. e. c. okay 
Bro017.B.dialogueact112	282.09	282.61	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah yeah but yeah 
Bro017.E.dialogueact111	281.85	282.23	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah yeah but with the m. s. e. c. okay yeah 
Bro017.B.dialogueact114	282.71	287.09	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	yeah yeah but you have the same problem i e. c. basically has an enormous number of uh in sessions in yeah 
Bro017.E.dialogueact113	282.23	282.43	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah yeah but yeah 
Bro017.E.dialogueact115	283.2	283.37	E	PhD	b	-1	0	you have the same problem i 
Bro017.E.dialogueact116	284.125	284.485	E	PhD	b	-1	0	e. c. basically 
Bro017.E.dialogueact117	286.47	286.92	E	PhD	b	-1	0	uh in sessions 
Bro017.E.dialogueact118	287.05	287.36	E	PhD	b	-1	0	in 
Bro017.B.dialogueact119	287.798	297.588	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	in so so now they want to say they'd be very five fifty percent blooming on before bottom explanation and only twenty five percent for this t. v. okay 
Bro017.E.dialogueact120	297.65	298.38	E	PhD	b	-1	0	v. okay and 
Bro017.B.dialogueact121	298.595	303.575	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	and uh and they almost agreed on that except that it wasn't a hundred percent agreed and so last 
Bro017.B.dialogueact122	303.575	307.554	B	Professor	s	+1	1	agreed and so last time of doing the maintained i just brought up the show so what you 
Bro017.B.dialogueact123	307.554	312.724	B	Professor	s	-1	0	up the show so what you know the quite frankly i'd surprised how old is like the law making these decisions because 
Bro017.B.dialogueact124	312.724	315.6	B	Professor	s	-1	0	decisions because this is a major decision for two years 
Bro017.B.dialogueact125	315.6	318.91	B	Professor	s	+1	1	decision for two years he off i can for five fifty percent improvement 
Bro017.B.dialogueact126	319.394	322.404	B	Professor	s	+1	1	insanity tossing on all these you to do something that's been maybe you should 
Bro017.B.dialogueact127	322.404	323.584	B	Professor	s^cs^t	-1	0	that's been maybe you should discuss that and everybody's 
Bro017.B.dialogueact128	323.584	326.474	B	Professor	s	+1	1	discuss that and everybody's all be discussed that in u. n. or to me they're not so what 
Bro017.B.dialogueact129	326.474	332.784	B	Professor	s:s	+1	1	not so what with a lot of people them and that because not everybody participates of these got qualified conferencing causes things then 
Bro017.B.dialogueact130	332.954	336.194	B	Professor	s	+1	1	things then they said oh no no no because so everybody's in a light it however 
Bro017.B.dialogueact131	336.464	341.284	B	Professor	s	+1	1	however there is only ten oh fifty nine so people kind of even you know about this state so i 
Bro017.B.dialogueact132	341.797	344.597	B	Professor	s	+1	1	so i badly and i thought it's okay to discuss that immediate 
Bro017.B.dialogueact133	344.997	347.567	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that immediate you know key uh uh raise the question is all soya have

Bro017.B.dialogueact144	376.045	382.81	B	Professor	s	-1	0	next wednesday viata going through have uh and other than for the confidence think also see uh like goes 
Bro017.E.dialogueact145	383.104	387.234	E	PhD	qo^tc	-1	0	so what about the issue of um the weights on that for the different systems uh well 
Bro017.E.dialogueact146	387.234	390.074	E	PhD	s^e.%-	-1	0	yeah that's what that's like uh well matched in media mismatch 
Bro017.B.dialogueact147	389.49	389.89	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah that's mismatch 
Bro017.B.dialogueact148	389.89	392.2	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	yeah that's what that's like very what's ballpoint because they beat says mismatch 
Bro017.B.dialogueact149	392.2	397.23	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because they beat says well you know we because money purely this number by choosing the right late anyways so what 
Bro017.B.dialogueact151	397.83	400.19	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so what you are right about to you know but yeah 
Bro017.E.dialogueact150	397.337	397.867	E	PhD	b	-1	0	so what 
Bro017.B.dialogueact152	401.041	401.431	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah if of course 
Bro017.B.dialogueact153	401.431	408.911	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah if of course if you put this zero the they zero on them is nice one issue ohio hiding it's nice today and then you done 
Bro017.E.dialogueact154	409.11	409.51	E	PhD	b	-1	0	by way so 
Bro017.B.dialogueact155	409.61	413.71	B	Professor	s	-1	0	by way so i also that there was already decided uh house a year ago and 
Bro017.B.dialogueact157	414.185	414.495	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so they're the staying the same 
Bro017.E.dialogueact156	413.93	415.32	E	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	a year ago so uh of and they're the staying the same 
Bro017.B.dialogueact158	415.47	417.63	B	Professor	h|s	-1	0	uh of course people are the most the like it now 
Bro017.B.dialogueact160	417.95	423.67	B	Professor	s	-1	0	the like it now what is happening now is that i've seen that people try to match the criterion to solution they 
Bro017.E.dialogueact159	417.745	418.245	E	PhD	b	-1	0	the like it now what is happening now 
Bro017.B.dialogueact161	424.0	424.83	B	Professor	s	-1	0	have solution 
Bro017.B.dialogueact162	425.18	428.08	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	now they went to they should have criteria criterion is and i think that is his right 
Bro017.E.dialogueact163	426.032	426.232	E	PhD	b	-1	0	to they should 
Bro017.B.dialogueact164	428.11	429.91	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and i think that is his mother rights relate 
Bro017.E.dialogueact165	429.78	430.1	E	PhD	b	-1	0	mother rights relate it to maybe 
Bro017.B.dialogueact166	430.56	432.26	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it to maybe that that eventually 
Bro017.B.dialogueact167	432.97	435.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that eventually it may have it may they may have to happen 
Bro017.B.dialogueact169	436.4	440.7	B	Professor	s	-1	0	bodies should happen at the point where everybody peace corps what's i would needed needed or would be quote 
Bro017.E.dialogueact168	436.17	436.47	E	PhD	b	-1	0	bodies should 
Bro017.B.dialogueact171	441.28	442.11	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and i don't see we did exactly i 
Bro017.E.dialogueact170	440.99	441.31	E	PhD	b	-1	0	would be quote and i don't see we did 
Bro017.B.dialogueact172	442.4	448.07	B	Professor	s	-1	0	exactly i think that that this test loss uh that of bogus because it doesn't they a and 
Bro017.B.dialogueact173	448.849	455.398	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and uh essentially there were as hobby trudy decisions made and and everything so 
Bro017.B.dialogueact174	455.718	460.02	B	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	so so so this is this is where it is sort of yeah i believe 
Bro017.B.dialogueact175	460.36	471.36	B	Professor	s^rt	+1	2	sort of yeah i believe that o. g. i know is uh uh the working basically on our new should be i've seen that have it and they connected 
Bro017.B.dialogueact176	472.14	473.11	B	Professor	s	+1	1	like the most separation 
Bro017.B.dialogueact177	474.12	484.6	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	uh so we are looking you know ways he's in uh the choose the the chicken prolife the better any show that's the metal demo specs through music 
Bro017.B.dialogueact178	485.37	488.1	B	Professor	s	+1	1	beach would be uh a more robust annoys and so far enough much 
Bro017.B.dialogueact179	488.1	490.17	B	Professor	s	+1	1	and so far enough much uh success he tried 
Bro017.E.dialogueact180	490.356	490.856	E	PhD	b	-1	0	he tried 
Bro017.B.dialogueact181	490.88	495.63	B	Professor	s	-1	0	he tried sings reach uh a long time ago bill bands uh suggested 
Bro017.B.dialogueact182	496.11	501.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	instead of using forty years spectrum from free time some form use the spectrum from b. d. c. mondale 
Bro017.B.dialogueact183	502.5	509.74	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that argument there was that b. c. if it's the peaks of the spectrum so and maybe make sure you more robust annoys 
Bro017.B.dialogueact184	510.24	514.45	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and i saw that that makes sense but still five econ get much my childhood 
Bro017.E.dialogueact185	513.43	513.77	E	PhD	b	-1	0	my childhood 
Bro017.B.dialogueact186	515.52	521.03	B	Professor	fh|s.%-	-1	0	um maybe maze try some found out that sneaks like picked us trucks and then no you haven't tried that yet 
Bro017.E.dialogueact187	520.839	521.849	E	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	trucks and then no you haven't tried that yet 
Bro017.B.dialogueact188	521.85	523.12	B	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	no not not much or even tried that yet 
Bro017.B.dialogueact190	523.64	528.78	B	Professor	s	-1	0	or even i was thinking about um looking back into these he had talks techniques for for 
Bro017.E.dialogueact189	523.193	523.513	E	PhD	b	-1	0	or even 
Bro017.B.dialogueact191	528.78	537.597	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	techniques for for instance uh that is consul plus uh the late too uh do you speeches and at mostly everything 
Bro017.E.dialogueact192	538.355	539.185	E	PhD	b	-1	0	i mean 
Bro017.B.dialogueact193	539.043	543.486	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean at add more they're the amount of noise or they don 
Bro017.E.dialogueact194	542.524	543.114	E	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	or they don 
Bro017.B.dialogueact196	544.457	549.427	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so that makes it at any i didn't even noise that i said it it i said effective right because i see 
Bro017.E.dialogueact195	544.271	544.691	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so that makes i see 
Bro017.B.dialogueact197	549.427	549.747	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right because 
Bro017.B.dialogueact199	549.967	552.927	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	right because he already uh had the noise uh in uh 
Bro017.E.dialogueact198	549.56	549.9	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right because 
Bro017.B.dialogueact200	553.687	555.027	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and it also working at the time it was kind of like one of 
Bro017.B.dialogueact201	555.027	557.037	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it was kind of like one of these things you know like if you think about it six 
Bro017.B.dialogueact202	557.037	559.057	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	if you think about it six davidian years is uh so 
Bro017.B.dialogueact203	559.88	566.42	B	Professor	s	-1	0	is uh so you know they got the spectrum and and and access to own stunt see to every everybody well you're you're basically yeah 
Bro017.E.dialogueact204	560.58	561.98	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	you know they got the spectrum well you're you're basically 
Bro017.E.dialogueact205	566.89	567.13	E	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah if you're making 
Bro017.E.dialogueact206	567.56	569.57	E	PhD	s^bs	-1	0	exactly if you're making all your training a more uniform 
Bro017.B.dialogueact207	569.81	570.35	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	exactly and even if then 
Bro017.B.dialogueact208	570.35	577.07	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and even if then knew that they that becomes noisy it it becomes as effective because that's really sick basically 
Bro017.E.dialogueact209	577.47	577.92	E	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro017.B.dialogueact210	578.21	584.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	of course you would get out at too much noise because then you goes then new york a commission goes down but i mean it you yet 
Bro017.B.dialogueact211	584.03	586.04	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but i mean it you yet to be seen how much it's a very simple technique 
Bro017.B.dialogueact212	586.04	587.15	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it's a very simple technique 
Bro017.E.dialogueact213	587.37	587.96	E	PhD	s^no^rt	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro017.B.dialogueact214	588.25	589.65	B	Professor	s	-1	0	he needed or anything but they can you just they 
Bro017.B.dialogueact215	589.65	595.5	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	but they can you just they kill spectrum and man and he used to whatever they is coming from a fifty at gone stunt 
Bro017.E.dialogueact216	596.292	596.792	E	PhD	b	-1	0	you know 
Bro017.B.dialogueact217	596.83	597.21	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	you know one unemployable 
Bro017.B.dialogueact218	597.83	599.12	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	one unemployable about respect so that 
Bro017.B.dialogueact219	599.832	600.372	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	that that 
Bro017.B.dialogueact220	601.71	611.618	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	or the other thing is of course if you have a spectrum what you can stop doing you can he started eating out up the park city shot a all in energy 
Bro017.B.dialogueact221	612.57	619.55	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and then perhaps uh like we tried to find helpful or more they'll such it the spectrum because 
Bro017.B.dialogueact222	619.69	630.85	B	Professor	s	-1	0	because uh help one more though there still tried to to to put them uh continuation basically all of the all the more they'll into these spots where she said to the year that's 
Bro017.B.dialogueact223	630.9	632.16	B	Professor	s	-1	0	said to the year that's what he wanted try i have 
Bro017.B.dialogueact224	632.73	635.22	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i have uh these there from but now is 
Bro017.B.dialogueact225	635.7	637.46	B	Professor	s	-1	0	now is uh kind of like young faculty 
Bro017.B.dialogueact226	638.228	641.858	B	Professor	s	-1	0	hard hardworking so he though he's so he's he's looking into that 
Bro017.E.dialogueact227	641.94	642.31	E	PhD	b	-1	0	looking into that 
Bro017.B.dialogueact228	643.025	650.635	B	Professor	s	+1	2	and then i'm also that it it's uh no also and it's it's this tropical mission 
Bro017.B.dialogueact229	651.481	654.061	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	this is this is physical mission from temple about them uhhuh 
Bro017.E.dialogueact230	654.653	655.153	E	PhD	b	-1	0	aw uhhuh what is that 
Bro017.E.dialogueact231	655.253	655.773	E	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	aw what is that 
Bro017.B.dialogueact232	655.96	657.72	B	Professor	s^fe|s	-1	0	aw you don't know about that what is that that 
Bro017.A.dialogueact233	656.962	657.492	A	Grad	b	-1	0	you don't know about that that 
Bro017.E.dialogueact234	657.865	659.975	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	that yeah i mean not that sounds familiar i i i 
Bro017.B.dialogueact235	659.38	659.51	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah i mean not i i 
Bro017.B.dialogueact236	659.51	660.2	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	yeah i mean not that it's just familial familiar i i 
Bro017.B.dialogueact237	660.2	662.97	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that it's just familial familiar accident because they gave me the name but 
Bro017.B.dialogueact238	662.97	670.94	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	they gave me the name but what it is is that normally what you do it said you nice nicest speech based on the salt respectful 
Bro017.E.dialogueact239	663.24	663.58	E	PhD	b	-1	0	what it is 
Bro017.E.dialogueact240	671.108	671.538	E	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	essentially 
Bro017.B.dialogueact241	671.644	677.514	B	Professor	s	+1	1	essentially at at a p. c. mac it's cruel but everything is stocked with uh across life 
Bro017.B.dialogueact242	678.86	686.85	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	uh so he's he's so given the spectrum me essentially oxide in science that sort of my own but it affected wince you have to send you 
Bro017.E.dialogueact243	685.126	685.616	E	PhD	b	-1	0	it affected 
Bro017.B.dialogueact244	686.85	689.484	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	wince you have to send you keep shifting the thing on of other around so you can say 
Bro017.E.dialogueact245	687.902	688.582	E	PhD	b	-1	0	keep shifting the thing on of 
Bro017.B.dialogueact246	689.484	694.324	B	Professor	s	+1	1	other around so you can say about you can also think that i'm such a philly of the as you have to give the frequency and 
Bro017.B.dialogueact248	694.972	697.792	B	Professor	s	+1	1	and what you get these then you got it 
Bro017.E.dialogueact247	694.505	695.015	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and what you get these 
Bro017.B.dialogueact249	699.44	704.08	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and his ex there can be at this to lose some funny mm you 
Bro017.B.dialogueact250	704.68	712.137	B	Professor	s	+1	1	you can say it it's i v. o. i would say that is access to it you know leo describe the funny much as in the center of the 
Bro017.B.dialogueact251	713.83	715.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you can talk to classify based on that 
Bro017.E.dialogueact252	715.816	716.266	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	on that and 
Bro017.B.dialogueact253	716.92	718.38	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	and in so you cautious i'm so it's a very different 
Bro017.B.dialogueact254	718.38	720.7	B	Professor	s^rt	+1	1	i'm so it's a very different activated pamper puppies you don't know 
Bro017.B.dialogueact255	720.7	721.75	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	puppies you don't know much about it 
Bro017.B.dialogueact257	723.01	723.79	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	the truth is but you have 
Bro017.E.dialogueact256	722.65	722.89	E	PhD	b	-1	0	by 
Bro017.E.dialogueact258	723.69	726.06	E	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	the truth is wow so you get many decisions but you have many of those sectors are funny right 
Bro017.B.dialogueact259	725.57	726.96	B	Professor	s	-1	0	wow so you get many decisions are funny right 
Bro017.E.dialogueact260	726.06	726.38	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	get many decisions right 
Bro017.E.dialogueact261	727.18	727.55	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and then 
Bro017.B.dialogueact262	727.79	731.81	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then you can stops this thinking aloud to call my niece decisions so 
Bro017.B.dialogueact264	731.81	733.93	B	Professor	s	-1	0	niece decisions so exactly that's what it yeah that's what it is 
Bro017.E.dialogueact263	731.6	732.04	E	PhD	b	-1	0	niece decisions so exactly that's what 
Bro017.E.dialogueact265	733.984	734.474	E	PhD	b	-1	0	it yeah that's what it is because if you

Bro017.B.dialogueact282	773.76	782.92	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	for it because uh some of these in the second acapulco i was to tell you about things like masking experiments beach uh uh you could take of 
Bro017.B.dialogueact283	783.29	791.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and also like thirty minutes the my skin it's actually tell you that something is happening across could take offense at girls bands and 
Bro017.B.dialogueact284	792.02	792.7	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	uh well 
Bro017.E.dialogueact285	792.88	801.32	E	PhD	qw	-1	0	uh it's uh well how do you how do you uh convert this uh energy over time in a particular frequency band into a factor of numbers 
Bro017.B.dialogueact286	801.6	806.87	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	it's uh i mean i'm i'm being zero is around and number time yeah but what's the number 
Bro017.E.dialogueact287	806.0	807.16	E	PhD	qw	-1	0	time but what's the number is it just 
Bro017.E.dialogueact288	807.53	808.32	E	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	it's the time as you is it just the 
Bro017.B.dialogueact289	808.03	810.64	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it's the time as you get older it's an expense i yeah the just the amount of energy 
Bro017.E.dialogueact290	809.362	813.932	E	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	get older it's an expense i yeah yes yes yes just the amount of energy in that band from in that time interval 
Bro017.B.dialogueact291	810.96	811.16	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	i yeah yes amount of energy in that band 
Bro017.B.dialogueact292	811.912	812.722	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yes yes in that band from 
Bro017.B.dialogueact293	813.88	814.68	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yes yes in that time interval okay 
Bro017.E.dialogueact294	814.51	814.88	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yes okay 
Bro017.B.dialogueact295	815.2	817.0	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	and that's what that's what i'm saying then say this is this 
Bro017.B.dialogueact296	817.0	819.12	B	Professor	s.x	-1	0	say this is this this is a stocking that that it's just 
Bro017.B.dialogueact297	819.77	823.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that it's just like short them spectrum something and now 
Bro017.B.dialogueact299	823.65	826.9	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	and now we are trying to understand what does that affect their presence 
Bro017.E.dialogueact298	823.241	823.711	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and now 
Bro017.B.dialogueact300	827.07	831.51	B	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	for instance question is like how correlate it odd that i'm so so uh 
Bro017.B.dialogueact301	832.21	836.12	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that's how they ach like all right it because i mean especially the neighboring once like they did at present 
Bro017.B.dialogueact303	836.12	836.31	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	like they did at present 
Bro017.B.dialogueact304	836.31	840.12	B	Professor	s	-1	0	like they did at present the same almost the same point people ration of the local talk so there's a 
Bro017.E.dialogueact302	836.09	836.39	E	PhD	b	-1	0	like they did at present 
Bro017.E.dialogueact305	836.39	836.86	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	like they did at present 
Bro017.E.dialogueact306	840.197	840.607	E	PhD	b	-1	0	so there's a 
Bro017.B.dialogueact307	840.71	842.11	B	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	so there's a very high quantities so 
Bro017.B.dialogueact308	843.01	847.72	B	Professor	s	-1	0	there's glossy fire species use the diving local audience matrix on like it's 
Bro017.B.dialogueact309	848.04	850.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so he's thinking about the core eighteen 
Bro017.E.dialogueact310	848.26	849.02	E	PhD	b	-1	0	so he's thinking about the core eighteen 
Bro017.B.dialogueact311	851.65	857.82	B	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	kind of question is uh uh can you describe i'm insult is that the bible she industry vicious or to what extent 
Bro017.B.dialogueact312	858.58	859.13	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	it costs 
Bro017.B.dialogueact313	861.507	863.447	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and hand and so on and so on so yeah i mean 
Bro017.B.dialogueact314	863.447	865.517	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so on so yeah i mean a lot about that and 
Bro017.B.dialogueact316	865.967	868.987	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that and then now the issue is how many with this you should be using i 
Bro017.E.dialogueact315	865.935	866.255	E	PhD	b	-1	0	that and then now the issue is 
Bro017.B.dialogueact317	868.987	870.577	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you should be using i mean the so the minimum is long 
Bro017.E.dialogueact318	869.12	869.49	E	PhD	b	-1	0	mean the so the minimum 
Bro017.B.dialogueact319	872.66	876.1	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	but i mean it's if it's a club and band rights uh the amazing totally 
Bro017.B.dialogueact320	876.726	879.126	B	Professor	s	-1	0	totally some homemade arbitrary decision yes 
Bro017.B.dialogueact321	880.72	888.88	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	then uh abandon now we are thinking of all too hopefully you had the neighboring banned because that seems to be happening this 
Bro017.B.dialogueact322	888.88	893.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	to be happening this ice somehow stop the baby that's what's happening in the commission says 
Bro017.B.dialogueact323	893.778	899.688	B	Professor	s^df^rt	-1	0	says although it's very man's point to the fact that people can plates assuming to protect events 
Bro017.B.dialogueact324	900.65	902.587	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	then all of it so you can 
Bro017.B.dialogueact325	902.587	910.28	B	Professor	s	-1	0	of it so you can you out quite capable of processing signal even at independent club individual medical benefits one mosque experiments 
Bro017.B.dialogueact326	910.28	912.01	B	Professor	s	-1	0	one mosque experiments tell you but at the same 
Bro017.B.dialogueact327	912.34	917.087	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	but at the same time you would most likely pay attention to at least neighboring bands venue i making any decisions 
Bro017.B.dialogueact328	917.087	926.114	B	Professor	s	-1	0	venue i making any decisions you compare what's happening in in this band to what's happening with the band to the to the neighboring bands and that's 
Bro017.B.dialogueact329	926.8	928.36	B	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	and that's how you make the decisions 
Bro017.B.dialogueact330	929.29	935.35	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that's a lighter i think that's really bans each of such a talks about the odd about stupid because bands you need at 
Bro017.B.dialogueact331	935.66	936.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	bands you need at least so basically you need 
Bro017.B.dialogueact332	936.94	940.34	B	Professor	s	-1	0	least so basically you need somebody that they've not beef relation 
Bro017.A.dialogueact333	940.713	941.583	A	Grad	b	-1	0	absolute number 
Bro017.B.dialogueact335	941.61	943.41	B	Professor	s	-1	0	absolute number doesn't tell you there i think you need to 
Bro017.E.dialogueact334	941.162	941.522	E	PhD	b	-1	0	absolute number 
Bro017.B.dialogueact336	943.41	946.46	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i think you need to you need to compare it to something that's what's happening 
Bro017.B.dialogueact337	947.261	949.601	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but what's happening in the in the cold me but also if you 
Bro017.B.dialogueact338	949.601	957.38	B	Professor	s	-1	0	me but also if you out making decisions what's happening at like you know if you want to know what's happening in nine hundred hertz and it and maybe at eleven hundred or study you don't much 
Bro017.B.dialogueact339	957.38	960.72	B	Professor	s	-1	0	or study you don't much care what's happening it's ridiculous so it's 
Bro017.E.dialogueact340	960.786	961.696	E	PhD	s^bu.%--	-1	0	ridiculous so it's really it's sort 
Bro017.E.dialogueact341	961.696	967.276	E	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	really it's sort of like saying that what's happening at one killer hurts depends on what's happening around it sort of relative 
Bro017.E.dialogueact342	967.276	968.416	E	PhD	s	-1	0	to some extent it sort of relative to 
Bro017.B.dialogueact343	968.24	970.25	B	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	to some extent it is also true yeah to 
Bro017.B.dialogueact345	970.74	970.98	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	true yeah 
Bro017.B.dialogueact346	970.98	986.95	B	Professor	s	-1	0	true yeah about five but but for instance uh uh what what uh human uh very much capable of doing is that if if they are exactly the same thing happening into neighboring typical bands corporation can discard 
Bro017.E.dialogueact344	970.541	971.491	E	PhD	b	-1	0	true yeah about five but 
Bro017.B.dialogueact348	987.88	988.63	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	is what's happening hey 
Bro017.E.dialogueact347	987.822	988.242	E	PhD	b	-1	0	is what's happening hey 
Bro017.A.dialogueact350	989.131	989.451	A	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	ok 
Bro017.B.dialogueact349	988.71	989.7	B	Professor	s^fe	-1	0	happening hey ok 
Bro017.B.dialogueact351	989.84	992.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	ok beanie there's another one another's voice here 
Bro017.E.dialogueact352	990.24	990.9	E	PhD	s	-1	0	beanie there's another one 
Bro017.B.dialogueact353	993.19	993.45	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	yeah i think yep 
Bro017.B.dialogueact354	993.72	994.3	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah i think so yeah yep sure 
Bro017.B.dialogueact356	994.3	994.54	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	so yeah sure 
Bro017.E.dialogueact355	994.08	994.25	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	so yeah sure 
Bro017.E.dialogueact357	994.48	994.64	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	so yeah sure 
Bro017.E.dialogueact358	994.64	994.95	E	PhD	s^co	-1	0	so yeah sure 
Bro017.B.dialogueact359	995.5	1007.87	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	so so so for instance if you'd if you if you add the noise that normally masks mosque with uh uh the uh the signal 
Bro017.B.dialogueact361	1008.39	1008.72	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	like you 
Bro017.E.dialogueact360	1008.17	1008.37	E	PhD	b	-1	0	like you 
Bro017.B.dialogueact362	1008.87	1018.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	like you can show that in that is that if you add the noise outside could country club and that doesn't affect the the decisions you making about the same i didn't think of that 
Bro017.E.dialogueact363	1018.58	1019.06	E	PhD	b	-1	0	think of that i glad this noise 
Bro017.B.dialogueact364	1019.22	1021.0	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	i glad this noise is more like give them life is 
Bro017.B.dialogueact365	1021.38	1029.14	B	Professor	s	-1	0	give them life is more do late did the same with lisa frequency as the noise you the physical band amount of mocking his the moment 
Bro017.B.dialogueact367	1029.86	1034.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	moment to moment to provide the noise and neighboring physical that so 
Bro017.E.dialogueact366	1029.52	1030.04	E	PhD	b	-1	0	moment to 
Bro017.B.dialogueact368	1034.89	1038.16	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so the it must've been mosque and so normally it looks like certify aside from 
Bro017.B.dialogueact369	1038.16	1039.46	B	Professor	s	-1	0	aside from from here so you 
Bro017.B.dialogueact370	1039.46	1046.71	B	Professor	s	-1	0	from here so you you have a no noise then you you you like spending the particular bands so we amount of mocking increasing 
Bro017.B.dialogueact371	1047.16	1052.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then you it it's it's at the point that you said because the club and then the amount of mocking is the same 
Bro017.E.dialogueact372	1052.97	1053.38	E	PhD	b	-1	0	the same so that's 
Bro017.B.dialogueact373	1053.8	1056.93	B	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	so that's the famous experimental such a long time ago 
Bro017.B.dialogueact374	1057.41	1060.02	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i guess when people start thinking lot this is interesting so 
Bro017.B.dialogueact376	1060.62	1060.9	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro017.E.dialogueact375	1060.15	1060.44	E	PhD	b	-1	0	so 
Bro017.B.dialogueact377	1061.17	1068.78	B	Professor	s	-1	0	box if you if you if you mostly the noise the mosque goals op and the moment you stop anything the and i looked at the cabana mosque skin goes down 
Bro017.B.dialogueact378	1071.39	1082.85	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so essentially essentially that's a clear indication that that that coke nation can take uh uh into consideration was happening in the neighboring bands 
Bro017.B.dialogueact379	1083.24	1089.57	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but if you go to fire in uh in uh in of it if you if the noise is very broth you i'm be increasing much more so if you 
Bro017.B.dialogueact380	1089.57	1101.66	B	Professor	s	-1	0	much more so if you if you are far away from the signal uh so i think enough uh that frequency that it just it really is then the even then the nicest going away did it it's not having much 
Bro017.E.dialogueact381	1089.82	1090.35	E	PhD	b	-1	0	much more so if you if you are far away 
Bro017.E.dialogueact382	1096.88	1097.1	E	PhD	b	-1	0	just it really is then the 
Bro017.E.dialogueact383	1101.62	1102.19	E	PhD	b	-1	0	much 
Bro017.A.dialogueact385	1102.6	1103.23	A	Grad	b	-1	0	so 
Bro017.B.dialogueact384	1102.28	1102.6	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro017.B.dialogueact386	1103.95	1115.14	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so things like the see i kind of playing with and i the the the whole and perhaps because eventually use this in the you know the uh uh like a nice like 
Bro017.A.dialogueact387	1115.25	1116.14	A	Grad	b	-1	0	like five cities of course 
Bro017.B.dialogueact388	1115.72	1122.72	B	Professor	s	-1	0	like five cities of course the promised to do this on uh they're or program but you probably won't have 
Bro017.E.dialogueact389	1122.1	1126.17	E	PhD	s	-1	0	you know that you probably won't have anything before the next time we have to evaluate 
Bro017.B.dialogueact391	1126.35	1127.03	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	you know that maybe it most likely 
Bro017.E.dialogueact390	1126.17	1126.45	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	you know that 
Bro017.B.dialogueact393	1127.03	1131.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	maybe it most likely even though they have anything beach because able would comply to the rules 
Bro017.E.dialogueact392	1126.76	1127.02	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	you know that maybe it most likely 
Bro017.E.dialogueact394	1131.62	1132.12	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	rules like the 
Bro017.B.dialogueact395	1132.18	1134.11	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	like the cause uh didn't agency latency and things 
Bro017.E.dialogueact396	1134.26	1135.2	E	PhD	s^2	-1	0	didn't agency kind kids chops latency and things 
Bro017.B.dialogueact397	1134.95	1141.6	B	Professor	s	-1	0	didn't agency kind kids chops is acquire uh um significant uh latency amount of processing close latency and things 
Bro017.E.dialogueact398	1138.57	1139.11	E	PhD	b	-1	0	uh latency 
Bro017.B.dialogueact399	1141.6	1148.21	B	Professor	s	-1	0	close uh you don't know any better yet then to use the u. n. the fires and it's in a trap

Bro017.C.dialogueact599	1604.07	1608.33	C	PhD	s	+1	1	and we know did that see one once almost that's just what it can remove really 
Bro017.C.dialogueact600	1608.73	1611.9	C	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	it can remove it from the uh actor it doesn't hurt really has no effect

Bro017.B.dialogueact611	1620.32	1622.86	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	so we were just discussing things you mention that in a driving 
Bro017.C.dialogueact612	1621.52	1621.84	C	PhD	b	-1	0	things you mention 
Bro017.B.dialogueact613	1622.86	1634.88	B	Professor	s^rt	+1	1	that in a driving in the car but more than this morning they're discussing the to experiment fooled for beginning graduate student who wants to around of the from who wants to get a little number from something 
Bro017.C.dialogueact614	1625.46	1625.85	C	PhD	b	-1	0	they're 
Bro017.B.dialogueact615	1636.05	1646.2	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	chase like imagine that you live you will stop looking every cause any coefficients each values i mean you know that's uh in some general up all our 
Bro017.E.dialogueact616	1647.09	1647.58	E	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	general in someone 
Bro017.B.dialogueact617	1647.77	1648.87	B	Professor	s	-1	0	general up all power power in someone 
Bro017.B.dialogueact618	1648.98	1654.15	B	Professor	s	+1	1	up all power power if you take this power of tool a square root or something so suppose 
Bro017.E.dialogueact619	1651.7	1652.03	E	PhD	b	-1	0	of tool a square root 
Bro017.C.dialogueact620	1652.93	1653.37	C	PhD	b	-1	0	square root or something 
Bro017.B.dialogueact622	1654.76	1658.08	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so suppose that you out working with this see we'll easy if you want 
Bro017.E.dialogueact621	1654.29	1654.7	E	PhD	b	-1	0	so suppose 
Bro017.B.dialogueact623	1659.1	1665.49	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so if you put it in this square roots that that's activity makes feel more they'll hospice efficient 
Bro017.B.dialogueact624	1667.25	1669.66	B	Professor	s^df	+1	1	costs uh you it'll go she an extra month all 
Bro017.B.dialogueact625	1670.08	1670.62	B	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	right to computers 
Bro017.B.dialogueact626	1670.62	1671.37	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	right to computers i mean 
Bro017.E.dialogueact627	1671.54	1672.08	E	PhD	b	-1	0	i mean and uh 
Bro017.B.dialogueact628	1672.39	1675.07	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	and uh and uh body them but it's the the media 
Bro017.B.dialogueact629	1675.07	1682.01	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but it's the the media next one uh whatever the the the cost of i'm so you you're compressing the range right of that 
Bro017.E.dialogueact630	1681.03	1682.33	E	PhD	s	-1	0	cost of i'm so you compressing the range right of that 
Bro017.B.dialogueact633	1682.79	1686.27	B	Professor	s^na	+1	1	so you these coefficients always becoming less efficient right of that 
Bro017.E.dialogueact631	1682.33	1682.57	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	so you right of that 
Bro017.E.dialogueact632	1682.57	1682.93	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	so you right of that 
Bro017.B.dialogueact634	1687.04	1687.3	B	Professor	qy^d^f^rt	-1	0	so 
Bro017.E.dialogueact635	1687.28	1687.81	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	so 
Bro017.B.dialogueact636	1687.99	1688.43	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so so 
Bro017.B.dialogueact637	1688.77	1689.18	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so more mobilization 
Bro017.B.dialogueact638	1689.42	1695.77	B	Professor	s	+1	1	more mobilization he was he was saying what you did this might be the doctor not the way how to play with uh it uh hotshot uh in uh 
Bro017.B.dialogueact639	1695.77	1696.06	B	Professor	qy^d^f	+1	1	hotshot uh in uh 
Bro017.B.dialogueact640	1696.69	1697.54	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	and uh oh 
Bro017.E.dialogueact641	1697.3	1698.05	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and uh you know just compress oh 
Bro017.B.dialogueact642	1698.06	1699.82	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you know just compress the whole sector 
Bro017.E.dialogueact643	1700.04	1700.42	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and i so well 
Bro017.B.dialogueact644	1700.57	1705.02	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	and i so well in that case why don't we just stop pressing neither do i i'm inside and then causing all 
Bro017.B.dialogueact645	1705.56	1713.77	B	Professor	s	-1	0	causing all they see readily income and then people still doing them but matching into the in the seventies you agree and it's it's tearing apart it's like 
Bro017.B.dialogueact646	1713.77	1714.01	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	apart it's like because the 
Bro017.E.dialogueact647	1714.08	1714.39	E	PhD	s^aa^rt	-1	0	because the 
Bro017.B.dialogueact648	1714.63	1718.94	B	Professor	s	+1	1	because the old serve that does high upon its as a more important than all work for a commission 
Bro017.B.dialogueact649	1719.16	1724.16	B	Professor	s	+1	1	basically that this is the c. c.'s the lawn is going to be as many so open it's highly affected 
Bro017.E.dialogueact650	1719.17	1719.35	E	PhD	b	-1	0	basically that 
Bro017.B.dialogueact651	1724.15	1730.99	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	it's highly affected by mm sequencer spawn so those those uh recording equipment and and that sort of thing 
Bro017.C.dialogueact652	1725.73	1726.15	C	PhD	b	-1	0	by mm sequencer 
Bro017.E.dialogueact653	1730.09	1730.43	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and that sort of thing 
Bro017.B.dialogueact654	1730.99	1731.33	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and that sort of thing so it's really 
Bro017.B.dialogueact655	1731.84	1733.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so it's really becoming minorities party a success

Bro017.B.dialogueact723	1869.01	1871.84	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	you know in the past they tell you would have to put it in the pollard but 
Bro017.B.dialogueact724	1871.84	1880.65	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it in the pollard but you know in the training what you call it the training in train one male or you would have to do is to market by i i appropriate constant 
Bro017.E.dialogueact725	1876.35	1876.61	E	PhD	b	-1	0	or you would have 
Bro017.E.dialogueact726	1881.13	1887.32	E	PhD	qw	-1	0	be costing white if you're if you're multiple if altering the model why would in the test data why would you have to muck would be uh kept surplus 
Bro017.B.dialogueact727	1887.55	1890.3	B	Professor	s	-1	0	be costing the testing that it as they tell you cut them without you have

Bro017.B.dialogueact729	1892.27	1893.4	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	i mean in the no but you're renting or it through that 
Bro017.E.dialogueact730	1892.81	1894.81	E	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	i mean in the no but you're renting or it through that same model 
Bro017.B.dialogueact731	1895.56	1896.15	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	that is true but i mean so what you

Bro017.B.dialogueact761	1943.05	1947.97	B	Professor	s^r	-1	0	this what you do when you you you'll mortified a standard deviation as you go straight

Bro017.B.dialogueact763	1948.96	1954.32	B	Professor	s	-1	0	activity you you know in in front of them all the more they'll you put a constant 
Bro017.B.dialogueact764	1955.42	1959.61	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so yeah activity what you're doing you see you see on what i find them though that the deviation

Bro017.B.dialogueact786	1978.56	1979.01	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yes so you making this particular 
Bro017.B.dialogueact787	1979.01	1981.69	B	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	you making this particular dimension it's important 
Bro017.B.dialogueact788	1982.46	1985.34	B	Professor	s	-1	0	go see what you off the thing is a mocking imaginable she tonight 
Bro017.B.dialogueact789	1985.34	1985.64	B	Professor	qy^d^f^rt	-1	0	tonight 
Bro017.E.dialogueact790	1985.86	1986.31	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	tonight it's it's 
Bro017.B.dialogueact791	1986.77	1992.75	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it's it's it's as if is and i ninety mentions all had seen dimensions if you could you know the about uh stuff 
Bro017.E.dialogueact792	1989.13	1989.6	E	PhD	b	-1	0	all had seen 
Bro017.E.dialogueact793	1990.69	1991.41	E	PhD	b	-1	0	dimensions if you could you know the about 
Bro017.B.dialogueact794	1993.51	2011.0	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so you know it if you you know to to make the imagination leashes stefan sees and that's important uh i mean the most useful the important what you do is they do spectacle a coupon component in a more they'll you can occupied by the you can you can basically do you make it you know mondale bought you conduit 
Bro017.B.dialogueact795	2011.35	2013.54	B	Professor	s	-1	0	bought you conduit in it in it that they that because you 
Bro017.B.dialogueact796	2013.54	2017.38	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	they that because you don't have a fourth i mean the then that that's comes what you can 
Bro017.B.dialogueact797	2017.38	2023.4	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	comes what you can do it said you put this particular uh component in in you compress it then 
Bro017.B.dialogueact798	2023.96	2028.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it then becomes uh they get so sweaty variance subsequently becomes less important 
Bro017.E.dialogueact799	2030.81	2034.63	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	that would be can you just do that to the test they and not do anything with your training data 
Bro017.B.dialogueact800	2034.47	2035.65	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	that would be very that because training data 
Bro017.B.dialogueact801	2035.68	2039.53	B	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	very that because they me immortal strained expecting that 
Bro017.B.dialogueact802	2040.03	2040.7	B	Professor	s	-1	0	would work 
Bro017.B.dialogueact803	2041.3	2045.09	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because the immortal strained expecting set the very very infancy bonk

Bro017.B.dialogueact805	2046.09	2048.46	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and because some of those things you see when it's important 
Bro017.B.dialogueact806	2049.52	2057.97	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	pasta you train them although you sort of you couldn't do it you could do is that what i was proposing initially 
Bro017.B.dialogueact807	2058.86	2066.58	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	that doing training q. you compress ceylon that becomes uh then it becomes less important you know training 
Bro017.E.dialogueact808	2062.18	2062.66	E	PhD	b	-1	0	that becomes 
Bro017.B.dialogueact809	2067.12	2074.35	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but if you have if you want to around the x. expensive experiment experimentally doubt training the more they'll you don't have to be trained him and you training 
Bro017.B.dialogueact810	2074.52	2076.42	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and you training it's on the origin of it uh i 
Bro017.B.dialogueact811	2077.09	2087.55	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	off to you there then you out green despotic study off importance if you want you'll they'll you wait see one component in a more though 
Bro017.B.dialogueact812	2088.7	2096.18	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and you live put in up impress the the this in a in a sense they by the same amount could you also if you wanted to if you want to try an experiment 
Bro017.E.dialogueact813	2094.02	2095.39	E	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	by the same amount you also if you wanted to if 
Bro017.E.dialogueact814	2095.98	2117.17	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	by the same amount to if you want to try an experiment um by leaving out say see one couldn't you in your test data uh modify d. all of the c. one values to be um way outside of the normal range of the gals n. foresee one that was trained in the model so that 
Bro017.E.dialogueact815	2117.63	2122.55	E	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	so that effectively the c. one never really contributes to the score

Bro017.B.dialogueact860	2175.22	2178.56	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i i'm reasonably close it and end up putting on the record i i mean these

Bro017.B.dialogueact862	2178.74	2182.08	B	Professor	s^j	-1	0	on the record i i mean these people to listen to it for for centuries now is what 
Bro017.B.dialogueact863	2182.53	2188.97	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	is what you can do is you train d'amato uh that that we do a some they 
Bro017.A.dialogueact864	2189.41	2190.12	A	Grad	b	-1	0	then you decide 
Bro017.B.dialogueact865	2190.57	2194.6	B	Professor	s	-1	0	then you decide that you want to see how we bought some c. c. one is 
Bro017.B.dialogueact866	2195.73	2203.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so what you are doing is that it pump on and you know more they'll force ceylon you really dubai did a bike by tool 
Bro017.B.dialogueact867	2204.35	2208.75	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and you look on percy all they don bikes square 
Bro017.E.dialogueact868	2209.11	2209.5	E	PhD	b	-1	0	then you 
Bro017.B.dialogueact869	2209.7	2211.63	B	Professor	s	-1	0	then you would still have a perfect match except 
Bro017.B.dialogueact870	2211.9	2216.07	B	Professor	s	-1	0	match except that this component if you want to be hospice important you know in overall score 
Bro017.E.dialogueact871	2211.94	2212.33	E	PhD	b	-1	0	match except that this component 
Bro017.E.dialogueact872	2214.95	2215.48	E	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	important you know in overall score 
Bro017.B.dialogueact873	2217.1	2220.75	B	Professor	s	-1	0	then used divided by four and you take a square of force it 
Bro017.B.dialogueact874	2221.97	2237.34	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	then if you've seen this uncle is more than this more important than the that that that needs it then then uh uh it it it's based on training then you that my people they cook on pointing them or they all by by by yeah some of the standard deviation 
Bro017.E.dialogueact875	2235.63	2237.18	E	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	or they all by by by yeah some of the standard deviation

Bro017.E.dialogueact877	2237.87	2238.08	E	PhD	b	-1	0	by yeah yeah market 
Bro017.B.dialogueact878	2238.53	2242.66	B	Professor	s^aa|s^rt	-1	0	yeah market by go employer that it it by the number of dodger than a lot of 
Bro017.E.dialogueact879	2242.69	2243.42	E	PhD	b	-1	0	than a lot of and you put your they 
Bro017.B.dialogueact880	2243.4	2246.12	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and you put your they thought in uh power higher than on 
Bro017.B.dialogueact881	2247.36	2250.53	B	Professor	s	-1	0	then it becomes more in one you know overall score i pity 
Bro017.C.dialogueact883	2251.6	2251.73	C	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah but that's but don't you 
Bro017.C.dialogueact884	2251.73	2252.53	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	yeah but that's that but don't you have to do something to the me 
Bro017.E.dialogueact882	2251.27	2253.59	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	no yeah but that's that but don't you have to do something to the me also

Bro017.C.dialogueact889	2255.3	2261.57	C	PhD	s	-1	0	but i think it's it's it's very and she's on and uh did i mean it turned and and uh gosham aggression so i think 
Bro017.C.dialogueact890	2261.57	2264.12	C	PhD	s	-1	0	aggression so i think maybe just uh country if you want 
Bro017.C.dialogueact891	2264.63	2271.58	C	PhD	s.x	-1	0	yes right yes exactly if you want to degrees importance of army terms u. s. too increased parents that

Bro017.B.dialogueact893	2269.6	2269.98	B	Professor	s^aa.x	-1	0	right 
Bro017.B.dialogueact894	2270.48	2270.7	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yes increased 
Bro017.D.dialogueact895	2270.53	2271.26	D	PhD	s.x	-1	0	yes exactly increased parents that 
Bro017.B.dialogueact896	2271.62	2272.09	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	exactly yeah so you parents that yeah 
Bro017.B.dialogueact897	2272.28	2272.51	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah so you yeah 
Bro017.B.dialogueact898	2272.8	2275.2	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	yeah so you felt so you may want to do the other way around yeah yeah that's right 
Bro017.C.dialogueact899	2272.87	2273.08	C	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah so you felt so you may yeah that's right 
Bro017.C.dialogueact900	2273.08	2273.65	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	felt so you may that's right 
Bro017.C.dialogueact901	2273.65	2274.11	C	PhD	b	-1	0	felt so you may want to do the other way around that's right 
Bro017.B.dialogueact902	2275.2	2275.4	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bro017.C.dialogueact903	2275.42	2275.88	C	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bro017.A.dialogueact904	2275.97	2276.26	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah but if 
Bro017.E.dialogueact905	2276.88	2277.55	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	but if you're 
Bro017.E.dialogueact906	2279.66	2284.51	E	PhD	s	-1	0	if youre um the original data foresee one had a mean of too 
Bro017.B.dialogueact907	2284.8	2285.06	B	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	too and 
Bro017.E.dialogueact908	2286.09	2291.26	E	PhD	s	-1	0	now you're you're you're changing that by square ing it now you're mean 
Bro017.E.dialogueact909	2291.52	2295.41	E	PhD	s	-1	0	it now you're mean of your c. one original data has it's four but 
Bro017.E.dialogueact910	2296.0	2297.96	E	PhD	s	-1	0	your model still has i mean it's too 
Bro017.E.dialogueact911	2299.14	2303.3	E	PhD	s	-1	0	so even though you expanded the range you're mean doesn't match anymore 
Bro017.C.dialogueact912	2303.52	2304.04	C	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro017.B.dialogueact914	2307.12	2307.55	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	i think when 
Bro017.E.dialogueact913	2306.83	2307.52	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	i think when 
Bro017.C.dialogueact915	2307.67	2312.92	C	PhD	s^cs^rt	-1	0	i think when i see what could be done east you don't change your creatures chuck computed once wrong 
Bro017.B.dialogueact916	2308.73	2309.42	B	Professor	b	-1	0	i see what could be done east you don't 
Bro017.C.dialogueact917	2313.86	2315.75	C	PhD	s	-1	0	but you just tune into muslim 
Bro017.C.dialogueact918	2316.33	2317.57	C	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	so you future your futuristic train your 
Bro017.C.dialogueact919	2317.57	2319.81	C	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	train your your mother on these teachers 
Bro017.E.dialogueact920	2319.93	2320.38	E	PhD	b	-1	0	these teachers and 
Bro017.C.dialogueact921	2320.99	2334.06	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and then you want to decrease the importance of she won you just take the browns she one component condoning the mother and increase it if you want to decrease the importance see one aren't treated 
Bro017.E.dialogueact922	2329.36	2329.6	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bro017.B.dialogueact923	2332.49	2332.71	B	Professor	b	-1	0	see one

Bro017.E.dialogueact941	2345.43	2349.22	E	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	just to just to know in that is a simple thing you could just just muck with the variance

Bro017.E.dialogueact944	2350.3	2353.27	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	to get uh this uh this the effect i think that you're talking about right 
Bro017.B.dialogueact945	2353.0	2353.53	B	Professor	b	-1	0	about right 
Bro017.E.dialogueact946	2353.27	2353.59	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	about right

Bro017.E.dialogueact948	2355.11	2357.79	E	PhD	s	-1	0	could it creates a variance to decrease the importance

Bro017.C.dialogueact950	2358.82	2359.25	C	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bro017.E.dialogueact951	2359.89	2365.64	E	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	doesn't matter it becomes more effective yeah because she had a huge variance you're dividing by a large number either very small contribution yeah 
Bro017.A.dialogueact954	2362.19	2362.83	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	doesn't matter becomes more effective you're dividing by 
Bro017.C.dialogueact952	2361.96	2362.08	C	PhD	b	-1	0	doesn't matter it becomes more effective variance you're dividing by

Bro017.A.dialogueact961	2368.1	2372.96	A	Grad	s	-1	0	sharper the variance the more more important to get that one right yeah you know actually 
Bro017.E.dialogueact960	2367.64	2368.29	E	PhD	b	-1	0	sharper the variance 
Bro017.B.dialogueact962	2371.82	2372.42	B	Professor	b	-1	0	to get that one right yeah you know actually 
Bro017.E.dialogueact963	2372.04	2376.41	E	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	get that one right you know actually this reminds me of something that happened uh when i was a b. b. n. we were playing with 
Bro017.E.dialogueact964	2376.41	2380.64	E	PhD	s	-1	0	b. n. we were playing with putting um pitch into thee mandarin recognize or 
Bro017.B.dialogueact965	2378.55	2378.99	B	Professor	b	-1	0	into 
Bro017.E.dialogueact966	2381.13	2387.21	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and this particular pitch algorithm um when it didn't think there was any voicing was spitting out zeros so 
Bro017.E.dialogueact967	2387.9	2394.83	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	that they do i would i know so we were getting uh when we did clustering we were getting groups uh of features 
Bro017.B.dialogueact968	2393.85	2395.87	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that they do i would i know what i uh of features yeah 
Bro017.B.dialogueact970	2396.12	2396.33	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	heard with with i mean 
Bro017.E.dialogueact969	2395.85	2399.6	E	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	what i heard yeah with with i mean of zero and basically zero variance so 
Bro017.B.dialogueact971	2398.78	2399.46	B	Professor	s^m	-1	0	basically zero variance so 
Bro017.E.dialogueact972	2399.91	2405.45	E	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	so when andrew and when any time any one of those actors came in i had a zero and we got a great score i mean it was 
Bro017.E.dialogueact973	2405.51	2410.67	E	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean it was just you know incredibly high score and so that was throwing everything off 
Bro017.C.dialogueact974	2407.05	2407.67	C	PhD	b	-1	0	incredibly 
Bro017.E.dialogueact975	2411.28	2416.48	E	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	so if you have a very small variance you get really good scores when you get something that matches 
Bro017.B.dialogueact976	2415.42	2415.87	B	Professor	b	-1	0	when you get something that 
Bro017.C.dialogueact978	2416.84	2417.65	C	PhD	b	-1	0	matches 
Bro017.E.dialogueact977	2416.48	2419.69	E	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	matches so that's the way yeah 
Bro017.E.dialogueact979	2420.08	2421.84	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	a way to increase yeah 
Bro017.E.dialogueact980	2421.98	2422.93	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	yeah that's interesting 
Bro017.E.dialogueact981	2423.82	2425.12	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so in fact that would be 
Bro017.E.dialogueact982	2426.19	2427.89	E	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	that doesn't require any retraining 
Bro017.B.dialogueact983	2428.34	2428.55	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah no yep that's right 
Bro017.B.dialogueact985	2428.68	2429.58	B	Professor	s^aa^m	-1	0	yeah no no yep that's right so

Bro017.C.dialogueact1144	2723.02	2724.55	C	PhD	s	-1	0	what i mean so so uh yeah 
Bro017.C.dialogueact1146	2724.8	2725.56	C	PhD	h	-1	0	so uh yeah exactly and 
Bro017.E.dialogueact1145	2724.76	2724.97	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	so uh yeah

Bro017.E.dialogueact1150	2730.32	2731.82	E	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and that's why the range of values 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1151	2731.34	2745.91	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and that's why it people use this this this uh university thing this this basically that's makes you you could the end of sounds more like uh my nose is it sounds with a dial in koreans and you was a buddy and his they're over door they talk of values 
Bro017.E.dialogueact1152	2735.08	2735.65	E	PhD	b	-1	0	this basically that's 
Bro017.E.dialogueact1153	2740.83	2741.36	E	PhD	b	-1	0	is it sounds with a dial 
Bro017.E.dialogueact1154	2746.23	2746.98	E	PhD	b	-1	0	they would they 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1155	2746.73	2751.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	they would they would do is they would wait each question by universal the variance turns 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1156	2751.82	2758.27	B	Professor	s	-1	0	turns out that the the variance decreases at least it's cost i believe the index all that good stuff questions that you can show that 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1158	2758.27	2760.99	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that you can show that uh on on basically 
Bro017.E.dialogueact1157	2757.92	2758.26	E	PhD	b	-1	0	that good stuff questions that you can show that 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1160	2761.48	2770.5	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so typically what happens is that you you need to based uh uh they the high equations more than uh local stations

Bro017.B.dialogueact1210	2857.89	2864.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	because what's happening that surely and he i know always that people essentially sow working on something and they don't want to be much bother side what can that 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1211	2864.49	2864.73	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	side what 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1212	2864.73	2877.54	B	Professor	s	-1	0	side what the that and the danger is in the group like this is it to people are working on the same seeing and it cookeville with both of them come this rate would solution i stick with it being down somehow in a houseful there for 
Bro017.E.dialogueact1213	2870.18	2870.66	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and it 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1214	2878.3	2881.25	B	Professor	s^t	-1	0	all this another thing that i wanted to uh uh the portal cause i 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1215	2881.25	2886.54	B	Professor	s	-1	0	cause i the the role with the software for this or our school system 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1216	2887.58	2890.85	B	Professor	s	-1	0	reasonably every that would amount but he's doing is what intel 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1217	2891.13	2897.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but i trust that he has the rights to to use it uh or distribute it and everything you talking to stories 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1218	2897.03	2900.45	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you talking to stories and he wants to distribute it feels josh anyways 
Bro017.E.dialogueact1219	2900.46	2900.98	E	PhD	b	-1	0	anyways 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1220	2901.26	2909.85	B	Professor	fh|s^cc	-1	0	and so so uh i've even make sure that if you can see them software and if it's easy to self in u. s. 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1221	2910.8	2911.19	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	just uh 
Bro017.C.dialogueact1222	2911.02	2911.44	C	PhD	b	-1	0	uh 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1223	2912.28	2916.84	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it might be a reasonable point for perhaps issaquah vegging 
Bro017.C.dialogueact1224	2913.46	2913.93	C	PhD	b	-1	0	point 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1225	2918.29	2920.41	B	Professor	s	-1	0	was more guns pointed is expedient guy says well you know 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1226	2920.41	2929.32	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	guy says well you know it's very difficult to collaborate if you i work with this supposing did the same thing in quotes exhibit it just melts with the same he's

Bro017.B.dialogueact1228	2930.02	2936.01	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	it's uh bunnies using that said if it's it's another one said is using another so the the the so 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1229	2936.01	2939.49	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and then is difficult to compare 
Bro017.C.dialogueact1230	2942.06	2942.9	C	PhD	qo	-1	0	about the harry 
Bro017.C.dialogueact1231	2943.13	2949.63	C	PhD	fh|s^rt	-1	0	he got he got the software that they send uh greasy to me that's too weak and u. s. talking to to do some experiments use 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1232	2947.7	2949.07	B	Professor	s	-1	0	he got he got the software that they send to to do some experiments use 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1233	2949.44	2950.47	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that they send these yeah use this in town

Bro017.B.dialogueact1244	2963.39	2966.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	much sure then he should have gotten but it's a lot of work 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1245	2967.74	2974.77	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and they want it to to to have a software so that they can also play with it which means that it just it being said man a lot of men they use 
Bro017.E.dialogueact1246	2972.33	2972.66	E	PhD	b	-1	0	which means 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1247	2974.77	2991.71	B	Professor	s	-1	0	man a lot of men they use she should have some intel libraries but in the process of little cautious three year old those things because you think that the rather than trying to make sense off uh it including dixie software uh north what training on and that's but i think 
Bro017.E.dialogueact1248	2988.59	2989.08	E	PhD	b	-1	0	uh 
Bro017.A.dialogueact1249	2989.82	2990.13	A	Grad	b	-1	0	uh north what training 
Bro017.B.dialogueact1250	2991.71	3006.06	B	Professor	s	-1	0	on and that's but i think year year uh uh uh or something maybe somehow are you still there the the of the things so that so that the whole seem to concluding i met the train them a piece yvonne avanti's self so 
Bro017.E.dialogueact1251	2997.28	2997.9	E	PhD	b	-1	0	things
