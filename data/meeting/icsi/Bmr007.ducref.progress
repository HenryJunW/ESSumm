Efforts are in progress to mark where regions of speaker overlap occur in meeting transcripts and note the number of speakers involved.
Such information is currently being encoded within relatively loose time boundaries.
A large number of overlapping speech regions were identified throughout one recorded meeting , wherein overlaps were found to occur in bursts , rather than being evenly distributed throughout the meeting.
A cursory analysis was done on regions of overlap involving two speakers to determine whether speakers are more likely to be overlapped with or to cause overlap with other speakers.
Attempts were also made to classify types of speaker overlap---e.g . backchannels , answering questions as they are being asked , and responding in unison---with future work focussed on subcategorizing types of backchannels.
Speaker fe016 is interested in the contribution of multiple speakers in an interaction to the amount and types of overlap observed , and comparing this to findings from the Switchboard corpus.
Future work includes generating predictive models of overlap , and the tentative erection of visual barriers during meeting recordings.
Speaker me011 described his attempts to automatically identify speakers via the close-talking microphone channels using thresholding and filtering methods and an existing speaker-change detection algorithm.
