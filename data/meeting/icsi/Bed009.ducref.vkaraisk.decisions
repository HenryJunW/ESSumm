As the generator module is being translated to english , it was agreed that the best approach is to use the same grammar as in german , as this also produces syntactic trees.
The same approach is going to be taken for the new parser release.
A single system is going to be used for german and english with possible code extensions to be written to accommodate the differences.
The new parser needs to be fast and robust in dealing with speech input.
The Verbmobil and FORWISS chunk parsers can provide with a valuable paradigm.
It was also agreed that the enhanced knowledge model that is going to be produced with the use of the belief-nets will need to integrate with parallel developments in the design of dialogues.
Some of the terminology will also have to be adapted.
Another meeting was scheduled to take place before the departure of the german visitors , in order to discuss future objectives of SmartKom.
