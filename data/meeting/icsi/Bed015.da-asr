Bed015.F.dialogueact18	30.3	39.35	F	Grad	s	+1	0	so basically the result of what thinking since the last time we met um but not as much writing um is the shit that i have a lot of like thoughts and just fusion comment on all the time 
Bed015.F.dialogueact19	39.54	40.87	F	Grad	s	-1	0	on all the time how as as right now 
Bed015.F.dialogueact20	41.24	42.46	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	so um here's

Bed015.F.dialogueact24	44.702	50.742	F	Grad	s	+1	1	it's two things it's a one on one side is one side is a sort of the revised and updated semantic specification 
Bed015.D.dialogueact25	46.185	46.425	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	one side is a 
Bed015.D.dialogueact27	51.12	51.29	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	and this site is

Bed015.F.dialogueact26	51.102	55.042	F	Grad	s	+1	1	i just wish okay this is just one machine right and this site is um certain revised construction just when she 
Bed015.E.dialogueact29	53.683	54.813	E	Grad	s^bu|qy^d^g	-1	0	i this is just one machine right revised construction 
Bed015.D.dialogueact30	54.832	54.992	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	i one machine right 
Bed015.D.dialogueact32	55.152	55.732	D	Grad	s^na	-1	0	just wish okay just when she 
Bed015.F.dialogueact31	55.042	55.682	F	Grad	s^na	-1	0	just wish okay just when she 
Bed015.D.dialogueact34	55.732	56.022	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	just wish okay just when she said nothing else 
Bed015.F.dialogueact33	55.682	57.222	F	Grad	s	-1	0	just wish okay just when she said nothing else um 
Bed015.D.dialogueact35	56.911	57.231	D	Grad	s	-1	0	said nothing else um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact36	57.482	57.792	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact37	59.556	60.026	F	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	and

Bed015.F.dialogueact39	60.876	63.606	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and in some ways it's it's very similar to there are very 
Bed015.F.dialogueact40	63.606	67.746	F	Grad	s	-1	0	similar to there are very few changes in some ways from before i don't 
Bed015.F.dialogueact41	67.746	70.02	F	Grad	s	-1	0	before i don't think everyone is oh so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact42	70.02	76.053	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so began um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact43	76.433	79.333	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	um and usual disclaimers are the all these things are it's only slightly 
Bed015.F.dialogueact44	79.533	81.283	F	Grad	s	+1	1	are it's only slightly more stable that was before and um 
Bed015.E.dialogueact45	81.363	81.783	E	Grad	b	-1	0	and um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact46	81.613	89.81	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and um after a little bit more discussion especially like you said i have more linguistics to settle in that case um publication against war 
Bed015.E.dialogueact47	87.891	88.261	E	Grad	b	-1	0	settle in that case um publication 
Bed015.F.dialogueact48	90.59	91.8	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	um maybe i will 
Bed015.F.dialogueact49	92.79	95.14	F	Grad	s	+1	0	not that number two actually on the notation um because that's 
Bed015.F.dialogueact50	95.48	96.07	F	Grad	s^df.%--	-1	0	um because that's 
Bed015.F.dialogueact51	97.7	101.45	F	Grad	s	-1	0	i'm thinking possibly the more familiar to um people okay 
Bed015.F.dialogueact52	101.985	106.825	F	Grad	s.%--	+1	0	people okay so the top like it's just sort of a of abstract irritate you 
Bed015.F.dialogueact53	106.825	110.365	F	Grad	s	+1	0	irritate you serve like um listings of the kinds of things that we can have and certain things 
Bed015.F.dialogueact54	110.615	114.158	F	Grad	s	-1	0	have and certain things i have um changed have changed that that has been a little 
Bed015.F.dialogueact55	114.517	116.607	F	Grad	s	-1	0	that has been a little bit of um going back and forth but basically 
Bed015.F.dialogueact56	116.607	119.177	F	Grad	s	-1	0	back and forth but basically obviously all the churches have have name i forgot to include that you 
Bed015.F.dialogueact57	119.177	122.673	F	Grad	s	-1	0	i forgot to include that you could have a tight including this line so something 
Bed015.C.dialogueact58	121.638	122.178	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	tight including this line so something 
Bed015.C.dialogueact60	122.899	123.199	C	Professor	b	-1	0	this line so something like um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact59	122.673	124.183	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	this line so something like um will there's an example 
Bed015.F.dialogueact61	124.373	125.113	F	Grad	s	-1	0	will there's an example the so somebody 
Bed015.F.dialogueact62	125.113	127.283	F	Grad	s	-1	0	the so somebody and have called construction so um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact63	127.283	127.503	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact64	127.884	130.024	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so um just to show doesn't have to be beautiful attack it could be simple 
Bed015.F.dialogueact65	130.024	131.904	F	Grad	s	-1	0	it could be simple texas ball 
Bed015.F.dialogueact66	132.214	133.084	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	um their couples uh the 
Bed015.F.dialogueact67	133.68	136.11	F	Grad	s	-1	0	uh the three have various ways of doing certain things all just try to go through them 
Bed015.F.dialogueact68	136.11	137.18	F	Grad	s	-1	0	all just try to go through them so they get all have 
Bed015.F.dialogueact69	137.4	138.91	F	Grad	s	+1	2	so they get all have a taken the beginning 
Bed015.F.dialogueact70	139.426	141.446	F	Grad	s	+1	0	oh i see um and and they say the key word construction have some name 
Bed015.C.dialogueact71	141.319	141.879	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	oh i see have some name 
Bed015.F.dialogueact72	141.446	142.206	F	Grad	s	-1	0	oh i see so so the person have some name 
Bed015.C.dialogueact73	142.119	146.639	C	Professor	s^bu.%-	-1	0	so so the person tax is if if if there's a type it's before construct okay yeah right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact74	146.13	147.1	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	construct okay fine yeah right 
Bed015.C.dialogueact75	146.639	147.479	C	Professor	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	construct okay fine yeah right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact76	148.134	150.514	F	Grad	fg|s	+1	0	okay and then i have a block that is constituents and as usual 
Bed015.F.dialogueact77	150.514	157.15	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and as usual i guess all the construction site all the examples here have only one type of constituent that is like instructional 
Bed015.F.dialogueact78	157.15	159.16	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	that is like instructional constituent i think that's actually interesting 
Bed015.F.dialogueact79	159.16	162.08	F	Grad	s	-1	0	i think that's actually interesting be certainly the most common time but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact80	162.504	167.904	F	Grad	s	+1	0	but in general it says the word contractor here you might have meaning reform well 
Bed015.F.dialogueact81	168.124	168.374	F	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	okay so there's some element 
Bed015.F.dialogueact82	168.374	173.114	F	Grad	s	-1	0	okay so there's some element that doesn't it yet construction on this maps one meaning okay 
Bed015.F.dialogueact83	173.494	173.864	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bed015.F.dialogueact84	174.454	184.131	F	Grad	fh|s.%--	-1	0	the name change with the contract which each of which has um the keyword contract and then some name and then some types of education is that it it's 
Bed015.F.dialogueact85	184.736	189.286	F	Grad	s	-1	0	it's it's often sometimes the case in the first issue that you know what kind of construction so for example 
Bed015.F.dialogueact86	189.286	192.743	F	Grad	s:s	-1	0	so for example whatever i had here to be a former there were throw we're 
Bed015.F.dialogueact87	192.843	196.482	F	Grad	s^e:s	-1	0	there were throw we're going to be a form of the word you know happy or something like something 
Bed015.F.dialogueact88	196.482	198.102	F	Grad	s	-1	0	like something to be specific words or maybe you'll have 
Bed015.F.dialogueact89	198.44	199.45	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	or maybe you'll have the type you say 
Bed015.F.dialogueact90	199.45	202.96	F	Grad	s:s	-1	0	the type you say i need a uh spatial relations right here 
Bed015.F.dialogueact91	203.12	205.29	F	Grad	s^e:s	-1	0	i that direction all sorry here i 
Bed015.F.dialogueact92	205.29	207.74	F	Grad	s	-1	0	here i you could have a joke actual type here 
Bed015.F.dialogueact93	208.24	211.97	F	Grad	s	+1	0	or you could just say in case you only know the meaning type 
Bed015.F.dialogueact94	212.18	219.58	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so very common example this is that you know in direct motion the first person something should be agent sometimes often 
Bed015.F.dialogueact95	219.96	220.73	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	sometimes often human rights 
Bed015.F.dialogueact96	220.86	221.11	F	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	human rights are like 
Bed015.F.dialogueact97	221.11	224.81	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	are like uh run down the street and i 
Bed015.F.dialogueact98	225.36	226.26	F	Grad	s	-1	0	i i received its type um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact99	226.26	227.51	F	Grad	s:s	-1	0	its type um i meaning 
Bed015.F.dialogueact100	227.85	229.4	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	i meaning category is there that 
Bed015.F.dialogueact101	229.899	232.739	F	Grad	s	-1	0	there that then you kind of this one is sort of a pair 
Bed015.F.dialogueact102	233.326	234.706	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact103	235.323	237.013	F	Grad	s	-1	0	skipping sponsor whatever the idea that 
Bed015.F.dialogueact104	237.293	243.103	F	Grad	s	-1	0	the idea that sometimes there are general construction site you know you're going to need need the equivalent 
Bed015.F.dialogueact105	243.363	246.853	F	Grad	s	-1	0	need the equivalent of a noun fraser provisional or something like that and 
Bed015.E.dialogueact106	245.285	245.915	E	Grad	b	-1	0	provisional or 
Bed015.F.dialogueact107	247.143	251.19	F	Grad	s	+1	1	and usually have formal um considerations along with it and then 
Bed015.C.dialogueact108	250.361	250.741	C	Professor	b	-1	0	along with 
Bed015.F.dialogueact109	251.51	255.97	F	Grad	s	-1	0	it and then you might know something much more specific depending on what construction you're talking about 
Bed015.F.dialogueact110	256.298	258.568	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	about what meaning what specifically want so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact111	258.819	261.259	F	Grad	s:s	-1	0	want so the couple again the bottom which is directed motion you might 
Bed015.F.dialogueact112	261.739	270.719	F	Grad	s	-1	0	you might need a nominal expression to take the place of you know um the big you know the big tall dark man you know walked into the room 
Bed015.E.dialogueact113	269.963	270.053	E	Grad	b	-1	0	you know walked into the room 
Bed015.F.dialogueact114	271.189	276.57	F	Grad	s	-1	0	but because of the nature this particular construction you know not just that it's phenomenal sometimes but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact115	276.84	279.41	F	Grad	s	-1	0	sometimes but you could some kind of animate nominal 
Bed015.F.dialogueact116	280.28	284.12	F	Grad	s	-1	0	which will apply just as well as like simple proper now and or just some complicated 
Bed015.F.dialogueact117	284.12	285.95	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and or just some complicated expression 
Bed015.F.dialogueact118	286.7	287.14	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	so i don't 
Bed015.F.dialogueact119	287.76	292.36	F	Grad	s^no	-1	0	so i don't know it's actual hold but something that just you you both instructional and mean type 
Bed015.F.dialogueact120	292.36	292.54	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	type 
Bed015.F.dialogueact121	293.43	295.87	F	Grad	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	okay then i don't think to um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact122	296.45	296.98	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	andy 
Bed015.F.dialogueact123	297.15	300.995	F	Grad	s^bk|s^rt	-1	0	yeah none of these examples have anything different for formal constraints but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact124	300.995	307.335	F	Grad	s	-1	0	for formal constraints but you can refer to any of uh available elements in scope right which here 
Bed015.F.dialogueact125	307.395	311.88	F	Grad	s^f|s	-1	0	right which here are the contracts to say something about the relation 
Bed015.F.dialogueact126	312.493	319.673	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and i think to eat you know you compare like the top block and that actual block um we dropped like the little s. script that at 
Bed015.F.dialogueact127	319.743	323.813	F	Grad	s	-1	0	script that at some scripts refer to the form of the contract 
Bed015.C.dialogueact128	323.869	324.069	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	of the contract and i think that 
Bed015.F.dialogueact129	324.234	326.914	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and i think that um in general being time it like 
Bed015.F.dialogueact130	326.914	330.114	F	Grad	s	-1	0	being time it like if you were getting a phone strengthen your friend whole whole of that so so buy thing 
Bed015.F.dialogueact131	330.114	334.624	F	Grad	s:s	-1	0	so so buy thing if i just said name one that means name one formal which 
Bed015.F.dialogueact132	334.624	336.514	F	Grad	s	-1	0	formal which which which makes sense um there 
Bed015.F.dialogueact133	336.814	339.034	F	Grad	s	-1	0	makes sense um there are certain times when we'll have an exception to that you just in 
Bed015.F.dialogueact134	339.034	342.132	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	you just in case you're i mean meaningful for some reason right we're 
Bed015.F.dialogueact135	342.552	342.742	F	Grad	s^f	-1	0	right we're 
Bed015.F.dialogueact136	342.742	349.602	F	Grad	s	-1	0	right we're actually is more often that only had a list one specialties you know george and jerry walk into the room in that order we have 
Bed015.E.dialogueact138	349.889	350.229	E	Grad	b	-1	0	that order we have a few funny things where 
Bed015.F.dialogueact137	349.732	354.044	F	Grad	s	-1	0	that order we have a few funny things where something and the meaning like or something but but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact139	354.672	356.862	F	Grad	s	-1	0	but but we're not going to really worry about that right now and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact140	356.862	360.182	F	Grad	s	-1	0	about that right now and our weight we can be more specific if we have to on 
Bed015.F.dialogueact141	361.354	364.079	F	Grad	s^bk|s^t^tc	-1	0	okay and so in terms of the relations you know and usually 
Bed015.F.dialogueact142	364.159	365.859	F	Grad	s	-1	0	you know and usually before and and i should 
Bed015.F.dialogueact143	365.859	368.739	F	Grad	s	-1	0	before and and i should put an example you of something that isn't intangible relation but inform 
Bed015.F.dialogueact144	368.739	371.563	F	Grad	s	-1	0	relation but inform you might also have a value my you know you could 
Bed015.F.dialogueact145	371.653	379.533	F	Grad	s:s	-1	0	my you know you could say that um you know name one dot you know number school world or something like that there are certain things 
Bed015.E.dialogueact146	377.08	378.34	E	Grad	b	-1	0	school world or something 
Bed015.F.dialogueact147	379.533	383.773	F	Grad	s	-1	0	like that there are certain things that are actually value similar to the findings below but i 
Bed015.F.dialogueact148	383.773	388.34	F	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	below but i mean they're just usually they're going to be value value fillers right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact149	389.681	392.451	F	Grad	s^bk|s	+1	2	okay and then again spent the change here just just my name's there was talk 
Bed015.F.dialogueact150	392.451	394.651	F	Grad	s	-1	0	my name's there was talk of changing the name of that and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact151	394.989	397.719	F	Grad	s	-1	0	of that and donna and i i mean i can like fight about that you like 
Bed015.F.dialogueact152	398.019	401.689	F	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	about changing it to man take facts which 
Bed015.F.dialogueact153	401.809	405.838	F	Grad	s	-1	0	facts which i thought was a little bit too order by and and 
Bed015.B.dialogueact154	404.21	404.53	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	order 
Bed015.B.dialogueact155	405.449	406.139	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	by and and semantic take findings 
Bed015.F.dialogueact156	405.838	407.428	F	Grad	s	-1	0	by and and semantic take findings which i thought might 
Bed015.F.dialogueact157	407.428	410.476	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	which i thought might be too restrictive in case we don't have only finding and so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact158	410.636	420.136	F	Grad	s	+1	1	finding and so it was an issue whether constraints um there were some linguist who reacted against i'm trying think oh it's not used for matching then it should be call a constraint i think we want 
Bed015.F.dialogueact159	420.336	423.596	F	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	i think we want to be uncommitted about whether he's from actually i right because they're 
Bed015.F.dialogueact160	423.596	428.856	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	right because they're i think we've got some situations where it would be useful to use whatever the lines are for 
Bed015.F.dialogueact161	429.4	431.97	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	well you actual you know sort of like on if can straining purpose 
Bed015.C.dialogueact162	431.602	437.402	C	Professor	s	-1	0	well you definitely want it to be couple formal isn't from the parking strategy so straining purpose yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact164	437.87	442.77	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so that whether or not it's used for matching are only for verification yeah if you shouldn't matter right 
Bed015.E.dialogueact163	437.824	438.244	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	so that whether or yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact165	438.038	438.968	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	that whether or

Bed015.C.dialogueact171	446.699	447.509	C	Professor	s^df.%-	-1	0	we want to use but we don't want to yeah i there was 
Bed015.F.dialogueact172	447.072	452.332	F	Grad	s^bk|s:s	-1	0	want to yeah i there was one time when when hans explain why constraints was a misleading work for him and i think 
Bed015.C.dialogueact173	452.594	452.784	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	him and i think 
Bed015.F.dialogueact174	452.602	457.252	F	Grad	s	-1	0	him and i think the reason that he gave was similar to the reason why john i thought it was missing is just an interesting 
Bed015.F.dialogueact175	457.252	459.202	F	Grad	s	-1	0	is just an interesting coincidence um but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact176	459.202	460.55	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	um but uh so like okay 
Bed015.F.dialogueact177	460.55	462.32	F	Grad	s:s^bk|s^rt	-1	0	uh so like okay well we're going to like understand 
Bed015.C.dialogueact179	462.536	463.116	C	Professor	s	-1	0	understand it but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact178	462.32	463.21	F	Grad	s^bk|s^cs^rt	-1	0	understand it but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact180	463.51	465.9	F	Grad	s	-1	0	it but i i i'm starting to like it again 
Bed015.B.dialogueact182	466.792	467.202	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	that's a 
Bed015.F.dialogueact181	466.6	468.06	F	Grad	s	-1	0	well you know what that's a so 
Bed015.A.dialogueact184	468.488	469.178	A	Grad	qw	-1	0	well you know what if so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact183	468.06	468.36	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	well you know what so 
Bed015.A.dialogueact185	469.878	473.688	A	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	if you have an if then face know what the done faces called 
Bed015.C.dialogueact186	469.913	470.623	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	if you have an if then face

Bed015.C.dialogueact192	479.235	487.58	C	Professor	fg|s^cs:s	-1	0	no but right so the other the other strategy you guys could consider is when you don't know what word to put you could put into work 
Bed015.F.dialogueact194	481.17	481.41	F	Grad	b	-1	0	you guys could consider 
Bed015.C.dialogueact195	488.14	488.75	C	Professor	s^e:s	-1	0	just meaning 
Bed015.C.dialogueact196	489.55	489.73	C	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	again and then 
Bed015.C.dialogueact198	489.73	490.49	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	again and then let the yeah that's 
Bed015.E.dialogueact197	489.603	489.913	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	again and then 
Bed015.F.dialogueact199	490.51	491.34	F	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	let the yeah that's true 
Bed015.B.dialogueact200	492.241	495.941	B	Grad	qy^bu^d	-1	0	so that's why you put semantic concerns about the meaning bending down down here 
Bed015.F.dialogueact201	496.67	497.12	F	Grad	s^bk|s^fe	-1	0	oh oh no that was just 
Bed015.F.dialogueact202	497.12	500.62	F	Grad	s^ar|s^df	-1	0	okay no that was just a mistake of cut and paste from when i was going with it so 
Bed015.B.dialogueact203	499.703	500.113	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay from when i was going with it so 
Bed015.C.dialogueact204	500.057	500.387	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	going with it so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact205	500.62	501.56	F	Grad	s^fa	-1	0	going with it so i'm sorry i didn't mean 
Bed015.F.dialogueact206	501.56	503.66	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so it should i'm sorry i didn't mean that one's an intentional 
Bed015.B.dialogueact207	503.69	504.91	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	so it should be the again sometimes i'm intentionally 
Bed015.F.dialogueact208	504.052	505.762	F	Grad	s	-1	0	be the again sometimes i'm intentionally i think i'm not 
Bed015.B.dialogueact209	505.428	506.495	B	Grad	%	-1	0	i think i'm not sure it here 
Bed015.F.dialogueact210	505.762	506.482	F	Grad	s^df^rt	-1	0	i think i'm not sure it here 
Bed015.F.dialogueact211	506.702	508.732	F	Grad	s	-1	0	that this that sure it here i actually actually was just a mistake 
Bed015.B.dialogueact212	508.135	510.485	B	Grad	s^bu^rt	-1	0	that this that i should be so many constraints on the bottom was just a mistake yeah 
Bed015.E.dialogueact213	510.699	511.079	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	on the bottom yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact214	510.83	511.08	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	on the bottom yeah

Bed015.F.dialogueact216	512.245	513.435	F	Grad	s:s	-1	0	well nothing with meaning 
Bed015.F.dialogueact217	513.435	515.655	F	Grad	s:s	-1	0	or whatever meaning like meaning to man thing right 
Bed015.B.dialogueact218	514.4	514.87	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	or whatever like meaning

Bed015.C.dialogueact223	520.142	520.692	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact222	519.905	519.995	F	Grad	%--	-1	0	buys these 
Bed015.C.dialogueact224	520.692	520.902	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	right 
Bed015.C.dialogueact225	521.082	522.562	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	minor my rub minor point okay 
Bed015.F.dialogueact226	521.94	522.51	F	Grad	s^m^na	-1	0	minor my rub minor point okay 
Bed015.C.dialogueact228	522.942	523.172	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	rub point okay um 
Bed015.E.dialogueact227	522.83	523.3	E	Grad	s^na	-1	0	rub point okay um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact229	522.97	524.23	F	Grad	fg	-1	0	rub point okay um so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact230	524.785	528.575	F	Grad	s	+1	0	so i think the middle lots this really give you any more information except on the top block and the bottom 
Bed015.F.dialogueact231	528.575	537.545	F	Grad	s	+1	0	top block and the bottom block similarly only just a list is all it does is illustrate that you can drop the subscription and and that you can drop the um that you can give dual type the one thing i 
Bed015.F.dialogueact232	537.545	539.425	F	Grad	s	+1	0	dual type the one thing i should mention about designate think 
Bed015.F.dialogueact233	539.425	542.253	F	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	think i'm actually gets across these as well so um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact234	542.573	546.033	F	Grad	s^co	-1	0	so um strike out the and subscription on the middle block so basically now 
Bed015.C.dialogueact235	546.232	546.702	C	Professor	b	-1	0	so basically now 
Bed015.F.dialogueact236	546.303	552.18	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so basically now um this is actually this little change actually goes along with the big linguistic change was just that designate 
Bed015.F.dialogueact237	552.18	556.451	F	Grad	s	-1	0	was just that designate and only something for the semantics to worry about now so we want 
Bed015.C.dialogueact238	556.487	556.907	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	now so we want 
Bed015.F.dialogueact239	556.741	561.801	F	Grad	s	-1	0	now so we want designate actually know one of the constituents which acts like a head in some respects 
Bed015.F.dialogueact240	562.202	565.582	F	Grad	s	-1	0	but it sort of um really important for say competition later the presence 
Bed015.F.dialogueact241	565.582	573.852	F	Grad	s	+1	0	later the presence of some other construction says you know are you what type is it part of type whatever um doesn't tell you what part part 
Bed015.F.dialogueact242	574.112	579.31	F	Grad	s^rt:s	-1	0	so you have like the big red ball no one else object for now what ball is going 
Bed015.F.dialogueact243	579.31	583.104	F	Grad	s:s	-1	0	what ball is going to be the designated elements of that kind of for 
Bed015.E.dialogueact244	581.423	581.693	E	Grad	b	-1	0	elements 
Bed015.F.dialogueact245	583.604	583.964	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed015.F.dialogueact246	584.609	593.46	F	Grad	s	-1	0	there is a slight complication here which is that we talk about form useful sometimes to talk about um talk about are also being a designated object and we think that it'll 
Bed015.F.dialogueact247	593.46	594.89	F	Grad	s|s^f	-1	0	object and we think that it'll be the same one right football 
Bed015.F.dialogueact248	594.89	597.287	F	Grad	s:s	-1	0	be the same one right football the ball the head of the phrase the 
Bed015.F.dialogueact249	597.357	599.317	F	Grad	s^e:s	-1	0	the um the ball and uh 
Bed015.F.dialogueact250	599.317	607.07	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and yeah and there's uh there's and uh and you know by the word ball sort of semantic head in some ways of of this sort of um interesting article 
Bed015.C.dialogueact251	605.975	606.635	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	and yeah interesting article 
Bed015.C.dialogueact252	606.825	607.075	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah and there's uh there's article 
Bed015.C.dialogueact253	607.195	612.635	C	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	and there's uh there's case some cases where the grammar depends on some form property of the head and 
Bed015.C.dialogueact256	612.995	615.405	C	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	of the head and and it's they push to get that if i understand you right right right 
Bed015.E.dialogueact255	612.903	613.163	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	of the head and and it's they push to get 
Bed015.F.dialogueact254	612.871	613.131	F	Grad	b	-1	0	of the head and and it's they push to get 
Bed015.E.dialogueact257	614.586	614.836	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	that if i understand right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact258	614.698	615.838	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	that if i understand you right right right 
Bed015.E.dialogueact259	615.246	615.896	E	Grad	s^na	-1	0	you right right 
Bed015.C.dialogueact261	616.235	616.705	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	and that 
Bed015.E.dialogueact260	615.896	616.106	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	you right right and that 
Bed015.F.dialogueact262	616.538	627.589	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and that you might feel say things like if they had has to go last and i had my own language you can refer to the head as a you know the formal head as opposed to the rest of the form having to be at the end of that so that's 
Bed015.C.dialogueact263	626.961	627.251	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	to be at the end of that so that's 
Bed015.F.dialogueact264	627.589	628.479	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so that's a useful things 
Bed015.F.dialogueact265	628.479	631.059	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	okay so that all this to me a useful things internal referral thing 
Bed015.C.dialogueact266	630.719	631.869	C	Professor	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	okay so that all this to me referral thing 
Bed015.C.dialogueact267	631.869	632.309	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so that all this to me 
Bed015.C.dialogueact268	632.91	633.35	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	oh well

Bed015.C.dialogueact275	641.47	646.382	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so if i understand this bean aside 
Bed015.C.dialogueact276	646.862	659.855	C	Professor	s	-1	0	aside from uh construed and all that sort of stuff that the differences are mainly that we've gone to the possibility of having four meaning errors for a tight

Bed015.F.dialogueact289	674.03	674.34	F	Grad	b	-1	0	sorry you're right 
Bed015.C.dialogueact291	675.116	676.136	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh construction type uh that's 
Bed015.C.dialogueact292	676.64	677.47	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	uh that's fine 
Bed015.C.dialogueact294	678.28	679.94	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	but it um well 
Bed015.F.dialogueact293	678.155	678.375	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	but it 
Bed015.F.dialogueact295	679.879	686.652	F	Grad	s	-1	0	um well and a previous um you know personal decision certainly allowed you to single out the meaning but the you could take 
Bed015.F.dialogueact296	686.652	689.862	F	Grad	s	-1	0	but the you could take contract of type whatever doesn't something 
Bed015.C.dialogueact297	690.08	690.44	C	Professor	b	-1	0	but that was mostly 
Bed015.F.dialogueact298	690.299	692.249	F	Grad	s	-1	0	but that was mostly for reference purposes just refer to them 
Bed015.F.dialogueact299	692.249	693.429	F	Grad	s	-1	0	just refer to them well i don't think that 
Bed015.F.dialogueact300	693.429	698.841	F	Grad	s	-1	0	well i don't think that it was often used to given extra meaning on i mean which is 
Bed015.F.dialogueact301	698.841	700.861	F	Grad	s	-1	0	mean which is really what we want most of the time i think 
Bed015.C.dialogueact302	700.789	701.329	C	Professor	b	-1	0	of the time i think 
Bed015.F.dialogueact303	701.36	701.71	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed015.F.dialogueact304	703.535	705.645	F	Grad	s^no.%--	-1	0	i i don't know if we'll ever have a case we actually have if there 
Bed015.F.dialogueact305	705.645	711.795	F	Grad	s	-1	0	no no no i don't think so i think actually have if there is a form category constraints you could imagine having a triple there so that's kind of weird 
Bed015.C.dialogueact306	710.61	711.69	C	Professor	s^ar|s^nd	-1	0	no no no i don't think so i think so that's kind of weird 
Bed015.C.dialogueact307	711.69	713.27	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	i don't think so i think that you'll you'll do fine in fact that's kind of weird 
Bed015.E.dialogueact308	711.89	712.16	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	i don't think so i think that you'll you'll do fine that's kind of weird 
Bed015.C.dialogueact309	713.47	717.81	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	in fact these are 
Bed015.C.dialogueact310	718.931	721.361	C	Professor	s	-1	0	as long as as marcus now these are form constraint so nominal expression 
Bed015.C.dialogueact311	721.361	726.63	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so nominal expression is uh the fact that animate is meant to texas 
Bed015.C.dialogueact312	726.63	735.95	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	meant to texas and uh normal expression i would say on most people's notion of of the higher form types to is this is what right right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact313	726.863	727.223	F	Grad	b	-1	0	meant to texas and uh 
Bed015.E.dialogueact314	732.983	733.283	E	Grad	b	-1	0	of of 
Bed015.F.dialogueact315	735.1	735.92	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	to is this is what right right 
Bed015.C.dialogueact317	736.22	737.54	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	i think that's just flying yeah just yeah 
Bed015.E.dialogueact316	736.15	737.73	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	i think that's just flying yeah just yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact318	738.31	739.11	F	Grad	s^m^na|s^aa	-1	0	it's but now i'm which is fine yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact320	739.21	739.49	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	but now i'm 
Bed015.E.dialogueact319	739.02	740.72	E	Grad	s	-1	0	but now i'm i mentioned this i i don't 
Bed015.E.dialogueact321	740.72	742.14	E	Grad	s^bd^df^no	-1	0	i mentioned this i i don't know if i ever explain this but the point of um 
Bed015.E.dialogueact322	742.14	743.4	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	but the point of um i mentioned in the last 
Bed015.E.dialogueact323	743.4	749.955	E	Grad	s.%--:s	-1	0	i mentioned in the last meaning of having something called nominal expression is um 
Bed015.E.dialogueact324	751.246	767.901	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	because it seems like having the verbs categorized for you know like i said taking his object just some expression which um designate this an object or designate the thing or whatever um that leads to some some tactic problems basically so 
Bed015.E.dialogueact325	767.901	773.171	E	Grad	s:s	-1	0	basically so you want to you know you sort of have this problem like okay well oh what the word of let's say the word dog you know that has become 
Bed015.E.dialogueact326	773.381	774.951	E	Grad	s^f|s	-1	0	you know that has become right after the verb because 
Bed015.F.dialogueact327	774.046	774.486	F	Grad	b	-1	0	right after the verb because 
Bed015.E.dialogueact328	774.951	776.531	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	right after the verb because we know for me it's just objects and have 
Bed015.E.dialogueact329	776.671	780.411	E	Grad	s:s	-1	0	and have a construction that says oh you can have uh proceeding uh now and and so 
Bed015.E.dialogueact330	780.701	785.002	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and and so you have this sort of problem at the for has to meet it doesn't not mean you can get you know 
Bed015.C.dialogueact331	784.238	784.608	C	Professor	b	-1	0	it doesn't not 
Bed015.E.dialogueact332	785.002	789.772	E	Grad	s:s	-1	0	mean you can get you know the uh kept a dog or something like that meaning that the dog 
Bed015.C.dialogueact333	789.998	790.278	C	Professor	b	-1	0	that the dog um 
Bed015.E.dialogueact334	790.202	794.132	E	Grad	s	-1	0	i i um so you kind of have to let this phrase idea in there but 
Bed015.C.dialogueact336	794.62	796.34	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	i i i have no problem and i think it's fine but it it yeah yeah 
Bed015.E.dialogueact335	794.132	794.422	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	i i but 
Bed015.E.dialogueact337	795.33	795.94	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	i have no problem it it yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact340	796.34	796.78	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	and i think it's fine yeah 
Bed015.E.dialogueact338	795.94	796.28	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	i have no problem and i think it's fine it it yeah yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact339	796.22	796.5	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	and i think it's fine yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact341	797.716	798.546	F	Grad	s^bk|%--	-1	0	right and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact342	799.39	802.37	F	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah you may be you me i'll be like everyone else in in berkeley but that's 
Bed015.E.dialogueact343	800.967	801.377	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	you me i'll be like everyone else in in berkeley 
Bed015.E.dialogueact344	802.45	802.76	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah but that's 
Bed015.F.dialogueact345	802.77	803.42	F	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	yeah i mean we but that's okay we don't 
Bed015.E.dialogueact346	803.41	807.3	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i mean we we sort of thought we were getting away with uh with uh i mean okay we don't mind either 
Bed015.F.dialogueact347	803.58	804.47	F	Grad	s^bd	-1	0	i mean we we sort of thought we were okay we don't mind either 
Bed015.F.dialogueact348	804.47	804.6	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	we sort of thought we were mind either 
Bed015.E.dialogueact349	807.57	812.54	E	Grad	s	-1	0	uh i mean we do not reverting to to the bars theory of uh phrase structure but right 
Bed015.C.dialogueact350	811.64	811.96	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	of uh phrase 
Bed015.E.dialogueact351	812.54	813.69	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	structure but uh right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact352	812.59	812.86	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	structure but right 
Bed015.E.dialogueact353	815.14	822.07	E	Grad	s	+1	0	they do i just know that this is like we didn't originally have in mind that uh that verbs woodson categorized for particular sort of form 
Bed015.F.dialogueact354	822.213	822.453	F	Grad	b	-1	0	they do 
Bed015.C.dialogueact355	822.79	823.25	C	Professor	s^df^rt	+1	0	they do 
Bed015.E.dialogueact356	822.82	823.4	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	they do 
Bed015.E.dialogueact357	824.126	824.546	E	Grad	s^m^na	-1	0	but it's well there's an alternative 
Bed015.F.dialogueact358	824.2	825.75	F	Grad	s	-1	0	but it's at least in well there's an alternative to this which is 
Bed015.E.dialogueact359	825.562	826.362	E	Grad	s^aap^e	-1	0	at least in english to this which is um the 
Bed015.F.dialogueact360	825.75	829.19	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	at least in english to this which is um the question was do we want directed motion which is an argument for sure 
Bed015.C.dialogueact361	826.518	826.738	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	english um the 
Bed015.F.dialogueact362	829.19	830.77	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	which is an argument for sure construction 
Bed015.C.dialogueact364	830.899	831.279	C	Professor	b	-1	0	construction did we want it to worry 
Bed015.E.dialogueact363	830.881	831.081	E	Grad	b	-1	0	construction did we want it to worry 
Bed015.F.dialogueact365	831.142	835.652	F	Grad	qy.%--	-1	0	did we want it to worry about um anything more than the fact that it's you have semantic you know it's 
Bed015.F.dialogueact366	835.652	838.032	F	Grad	s	-1	0	semantic you know it's sort of a frame based construction so why not option 
Bed015.F.dialogueact367	838.282	845.979	F	Grad	s	+1	0	so why not option that you know keep mentioned also was like well if you have more after construction such as subject press get basically things like a medical relations 
Bed015.E.dialogueact368	840.231	840.621	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	mentioned also was like 
Bed015.F.dialogueact369	846.435	847.615	F	Grad	s	+1	0	those could intersects of these that 
Bed015.F.dialogueact370	847.615	856.067	F	Grad	s	+1	0	right of these that subject predicates or subject predicates get subject for bob you know roderick would require that those things that fault fills up an object our non expressions and that would be 
Bed015.C.dialogueact371	851.982	852.182	C	Professor	b	-1	0	right bob you know roderick would require 
Bed015.F.dialogueact372	856.425	858.965	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and that would be a little bit cleaner in some way but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact373	858.965	860.165	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	but in some way but you know for now i mean 
Bed015.C.dialogueact374	860.45	860.57	C	Professor	b	-1	0	but 
Bed015.C.dialogueact375	861.03	865.88	C	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	it it it just moving moving the accustomed to constraints right it you know moving into the place right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact376	861.078	861.778	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	it it it you know 
Bed015.F.dialogueact377	863.79	865.05	F	Grad	s^m^na|s^aa	-1	0	moving the accustomed to constraints right moving into the place right 
Bed015.E.dialogueact378	864.34	864.58	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	accustomed into the place right 
Bed015.C.dialogueact379	866.14	867.12	C	Professor	fg|s.%-	-1	0	okay so that's there does it basically 
Bed015.F.dialogueact380	867.11	870.11	F	Grad	s^bu|qy^d^g	-1	0	right there does it basically the point there has to be that constraint somewhere right oh yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact381	869.906	870.136	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right constraint somewhere right oh yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact382	870.11	870.32	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	oh yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact383	870.32	870.52	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	oh yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact384	871.61	873.77	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	and so that was the e. 
Bed015.F.dialogueact385	874.335	875.195	F	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	um robert's i have you 
Bed015.A.dialogueact386	875.566	875.886	A	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	um you 
Bed015.F.dialogueact387	876.09	876.41	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bed015.C.dialogueact388	876.637	883.397	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	okay and sort of going with that is that the desert not them also now is a pair 
Bed015.F.dialogueact389	883.82	884.06	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	pair is it just me 
Bed015.C.dialogueact390	884.437	885.257	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	is it just me and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact391	885.344	885.804	F	Grad	b	-1	0	and 
Bed015.C.dialogueact392	885.847	890.91	C	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	and that aside from some terminology that's basically it 
Bed015.F.dialogueact393	892.206	892.376	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	that's right 
Bed015.C.dialogueact394	892.88	894.11	C	Professor	s^bd^df	-1	0	that's why i'm asking right yep yeah um 
Bed015.E.dialogueact396	893.556	894.036	E	Grad	b	-1	0	why i'm asking yep yeah um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact395	893.54	893.69	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	why i'm asking yep 
Bed015.E.dialogueact397	894.316	894.576	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact398	894.337	894.607	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact399	894.917	904.189	F	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah um but uh um javon address question in this um definitely would for instance the semantic constraints we talked about here just 
Bed015.C.dialogueact400	900.31	900.51	C	Professor	b	-1	0	um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact401	904.734	905.734	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	here just fine games but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact402	905.734	905.984	F	Grad	%--	-1	0	fine games but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact403	906.304	906.464	F	Grad	s^f	-1	0	right we might want 
Bed015.F.dialogueact404	906.524	908.244	F	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	build right we might want to introduce mental spaces you know that all these things 
Bed015.F.dialogueact405	908.304	909.504	F	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	build the mental spacing is you know that all these things that we don't 
Bed015.C.dialogueact406	908.868	910.878	C	Professor	s^nd	+1	1	build the mental spacing is clearly not here you know that all these things that we don't right so it's going 
Bed015.F.dialogueact407	910.263	910.593	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	clearly not here right so it's going 
Bed015.F.dialogueact408	910.593	915.053	F	Grad	s	+1	1	clearly not here by the way i do want right so it's going to be some extra and you know definitely other additionally to that which we skip for now 
Bed015.E.dialogueact409	912.974	913.564	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	and you know definitely other additionally to that which 
Bed015.C.dialogueact410	915.208	919.068	C	Professor	s	-1	0	by the way i do want to get on that as soon as robert gets back so it yeah okay 
Bed015.F.dialogueact411	917.65	918.01	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	as soon as robert gets back yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact412	918.1	918.47	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	as robert gets back yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact414	919.608	922.698	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so it uh the the pencils tasting okay 
Bed015.F.dialogueact413	919.575	919.885	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	so it okay 
Bed015.C.dialogueact416	923.048	929.218	C	Professor	s	-1	0	um obviously can stroll is it is it is a big component that so there's probably not 
Bed015.E.dialogueact415	922.804	923.234	E	Grad	b	-1	0	tasting um obviously 
Bed015.C.dialogueact417	929.218	931.688	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that so there's probably not worth trying to do anything to really gets back but sort 
Bed015.C.dialogueact418	931.688	936.524	C	Professor	s^cs.%-	-1	0	really gets back but sort of as soon as he gets back i think

Bed015.B.dialogueact433	957.067	958.537	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	often enough well he was he went to college here oh yeah forgot 
Bed015.F.dialogueact434	958.45	958.95	F	Grad	s^aa|s^df^no	-1	0	here oh yeah forgot 
Bed015.F.dialogueact435	958.95	959.3	F	Grad	s^fa	-1	0	here oh yeah forgot sorry 
Bed015.C.dialogueact436	959.583	959.933	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	sorry 
Bed015.F.dialogueact437	960.05	960.26	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bed015.C.dialogueact438	961.69	962.95	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and furthermore it's well worth it in california

Bed015.E.dialogueact441	963.3	963.66	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yes yeah that's true i 
Bed015.F.dialogueact440	963.19	963.99	F	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	yes yeah that's true i 
Bed015.F.dialogueact442	963.99	967.21	F	Grad	s	-1	0	yes yeah that's true i like i like setting for the drive other countries whenever i can 
Bed015.C.dialogueact443	967.678	967.878	C	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed015.F.dialogueact444	968.21	968.77	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	okay um 
Bed015.C.dialogueact445	968.887	969.877	C	Professor	fg|s^ba^t^tc	-1	0	okay so that's great um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact446	970.56	970.89	F	Grad	s^tc	-1	0	construe okay 
Bed015.F.dialogueact447	970.89	971.81	F	Grad	s^bk|%--	-1	0	construe okay so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact448	972.962	974.372	F	Grad	s	-1	0	oh so there was one question i can't i hate 
Bed015.F.dialogueact449	974.372	975.022	F	Grad	s	-1	0	i can't i hate um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact450	975.152	975.302	F	Grad	s^fa	-1	0	um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact451	975.684	976.464	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	um which is 
Bed015.F.dialogueact452	977.35	983.495	F	Grad	s	+1	0	so something like past which is you know we think is a very simple as we've often just i can as the future you know 
Bed015.C.dialogueact453	981.24	981.55	C	Professor	b	-1	0	simple as we've often 
Bed015.C.dialogueact455	983.857	984.137	C	Professor	b	-1	0	future you know this event takes place 
Bed015.F.dialogueact454	983.495	987.145	F	Grad	s:s	-1	0	future you know this event takes place before speech time okay was what this means um it's 
Bed015.F.dialogueact456	987.435	991.421	F	Grad	s	+1	1	right um it's often thought of as is also considered a mental space you know by 
Bed015.C.dialogueact457	991.51	991.74	C	Professor	b	-1	0	right space you know by 
Bed015.F.dialogueact458	991.641	993.571	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	right right space you know by you know what people around here so 
Bed015.C.dialogueact459	993.359	993.569	C	Professor	b	-1	0	right around here so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact460	993.941	999.586	F	Grad	s^rt:s^rt	-1	0	right around here so there's the issue of well sometimes they're really exotic explicit space builders a say in france blah blah blah and you 
Bed015.E.dialogueact461	999.298	999.668	E	Grad	b	-1	0	blah blah and you 
Bed015.F.dialogueact462	999.866	1004.19	F	Grad	s	-1	0	blah blah and you have to build a you got you would imagine that would require you to be very specific of machinery rest passes 
Bed015.F.dialogueact463	1004.46	1006.05	F	Grad	s	+1	0	rest passes very conventional when we sort of know what it means 
Bed015.F.dialogueact464	1006.05	1007.19	F	Grad	s	-1	0	we sort of know what it means but if 
Bed015.F.dialogueact465	1007.58	1012.54	F	Grad	s	-1	0	but if we don't know and silly want to you know i'm little limitation every time you see that it's past tense to 
Bed015.C.dialogueact466	1011.86	1012.11	C	Professor	b	-1	0	see that it's past tense to 
Bed015.F.dialogueact467	1012.75	1021.38	F	Grad	s	-1	0	i think that's exactly right tense to you know we can think of art it just like x. tina walk refers to this complicate structure past refers to you know certain configuration of the things that are just so 
Bed015.C.dialogueact468	1017.28	1018.31	C	Professor	s^na	-1	0	i think that's exactly right structure past refers to 
Bed015.F.dialogueact469	1021.38	1023.7	F	Grad	s	-1	0	are just so that were kind of like having are taking you know 
Bed015.C.dialogueact471	1024.13	1024.32	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah i mean both right right into 
Bed015.F.dialogueact470	1023.7	1025.04	F	Grad	s^e|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	yeah yeah no i think that they taking you know i mean both right right into it 
Bed015.C.dialogueact473	1025.15	1028.37	C	Professor	s^aa|s^bd	-1	0	yeah no i think that they to see how it works out when we do the details but it 
Bed015.F.dialogueact472	1025.04	1025.78	F	Grad	%-	-1	0	yeah no i think that they it 
Bed015.F.dialogueact474	1027.01	1027.33	F	Grad	b	-1	0	works out when we do the details 
Bed015.C.dialogueact475	1028.37	1030.79	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but my intuition would be that that's right yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact476	1028.41	1028.76	F	Grad	b	-1	0	but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact477	1030.7	1031.61	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	be that that's right yeah okay 
Bed015.A.dialogueact478	1032.21	1033.55	A	Grad	qy^rt	+1	0	you want to do something space sorry 
Bed015.F.dialogueact479	1033.79	1034.12	F	Grad	qw^br	-1	0	space sorry 
Bed015.A.dialogueact480	1035.78	1036.28	A	Grad	s^r	-1	0	space space 
Bed015.F.dialogueact481	1036.61	1036.95	F	Grad	qw^br^m	-1	0	space 
Bed015.A.dialogueact482	1037.2	1037.49	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	yeah 
Bed015.A.dialogueact483	1038.28	1038.59	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	no oh 
Bed015.F.dialogueact484	1038.87	1040.86	F	Grad	s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt	+1	0	no oh well oh instead of just time yeah 
Bed015.A.dialogueact486	1041.07	1041.32	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah same 
Bed015.F.dialogueact485	1040.99	1041.86	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	instead of just time yeah yeah same 
Bed015.F.dialogueact487	1041.86	1042.33	F	Grad	s^na	+1	1	yeah same thing so they're very 
Bed015.F.dialogueact488	1042.33	1045.54	F	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	+1	0	thing so they're very conventional i'd like they kick months right and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact489	1045.94	1050.7	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	right and then i think for others spaces that you introduce you could just attach or whatever 
Bed015.F.dialogueact490	1050.7	1051.07	F	Grad	s	-1	0	or whatever you could build up 
Bed015.A.dialogueact492	1051.34	1051.64	A	Grad	b	-1	0	you could build up 
Bed015.F.dialogueact491	1051.17	1055.96	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and this this basically you could build up an appropriately you know for structure according to the the sentence 
Bed015.C.dialogueact493	1053.22	1053.66	C	Professor	b	-1	0	you know for structure 
Bed015.A.dialogueact494	1054.43	1054.57	A	Grad	b	-1	0	according to the 
Bed015.A.dialogueact495	1055.01	1060.29	A	Grad	s:s	-1	0	and this this basically would've off everything they can't imagine to fit under your seed taught something you the sentence yeah 
Bed015.E.dialogueact496	1055.1	1055.35	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	and this this basically the sentence 
Bed015.A.dialogueact498	1060.99	1062.87	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	you know where where is could actually depending what yeah right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact497	1060.7	1061.17	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	you know where where is could yeah right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact499	1061.66	1062.0	F	Grad	b	-1	0	know where where is could actually depending what right 
Bed015.A.dialogueact501	1062.87	1063.33	A	Grad	qh	-1	0	actually depending what us know what this past 
Bed015.A.dialogueact502	1063.33	1064.29	A	Grad	qh	-1	0	us know what this past what this in the future 
Bed015.F.dialogueact500	1062.84	1063.21	F	Grad	b	-1	0	actually depending what us know what this past 
Bed015.A.dialogueact503	1064.29	1065.19	A	Grad	qh	-1	0	what this in the future versus what if you're 
Bed015.A.dialogueact504	1065.19	1065.61	A	Grad	qh	-1	0	versus what if you're 
Bed015.A.dialogueact505	1065.61	1066.05	A	Grad	qh	-1	0	versus what if you're what if they're what this

Bed015.A.dialogueact507	1066.64	1067.12	A	Grad	qh.%--	-1	0	what if they're what this uhhuh yes 
Bed015.F.dialogueact508	1067.2	1067.49	F	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh yes 
Bed015.F.dialogueact509	1067.82	1067.97	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	uhhuh yes 
Bed015.F.dialogueact510	1067.97	1068.77	F	Grad	s	-1	0	uhhuh yes the time and space 
Bed015.F.dialogueact511	1069.03	1072.44	F	Grad	s	-1	0	um we get that on the other side a little like very mentally there's a sort of 
Bed015.F.dialogueact512	1072.44	1075.67	F	Grad	s	-1	0	there's a sort of there's a slot for setting time setting place and 
Bed015.C.dialogueact513	1073.25	1073.44	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	there's a slot for 
Bed015.F.dialogueact514	1075.67	1075.99	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	setting place and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact515	1076.71	1080.17	F	Grad	s	-1	0	you know you can imagine pro those are absolute things you could say about the time and place and then there many 
Bed015.F.dialogueact516	1080.42	1088.33	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and then there many in more interesting lee linguistically anyway their relative things that you know you relate the event in time and space to where you are now if there's 
Bed015.F.dialogueact517	1088.88	1093.85	F	Grad	s	-1	0	if there's something more a lot more complicated like are so hypothetical or whatever then you have to do your job 
Bed015.E.dialogueact518	1092.22	1092.72	E	Grad	b	-1	0	whatever then you have to 
Bed015.F.dialogueact519	1094.28	1095.74	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	or somebody's job anyway pointed 
Bed015.E.dialogueact520	1095.51	1095.76	E	Grad	b	-1	0	job anyway pointed 
Bed015.F.dialogueact521	1095.74	1097.04	F	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah i mean i'm i'm job anyway pointed at random 
Bed015.E.dialogueact522	1096.5	1096.71	E	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah i mean i'm at random 
Bed015.E.dialogueact523	1096.71	1101.92	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	yeah i mean i'm i'm curious about how much or the mental i mean at random 
Bed015.E.dialogueact524	1101.92	1109.94	E	Grad	s^no	+1	0	the mental i mean i'm not sure that the formula some sort of the grammatical side of things is going to have that much going on in terms of the mental space stuff 
Bed015.E.dialogueact525	1110.41	1117.04	E	Grad	s.%--	+1	1	you know um basically all of these so called space builders that are in the sons are going to sort of i think of it is 
Bed015.E.dialogueact526	1117.32	1120.62	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i think of it is to give you the coordinates of you know 
Bed015.E.dialogueact527	1121.48	1141.46	E	Grad	s	+1	1	assuming that at any point in discourse there's a possibility that we could be sort of talking about a bunch of different world scenarios whatever and the speakers supposed to be keeping track of those uh um the construction that you actually get is just going to sort of give you a cue as to which one of those that you've already got going um you're supposed to add structure too so in 
Bed015.F.dialogueact528	1139.26	1139.55	F	Grad	b	-1	0	um you're supposed 
Bed015.E.dialogueact529	1141.68	1145.54	E	Grad	s:s	-1	0	too so in france uh watergate wouldn't i've heard nixon or something like that um 
Bed015.E.dialogueact530	1145.89	1152.83	E	Grad	s	-1	0	like that um well you say all right i'm supposed to add some structure to my model of this hypothetical past france universe or something like that 
Bed015.E.dialogueact531	1153.09	1155.19	E	Grad	s	-1	0	the information in this in this tells you that much but it doesn't 
Bed015.E.dialogueact532	1155.52	1162.19	E	Grad	s	+1	1	but it doesn't tell you like exactly what it what the point of doing so is so for example 
Bed015.E.dialogueact533	1162.19	1166.74	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so for example depending on the linguistic on uh the context it could be 
Bed015.E.dialogueact534	1167.18	1169.74	E	Grad	qh	-1	0	like the question is for example what is watergate refer to their 
Bed015.E.dialogueact535	1170.04	1172.32	E	Grad	qh.%--	-1	0	that you know because i referred to um did you just hear 
Bed015.E.dialogueact536	1172.52	1179.68	E	Grad	s	-1	0	did you just hear that's in the cold is something is that when you say watergate you're referring to a watergate like scandal as we might imagine it happening in france but 
Bed015.E.dialogueact537	1180.0	1186.9	E	Grad	s:s	-1	0	in a different context oh you know if nixon had apologize right away it wouldn't near watergate wouldn't have hurt him so badly in the u. s. and 
Bed015.E.dialogueact538	1186.9	1188.58	E	Grad	s:s	-1	0	in the u. s. and in france it in a for him at all now worst 
Bed015.E.dialogueact539	1188.82	1193.63	E	Grad	s	-1	0	him at all now worst and now that watergate we're not talking about the real one and the real right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact540	1192.7	1193.79	F	Grad	s^na|s^aa	-1	0	about the real one and the real right 
Bed015.E.dialogueact541	1193.99	1199.11	E	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	real one and that would sort of it's sort of different dimension of type of that medic allocate right we're not saying what's right 
Bed015.E.dialogueact543	1199.11	1201.8	E	Grad	s^e:qw	-1	0	we're not saying what's hypothetical about this world in the first 
Bed015.F.dialogueact542	1198.76	1199.16	F	Grad	s^na|s^aa	-1	0	allocate right we're not saying what's 
Bed015.E.dialogueact544	1201.8	1205.14	E	Grad	s	-1	0	about this world in the first case hypothetically were imagining the watergate happen in france in the second case 
Bed015.F.dialogueact545	1204.08	1204.25	F	Grad	b	-1	0	happen in france 
Bed015.E.dialogueact546	1205.37	1209.19	E	Grad	s	-1	0	in the second case for imagine hypothetically that nixon had apologize right away or something right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact547	1208.4	1208.79	F	Grad	b	-1	0	apologize right away 
Bed015.E.dialogueact549	1209.55	1210.22	E	Grad	s^e|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	or something right so a lot of this 
Bed015.F.dialogueact548	1209.49	1209.79	F	Grad	b	-1	0	or something right 
Bed015.E.dialogueact550	1210.22	1212.72	E	Grad	s	-1	0	right so a lot of this isn't happening at the grammatical level 
Bed015.C.dialogueact552	1213.0	1213.25	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	um and 
Bed015.E.dialogueact551	1212.86	1215.18	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	right level um and so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact553	1215.82	1216.17	F	Grad	b	-1	0	i don't 
Bed015.E.dialogueact554	1216.83	1218.07	E	Grad	s^no	-1	0	i don't know where that fits then sort of the idea 
Bed015.A.dialogueact555	1218.31	1218.58	A	Grad	b	-1	0	sort of the idea 
Bed015.E.dialogueact556	1218.44	1220.63	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	sort of the idea of sorting out what the person meant seems like um the 
Bed015.F.dialogueact557	1219.53	1227.48	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	of sorting out what the person meant seems like um the grammatical things such as the artillery that you know introduce these conditional whatever give you so the the most basic those we i 
Bed015.E.dialogueact558	1224.5	1224.97	E	Grad	b	-1	0	these conditional 
Bed015.F.dialogueact559	1227.48	1230.01	F	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	basic those we i think we can figure out what the possibilities are right there it's a relatively 
Bed015.E.dialogueact560	1229.75	1230.02	E	Grad	b	-1	0	possibilities are right there it's a relatively 
Bed015.F.dialogueact561	1230.01	1231.8	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	it's a relatively limited number 
Bed015.F.dialogueact562	1232.17	1239.39	F	Grad	s.%--:s	-1	0	and then how they interact with some extra thing like in france or if such and such that's like there are certain ways that they they can you know one is 
Bed015.E.dialogueact563	1235.38	1235.6	E	Grad	b	-1	0	or if such 
Bed015.F.dialogueact564	1239.39	1244.16	F	Grad	s	-1	0	they can you know one is a more specific version of the general pattern that uh from at grammar if you think 
Bed015.E.dialogueact566	1244.36	1244.56	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	think 
Bed015.F.dialogueact565	1244.16	1245.06	F	Grad	s^bd	-1	0	yeah think but you know whatever 
Bed015.F.dialogueact567	1245.06	1245.9	F	Grad	s^bd	-1	0	yeah but you know whatever 
Bed015.C.dialogueact569	1246.03	1254.56	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	in the short run all we need is enough mechanism on the form side to get things going uh 
Bed015.F.dialogueact568	1245.9	1246.14	F	Grad	%-	-1	0	yeah in the short run but you know whatever 
Bed015.E.dialogueact570	1250.24	1250.81	E	Grad	b	-1	0	to 
Bed015.E.dialogueact571	1253.68	1253.94	E	Grad	b	-1	0	things going 
Bed015.C.dialogueact572	1254.56	1256.58	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	uh you know but the whole point of the whole 
Bed015.E.dialogueact573	1256.1	1264.22	E	Grad	s	-1	0	know point but the whole point of the whole point of what folk an intern or have to say about uh mental spaces and blending and all that stuff is that you don't really get that much out of the sentence you know there's 
Bed015.E.dialogueact574	1264.22	1266.65	E	Grad	s	-1	0	you know there's not that much information contained in the sense that just says 
Bed015.E.dialogueact575	1266.65	1267.36	E	Grad	s:s	-1	0	in the sense that just says here at the structure 
Bed015.E.dialogueact576	1267.36	1268.79	E	Grad	s:s	-1	0	here at the structure to the space 
Bed015.E.dialogueact577	1269.12	1274.59	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and exactly what that means for the overall ongoing interpretation is quite open an 
Bed015.E.dialogueact578	1274.91	1280.39	E	Grad	s:s	-1	0	open an individual in this could mean a hundred different things depending on quote what the space configuration is at the time of utter this and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact579	1275.26	1275.6	F	Grad	b	-1	0	individual in this could mean 
Bed015.F.dialogueact580	1276.87	1277.09	F	Grad	b	-1	0	a hundred different things depending on quote what 
Bed015.E.dialogueact581	1280.99	1285.16	E	Grad	s	-1	0	i think that's right this and so somebody's going to have to be doing a whole lot of work but not me i think 
Bed015.C.dialogueact582	1281.61	1282.1	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	so somebody's going to have to be doing a whole 
Bed015.C.dialogueact583	1285.17	1286.01	C	Professor	s^na	-1	0	i think that's right oh i yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact584	1286.65	1290.0	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	oh i yeah i i think that's not because i i don't think 
Bed015.C.dialogueact585	1290.75	1291.86	C	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	i don't think it's completely right i mean 
Bed015.C.dialogueact586	1291.86	1298.81	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it's completely right i mean in fact offends examples you gave int did constrain demeaning about the form 
Bed015.C.dialogueact587	1298.81	1300.32	C	Professor	s	-1	0	about the form did constrain demeaning 
Bed015.E.dialogueact588	1300.76	1301.05	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	and so 
Bed015.C.dialogueact589	1301.36	1305.96	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	and so um it isn't or sure but like 
Bed015.E.dialogueact590	1305.49	1309.73	E	Grad	s^bk|qh^df	-1	0	or sure but like what what was the point of saying that since about nixon in france 
Bed015.E.dialogueact591	1310.1	1313.68	E	Grad	s	-1	0	that is not there's nothing about that in uh in the sense really that's okay we usually don't 
Bed015.F.dialogueact592	1312.95	1313.37	F	Grad	s^bd	-1	0	in uh in the sense really that's okay we usually don't 
Bed015.F.dialogueact593	1313.37	1315.74	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	really okay we usually don't of point of at all but we know 
Bed015.E.dialogueact594	1314.63	1314.91	E	Grad	b	-1	0	of point of 
Bed015.F.dialogueact595	1315.74	1317.53	F	Grad	s	-1	0	at all but we know what it's trying to say what we know what 
Bed015.C.dialogueact598	1317.79	1318.09	C	Professor	b	-1	0	to say what we know what it what medication 
Bed015.E.dialogueact597	1317.74	1318.23	E	Grad	b	-1	0	to say what we know what it what medication 
Bed015.F.dialogueact596	1317.53	1319.76	F	Grad	s	-1	0	but to say what we know what it what medication setting up that's 
Bed015.C.dialogueact599	1319.69	1321.35	C	Professor	s^na	-1	0	but but bottom line i agree with you that we that setting up that's all 
Bed015.E.dialogueact600	1319.7	1319.88	E	Grad	b	-1	0	but setting up that's 
Bed015.F.dialogueact601	1319.81	1320.24	F	Grad	s^bd	-1	0	but but bottom line i agree setting up that's all 
Bed015.C.dialogueact603	1321.35	1326.17	C	Professor	s^e.%-	+1	0	with you that we that we not expecting much out of the purely linguistic use 
Bed015.E.dialogueact602	1321.04	1321.44	E	Grad	b	-1	0	with you that we that 
Bed015.F.dialogueact604	1326.0	1327.37	F	Grad	s^2|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	stupid early linguistic use right 
Bed015.C.dialogueact605	1326.99	1328.93	C	Professor	s^m^na|s^aa	+1	0	stupid early fourties yeah linguistic use right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact606	1327.37	1327.64	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	stupid early right 
Bed015.C.dialogueact608	1329.26	1333.99	C	Professor	fh|s^bd	-1	0	and um when you're you're the linguist but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact607	1328.82	1329.09	F	Grad	b	-1	0	fourties yeah and um 
Bed015.C.dialogueact609	1333.99	1340.69	C	Professor	s	-1	0	linguist but uh it seems to me that the these we we you know we've talked about maybe half a dozen linguistics feces in the last two minutes or something i mean yeah 
Bed015.E.dialogueact610	1339.8	1340.86	E	Grad	b	-1	0	in the last two minutes or something i mean yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact611	1340.76	1341.12	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	or something i mean yeah 
Bed015.E.dialogueact612	1342.16	1342.39	E	Grad	b	-1	0	i yeah oh yeah 
Bed015.E.dialogueact613	1342.39	1342.68	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	i yeah oh yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact614	1342.9	1352.82	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i i mean it's my feeling that that these really hard problems that decide exactly what what's going on yeah oh yeah 
Bed015.E.dialogueact615	1344.53	1344.92	E	Grad	b	-1	0	feeling that that 
Bed015.E.dialogueact616	1347.84	1348.05	E	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed015.E.dialogueact617	1352.92	1353.14	E	Grad	b	-1	0	what's going on 
Bed015.C.dialogueact618	1354.49	1354.83	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed015.F.dialogueact619	1355.67	1362.71	F	Grad	fg|s^t^tc:s	+1	0	right right okay so um one other thing i just want to point out is a lot of confusion about the terms like profile designate focus that are that are 
Bed015.C.dialogueact621	1362.5	1363.18	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right right that are that are um for now 
Bed015.E.dialogueact620	1362.18	1362.53	E	Grad	b	-1	0	right right that are that are 
Bed015.F.dialogueact622	1363.23	1366.16	F	Grad	s.%--	+1	0	um for now i am going to say like profiles often music to use that kind 
Bed015.F.dialogueact623	1366.16	1367.86	F	Grad	s	-1	0	to use that kind of line immediately 
Bed015.F.dialogueact624	1368.24	1373.49	F	Grad	s	+1	0	one is in the traditional like semantic highlight of one element would expect everything else so high pot news 
Bed015.F.dialogueact625	1373.49	1378.23	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	else so high pot news you profiled this guy against the background of their rights rectangle okay and 
Bed015.E.dialogueact626	1376.61	1376.98	E	Grad	b	-1	0	the background of their 
Bed015.F.dialogueact627	1378.23	1378.47	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact628	1378.93	1381.01	F	Grad	s	+1	0	okay and the second use um is the same as slightly different no 
Bed015.F.dialogueact629	1381.01	1381.81	F	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	slightly different no 
Bed015.F.dialogueact630	1382.04	1383.27	F	Grad	s	-1	0	i was asking talk about this they use it really 
Bed015.F.dialogueact631	1383.52	1389.62	F	Grad	s	+1	0	this they use it really mean um this in a frame this is the profile dom and these other ones are required so they have 
Bed015.F.dialogueact632	1389.8	1392.82	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so they have to be there or expressed in some way 
Bed015.F.dialogueact633	1393.06	1395.83	F	Grad	s	-1	0	which which uh nothing one two me too exclusive but they're 
Bed015.F.dialogueact634	1395.83	1397.77	F	Grad	s	-1	0	right me too exclusive but they're they're different meanings 
Bed015.C.dialogueact635	1396.72	1397.0	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	right they're different meanings 
Bed015.E.dialogueact636	1397.19	1397.54	E	Grad	b	-1	0	meanings 
Bed015.F.dialogueact637	1398.11	1399.02	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so the closest thing so i was thinking about how 
Bed015.F.dialogueact638	1399.02	1401.35	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so i was thinking about how it relates to this temptation for 
Bed015.F.dialogueact639	1401.86	1403.07	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	for us um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact640	1404.57	1405.69	F	Grad	fg|qw^t1.%--	-1	0	okay so how is it so designate 
Bed015.C.dialogueact642	1405.88	1407.65	C	Professor	qy.%-	-1	0	what they mean in in how is it so designate 
Bed015.F.dialogueact641	1405.75	1406.61	F	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	what they mean how is it so designate 
Bed015.C.dialogueact644	1408.34	1408.69	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	that i didn't freenet yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact645	1408.79	1409.49	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	that i didn't know that freenet yeah yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact643	1408.3	1408.67	F	Grad	qy^2^bu^d	-1	0	that i didn't freenet yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact646	1408.82	1409.95	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	that i didn't know that freenet yeah yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact647	1410.16	1412.44	F	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	i i mean i i was a little bit surprise that i knew that 
Bed015.C.dialogueact649	1412.52	1413.06	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	that i knew that i thought that that would be something 
Bed015.F.dialogueact648	1412.44	1412.87	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	that i knew that 
Bed015.F.dialogueact650	1413.19	1414.55	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i thought that that would be something like 
Bed015.F.dialogueact651	1415.26	1417.29	F	Grad	s	-1	0	right okay there's another term that i've heard for that thing but they i mean 
Bed015.C.dialogueact652	1416.97	1418.07	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	right okay i've heard for that thing but they i mean i well at least i'm 
Bed015.F.dialogueact653	1417.44	1419.89	F	Grad	s	-1	0	okay but they i mean i well at least i'm so they use it that way and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact654	1419.89	1420.08	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	well check so they use it that way and may maybe 
Bed015.C.dialogueact655	1420.46	1421.14	C	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	well check may maybe he's anyway 
Bed015.F.dialogueact656	1420.63	1421.51	F	Grad	s	-1	0	well check may maybe he's anyway 
Bed015.F.dialogueact657	1421.75	1422.77	F	Grad	fg	-1	0	he's anyway so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact658	1423.18	1430.3	F	Grad	s^tc|qy^d^f^g	+1	0	right i think uh the designate that we have in terms of meaning is really the highlight this thing with respect everything else okay so this is what what 
Bed015.C.dialogueact659	1429.99	1430.24	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	right everything else okay so this is what what 
Bed015.F.dialogueact660	1430.3	1431.57	F	Grad	s	-1	0	okay so this is what what i mean but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact661	1431.91	1434.59	F	Grad	s	+1	0	i mean but the second one seems to be useful that we might 
Bed015.F.dialogueact662	1434.59	1436.02	F	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	useful that we might not needed an occasion for we don't have an audition for 
Bed015.F.dialogueact663	1436.02	1437.12	F	Grad	s	-1	0	don't have an audition for it but we might want 
Bed015.F.dialogueact664	1437.51	1438.54	F	Grad	s	-1	0	it but we might want one so for example 
Bed015.F.dialogueact665	1438.54	1443.09	F	Grad	s:s	-1	0	one so for example we've talked about if you're talking about the electrical item walk you know it's an action 
Bed015.F.dialogueact666	1443.4	1444.27	F	Grad	s	-1	0	you know it's an action well it 
Bed015.F.dialogueact667	1444.48	1448.6	F	Grad	s	-1	0	well it also has this idea carried along with the the idea of an actor somebody 
Bed015.F.dialogueact668	1448.64	1449.73	F	Grad	s	-1	0	an actor somebody can do walking or 
Bed015.F.dialogueact669	1449.94	1455.08	F	Grad	s:s	-1	0	can do walking or if you talk about the magic of red carries on the idea of the thing that has a property of having color red so we 
Bed015.F.dialogueact670	1455.51	1458.15	F	Grad	s^rt:s	-1	0	right so we used to use an efficient with for this and i think that's closer 
Bed015.C.dialogueact672	1458.4	1458.65	C	Professor	b	-1	0	right and i think that's closer 
Bed015.F.dialogueact671	1458.14	1459.64	F	Grad	s	-1	0	right and i think that's closer to the second one so i'd 
Bed015.F.dialogueact673	1459.63	1462.65	F	Grad	s	+1	0	to the second one so i'd don't get no i've no commitment as to whether we need it it might be 
Bed015.F.dialogueact674	1462.64	1463.24	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	we need it it might be kind of thing 
Bed015.F.dialogueact675	1463.55	1467.83	F	Grad	s^cs^rt.%--	-1	0	kind of thing that uh parse or you might want to think about whether we require you know these 
Bed015.F.dialogueact676	1467.83	1471.21	F	Grad	s	-1	0	no no it it correctly require you know these things are like it's a magically part of it 
Bed015.C.dialogueact677	1470.06	1470.71	C	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	no no it part of it 
Bed015.C.dialogueact678	1470.71	1473.8	C	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	no no it it correctly they're not required sin practically part of it 
Bed015.C.dialogueact679	1474.04	1477.07	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	off and the priest increase up to supposed and all that sort of stuff right right right yeah um definitely 
Bed015.F.dialogueact680	1474.5	1474.82	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	off and the priest increase right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact681	1475.42	1478.26	F	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	up to supposed and all that sort of stuff right right yeah um definitely so um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact682	1478.26	1478.91	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact683	1479.32	1480.3	F	Grad	s:s	-1	0	in was a good example of you walk in 
Bed015.F.dialogueact684	1480.3	1483.03	F	Grad	qh^df^e	-1	0	of you walk in like well in what you know like is it that it 
Bed015.C.dialogueact686	1483.35	1483.69	C	Professor	s^aa|%-	-1	0	know like is it that it 
Bed015.F.dialogueact685	1483.03	1485.55	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	know like is it that it was only semantic lee is it it is 
Bed015.F.dialogueact687	1485.84	1488.24	F	Grad	s	-1	0	right lee is it it is still required to say bye simulation time though to have some 
Bed015.C.dialogueact689	1488.34	1488.61	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right though to have some 
Bed015.F.dialogueact688	1488.24	1489.28	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	right though to have some toast that i'd meant 
Bed015.F.dialogueact690	1489.28	1493.88	F	Grad	s	-1	0	toast that i'd meant the idea of like that this many values filled in by symptom is i don't 
Bed015.F.dialogueact691	1493.88	1497.79	F	Grad	s^no^rt	-1	0	by symptom is i don't know that something we need to state it's like say ever as part of the requirement for the 
Bed015.F.dialogueact692	1497.79	1498.44	F	Grad	s^bsc^rt	-1	0	part of the requirement for the construction or not what will 
Bed015.F.dialogueact693	1498.5	1498.73	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	construction or not what will 
Bed015.F.dialogueact694	1498.82	1500.6	F	Grad	s	-1	0	or i mean or construction or not what will again differ 
Bed015.C.dialogueact695	1500.39	1502.46	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	or i mean or or uh so again differ how they 
Bed015.C.dialogueact696	1502.73	1502.96	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	uh so how they 
Bed015.F.dialogueact697	1502.8	1503.53	F	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	uh so yeah how they can through that it 
Bed015.C.dialogueact699	1503.73	1504.69	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah yeah can through that it point 
Bed015.F.dialogueact698	1503.67	1504.27	F	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	yeah yeah can through that it point 
Bed015.F.dialogueact700	1504.56	1505.44	F	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah point of robert whenever 
Bed015.F.dialogueact701	1505.89	1507.7	F	Grad	s	-1	0	this of robert whenever i'm confuses of him you don't 
Bed015.C.dialogueact702	1507.01	1507.3	C	Professor	s^aa^j	-1	0	this him you don't 
Bed015.C.dialogueact704	1507.73	1508.7	C	Professor	s^j|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	this is this is him you don't 
Bed015.F.dialogueact703	1507.7	1508.15	F	Grad	s	-1	0	this is this is him you don't 
Bed015.C.dialogueact706	1509.23	1509.52	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	right right okay 
Bed015.F.dialogueact705	1509.16	1509.59	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right right okay 
Bed015.C.dialogueact707	1510.05	1512.11	C	Professor	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	yeah but this is going to be a you're right that's a bit of a mess 
Bed015.C.dialogueact708	1512.11	1513.31	C	Professor	s	-1	0	right that's a bit of a mess and we still have emphasis 
Bed015.C.dialogueact709	1513.31	1516.45	C	Professor	s	+1	0	and we still have emphasis as well or stress or whatever okay well we'll get 
Bed015.F.dialogueact710	1516.0	1519.7	F	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	or whatever great okay well we'll get the i we have thought about those as well um 
Bed015.C.dialogueact711	1517.49	1517.78	C	Professor	b	-1	0	the i we have thought 
Bed015.C.dialogueact712	1518.76	1519.03	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	great about those as well um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact713	1519.77	1520.32	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	well um the 
Bed015.F.dialogueact714	1520.96	1522.01	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	the i i would just some of this is just like 
Bed015.F.dialogueact715	1522.13	1524.73	F	Grad	s	-1	0	some of this is just like my you know by i'm going to say 
Bed015.F.dialogueact716	1524.73	1526.26	F	Grad	s	-1	0	know by i'm going to say this and how we use these terms don't you know the lots 
Bed015.F.dialogueact717	1526.26	1528.98	F	Grad	s	-1	0	that that's fine terms don't you know the lots of different ways of the world that people use it 
Bed015.C.dialogueact719	1527.1	1527.81	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	that that's fine of different ways of the 
Bed015.E.dialogueact718	1526.92	1527.12	E	Grad	b	-1	0	that that's fine terms don't you know the lots of different ways of the 
Bed015.F.dialogueact720	1529.43	1533.8	F	Grad	s	+1	0	i think that um the other times i related are like focus and stress 
Bed015.C.dialogueact722	1534.04	1534.5	C	Professor	b	-1	0	suits i 
Bed015.F.dialogueact721	1534.02	1534.39	F	Grad	%--	-1	0	suits i 
Bed015.F.dialogueact723	1534.99	1540.4	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	suits i think that the way i we would like to think back i think is focus is something that comes up in i mean lots of bases 
Bed015.F.dialogueact724	1540.73	1541.98	F	Grad	s	-1	0	of bases information structure 
Bed015.C.dialogueact726	1542.41	1542.8	C	Professor	b	-1	0	okay it's like it's 
Bed015.F.dialogueact725	1542.22	1548.62	F	Grad	s	+1	1	okay it's like it's it's not it might be that there's a some tactic uh device that used to indicate focus towards that 
Bed015.F.dialogueact727	1548.62	1550.78	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	focus towards that there are things like you know i think 
Bed015.F.dialogueact728	1550.78	1554.78	F	Grad	s	-1	0	you know i think he's a only things toward the end of sentence post verbal tend to be the focused book some of the new 
Bed015.E.dialogueact729	1554.46	1554.83	E	Grad	b	-1	0	book some of the new 
Bed015.F.dialogueact730	1554.78	1555.81	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	book some of the new information you know 
Bed015.F.dialogueact731	1555.81	1561.67	F	Grad	s:s	-1	0	information you know fight you know i walked into the room you tend to think that whatever into the room is sort of like the more focus kind of thing and when you 
Bed015.E.dialogueact732	1556.36	1556.71	E	Grad	b	-1	0	fight you know i walked 
Bed015.E.dialogueact733	1558.28	1558.49	E	Grad	b	-1	0	tend to think that whatever 
Bed015.F.dialogueact734	1561.67	1572.14	F	Grad	s	-1	0	kind of thing and when you uh but you have stress on something that might be you know a cute that the stressed element or friends of the negated element is kind of related information structure so that's like the 
Bed015.F.dialogueact735	1572.14	1576.36	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so that's like the new the sort of like import or whatever of of this thing it's okay so i 
Bed015.F.dialogueact736	1576.43	1581.17	F	Grad	s	+1	1	thing it's okay so i think that's kind of nice to keep focused being in information structure term stress 
Bed015.F.dialogueact737	1581.76	1582.35	F	Grad	%--	-1	0	stress i did and then there 
Bed015.F.dialogueact738	1582.35	1584.54	F	Grad	s	-1	0	i did and then there are different kinds of focus you can bring to it so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact739	1584.76	1591.81	F	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	bring to it so um like stress that this is kind of a pun on you might have like whatever like um accent kind of stress and 
Bed015.E.dialogueact740	1591.97	1592.37	E	Grad	b	-1	0	kind of stress and that's just the 
Bed015.F.dialogueact741	1592.02	1592.84	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	that's just the 
Bed015.F.dialogueact742	1593.28	1596.18	F	Grad	s	+1	0	i and we what wanting to stress as a form device you know like oh 
Bed015.F.dialogueact743	1596.34	1598.67	F	Grad	s^e	+1	0	you know like oh high volume or whatever um 
Bed015.E.dialogueact744	1598.63	1598.84	E	Grad	b	-1	0	whatever um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact745	1598.92	1599.25	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	whatever um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact746	1600.15	1602.38	F	Grad	s	-1	0	uh and to see was that from it's a fact which is oh 
Bed015.F.dialogueact747	1602.38	1608.41	F	Grad	s:s|s^f	-1	0	which is oh that kind of focus we have is were emphasizing the value often as opposed to other values right so focused as 
Bed015.F.dialogueact748	1608.41	1609.86	F	Grad	s	-1	0	right so focused as along the scope 
Bed015.F.dialogueact749	1610.1	1615.0	F	Grad	s	+1	0	like if you're going to focus on this thing and you want to know it sort of evil all the other possibly that it wasn't um so 
Bed015.E.dialogueact751	1615.67	1615.92	E	Grad	b	-1	0	um so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact750	1615.4	1620.05	F	Grad	s:qy^rt	-1	0	um so my classic my now classic example saying oh he did go to the meeting that was my way 
Bed015.E.dialogueact752	1620.1	1620.43	E	Grad	b	-1	0	that was my way 
Bed015.F.dialogueact753	1620.27	1623.96	F	Grad	s^rt:qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	that was my way of saying as opposed to you know he didn't order was it meeting i 
Bed015.E.dialogueact755	1624.1	1624.45	E	Grad	b	-1	0	think that was a couple of 
Bed015.F.dialogueact754	1623.96	1627.2	F	Grad	s	-1	0	order was it meeting i think that was a couple of caught him by the link was immediately and so um 
Bed015.E.dialogueact756	1625.48	1625.69	E	Grad	b	-1	0	caught 
Bed015.F.dialogueact757	1627.2	1630.28	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and so um the like if you said he you know all these different 
Bed015.F.dialogueact758	1630.28	1635.8	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	you know all these different things that if you put stress on different part of it then you're focusing we're on the right 
Bed015.E.dialogueact759	1634.94	1635.21	E	Grad	b	-1	0	focusing we're on the right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact760	1636.11	1637.95	F	Grad	s:s	-1	0	he walked to the meaning of the poster he ran 
Bed015.F.dialogueact761	1638.3	1641.02	F	Grad	s:s|s^f	-1	0	or he did watch it the meaning of the pows he didn't walk you know so 
Bed015.E.dialogueact762	1640.97	1641.28	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	didn't walk you know so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact763	1641.02	1643.72	F	Grad	s^cs	+1	0	so we need to have a notation for that which 
Bed015.F.dialogueact764	1643.72	1644.77	F	Grad	%--	-1	0	for that which um i think 
Bed015.F.dialogueact765	1644.89	1646.06	F	Grad	s	+1	2	um i think that still in progress of this sort of them's still 
Bed015.F.dialogueact766	1646.06	1647.81	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	of this sort of them's still working it out 
Bed015.F.dialogueact767	1648.29	1658.38	F	Grad	s	+1	1	but it did one one implication tougher for have for the other side forget in a minute is that i couldn't think of a good way to say cure are the possible things that you could focus on because it seems like 
Bed015.F.dialogueact768	1658.38	1667.98	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	on because it seems like any entity in any sentence you or any meaning component of anything you know all the puzzle means you could have any of them could be the subject of focus 
Bed015.C.dialogueact769	1664.58	1665.0	C	Professor	b	-1	0	you know all the puzzle means you could have 
Bed015.F.dialogueact770	1668.28	1671.1	F	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	but i think what's the one thing you can't it i just kind of focus for differences you 
Bed015.F.dialogueact771	1671.1	1677.5	F	Grad	s|s^f	-1	0	differences you could say it's the depends on this as opposed to um the the action okay or it's but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact772	1677.5	1680.5	F	Grad	s	-1	0	okay or it's but it's identity thing or contrast with other things or 
Bed015.F.dialogueact773	1680.99	1683.04	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	things or stresses value as opposed to other things so um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact774	1683.04	1684.02	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	so um it 
Bed015.F.dialogueact775	1685.07	1689.3	F	Grad	s	-1	0	it is kind of like a profile profile background thing but i 
Bed015.F.dialogueact776	1689.3	1695.98	F	Grad	s.%--	+1	1	light up with so but i i can't think of like a limited set of possible meanings that you would that you would focus light 
Bed015.E.dialogueact777	1695.43	1696.36	E	Grad	s^2|s^aa	+1	0	light up with so focus light up a highlight 
Bed015.F.dialogueact778	1696.06	1697.01	F	Grad	s^m^na	-1	0	up a highlight as opposed to 
Bed015.F.dialogueact779	1697.54	1698.55	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	as opposed to other one so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact780	1698.55	1703.94	F	Grad	s	-1	0	other one so it has some certain complications for the uh um later on like 
Bed015.F.dialogueact781	1703.94	1708.43	F	Grad	s	+1	0	later on like i mean the the best thing i call was that information structure have a list of folks element for instance 
Bed015.F.dialogueact782	1708.43	1711.85	F	Grad	s	-1	0	element for instance you well one to other type of threat missions aquarium and so that's 
Bed015.F.dialogueact783	1711.85	1716.44	F	Grad	s:qw	-1	0	aquarium and so that's probably relevant for the like where is you know the castle kind of thing because 
Bed015.E.dialogueact784	1715.98	1716.4	E	Grad	b	-1	0	the castle kind of thing because 
Bed015.F.dialogueact785	1716.44	1729.19	F	Grad	s^df:s^no	-1	0	of thing because you might want to say that um location or some certain w. h. words bring sort of automatically focus in uh you know i don't know the identity of this thing kind of way on certain elements so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact786	1729.19	1729.38	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact787	1730.3	1736.85	F	Grad	fg|s^rt	-1	0	okay anyway so that's the only there that there are many more things that are on this is like a little bit on television but it's 
Bed015.F.dialogueact788	1736.85	1739.82	F	Grad	s	-1	0	television but it's most i think it's this is you know the current current form other things 
Bed015.F.dialogueact789	1739.82	1743.68	F	Grad	s.%--	+1	1	oh current form other things we didn't totally deal with um well 
Bed015.E.dialogueact791	1743.89	1744.73	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	oh there's like well we a lot of other stuff 
Bed015.F.dialogueact790	1743.79	1747.99	F	Grad	s	+1	1	oh there's like well we a lot of other stuff that keeps and i've been working on terms of like how you deal with like an adjective 
Bed015.E.dialogueact792	1746.41	1746.61	E	Grad	b	-1	0	terms of like how you 
Bed015.F.dialogueact793	1748.14	1750.1	F	Grad	s	+1	1	you know in a nominal expression and um 
Bed015.E.dialogueact795	1750.36	1750.72	E	Grad	b	-1	0	and um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact794	1750.1	1750.92	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact796	1751.62	1753.1	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	we we should put example in this we could do that 
Bed015.F.dialogueact797	1753.1	1754.43	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	we could do that later but i think 
Bed015.E.dialogueact798	1753.82	1754.17	E	Grad	b	-1	0	we could do that later but i think 
Bed015.F.dialogueact799	1754.69	1758.23	F	Grad	s	-1	0	later but i think the note inherently like the general principle still work though that um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact800	1758.23	1765.95	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	though that um we could have constructions that have sort of constituent structure and that there is like you know for instance one 
Bed015.F.dialogueact801	1766.43	1768.45	F	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	uh you know they they have constituents right that you can like 
Bed015.F.dialogueact802	1768.45	1770.47	F	Grad	s	+1	0	right that you can like messed things when you need to but they can 
Bed015.F.dialogueact803	1770.78	1773.08	F	Grad	s	+1	0	to but they can also overlap minnesota fighter way so if you have like 
Bed015.F.dialogueact804	1773.31	1777.14	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so if you have like a lot of grammar trees and like this this might you know be a little so opaque but you know 
Bed015.F.dialogueact805	1777.14	1784.31	F	Grad	s	+1	1	but you know we have the properties of the pentagon verse and some properties of constituents constituent base grammar so that's 
Bed015.F.dialogueact806	1784.31	1786.79	F	Grad	s	-1	0	grammar so that's i think that's the main thing we want to and so 
Bed015.E.dialogueact807	1786.42	1786.68	E	Grad	b	-1	0	we want to and so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact808	1786.79	1788.42	F	Grad	s	-1	0	we want to and so far it's worked out okay them 
Bed015.C.dialogueact809	1788.56	1788.68	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	them

Bed015.A.dialogueact844	1854.8	1855.37	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	it's absurd it's 
Bed015.A.dialogueact845	1855.98	1856.77	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	it's complicated 
Bed015.F.dialogueact846	1856.17	1856.54	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	complicated 
Bed015.A.dialogueact848	1857.2	1857.71	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	and all yeah i mean i i believe yeah 
Bed015.E.dialogueact847	1857.15	1866.02	E	Grad	fg|s^cs	-1	0	and all yeah i mean i i'm sort of inclined to say let's worry about specify in the information structure focus of the sentence and then i believe yeah ways 
Bed015.F.dialogueact849	1857.43	1858.15	F	Grad	s^na|s^bk	-1	0	and all yeah i mean i i'm sort of inclined i believe yeah 
Bed015.E.dialogueact851	1866.02	1866.69	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	and then ways 
Bed015.F.dialogueact850	1865.64	1865.98	F	Grad	b	-1	0	of the sentence 
Bed015.F.dialogueact852	1867.01	1869.76	F	Grad	s^2.%--	-1	0	the fun knowledge e. component can handle that you can get it come from right 
Bed015.E.dialogueact853	1867.99	1872.92	E	Grad	s	-1	0	the fun knowledge e. component can handle actually assigning an intonation contour of that you that you can get it come from right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact854	1869.76	1870.04	F	Grad	b	-1	0	can handle actually assigning right 
Bed015.E.dialogueact855	1872.92	1875.58	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	or map from the country of that you know i mean later on we'll worry about exactly how 
Bed015.A.dialogueact856	1874.68	1878.69	A	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	or map from the country to to what the force accident is on we'll worry about exactly how exactly to figure out 
Bed015.E.dialogueact857	1876.27	1876.84	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	to to what 
Bed015.E.dialogueact859	1877.84	1878.34	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	the force accident is exactly to figure out 
Bed015.F.dialogueact858	1877.52	1877.86	F	Grad	b	-1	0	the force accident exactly 
Bed015.E.dialogueact860	1878.58	1879.49	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	is to figure out how that 
Bed015.A.dialogueact862	1880.37	1886.39	A	Grad	s	-1	0	but uh if you don't know what your what your focus is then you're you're hopeless uh the last anyways and that's fine yeah 
Bed015.E.dialogueact861	1880.2	1880.43	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	but uh if you don't 
Bed015.F.dialogueact863	1881.87	1882.0	F	Grad	b	-1	0	know what your what your focus is then 
Bed015.F.dialogueact864	1883.34	1883.89	F	Grad	s^ba|s^bk	-1	0	you're you're that's fine yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact865	1885.13	1885.48	F	Grad	b	-1	0	the last anyways 
Bed015.A.dialogueact866	1886.77	1901.92	A	Grad	s	+1	0	and the only way of figuring out what that is man is um my sort of generating all the possible alternatives to each focused on them and just decide which one in that context makes sense in which one doesn't 
Bed015.F.dialogueact867	1890.11	1890.25	F	Grad	b	-1	0	is 
Bed015.A.dialogueact868	1902.34	1903.97	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and then you're left with a couple three 
Bed015.A.dialogueact870	1904.82	1909.02	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so you know again that's something that she she was can do um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact869	1904.81	1905.19	F	Grad	b	-1	0	so 
Bed015.A.dialogueact871	1909.4	1914.85	A	Grad	s	-1	0	um but parts that the scope of any anything so 
Bed015.A.dialogueact872	1914.91	1915.31	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	anything so 
Bed015.A.dialogueact873	1917.11	1917.28	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed015.A.dialogueact874	1917.76	1917.85	A	Grad	%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed015.F.dialogueact875	1918.42	1923.49	F	Grad	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	okay well oh yeah i would assume that it's it's easy problem an absence of all that you need all the other 
Bed015.A.dialogueact876	1919.03	1920.19	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	well oh yeah i would assume that it's it's 
Bed015.F.dialogueact877	1923.49	1925.04	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	but it's it's what it of all that you need all the other information i guess 
Bed015.A.dialogueact878	1924.65	1928.41	A	Grad	s	-1	0	but it's it's what it well it's pretty easy to put it in the fall isn't though i mean because information i guess yeah 
Bed015.A.dialogueact879	1928.41	1929.27	A	Grad	s^df.%-	-1	0	though i mean because you yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact880	1928.89	1929.08	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	though i mean because you yeah 
Bed015.A.dialogueact881	1930.03	1936.89	A	Grad	s	-1	0	can just say whatever stuff it's the container be focused or the the entire whatever bulletins on 
Bed015.F.dialogueact882	1935.96	1937.13	F	Grad	b	-1	0	whatever bulletins on 
Bed015.E.dialogueact883	1936.71	1936.88	E	Grad	b	-1	0	on 
Bed015.F.dialogueact884	1938.71	1942.62	F	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah so but i think yeah exactly so the through effective it is something we want to build a capture 
Bed015.C.dialogueact885	1941.67	1943.46	C	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	yeah so but i think the i'm not sure i understand is something we want to build a capture 
Bed015.C.dialogueact886	1943.46	1944.34	C	Professor	s^bd^df^no	-1	0	the i'm not sure i understand but here's what i 
Bed015.C.dialogueact887	1944.34	1946.08	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but here's what i think is going on that if we do 
Bed015.C.dialogueact888	1946.08	1956.84	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that if we do the constructions right way in particular construction matches it the fact that it matches does in fact specify focus 
Bed015.F.dialogueact889	1957.79	1959.01	F	Grad	%--	-1	0	uh 
Bed015.F.dialogueact890	1960.9	1961.81	F	Grad	s^no	-1	0	okay i'm not sure about that or it 
Bed015.C.dialogueact892	1961.9	1962.55	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay not sure about that or it may live it's 
Bed015.F.dialogueact891	1961.81	1965.75	F	Grad	s	-1	0	okay you it's at the very least not sure about that or it may live it's certainly constraints the possibilities for because i think that's 
Bed015.C.dialogueact893	1964.25	1966.35	C	Professor	s^na.%-	-1	0	you it's at the very least i the possibilities for because i think that's that's the that's certainly 
Bed015.F.dialogueact894	1965.75	1967.53	F	Grad	s	-1	0	at the very least i for because i think that's that's the that's certainly true 
Bed015.F.dialogueact895	1968.13	1971.46	F	Grad	s^bu|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	oh i for sure yeah yes they're working and depending on the construction may or may not justify the focus right 
Bed015.C.dialogueact896	1970.25	1971.44	C	Professor	s^na|s^aa	-1	0	oh i for sure yeah yes they're working justify the focus right 
Bed015.C.dialogueact897	1971.44	1978.87	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah yes they're working yes not every but there are constructions uh where you could actually take into account those considerations right yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact898	1972.96	1973.22	F	Grad	b	-1	0	yes not every but there are constructions yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact899	1977.46	1977.82	F	Grad	b	-1	0	those considerations 
Bed015.C.dialogueact900	1979.39	1983.66	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that you need to take into account in order to decide which what is being focused 
Bed015.F.dialogueact901	1980.4	1980.77	F	Grad	b	-1	0	into account in order to 
Bed015.A.dialogueact902	1981.95	1982.22	A	Grad	b	-1	0	decide which what is being 
Bed015.A.dialogueact903	1984.49	1987.55	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so we talked about that delivered this morning 
Bed015.A.dialogueact904	1988.69	1989.76	A	Grad	s:s	-1	0	john is on the bus 
Bed015.A.dialogueact906	1990.63	1991.62	A	Grad	s:s	-1	0	nothing fancy 
Bed015.F.dialogueact905	1990.26	1990.55	F	Grad	b	-1	0	nothing 
Bed015.A.dialogueact908	1992.27	1993.92	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so that's focuses on on 
Bed015.C.dialogueact909	1992.34	1992.57	C	Professor	b	-1	0	so that's 
Bed015.F.dialogueact907	1992.25	1992.42	F	Grad	b	-1	0	so that's 
Bed015.A.dialogueact910	1994.37	1997.12	A	Grad	s:s	-1	0	john is on the bus and not on the train on this on 
Bed015.F.dialogueact911	1997.09	1997.28	F	Grad	b	-1	0	on this on 
Bed015.A.dialogueact913	1997.73	2000.21	A	Grad	s:s	-1	0	on this on the bus versus on this on the train and john right 
Bed015.C.dialogueact912	1997.46	1997.72	C	Professor	b	-1	0	on this on 
Bed015.F.dialogueact914	1999.27	1999.49	F	Grad	b	-1	0	on this on the train right 
Bed015.A.dialogueact915	2000.21	2003.55	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	and john is on the bus versus plus and he our son is on the bus 
Bed015.F.dialogueact916	2001.33	2001.67	F	Grad	s^2	-1	0	is on the bus our 
Bed015.F.dialogueact917	2002.29	2004.02	F	Grad	s^na	-1	0	versus plus and he is you say right all son is on the bus and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact919	2004.09	2004.43	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	is you say right all and 
Bed015.A.dialogueact918	2004.09	2005.42	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	is you say right all all of those yeah and right 
Bed015.C.dialogueact920	2004.17	2004.4	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	is you say right all and 
Bed015.C.dialogueact921	2004.75	2005.7	C	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	is you say right all all of those yeah and right 
Bed015.A.dialogueact924	2006.05	2006.55	A	Grad	s^m^na	-1	0	of these and 
Bed015.C.dialogueact922	2005.7	2005.87	C	Professor	b	-1	0	all of those yeah right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact923	2005.71	2005.95	F	Grad	b	-1	0	all of those yeah right 
Bed015.A.dialogueact925	2006.92	2008.84	A	Grad	qy.%--	-1	0	of these and we we have 
Bed015.A.dialogueact926	2009.06	2010.51	A	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	is it all the same constructions 
Bed015.A.dialogueact927	2011.33	2013.74	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	just a little different folk focus constituents yeah i would say that argument structure 
Bed015.F.dialogueact928	2012.04	2016.07	F	Grad	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	folk focus constituents i would say that argument structure in terms of like the main like so i don't know 
Bed015.A.dialogueact929	2016.01	2016.36	A	Grad	b	-1	0	i don't know 
Bed015.F.dialogueact930	2016.19	2016.6	F	Grad	s^no	-1	0	i don't know 
Bed015.F.dialogueact931	2017.36	2023.1	F	Grad	s	+1	0	the fact that you can get it without any stress and you have some whatever's predicated anyway should be the same a stretch that's what i'm talking about overlapping 
Bed015.F.dialogueact932	2023.1	2024.56	F	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	that's what i'm talking about overlapping section so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact933	2024.56	2030.14	F	Grad	s	+1	0	so the question is actually section so then you have a separate thing that sticks out you know stress on something relative to everything else and it 
Bed015.C.dialogueact934	2028.37	2028.8	C	Professor	b	-1	0	stress on something 
Bed015.C.dialogueact936	2030.15	2031.29	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so the question is actually cigarette and it would yeah 
Bed015.E.dialogueact935	2029.8	2030.1	E	Grad	b	-1	0	so the question is actually relative to everything else and it 
Bed015.C.dialogueact938	2031.29	2031.86	C	Professor	s^fa	-1	0	cigarette would yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact937	2030.91	2031.25	F	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	so the question is actually cigarette and it would yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact940	2031.86	2032.06	C	Professor	s^co	-1	0	cigarette would yeah and it when that 
Bed015.F.dialogueact939	2031.68	2032.04	F	Grad	b	-1	0	cigarette would yeah and it when that 
Bed015.C.dialogueact941	2032.25	2032.52	C	Professor	s^co	-1	0	and it when that 
Bed015.F.dialogueact942	2032.29	2037.71	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and it when that would have to uh it might be ambiguous as it would be that element or the phrase signed that but i still 
Bed015.F.dialogueact943	2037.71	2039.34	F	Grad	s	-1	0	phrase signed that but i still live limited possiblity so that 
Bed015.A.dialogueact944	2039.42	2039.83	A	Grad	b	-1	0	so that 
Bed015.F.dialogueact945	2039.78	2043.57	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so so that should you know track with should overlap with whatever other construction there 
Bed015.A.dialogueact946	2042.39	2042.57	A	Grad	b	-1	0	with whatever other construction 
Bed015.C.dialogueact947	2043.9	2056.42	C	Professor	qh	-1	0	so the question is do we have a way on the other page on what we get this semantics side of saying what the stressed woman was score stressed raise or something there was so that's why i was 
Bed015.F.dialogueact948	2050.07	2050.37	F	Grad	b	-1	0	what we get this semantics 
Bed015.F.dialogueact949	2056.31	2057.63	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	something was so that's why i was saying how because i couldn't 
Bed015.F.dialogueact950	2057.62	2065.14	F	Grad	s^rt	+1	0	right saying how because i couldn't think of it's easy like limited way of doing it um all i can say the information structure has a focus lot and i think that should 
Bed015.C.dialogueact951	2061.48	2061.72	C	Professor	b	-1	0	right doing it um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact952	2065.14	2067.81	F	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	so that's kind of the bottom here and i think that should be a little for two 
Bed015.C.dialogueact953	2067.01	2068.81	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that's kind of the bottom here when we get there okay two yeah and 
Bed015.C.dialogueact955	2068.81	2069.19	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	when we get there okay oh yeah and for and i don't have a 
Bed015.F.dialogueact954	2068.41	2068.92	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	when we get there okay yeah and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact956	2068.92	2071.89	F	Grad	s	-1	0	when we get there okay oh i'll white yeah and for and i don't have a i have a great way were great examples but 
Bed015.C.dialogueact957	2069.85	2070.43	C	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	oh i'll white for and i don't have a i have a great way 
Bed015.C.dialogueact959	2072.08	2072.55	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	i think that something like 
Bed015.F.dialogueact958	2071.89	2076.7	F	Grad	s	-1	0	were great examples but i think that something like that's probably going to be uh more more we have to do 
Bed015.A.dialogueact960	2076.81	2077.16	A	Grad	b	-1	0	have to do um 
Bed015.C.dialogueact962	2076.96	2077.24	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	have to do um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact961	2076.82	2078.62	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	have to do um okay that was 
Bed015.A.dialogueact963	2078.48	2078.68	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	okay that was 
Bed015.F.dialogueact964	2078.62	2079.57	F	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	okay that was one comments and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact965	2079.82	2080.99	F	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	yeah i love one comments and another one 
Bed015.A.dialogueact966	2080.76	2084.35	A	Grad	s^aa|s	+1	0	yeah i love it what you know what the focus is to everything else is background how about topical another one 
Bed015.A.dialogueact967	2084.35	2085.68	A	Grad	qh	+1	0	how about topical man that's the 
Bed015.A.dialogueact968	2085.73	2087.23	A	Grad	s	-1	0	man that's the other side of information topic comments how about what 
Bed015.F.dialogueact969	2086.8	2087.19	F	Grad	qw^br^rt	-1	0	other side of information topic comments how about what 
Bed015.A.dialogueact970	2087.42	2088.28	A	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	topic comments what yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact971	2088.52	2090.35	F	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	yeah so that was the other thing is so i didn't realize 
Bed015.F.dialogueact972	2090.35	2091.57	F	Grad	s	-1	0	other thing is so i didn't realize force like oh 
Bed015.F.dialogueact973	2091.57	2095.82	F	Grad	s:s	-1	0	force like oh disney that it's you know topic and focus our contrast that so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact974	2095.82	2096.98	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	contrast that so topic is 
Bed015.F.dialogueact975	2097.32	2101.8	F	Grad	s|qy^d^g	-1	0	topic focused it seems to me like um background profile okay or 
Bed015.F.dialogueact976	2101.8	2104.06	F	Grad	s	-1	0	okay or landmark projector or some something like that there's there's definitely 
Bed015.F.dialogueact977	2104.06	2107.72	F	Grad	s	-1	0	there's there's definitely um that kind of thing going on i don't 
Bed015.A.dialogueact978	2105.49	2105.87	A	Grad	b	-1	0	um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact979	2107.72	2109.57	F	Grad	s^no.%--	-1	0	kind of thing going on i don't know whether 
Bed015.F.dialogueact980	2110.13	2113.46	F	Grad	s	-1	0	i know i don't have as many good examples of like topic indicating constructions 
Bed015.F.dialogueact981	2114.08	2115.06	F	Grad	s^e|qy^d^g	-1	0	on like focus right um topic 
Bed015.F.dialogueact982	2115.36	2118.81	F	Grad	s	+1	0	japanese um topic seems that you know thing that might be an ongoing kind of thing 
Bed015.A.dialogueact983	2118.45	2118.82	A	Grad	b	-1	0	japanese kind of thing 
Bed015.E.dialogueact984	2118.7	2120.17	E	Grad	s	-1	0	japanese has this so you know kind of thing topic marker 
Bed015.E.dialogueact986	2120.34	2120.7	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	you know topic marker 
Bed015.F.dialogueact985	2120.24	2120.82	F	Grad	qy^bu^d	-1	0	you know topic marker 
Bed015.A.dialogueact988	2121.26	2121.46	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah that's what why 
Bed015.E.dialogueact987	2121.11	2122.62	E	Grad	s^aa|s:s	-1	0	yeah that's what why is um 
Bed015.E.dialogueact990	2122.93	2124.84	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	is um just to mark which thing is the topic it doesn't 
Bed015.F.dialogueact989	2122.72	2123.13	F	Grad	b	-1	0	is um just to mark which 
Bed015.E.dialogueact992	2124.84	2126.27	E	Grad	s	-1	0	thing is the topic it doesn't always have to be the subject right so again information 
Bed015.F.dialogueact991	2124.42	2124.74	F	Grad	b	-1	0	thing is the topic it doesn't 
Bed015.F.dialogueact993	2125.68	2126.0	F	Grad	b	-1	0	always have to be the subject right so again information 
Bed015.F.dialogueact994	2126.42	2128.26	F	Grad	s	+1	0	so again information travel talks topic lot and i stuck it in 
Bed015.F.dialogueact995	2128.26	2130.55	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and i stuck it in thinking that we might use it um 
Bed015.A.dialogueact996	2129.04	2129.51	A	Grad	b	-1	0	thinking that we might 
Bed015.F.dialogueact997	2130.95	2132.3	F	Grad	s	-1	0	yep it's there use it um i think it's a and um 
Bed015.C.dialogueact998	2132.22	2132.81	C	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	yep it's there um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact999	2132.95	2134.45	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	yep it's there um and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1000	2135.19	2142.07	F	Grad	s	+1	0	one thing that i didn't do consistently um is when we get there is like indicate what kind of things it's into every real i think i have an idea of what 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1001	2142.07	2143.42	F	Grad	s	-1	0	i think i have an idea of what should be but there 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1002	2143.42	2143.87	F	Grad	%--	-1	0	should be but there 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1003	2144.29	2149.55	F	Grad	s	-1	0	they're so far we've been getting away with like either take constraint or um you know whatever will be a frame 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1004	2149.55	2150.39	F	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	whatever will be a frame you know it'll be it'll 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1005	2150.39	2157.29	F	Grad	s	+1	0	you know it'll be it'll be another persecution or it'll be um i don't know some value from from some something some variable in scope or something like that worth watching 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1006	2157.68	2159.22	F	Grad	s	+1	0	that worth watching based on a very punk so well 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1007	2159.29	2160.44	F	Grad	fg|s^tc.%--	-1	0	so well that's too will 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1008	2160.72	2162.34	F	Grad	qy^rt^t^tc	-1	0	okay that's too will go to the other side officially keep keeping like 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1009	2161.62	2162.61	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	okay go to the other side officially keep keeping like 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1011	2162.82	2163.56	E	Grad	s^bk|s	+1	0	okay so one keep keeping like pointing for 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1010	2162.54	2164.36	F	Grad	s	-1	0	okay so one keep keeping like pointing for it too yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1012	2164.36	2164.71	F	Grad	b	-1	0	it too yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1013	2165.13	2165.85	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	yeah because accent 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1014	2167.23	2174.21	F	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	okay so this doesn't include something which make my me have some effect on on it which is um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1015	2174.21	2178.58	F	Grad	s	-1	0	it which is um the discourse situation context record right so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1016	2178.85	2180.55	F	Grad	s^f|s	-1	0	record right so i did i i meant just like draw a line and like you 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1017	2180.55	2184.78	F	Grad	s	-1	0	draw a line and like you know you also have uh some tracking of what was going on 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1018	2185.09	2185.33	C	Professor	b	-1	0	and there 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1019	2185.16	2188.72	F	Grad	s^bd	-1	0	and there was a big sell comics for it you know looking at the details of this but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1020	2189.03	2190.99	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	for instance you can imagine instead of having 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1021	2191.33	2193.61	F	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	i i changed the name of um i used to be entities so you 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1022	2193.69	2196.79	F	Grad	s	+1	2	entities so you see a scenario reference and of course i can and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1023	2197.07	2199.78	F	Grad	s	+1	0	and scenarios essentially what kind of what's the basic medication what event 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1024	2199.78	2200.73	F	Grad	s^e	+1	0	basic medication what event happened 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1025	2201.05	2209.19	F	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g^rt	+1	2	and actually is just a list of various slots from which she would draw draw in order to pay your picture bunch of frames my and findings right um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1026	2209.74	2212.06	F	Grad	s	-1	0	um and obviously there are other was are not included here general couple friends 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1027	2212.06	2215.01	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	general couple friends in general like uh uh direction you know specific scheme 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1029	2215.4	2215.8	E	Grad	b	-1	0	you know specific scheme 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1028	2215.09	2216.54	F	Grad	s	-1	0	you know specific scheme of things like whatever 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1030	2216.54	2217.05	F	Grad	s^bk|s^bd	-1	0	of things like whatever the middle 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1031	2217.89	2219.51	F	Grad	s	+1	0	the middle thing used to be entities because you can imagine 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1032	2219.51	2221.7	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	entities because you can imagine it should be like really a list where 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1033	2221.96	2224.09	F	Grad	s	-1	0	a list where here was varies information and it doesn't tend to be 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1034	2224.09	2232.1	F	Grad	s	+1	1	and it doesn't tend to be grammatical a specify able information about reference tell you about some entity that you're going to talk about so harry walked 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1035	2232.1	2233.61	F	Grad	s:s	-1	0	so harry walked into the room harry 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1036	2234.03	2235.19	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and room you know the room that but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1037	2235.19	2235.75	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	you know the room that but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1038	2235.75	2238.55	F	Grad	s	-1	0	you know the room that but they be represented this was somehow and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1039	2238.96	2241.09	F	Grad	s	-1	0	somehow and it could also have friends has a category spot um should 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1040	2241.52	2243.63	F	Grad	s	-1	0	um should be there category we're in for instance basically 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1041	2243.63	2245.87	F	Grad	s	+1	1	for instance basically could be a pointer to want all of g. 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1042	2246.12	2248.54	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so the everything you know about this could be could be time but the important 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1043	2248.54	2254.03	F	Grad	s	-1	0	be time but the important thing for grammatical purposes are for things like number gender um keep 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1044	2254.03	2257.55	F	Grad	s	-1	0	um keep the one thing could hear slightly ever true but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1045	2257.55	2260.29	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	ever true but you could imagine that um you need to figure out what if it's a group 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1046	2260.29	2263.36	F	Grad	s	-1	0	what if it's a group whether um some event is happening linear 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1047	2263.91	2265.09	F	Grad	s	-1	0	linear time than your space is like you know are are they doing 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1048	2265.09	2267.64	F	Grad	s	-1	0	like you know are are they doing something to really or is it 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1049	2267.64	2268.3	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	really or is it like um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1050	2268.75	2270.56	F	Grad	fh|s^no	-1	0	like um i i i'm i'm not sure this is 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1051	2270.56	2273.64	F	Grad	s^df	+1	0	not sure this is partly came from uh told me scheme and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1052	2273.64	2275.76	F	Grad	s	+1	0	scheme and not sure will need all these actually but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1053	2275.79	2275.9	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	these actually but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1054	2276.47	2284.84	F	Grad	s	-1	0	um and then the status i used was like again in some languages you know like four inches and child language you might distinguish between different it so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1055	2284.84	2292.21	F	Grad	s	+1	1	different it so the the the big come and then finally dispersing is about thursday jackie information surgery like utter in specific 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1056	2292.21	2294.27	F	Grad	s	+1	1	like utter in specific kinds of things so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1057	2294.78	2303.75	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so the coming i was going to make about um changing and to t. entities blocked a reference is that you can imagine your discourse like situation 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1058	2303.75	2304.57	F	Grad	s^e.%--	-1	0	discourse like situation cause you have a set 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1059	2304.57	2306.78	F	Grad	s	-1	0	cause you have a set of entities that you sort of referring to and you might 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1060	2306.78	2311.24	F	Grad	s	-1	0	of referring to and you might that might be sort of general i don't know database of all the things in this discourse you could for too and i guess 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1061	2311.55	2312.61	F	Grad	s	-1	0	too and i guess a reference because they would 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1062	2312.61	2317.44	F	Grad	s	-1	0	a reference because they would say forty particular utter is you have particular referring expressions in it and those 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1063	2317.66	2320.66	F	Grad	s	-1	0	in it and those are the ones that you get information about that used to can here friends is 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1064	2320.66	2321.92	F	Grad	s	-1	0	used to can here friends is i know it's really poor oh i know 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1065	2321.92	2323.99	F	Grad	s	-1	0	i know it's really poor oh i know it's going to be feminine or something like that 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1066	2324.25	2333.44	F	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	and and these could actually just pointed to you know the the id in my older list of active entities right so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1067	2333.44	2334.64	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	right so um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1068	2335.49	2338.92	F	Grad	s	-1	0	uh this is there's a there's all this stuff about discourse as we've talked about 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1069	2339.21	2342.82	F	Grad	s	-1	0	i was listed discourse as a fought where you could say it's active you know there's 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1070	2342.82	2350.29	F	Grad	s	-1	0	it's active you know there's is um hierarchy uh there's a scheme innovation of you know things can be active or they can be um acceptable inaccessible is the one that you 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1071	2350.24	2350.59	E	Grad	b	-1	0	is the one that you 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1072	2350.28	2353.14	F	Grad	s	-1	0	is the one that you know keep um you know those once do some of them files and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1073	2353.14	2353.67	F	Grad	s	-1	0	files and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1074	2353.97	2354.37	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	files and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1075	2355.13	2360.36	F	Grad	s	-1	0	the thing is that that i know said that um list was sort of discourse dependence like in this 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1076	2360.36	2365.9	F	Grad	s	-1	0	dependence like in this particular set else instance it has been referred to recently or haven't been

Bed015.F.dialogueact1078	2366.12	2368.95	F	Grad	s	-1	0	you know where or this is something that's like in my world knowledge but not active 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1079	2366.96	2367.31	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	or this is something that's like in my world knowledge but 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1080	2368.31	2370.89	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	you know where there seems to be context properties not active yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1081	2368.95	2369.08	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	you know where there seems to be context not active 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1083	2371.24	2371.49	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah they're kind of infringes 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1082	2370.89	2373.51	F	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	properties yeah yeah they're kind of infringes i used have a location thing there but actually 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1084	2373.51	2375.73	F	Grad	s	-1	0	thing there but actually that's a property of the situation and again 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1085	2375.73	2381.17	F	Grad	s	-1	0	well it wouldn't what this of the situation and again time you know it's a certain point things are located you know near or far from you and 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1086	2380.58	2382.8	C	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	well it wouldn't what this is free cursive person or far from you and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1087	2381.17	2381.49	F	Grad	%-	-1	0	wouldn't what this and 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1088	2382.8	2388.31	C	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	is free cursive person too we do the mental space start we're not quite sure that that wichita yeah yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1089	2384.59	2384.9	F	Grad	b	-1	0	the yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1090	2388.31	2388.83	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	that wichita yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1092	2389.15	2389.97	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	which is which is yeah so some of these 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1091	2388.73	2389.45	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	that wichita which is which is yeah yeah so some of these 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1093	2389.45	2390.86	F	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	which is which is we just yeah so some of these are not 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1094	2390.71	2391.65	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	we just don't know yet are not right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1095	2391.39	2391.69	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	don't know yet right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1096	2392.7	2399.7	F	Grad	s|qy^d^g:s	-1	0	so i so for now i thought well maybe i'll just have in this list of things are relevant to this particular utter and try everything else 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1097	2399.7	2401.41	F	Grad	s	-1	0	utter and try everything else there is uh there is specific um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1098	2401.9	2405.69	F	Grad	s	-1	0	um and i left the slot medications open 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1099	2406.09	2410.47	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because you can have um things like the guy i know from school or you know it's like 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1101	2410.48	2411.02	E	Grad	b	-1	0	or you know it's like europe or preferring expression 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1100	2410.47	2417.65	F	Grad	s	-1	0	or you know it's like europe or preferring expression might be constrained by certain i'm down to not amounts of prep you know pretty predicates that you might make 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1102	2418.11	2420.96	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and it's unclear whether i 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1103	2420.96	2425.37	F	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	unclear whether i mean you could just have in your scenarios cure some extra few things that are true right and then 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1104	2425.61	2426.02	E	Grad	b	-1	0	right and then you could just sort of not 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1105	2425.82	2428.78	F	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right and then you could just sort of not have this lot here are your 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1106	2428.78	2431.84	F	Grad	s	-1	0	are your but but if you strike education purposes so 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1109	2431.94	2432.29	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	purposes so it's it's a little different 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1108	2431.85	2432.13	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	purposes so it's it's a little different 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1107	2431.84	2436.22	F	Grad	s	-1	0	purposes so it's it's a little different from just saying all these things are true for my parents 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1110	2435.96	2436.2	E	Grad	b	-1	0	are true for my parents 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1111	2437.23	2437.63	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	right um 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1112	2437.91	2444.95	E	Grad	fg|s:s	-1	0	right this guy i know from school came for dinner does not mean um there's a guy i know him from school and um 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1113	2444.95	2446.2	E	Grad	s:s	-1	0	him from school and he came over for dinner it's not the same 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1114	2446.2	2448.03	E	Grad	s	-1	0	it's not the same effect yeah it's a little bit it's a little different right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1115	2447.3	2449.01	F	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	effect yeah it's a little bit it's a little different right so or 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1116	2449.01	2449.53	F	Grad	s^f|%--	-1	0	so or 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1117	2450.01	2452.06	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	maybe that's like they're sick not restricted you know it's like it gets 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1119	2452.47	2452.75	E	Grad	b	-1	0	you know it's like it gets 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1118	2452.06	2454.51	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	you know it's like it gets into that kind of thing for 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1120	2455.05	2461.32	F	Grad	s	-1	0	um but maybe i'm mixing you know this is kind of like the final results after person sentence so you might 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1122	2461.33	2461.69	E	Grad	b	-1	0	so you might 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1121	2461.32	2468.83	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so you might imagine that the information you passed to you know in identifying because preference would be so some you know it's a guy and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1123	2468.83	2469.94	F	Grad	s	-1	0	know it's a guy and it's someone i know from school so 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1125	2470.11	2470.29	E	Grad	b	-1	0	maybe that would 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1124	2469.94	2480.07	F	Grad	s	-1	0	it's someone i know from school so maybe that would you know the some intermediate structure that you would pass in to the to a whatever religion or whatever discourse context to find you know either create this reference in which case should be created 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1127	2480.28	2481.0	E	Grad	b	-1	0	in which case should be created here and you 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1126	2480.07	2481.36	F	Grad	s	-1	0	in which case should be created here and you 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1128	2481.36	2481.53	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	here and you 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1129	2482.02	2483.91	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	it so you can imagine that this might so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1130	2483.97	2487.59	F	Grad	s	-1	0	but this might so i uncommitted to a couple of these things um 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1131	2487.42	2491.59	A	Grad	s	-1	0	but make it this as it is in my mind that does that person so things um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1132	2487.6	2488.32	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	but make it things um 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1133	2491.97	2494.96	A	Grad	qw^rt	-1	0	that person so hollis is gender neuter 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1135	2497.26	2498.15	A	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	and we had a team or in semantic it could be in 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1134	2496.77	2498.2	F	Grad	h|s.%-	-1	0	and we had a team or in semantic um it could be in 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1136	2498.59	2499.14	A	Grad	qrr.%-	-1	0	or in semantic lee 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1137	2498.74	2499.45	C	Professor	s	-1	0	or in semantic lee 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1139	2500.43	2501.06	A	Grad	s^bk^m	-1	0	semantic medically so semantic lee yeah yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1138	2500.19	2502.0	F	Grad	s^m^na|s^aa	-1	0	semantic medically so semantic lee yeah yeah so 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1140	2501.57	2501.99	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	so yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1141	2502.69	2504.61	F	Grad	s:s	-1	0	so it a a table 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1142	2505.78	2508.15	F	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah nothing because doesn't have a gender so it 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1143	2508.15	2510.23	F	Grad	fg|s.%--	-1	0	so it could be that i mean 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1144	2511.26	2513.01	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	maybe maybe not all these i mean i would say 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1145	2513.23	2518.96	F	Grad	s	-1	0	no i mean i would say that i try to keep out here that were potentially relevant to most most things 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1146	2518.64	2525.13	A	Grad	s^ar|s	-1	0	no just make sure that we we're everybody it's going to be great that it it has nothing to do with uh form most things yeah okay that is semantic as opposed to yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1147	2520.0	2520.39	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	we we're everybody 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1148	2521.6	2523.56	F	Grad	s^bk|s.%-	-1	0	it's going to be great that it it has nothing to do with okay that is semantic as opposed to 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1149	2524.14	2526.14	F	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	uh form yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1150	2527.14	2527.68	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1152	2531.28	2537.31	A	Grad	s	-1	0	then medications makes sense to private open for something like um accessible that you know not so again open to various things 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1151	2531.15	2531.87	F	Grad	%-	-1	0	then medications so again 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1153	2534.59	2535.94	F	Grad	s^2	-1	0	something like um open to various things 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1154	2537.31	2537.37	A	Grad	b	-1	0	know not 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1155	2538.1	2538.39	F	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed015.F.dialogueact1156	2539.92	2541.4	F	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	okay so let's see so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1157	2541.4	2550.84	F	Grad	qy^rt^t^tc	+1	0	let's see so maybe having made that big skits of like large scale comment teachers go through each of these lot uh each of these blocks um a little bit 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1158	2551.74	2552.02	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1159	2552.0	2556.33	F	Grad	s	+1	1	mostly the top one is of image dramatic and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1160	2556.81	2558.85	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and just to note which 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1161	2558.85	2559.78	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	note which is that um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1162	2560.18	2562.22	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so when we actually have the differences um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1163	2562.22	2563.23	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	have the differences um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1164	2564.29	2566.8	F	Grad	s|s^f	+1	0	some of them seem more inherently static okay like 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1165	2566.8	2569.88	F	Grad	s	+1	1	okay like a container or sort of support dish 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1166	2570.3	2573.69	F	Grad	s	+1	0	and others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic like 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1167	2573.93	2575.99	F	Grad	s	+1	1	dynamic like source at school is often thought that way 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1168	2576.33	2577.65	F	Grad	s	+1	0	or force or something like that but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1169	2577.97	2583.0	F	Grad	s	-1	0	or something like that but in actual fact i think that they're intended to be sort of neutral respected and different ex chemist 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1170	2583.0	2586.91	F	Grad	s	-1	0	different ex chemist use them in a way that either static or dynamic 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1171	2587.11	2590.07	F	Grad	s	-1	0	surpassed you could just be talking about the path between this and this and you know 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1172	2589.39	2589.83	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	between this and this 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1173	2590.07	2592.24	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and you know container and you go in and out all these things and so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1174	2592.24	2592.72	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and out all these things and so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1175	2592.72	2594.0	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	and out all these things and so um i think 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1176	2594.81	2599.15	F	Grad	s	-1	0	i think this came of them but ben and i were working with the spaniards them the other day span yet 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1177	2599.4	2600.96	F	Grad	s^bsc	-1	0	span yet 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1178	2601.17	2607.57	F	Grad	s	-1	0	um to decide like how you want to split up like image medic contributions versus like x. came out of countries and how you make them 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1179	2607.57	2608.25	F	Grad	qh^e	-1	0	countries and how you make them up and i think again 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1180	2608.52	2613.47	F	Grad	s	+1	0	up and i think again um its going to be something any thing that tells you is a static or who we definitely 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1181	2613.47	2616.9	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	who we definitely need that sort of sexual type give you some of that 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1182	2617.28	2623.42	F	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	uh um that you know is it a state or is it a change of staters it um action of some kind 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1183	2624.03	2629.97	A	Grad	qy	-1	0	uh is is there any many too when you have sort of or measures spend it and when you don't yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1184	2624.29	2624.32	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	uh is is there yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1185	2624.68	2624.82	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	uh is is there yeah 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1186	2630.81	2631.2	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	just me oh you mean in the slot 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1187	2630.93	2632.34	F	Grad	s^bk|qy^bu^d	-1	0	just me oh you mean in the slot um 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1188	2632.69	2632.96	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1189	2632.73	2636.13	F	Grad	s^ar|s	-1	0	um no it's like x. it's it's it's like i was thinking of taking that the ex you know obviously 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1190	2636.13	2637.93	F	Grad	s	-1	0	the ex you know obviously a fedex came out 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1191	2638.35	2641.19	F	Grad	s	-1	0	asians i mean the the performer they're some of that depends on asking 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1192	2641.19	2642.23	F	Grad	s	-1	0	of that depends on asking my you know and i 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1193	2642.23	2644.57	F	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	so the difference my you know and i in general probably be you 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1194	2644.46	2648.1	E	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	so the difference is basically whether you thought it was obvious what possible fillers for be you yeah basically um especially 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1195	2646.9	2648.4	F	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	it was obvious what possible fillers for yeah basically um especially 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1196	2648.41	2648.82	A	Grad	b	-1	0	um especially 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1197	2648.52	2648.81	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	um especially 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1198	2648.73	2650.31	F	Grad	s^bd	-1	0	um especially i probably is an obvious question so i 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1199	2650.31	2654.7	F	Grad	s^df.%-	-1	0	question so i just neglect is becoming perspective actor under bigger observer um 
Bed015.B.dialogueact1200	2651.82	2652.53	B	Grad	b	-1	0	just neglect is becoming perspective 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1201	2655.44	2657.72	F	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	that's that one right i think we've often used agent patient of yeah exactly 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1202	2656.51	2656.91	E	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	used agent patient 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1203	2657.36	2658.22	E	Grad	s^bu|qy^d^g	-1	0	that's that one right of yeah exactly 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1204	2657.72	2660.2	F	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	that's that one right of yeah exactly exactly um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1205	2660.44	2675.62	F	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um and so one nice thing that uh we had talked about is this examples like if you have a passive construction then one thing it does is she you know definitely it is one way to for you to you know specifically take the perspective of the undergoing kind of object and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1206	2675.9	2680.05	F	Grad	qh	-1	0	of object and so then we talked about you know whether well does that does like topic as well well maybe there are other thing 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1207	2680.05	2681.14	F	Grad	s	-1	0	well maybe there are other thing and now that it's 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1208	2681.14	2683.51	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and now that it's subject it's more like a topic and now that you 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1209	2683.51	2684.08	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	a topic and now that you know and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1210	2684.76	2685.22	F	Grad	fg|%--	-1	0	know and so far i got to go off 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1211	2685.29	2686.39	F	Grad	s^fa|s	-1	0	so far i got to go off and i'm like is not that 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1212	2686.39	2688.04	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	and i'm like is not that important right now um 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1214	2688.66	2695.12	C	Professor	s	-1	0	we just need the ability to who write it down if if somebody figured out what the rules for um you know how yeah yeah exactly 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1213	2688.47	2688.91	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1215	2691.44	2692.03	F	Grad	s^2.%-	-1	0	who write it down if you know how 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1216	2694.25	2695.9	F	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	out what the rules for yeah yeah exactly 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1217	2695.3	2695.45	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	exactly 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1218	2696.15	2696.75	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1219	2697.62	2698.53	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so many of the other ones i see so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1220	2698.53	2698.85	F	Grad	s	-1	0	the other ones i see so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1221	2698.85	2699.27	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	the other ones i see so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1222	2700.22	2703.0	F	Grad	s	+1	0	oh one thing i'm uncertain about is how polarity interactive polarity uh is 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1224	2703.18	2703.61	C	Professor	b	-1	0	polarity uh is 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1223	2703.0	2707.61	F	Grad	s	+1	0	polarity uh is using for like action did not take place for instance a by default 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1225	2707.61	2709.96	F	Grad	s	-1	0	for instance a by default it'll be like true i guess 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1226	2710.24	2712.38	F	Grad	s	-1	0	you know if you're satisfying events it did happen 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1227	2713.17	2717.6	F	Grad	s	-1	0	you could imagine that use get about this you know leave off the polarity you're not 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1228	2717.6	2718.8	F	Grad	s	-1	0	you're not don't have it here 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1229	2719.04	2721.15	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and have it part of the speech act in some way to some vacation 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1230	2720.88	2721.36	C	Professor	b	-1	0	the speech act in some way to some vacation 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1231	2721.15	2721.88	F	Grad	s	-1	0	to some vacation 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1232	2722.36	2729.36	F	Grad	s	-1	0	but the reason why i left in because he might have uh changes state let's say where some state hold some something doesn't hold and you're just talking 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1233	2729.36	2730.61	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and you're just talking you know if 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1234	2730.96	2735.08	F	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	no i i think at this live which is it you know if you're trying to have enough people to simulation you need to know that you know whatever hold it doesn't and 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1235	2733.74	2736.82	C	Professor	s^ar|s	-1	0	no i i think at this live which is it should be where you have it you know whatever hold it doesn't and okay 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1236	2737.04	2738.95	F	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	it so it's it's it's fine or is 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1238	2739.21	2743.38	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	how you get it it made may and often involve a discourse but but it okay making a few places 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1237	2738.95	2739.1	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	how it's fine or is it okay 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1239	2739.59	2739.89	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	how it okay 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1240	2742.36	2743.39	F	Grad	s^2	-1	0	often involve a discourse but but making a few places 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1241	2743.38	2747.35	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but but by the time you simulating you should you should know that so places right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1242	2745.26	2745.59	F	Grad	b	-1	0	you simulating you should 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1243	2747.35	2747.74	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	that so right 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1244	2747.87	2752.41	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	that so i'm still just really not clear on what i'm looking at the scenario right 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1245	2752.47	2753.56	E	Grad	s^rt	+1	2	at the scenario box like what does 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1246	2753.56	2756.09	E	Grad	qh	-1	0	box like what does that look like for an example like not all of yeah 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1248	2756.09	2758.67	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	like not all of these things are going to be here this 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1247	2756.03	2756.45	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	like not all of 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1250	2758.69	2759.03	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	here this is just basically says 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1251	2758.94	2760.38	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	here this is just basically says it's 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1249	2758.65	2758.99	F	Grad	b	-1	0	here this 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1252	2761.0	2762.22	F	Grad	s.%-	+1	0	part of what i'm going to hand you a grab bag of 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1253	2761.68	2767.65	E	Grad	s	+1	1	part of what i'm going to hand you is uh a whole bunch of uh scheme is image and x. chemo is a grab bag of 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1254	2768.24	2770.96	E	Grad	s	-1	0	here are some examples of the sorts of things you might have in there 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1255	2771.34	2772.85	F	Grad	s^na	-1	0	so that's exactly what it is and 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1256	2772.9	2773.23	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	what it is and for a particular instance 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1257	2772.94	2785.93	F	Grad	s	-1	0	what it is and for a particular instance which i do you know make an example site is that you might have instance of container and path let's say as part of your you know into you know definition 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1258	2782.08	2782.58	E	Grad	b	-1	0	let's say as part 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1259	2784.61	2785.1	E	Grad	b	-1	0	you know definition 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1260	2786.21	2791.64	F	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	so you would eventually have instances filled in with various various values for all frozen slots 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1261	2790.08	2790.58	E	Grad	b	-1	0	values for all frozen 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1262	2792.1	2795.42	F	Grad	s	-1	0	do you have to say about the binding and bound up in it their findings and and and values 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1264	2794.05	2794.62	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	their findings and and and 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1263	2793.73	2794.0	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	it their findings and and and 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1265	2795.05	2796.77	E	Grad	qy.%--	-1	0	do you have to say about the binding in your values 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1266	2797.47	2800.94	E	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	no no no i said let's is there a slot in here for the children of the findings are done 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1267	2800.25	2800.74	C	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	no no no i said let's are done 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1268	2800.74	2801.93	C	Professor	s	-1	0	no no no i said let's see i think we were not but are done 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1269	2801.93	2803.36	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	see i think we were not but it was quite great yet so 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1271	2803.9	2807.12	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yet so uh what this is like supposed to moments 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1270	2803.5	2803.68	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yet so 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1272	2807.12	2808.73	C	Professor	s	-1	0	like supposed to moments complete 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1274	2809.31	2825.98	C	Professor	s	+1	0	okay uh then this says that when and analysis is finished the whole analysis is finished you'll have as a result of uh sums resulting set some spec for that veterans in context 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1273	2808.9	2809.16	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	complete okay 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1275	2816.25	2816.64	E	Grad	b	-1	0	the whole analysis 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1276	2826.15	2836.29	C	Professor	s	+1	1	which he is made up entirely of these things and uh findings among them 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1278	2837.08	2838.85	C	Professor	s^e	+1	1	and binding on toiletry items 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1277	2836.6	2837.1	E	Grad	b	-1	0	and binding on 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1280	2839.8	2848.94	C	Professor	s	+1	1	so that that the whole that this is the token underweight out of which you can make is samantha specification 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1279	2839.46	2839.86	E	Grad	b	-1	0	so 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1281	2848.94	2849.47	E	Grad	b	-1	0	specification 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1282	2850.11	2850.87	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so that's a 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1284	2851.35	2860.85	C	Professor	s	-1	0	good beach which is more relevant to your life is this is also the folks that that is used in the semantics sides constructions 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1283	2851.17	2851.5	E	Grad	b	-1	0	good beach 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1285	2861.32	2861.75	E	Grad	b	-1	0	so 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1286	2861.94	2871.92	C	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	so this is and it did anything you have in the party line anything you have a cement excited constructions comes from pieces is ignoring all i mean 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1287	2865.72	2866.01	E	Grad	b	-1	0	in the party line 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1288	2871.92	2873.62	C	Professor	s	-1	0	is ignoring all i mean in general you ignore losses it but 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1289	2872.92	2873.19	E	Grad	b	-1	0	in general you ignore losses it but 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1290	2873.97	2878.09	C	Professor	s	+1	1	losses it but it's got to be pieces of this along with constraints among them uh 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1291	2878.36	2878.66	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	uh 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1292	2878.96	2889.22	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh so that the you know goal love the uh uh sort of goal has to be the landmark of the content you know the injured this container or whatever whatever 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1293	2887.17	2887.78	E	Grad	b	-1	0	the content you 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1294	2889.22	2889.98	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	or whatever whatever 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1295	2889.73	2890.08	E	Grad	b	-1	0	or whatever whatever so those constraints 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1296	2890.42	2894.66	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so those constraints up here and constructions 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1297	2894.72	2895.05	E	Grad	b	-1	0	but 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1298	2895.39	2904.44	C	Professor	s	+1	0	but pretty much this is d. full range of semantic structures available to except 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1299	2904.68	2904.99	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	to except 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1300	2904.79	2906.75	F	Grad	s^arp	+1	2	to except for cause i forgot 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1301	2906.95	2910.55	F	Grad	s	-1	0	okay good let's let's mark that i forgot anyway is a some kind of causal structure for composite events 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1302	2908.11	2908.36	E	Grad	b	-1	0	a some kind of causal structure 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1303	2909.36	2909.86	C	Professor	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	okay good let's for composite 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1304	2909.86	2910.66	C	Professor	s^co	+1	0	okay good let's let's mark that for composite events 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1305	2911.27	2911.8	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	so we different 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1306	2912.6	2914.07	F	Grad	s	-1	0	i mean it gets a little tiny these are all so far 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1307	2914.07	2921.75	F	Grad	s	-1	0	these are all so far these structures especially from happen on down these are sort of relatives familiar um image medic kind of slots 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1308	2922.2	2926.39	F	Grad	s|qy^d^g	-1	0	now what caused uh the stiller's will actually be themselves frames right so you'll say 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1310	2926.45	2926.77	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right so you'll say 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1311	2926.82	2927.43	E	Grad	b	-1	0	right so you'll say even one causes 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1309	2926.39	2928.52	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and and right so you'll say even one causes and be uh into 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1312	2928.57	2934.78	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and and and this this this again may get our um every and and of course worlds and be uh into and yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1313	2928.58	2929.26	F	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	and and and this this this again and be uh into and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1314	2929.26	2929.47	F	Grad	%-	-1	0	and this this this again and 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1316	2935.44	2935.74	E	Grad	b	-1	0	so that's why 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1315	2935.07	2939.35	F	Grad	s^aa|s	+1	0	so that's why these are all implicitly one within in within one world um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1317	2939.84	2940.28	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1318	2941.56	2944.04	F	Grad	s	-1	0	even though saying that place takes place whatever uh if you if i said 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1319	2944.08	2951.53	F	Grad	s	-1	0	uh if you if i said time is you know past that was a set this world you know somewhere before the world of course undercurrents each time so 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1320	2948.73	2949.0	E	Grad	b	-1	0	world you know somewhere before the world 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1321	2949.82	2950.19	E	Grad	b	-1	0	before the world of course undercurrents 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1322	2951.62	2951.84	E	Grad	b	-1	0	each time so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1323	2951.98	2953.84	F	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	each time so that that that sort of okay that 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1324	2953.84	2955.86	F	Grad	s	-1	0	that sort of okay that the within the event is is a one world 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1325	2956.58	2956.96	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed015.F.dialogueact1326	2958.19	2959.39	F	Grad	fg|s.%--	-1	0	yeah so cause and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1327	2960.08	2966.19	F	Grad	s	-1	0	other frames that could come in i mean i'm course you could bring in say for instance um uh desire or something like that like once 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1328	2965.94	2966.45	E	Grad	b	-1	0	or something like that like once 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1329	2966.19	2966.81	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	like once 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1330	2967.25	2973.46	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and actually there is right now under discourse segments um attitude volition 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1331	2973.52	2973.92	E	Grad	b	-1	0	volition 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1332	2973.79	2974.39	F	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	volition could 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1333	2974.75	2975.43	F	Grad	s	-1	0	could feel that a couple things 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1334	2975.43	2979.31	F	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	feel that a couple things are like oh not sure if and i want to have their or basically 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1335	2978.46	2979.0	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	and i want to have their or basically 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1336	2979.31	2984.05	F	Grad	s	+1	0	or basically there was a whole list of of possible speaker attitudes that like they told me was just like well 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1337	2984.05	2987.74	F	Grad	s	-1	0	like well i don't you know it was like hope wish desire 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1338	2987.93	2988.26	C	Professor	b	-1	0	blah blah and 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1339	2988.15	2988.53	E	Grad	b	-1	0	blah blah and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1340	2988.3	2988.74	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	blah blah and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1341	2988.96	2992.43	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	blah blah and it's like well i feel like if i wanted to have an extra meaning i don't know 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1342	2992.66	2994.61	F	Grad	s^no	+1	0	i don't know those are radically march in the first place so they're 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1343	2994.62	2996.13	F	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	the first place so they're more likely march right at least in english 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1345	2996.72	2997.52	E	Grad	b	-1	0	at least in english so if i wanted 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1344	2996.43	2997.18	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	at least in english so if i wanted 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1346	2997.46	3000.87	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so if i wanted to i would stick in an extra frame in my meeting saying 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1347	3001.19	3003.35	F	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	it so that would be a higher cool frame then right you know like 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1348	3003.35	3006.74	F	Grad	s	-1	0	then right you know like the only once once such a certain situation and that 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1349	3006.74	3009.24	F	Grad	s	-1	0	right so so want certain situation and that situation itself is save affairs 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1350	3008.9	3009.34	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right so so want save affairs 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1351	3009.34	3013.43	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	right so so want itself can be as well and it can be just another frame that's part of your 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1352	3009.48	3009.58	F	Grad	%-	-1	0	right so so want 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1353	3011.51	3013.93	F	Grad	s^2	-1	0	be as well and it can be just another frame that's part of your 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1354	3013.64	3015.25	C	Professor	s	-1	0	well and it basically it's an action in in that's part of your 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1355	3015.71	3017.49	C	Professor	s^e.%-	-1	0	in in our in our in our for in yeah situation but right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1356	3016.35	3016.51	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	our in our in our yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1357	3017.22	3018.16	F	Grad	s^2|s^aa	-1	0	for in our arts situation but right 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1358	3017.97	3020.48	C	Professor	s	+1	0	for in our arts terminal she want to be an action and what you want situation but right 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1359	3020.48	3022.82	C	Professor	s	+1	0	an action and what you want is work 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1360	3021.53	3021.93	F	Grad	b	-1	0	is 
Bed015.B.dialogueact1361	3023.14	3024.04	B	Grad	b	-1	0	so that's definitely 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1363	3024.43	3025.83	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so that's definitely one way to 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1362	3024.03	3024.39	F	Grad	b	-1	0	so that's definitely 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1365	3026.25	3029.44	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	do there there are other than causal stuff 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1364	3026.2	3026.56	E	Grad	b	-1	0	do there there are 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1366	3029.44	3031.11	C	Professor	s	+1	2	than causal stuff we have to look we need a mental space we need the context 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1367	3031.11	3031.9	C	Professor	s	+1	1	a mental space we need the context 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1368	3031.17	3031.63	F	Grad	b	-1	0	a mental space we need the context 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1369	3031.9	3032.83	C	Professor	s	+1	0	a mental space we need the context 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1370	3033.44	3035.19	C	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	um i think 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1371	3037.46	3041.12	C	Professor	qy	-1	0	so is this comfortable to you that 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1372	3041.24	3051.13	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	that uh once we have this line if he is your tool kit for doing the semantic part of the instructions and then 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1373	3044.98	3045.34	E	Grad	b	-1	0	line if he is 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1374	3051.13	3060.72	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and then when we combined constructions semantic lay the goal is going to be just a lot more and more of the binding needed in order to the final one 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1375	3055.41	3055.77	E	Grad	b	-1	0	lay the goal 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1377	3062.08	3065.75	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and that so and and i mean that according to party line that's the whole story 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1376	3062.03	3062.78	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	and that so 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1378	3066.06	3066.45	E	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed015.E.dialogueact1379	3068.94	3069.31	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah um 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1380	3069.31	3070.24	E	Grad	fh|%--	-1	0	um you right that 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1381	3070.71	3071.61	E	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	you right that makes sense i mean 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1382	3071.61	3074.39	E	Grad	s	+1	0	makes sense i mean there's this stuff enough in the scenario which just tells you 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1383	3074.39	3076.83	E	Grad	s	+1	1	which just tells you how various whisky misusing and have 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1384	3076.83	3077.94	E	Grad	s	+1	0	misusing and have they're bound together 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1385	3078.28	3081.57	E	Grad	s.%--	+1	1	and i guess that some of the discourse segment stuff 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1387	3082.3	3083.14	E	Grad	qy.%--	-1	0	is that where you it's i mean that's 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1386	3081.99	3082.43	F	Grad	b	-1	0	is that where you it's 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1388	3083.39	3084.01	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i mean that's okay that's 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1389	3084.75	3086.5	E	Grad	s^bk|s	+1	0	okay that's really information structure is we're sort of 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1390	3086.5	3092.21	E	Grad	s	+1	0	is we're sort of the kind of profiling on different parts of uh this i mean what's interesting 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1391	3087.25	3087.56	F	Grad	b	-1	0	the kind of profiling

Bed015.E.dialogueact1393	3092.4	3094.97	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i mean what's interesting is that the information structure stuff 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1394	3097.44	3098.31	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	um there's almost i 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1395	3098.31	3104.34	E	Grad	s	-1	0	there's almost i mean we keep coming back to how focuses like this this uh projector landmark thing so if i say yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1396	3102.04	3102.38	F	Grad	b	-1	0	this uh 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1397	3104.34	3109.41	E	Grad	s:s	-1	0	thing so if i say um you know in france it's like this you know great we've learned

Bed015.E.dialogueact1399	3109.84	3111.03	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	this you know great we've learned something about france but the fact is that hundreds 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1400	3111.03	3119.11	E	Grad	s	-1	0	but the fact is that hundreds of that sort are generally used to help you draw a conclusion also about some implicit contrast like in france it's like 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1401	3119.11	3120.45	E	Grad	s:s	-1	0	like in france it's like this and therefore you're supposed 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1403	3120.45	3122.15	E	Grad	s.%--:s	-1	0	this and therefore you're supposed to say boy like for you know in france 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1402	3120.38	3120.9	F	Grad	b	-1	0	this and therefore you're supposed 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1404	3122.15	3124.62	E	Grad	s	-1	0	you know in france kids are allowed to drink at age three 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1405	3125.04	3127.34	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and years that's not just the fact about france joseph and do something 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1407	3127.34	3130.63	E	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	joseph and do something about how boring it is here in the u. s. right and so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1406	3127.08	3127.82	F	Grad	b	-1	0	joseph and do something 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1408	3130.63	3130.92	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	right and so 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1409	3130.63	3131.3	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	right and so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1410	3132.41	3135.62	F	Grad	s^bd^cs^rt	-1	0	so i would prefer not to worry about that for right now and 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1411	3135.69	3136.13	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right now and to think that there are 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1412	3135.94	3137.57	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	that comes right now and to think that there are um discourse

Bed015.E.dialogueact1415	3138.37	3138.74	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	in and they level 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1414	3137.99	3144.96	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	that comes in and they um discourse level constructions in a sense topic topic because there's that would say oh when you focus something then just

Bed015.E.dialogueact1417	3144.39	3144.67	E	Grad	b	-1	0	then just 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1418	3144.96	3147.68	F	Grad	s	-1	0	then just the same way just like actually the same way as the lower level if you stressed 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1419	3147.68	3151.73	F	Grad	s	+1	0	the lower level if you stressed you know john went to the you know the bar whatever you're focusing that and

Bed015.F.dialogueact1423	3155.12	3158.16	F	Grad	s	-1	0	suddenly for a whole sentence you know in france such and such happened so the whole thing

Bed015.E.dialogueact1425	3157.58	3158.41	E	Grad	b	-1	0	such and such happened so the whole thing

Bed015.C.dialogueact1531	3384.07	3384.18	C	Professor	b.%	-1	0	yeah right so yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1532	3384.47	3384.79	C	Professor	s^na	-1	0	yeah right so yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1534	3384.79	3388.44	C	Professor	fg|s	+1	0	yeah right so so again this is this this this tuna goes into the mental space stuff into because yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1533	3384.69	3386.26	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah right so so again this is this this this tuna yeah yeah yeah yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1535	3388.44	3392.13	C	Professor	s^df:s	-1	0	stuff into because you know fred said that mary said and whatever and and so we're 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1537	3388.71	3389.1	E	Grad	b	-1	0	stuff into because 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1536	3388.47	3388.89	F	Grad	b	-1	0	stuff into because 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1538	3392.13	3399.77	C	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	and and so we're uh going to have to um chain those as well 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1539	3393.99	3394.22	A	Grad	b	-1	0	uh going to have 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1540	3394.65	3394.75	A	Grad	b	-1	0	going to have 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1541	3396.73	3396.85	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed015.F.dialogueact1542	3399.41	3400.05	F	Grad	b	-1	0	well so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1543	3400.85	3406.8	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so this and tired thing is inside the world not 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1544	3403.84	3404.1	C	Professor	b	-1	0	is 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1546	3407.07	3407.35	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	just like the top part 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1545	3406.9	3407.89	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	the world not just like the top part 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1547	3408.4	3409.11	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	i think that it 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1548	3409.42	3409.58	F	Grad	%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed015.A.dialogueact1549	3411.22	3411.65	A	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed015.C.dialogueact1550	3414.08	3416.5	C	Professor	s^arp	-1	0	except it's it's it's trickier than that because 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1551	3416.5	3421.84	C	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	than that because um the reference for example 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1552	3422.89	3426.42	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so here we were gets really tricky is there's some things and this is we're 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1553	3425.05	3425.34	F	Grad	b	-1	0	is there's some things 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1554	3426.42	3428.27	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and this is we're bland unalterably so some things which 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1556	3428.27	3435.0	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so some things which really are meant to be identified and some things which aren't in again all we 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1555	3428.05	3428.4	F	Grad	b	-1	0	so some things which 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1557	3433.89	3434.04	F	Grad	b	-1	0	and some things which aren't in 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1558	3435.0	3440.34	C	Professor	s	-1	0	again all we need for the moment is some way who say that 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1559	3436.08	3436.37	F	Grad	b	-1	0	need for the moment is 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1560	3441.21	3445.98	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so i thought having like for each reference having a list of other things with which is identified 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1561	3446.61	3448.96	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	you could do that you know which which is you know you you you for 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1562	3448.0	3448.73	C	Professor	s^am	-1	0	could do that you know you you you for 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1563	3448.96	3449.86	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	could do that you know you you you for instance um 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1564	3450.72	3451.33	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so i guess 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1565	3452.6	3457.92	F	Grad	s	+1	0	it sort of depends on if it is a referring or if it's identifiable already or if it's a new thing is 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1566	3456.52	3457.11	E	Grad	b	-1	0	already or if it's a new thing is 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1567	3457.92	3459.81	F	Grad	s	+1	0	if it's a new thing is new thing you have to like korea structure whatever 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1568	3460.23	3464.87	F	Grad	s|s^f	+1	0	it is old thing it could be referring to um usually well something and situation right or something 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1569	3464.87	3466.05	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and situation right or something and not allergy so 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1570	3465.91	3466.42	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	and not allergy so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1571	3466.66	3467.4	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	so because 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1572	3468.09	3470.18	F	Grad	s	-1	0	i just haven't i just and and um an idea it you know whatever it can it can point at one 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1573	3469.3	3472.87	C	Professor	s	+1	0	i just haven't i just and and um an idea it would be very nice if it works it can it can point at one 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1574	3473.12	3473.47	F	Grad	qw^br	-1	0	for what it works 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1576	3473.87	3476.05	C	Professor	s	-1	0	@reject@ and i i don't know what know this was my for what it works 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1575	3473.47	3474.2	F	Grad	s	-1	0	@reject@ and i for what it works 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1578	3476.05	3477.58	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	was my go to and i 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1577	3475.86	3476.68	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	i don't know what know this was my 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1579	3477.69	3479.75	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	go to and i and i did it would be nice if came across and there's 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1580	3478.17	3478.43	F	Grad	b	-1	0	and i did it would be nice 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1581	3479.32	3480.09	F	Grad	s^bk|s^cc	-1	0	if right if it worked came across and there's 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1582	3480.34	3480.66	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	right if it worked 
Bed015.B.dialogueact1584	3481.03	3482.19	B	Grad	s^j	-1	0	there billy medals biscuit yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1583	3480.66	3481.12	C	Professor	s	-1	0	there billy medals biscuit right if it worked 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1585	3482.71	3482.95	C	Professor	s^aa^j	-1	0	yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1586	3482.9	3483.05	F	Grad	s^bk^j	-1	0	yeah right the 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1587	3483.43	3484.67	C	Professor	s^aa|s^rt	-1	0	right the space builder 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1588	3485.96	3493.46	C	Professor	fh|s	+1	2	um we might be able to handle context in the same way that we handle mental spaces 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1589	3494.48	3502.65	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	cause uh you have somewhat the same things going on of uh things being acceptable or not and yep 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1590	3494.49	3494.72	F	Grad	b	-1	0	cause 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1591	3502.73	3504.3	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	or not and so i yep 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1592	3503.05	3503.26	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	so 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1593	3505.18	3511.19	C	Professor	s	+1	0	it it it it i think we did right we might be able to get at least a lot of the same structure yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1594	3508.68	3509.3	F	Grad	s^2|s^aa	-1	0	to get at least a lot yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1595	3512.14	3525.14	C	Professor	s	+1	1	so pulling something out of discourse contexts i think similar to other kinds of uh mentally something i didn't i've never seen 
Bed015.B.dialogueact1596	3520.54	3521.16	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	i think similar to other

Bed015.C.dialogueact1601	3528.11	3528.82	C	Professor	s^ba^df	-1	0	it maybe they did i don't 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1602	3528.82	3529.25	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	it maybe they did i don't know but maybe 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1603	3529.52	3530.92	C	Professor	s	-1	0	know but maybe all of the literature 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1604	3529.79	3530.18	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	know but maybe all of the literature 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1606	3531.45	3542.38	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	there's things like there's you know there's all kinds of stuff like um i think i mentioned last time in check if you have uh verbal saying that um who who by default 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1605	3531.13	3532.46	F	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	there's things like there's you who who by default 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1607	3542.94	3550.31	E	Grad	s:s	-1	0	um you know you see something like or or if they can you can say something like oh i thought uh you are republican or something like that whereas in english or say 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1608	3550.31	3551.94	E	Grad	s:s	-1	0	like that whereas in english or say i thought you were 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1609	3552.26	3552.61	C	Professor	b	-1	0	um you know 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1610	3552.27	3557.33	E	Grad	s	-1	0	um you know sort of the past tense being copied onto the lower for doesn't happen there so you have to say something 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1611	3557.33	3562.21	E	Grad	s	-1	0	there so you have to say something about you know texas determine relative to current blah blah blah same thing happens 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1612	3561.47	3561.77	F	Grad	b	-1	0	current blah blah blah 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1614	3562.6	3564.11	E	Grad	s	-1	0	same thing happens with pronouns there's languages where 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1613	3562.38	3562.65	F	Grad	b	-1	0	same thing happens 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1615	3564.11	3566.23	E	Grad	s.%--	+1	0	there's languages where 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1616	3568.15	3570.3	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	if you have a fervent saying

Bed015.E.dialogueact1621	3582.56	3585.11	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	so we would it be in english um and it's sort of an extended function yeah but 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1623	3583.61	3585.24	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so we would it be in english and it's sort of an extended function yeah but

Bed015.E.dialogueact1627	3585.92	3588.14	E	Grad	s	+1	0	yeah but it's not perceived as a court of construction i mean it's been analyzed 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1625	3585.65	3585.99	F	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah but 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1629	3588.58	3588.85	C	Professor	b	-1	0	i mean it's been analyzed 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1628	3588.14	3592.81	E	Grad	s	+1	0	i mean it's been analyzed by the formal as as being awol before fork pronouns 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1630	3593.18	3598.31	E	Grad	s^e|qy^d^f^g	+1	0	um which means i'll number it refers back to the person who's speaking or that sort of thing right um oh right so uhhuh 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1632	3598.21	3598.59	C	Professor	b	-1	0	right um right so uhhuh

Bed015.E.dialogueact1634	3599.52	3602.5	E	Grad	s^rt:s^rt	-1	0	but at that happens to sound like the word for i but it's actually

Bed015.F.dialogueact1641	3608.67	3609.29	F	Grad	s	-1	0	there's a whole book which you're kidding 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1642	3609.27	3611.85	E	Grad	s	-1	0	there's a whole book which basically operates on this assumption uh 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1643	3611.85	3613.25	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	on this assumption uh mary dell rumple uh this book 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1644	3613.62	3617.99	E	Grad	s	-1	0	uh this book ninety three book on on pronouns and stuff no was horrible 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1645	3614.16	3615.96	F	Grad	s^ar|s^ba	-1	0	ninety three book on no was horrible

Bed015.F.dialogueact1647	3618.43	3619.85	F	Grad	s^ba|s^bk	-1	0	well yeah and then same 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1648	3619.45	3621.05	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	well yeah and then same thing for e. s. l. or you know you're signing and 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1649	3621.05	3621.97	E	Grad	s	-1	0	or you know you're signing and 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1650	3621.97	3623.07	E	Grad	s	-1	0	or you know you're signing and someone says something and then you 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1651	3623.33	3627.47	E	Grad	s:s	-1	0	and then you know so he say and then you sort of do a role shaft and then you sign 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1652	3627.57	3629.79	E	Grad	s:s	-1	0	shaft and then you sign i this that the other you know uhhuh 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1653	3628.08	3628.47	F	Grad	b^rt	-1	0	i uhhuh 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1654	3629.79	3630.69	E	Grad	s:s	-1	0	this that the other you know i did this 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1655	3631.26	3635.46	E	Grad	s:s	-1	0	that's also been analyze this war before x. and having nothing to do with high in the role shifting 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1656	3635.46	3637.64	E	Grad	s	-1	0	high in the role shifting is completely left out and so on 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1657	3637.64	3637.8	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	out and so on 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1658	3638.54	3645.3	E	Grad	s	+1	0	i mean the point is that pronouns reference is uh you know sort of ties in with all this mental space stuff and so on and so forth so yeah yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1659	3638.82	3639.11	F	Grad	b	-1	0	i mean the point is that 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1660	3645.3	3646.72	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	so that that that that so yeah i mean that yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1661	3645.32	3645.67	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	so yeah yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1662	3646.34	3649.52	C	Professor	s|s^bk	-1	0	so that that that that does sound like a consistent consistent with what we're saying i mean that right like 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1663	3647.08	3647.31	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	does sound like a consistent right like 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1664	3648.28	3648.55	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	consistent with what we're saying 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1665	3650.39	3654.79	F	Grad	s^bk|s^bu	+1	0	okay so it's kind of like the on stuff like mental space our current context and then 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1666	3654.85	3664.49	F	Grad	s	+1	0	context and then when you in bed them sometimes you have to pop up to the hot you know depending on the construction or the whatever um you you your scope it might break send out to the base one

Bed015.E.dialogueact1669	3662.82	3663.14	E	Grad	b	-1	0	break send out to the 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1670	3665.43	3668.24	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	it would be nice to actually use the same um nexus since there are so many 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1671	3668.24	3670.28	F	Grad	s^df.%--	-1	0	since there are so many cases where you actually need it'll be one 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1672	3670.63	3671.66	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	it'll be one or the other it's like well 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1673	3671.45	3671.85	E	Grad	b	-1	0	or the other it's like well 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1674	3671.66	3673.59	F	Grad	s	-1	0	okay so this or the other it's like well actually the same same offices 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1675	3673.48	3675.09	C	Professor	s^bk|s	-1	0	okay so this this person thought it's like it's like what's happening offices 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1676	3673.68	3673.76	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	okay so this offices 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1677	3674.56	3680.29	E	Grad	s|qy^d^g	+1	1	this person thought it's like it's like what's happening there yeah what was happening there there is that you're moving the base space or something like that right so that's that's how yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1678	3679.12	3680.3	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	or something like that right so that's that's how yeah 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1679	3680.29	3682.25	E	Grad	s	-1	0	right so that's that's how far and they were talking about and it happens different 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1681	3682.25	3685.2	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and it happens different under different circumstances and different languages and so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1680	3682.23	3682.51	F	Grad	b	-1	0	and it happens different 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1682	3685.2	3685.65	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	and so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1683	3685.27	3685.6	F	Grad	b	-1	0	and so 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1684	3686.17	3692.15	E	Grad	s	-1	0	um things like for on reference intense work for thinking of is being used discourse scorsese things actually are relative to a base base which can change and we need 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1685	3692.15	3692.76	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	which can change and we need 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1686	3692.19	3692.55	F	Grad	s^bk^rt	-1	0	which can change and we need 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1687	3692.76	3694.26	E	Grad	s^cs^e	-1	0	which can change and we need all i'm she

Bed015.E.dialogueact1809	3893.57	3893.94	E	Grad	b	-1	0	i think for the most 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1810	3894.4	3898.29	F	Grad	%-	-1	0	i just mean there's lots of different part i don't no too much rather like grammatical 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1811	3895.07	3895.52	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	just mean no too much rather 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1812	3898.41	3903.25	E	Grad	s	-1	0	there's lots of different attitudes that that the speaker could have and that we can clearly identify and so on and so forth but like yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1813	3902.21	3902.76	F	Grad	b	-1	0	and so on and so forth yeah 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1814	3903.25	3909.15	E	Grad	qh	+1	0	right so is this but like water the distinctions among those that we actually care about for our current purposes 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1815	3907.94	3908.22	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	actually care about for our current purposes 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1816	3909.07	3912.38	C	Professor	s^aa|qh	-1	0	right so is this is the first question what our current purposes 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1817	3909.54	3909.96	F	Grad	b	-1	0	right so is this 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1818	3913.46	3913.73	C	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	oh oh yeah 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1820	3913.9	3914.55	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	oh shoot here it is three oh yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1819	3913.57	3915.87	F	Grad	s^aa^j|qy^j^rt	-1	0	oh shoot here it is three fifteen or any oh yeah do you have any 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1821	3914.61	3915.81	E	Grad	s	-1	0	shoot here it is three fifteen or any do you have any

Bed015.A.dialogueact1823	3917.4	3917.64	A	Grad	b	-1	0	uh 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1824	3917.81	3919.74	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh so uh um 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1825	3920.73	3921.6	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	i i don't know the answer but but 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1826	3921.6	3924.99	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	don't know the answer but but um it's does seem that 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1827	3926.26	3927.55	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you know this is this is coming along i think it's 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1828	3927.55	3929.52	C	Professor	s	-1	0	coming along i think it's it's pretty it's it's 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1829	3929.52	3932.31	C	Professor	s	+1	1	pretty it's it's hard to tell this is one major thing we have to do which is the 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1830	3932.31	3934.27	C	Professor	s	+1	1	do which is the holes pencils they thing and then 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1831	3934.78	3936.72	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and then there's some other minor things 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1832	3935.06	3935.43	F	Grad	b	-1	0	there's some other minor 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1833	3937.15	3940.14	C	Professor	s	+1	2	um and got this sort of bound the complexity i mean if you get everything 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1834	3940.14	3943.36	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	i mean if you get everything anybody ever thought about moving out so 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1835	3942.74	3943.02	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	about moving out so 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1836	3943.79	3956.98	C	Professor	s	+1	0	out so we had started with the idea that the e. actual uh constraint was you related to disperse to me 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1837	3957.39	3961.08	C	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	and the kind of interactions that might occur in the papers i mean assuming 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1838	3961.71	3965.68	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	assuming that people were being healthy one weren't trained to do you know there's 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1839	3965.68	3968.76	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	to do you know there's all sorts of god the irony and stuff like that you 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1841	3968.76	3972.09	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and stuff like that you isn't probably as much use in dealing with the first guy yeah 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1840	3968.43	3968.72	E	Grad	b	-1	0	and stuff like that you 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1843	3972.5	3972.62	C	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	yeah 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1842	3972.35	3972.66	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1844	3973.33	3973.75	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	mockery 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1845	3973.55	3974.61	F	Grad	s	-1	0	right mockery 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1846	3974.87	3975.13	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right whatever yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1847	3975.13	3975.46	C	Professor	s^bd.x	-1	0	whatever yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1848	3975.85	3975.95	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	whatever yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1849	3976.39	3980.37	C	Professor	s	-1	0	oh no end of things that that that you know we don't deal with and 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1850	3980.8	3981.04	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	is with and then 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1851	3980.91	3981.79	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	is with and then 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1853	3981.8	3983.18	A	Grad	qy	-1	0	is is that but he's either because in term so then 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1852	3981.79	3982.0	C	Professor	s^co	-1	0	is is that but he's then 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1854	3983.18	3988.43	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	either because in term so this this is bigger would just mean you put one more to practice brackets around it and then 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1855	3988.77	3993.57	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	it and then just tended to sort of negates whatever the the continent that is in terms of irony or mm 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1856	3991.49	3991.99	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	the the continent 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1857	3992.02	3994.48	C	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	that is in terms of irony or right mm 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1858	3992.46	3993.07	F	Grad	b	-1	0	that is in terms of irony or mm 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1859	3993.57	3993.95	A	Grad	%--	-1	0	or 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1861	3994.48	3994.54	C	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	right 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1860	3994.29	3994.6	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1862	3995.08	3995.69	F	Grad	s^am	-1	0	maybe yeah in 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1864	3996.14	3996.5	C	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	model there'd semantics 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1863	3995.69	3998.82	F	Grad	fg|s:s	-1	0	maybe yeah in model there'd semantics always like speaker believe not p. 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1865	3998.93	3999.6	F	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	believe not p. you figure 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1867	4000.21	4000.46	C	Professor	b	-1	0	we have figures as p. 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1866	3999.86	4001.82	F	Grad	s:s	-1	0	we have a a radical model you figure figures as p. we've not seen it 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1868	4000.82	4003.18	E	Grad	s^na	-1	0	right now we have a a radical model of sarcasm figures as p. we've not seen it okay but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1869	4001.82	4001.93	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	a a radical model we've not seen it 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1872	4003.55	4003.82	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right now okay but 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1870	4003.18	4003.94	E	Grad	s^bk|%--	-1	0	right now okay but 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1873	4003.82	4004.84	C	Professor	s	-1	0	right now yeah okay but 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1871	4003.45	4004.28	F	Grad	s^aa|%-	-1	0	right now yeah okay but 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1874	4005.62	4008.61	C	Professor	fg|%--	-1	0	yeah so so um i guess 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1875	4010.27	4014.46	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh let me make oh on how to proceed on that which 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1876	4014.97	4018.11	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	that which is that 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1877	4020.29	4028.98	C	Professor	s	+1	0	it was case uh sort of job over the summer of two come up with this set of instructions 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1878	4029.14	4037.72	C	Professor	fh|s.%--	+1	0	um and the my suggestion you is that you too over the next couple weeks not don't try 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1879	4037.21	4037.48	E	Grad	b	-1	0	not don't try 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1880	4037.72	4040.79	C	Professor	s	+1	0	not don't try to do them indy killer formerly but 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1881	4040.93	4045.57	C	Professor	s^cs	+1	2	formerly but just artists describe which ones you think we ought to have 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1882	4045.93	4046.26	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	ought to have uh 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1883	4046.62	4051.05	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh and then when robert gets back we'll look at the set of them 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1884	4051.47	4051.73	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed015.C.dialogueact1885	4052.02	4054.1	C	Professor	s^cs^e	+1	2	is just sort of you know find your space 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1886	4054.12	4054.61	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed015.C.dialogueact1887	4055.36	4060.78	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and um they they these this is a set of things that i think we ought to deal with 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1888	4061.15	4061.47	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed015.C.dialogueact1889	4062.21	4064.66	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	and then what will go back over it and 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1890	4064.66	4067.55	C	Professor	s	-1	0	over it and people will be better and then they don't 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1891	4065.69	4066.0	E	Grad	b	-1	0	people will 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1892	4067.55	4076.37	C	Professor	s	-1	0	be better and then they don't have at least initial speck of of what we're actually trying to do 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1893	4076.53	4076.71	E	Grad	b	-1	0	do 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1894	4077.03	4081.02	C	Professor	s^df	+1	0	and that also be useful for anybody who's trying to write a purse or knowing 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1895	4081.35	4081.49	E	Grad	b	-1	0	knowing 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1896	4081.93	4082.84	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	knowing in case there's any if we knew anybody 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1897	4082.46	4083.53	E	Grad	s^bd^j	-1	0	in case there's any around if we knew anybody like that 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1898	4082.5	4083.63	F	Grad	s^bd^j	-1	0	in case there's any around if we knew anybody like that 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1899	4085.36	4085.6	C	Professor	s^aa^j	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed015.C.dialogueact1900	4086.09	4086.63	C	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	who might want et cetera 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1901	4086.84	4087.28	C	Professor	s	-1	0	who might want et cetera so 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1902	4087.51	4088.81	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so uh 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1903	4087.59	4087.87	E	Grad	b	-1	0	so 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1904	4089.67	4094.83	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so if you know you get this this for those fixed and then 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1905	4094.83	4099.93	C	Professor	s	-1	0	fixed and then we have an idea of the trip initial range and 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1906	4099.93	4105.85	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	range and then of course if you're going to have to do you were set if but get 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1907	4105.89	4106.96	C	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	you were set if but get to do that anyway for the same yet 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1908	4106.18	4107.51	F	Grad	s^na|s^aa	-1	0	to do that anyway so so for the same yet yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1909	4107.88	4111.33	C	Professor	s	+1	1	so so we're going to get the especially dealing with the demi's the first i mean yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1910	4111.55	4113.59	C	Professor	s	+1	1	the first i mean in the in the child language learning 
Bed015.B.dialogueact1911	4112.98	4113.61	B	Grad	b	-1	0	in the in the child language learning 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1912	4114.12	4118.38	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	and let's see what we need more those two 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1913	4119.1	4129.43	C	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	and my post would be too um no i totally cut off more general discussion but the focus 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1914	4129.43	4136.55	C	Professor	s	+1	0	but the focus really detailed work on the subset of things that we we really want to get 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1915	4131.69	4132.1	E	Grad	b	-1	0	work on 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1917	4137.37	4143.65	C	Professor	s	-1	0	without and that is the kind of separate red think about the more general things and and all that

Bed015.E.dialogueact1918	4142.77	4143.19	E	Grad	b	-1	0	without and and all that 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1919	4144.02	4149.67	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	something do to care discussion boasted you bring us to problems that will will fraternal nutri and maybe that without 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1921	4149.67	4150.49	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	nutri and maybe you can that without doubt yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1920	4149.62	4150.39	C	Professor	s^na	-1	0	nutri and maybe you can that without doubt yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1923	4150.8	4150.93	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	you can doubt yeah 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1922	4150.49	4150.72	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	you can doubt yeah 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1925	4151.31	4152.98	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	even suggesting solutions so i want to do is is is 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1924	4151.1	4157.2	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	even suggesting solutions so i want to do is is is this to constrain the things that we really feel responsible for 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1926	4152.98	4153.19	A	Grad	b.%	-1	0	solutions so is is this 
Bed015.A.dialogueact1927	4157.8	4158.11	A	Grad	b.%	-1	0	so that that we said 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1929	4158.15	4161.42	C	Professor	s^df:s	-1	0	so that that we said these are the things really get to to do by the end of the summer 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1928	4158.04	4158.38	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	so that that we said 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1930	4162.28	4166.42	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and i things will put on a list of of research problems or something because 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1931	4166.81	4172.33	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	something because you can easily get the point where nothing gets done because 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1932	4172.33	4177.19	C	Professor	s:qh	-1	0	done because every time you start to do something you say oh yeah but what about this case is 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1933	4177.35	4177.76	E	Grad	b	-1	0	is 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1934	4177.91	4179.29	C	Professor	s^j	-1	0	is the scoping a linguistic

Bed015.C.dialogueact1983	4240.73	4241.08	C	Professor	b	-1	0	so i maybe subconsciously intentional 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1982	4240.59	4242.43	F	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	yeah uh yeah so i maybe subconsciously intentional 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1984	4242.37	4243.01	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah uh yeah

Bed015.E.dialogueact1985	4242.78	4253.08	E	Grad	s	+1	0	yeah uh yeah yeah there should be i wanted this find out someday if there's going to be some way of dealing with uh if this is the right term multiple inheritance where one construction uhhuh 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1988	4253.19	4253.66	C	Professor	b	-1	0	where one construction uhhuh 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1987	4253.17	4257.62	E	Grad	s	+1	0	where one construction is inheriting from uh from both parents uh were uhhuh yep 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1989	4253.48	4253.74	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	where one construction uhhuh 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1990	4256.86	4257.08	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	from both parents uh were yep 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1991	4257.62	4258.79	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	parents uh were different ones or 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1992	4258.79	4259.99	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	yeah different ones or three or four different ones yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1993	4259.9	4260.09	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah so let me three or four different ones because the problem is that yeah 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1996	4260.42	4260.76	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	so let me because the problem is that 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1995	4260.35	4261.75	E	Grad	s^df.%--	-1	0	so let me because the problem is that then you have to 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1994	4259.95	4260.43	F	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah so let me three or four different ones because the problem is that yeah 
Bed015.E.dialogueact1998	4263.12	4265.75	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	yeah right right it shows you know sure how they're getting down together to yeah and 
Bed015.F.dialogueact1997	4262.74	4264.53	F	Grad	s^2	-1	0	yeah right right it shows you know sure how they're getting refer to 
Bed015.C.dialogueact1999	4264.13	4264.96	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right right know sure how they're getting 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2001	4265.81	4266.43	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	down together yeah and and there are certainly 
Bed015.F.dialogueact2000	4265.65	4267.61	F	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	down together yeah and and there are certainly he's like that even 
Bed015.F.dialogueact2002	4267.61	4270.44	F	Grad	s	-1	0	he's like that even just semantics team is we have some examples so 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2003	4270.34	4270.56	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	examples so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact2004	4270.44	4270.81	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	examples so 
Bed015.F.dialogueact2005	4271.15	4273.47	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so what i would like to do and we been talking a little bit about that anyway 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2006	4272.42	4276.48	C	Professor	fg|s^cs	+1	0	so what i would like to do is separate that problem out so bit about that anyway 
Bed015.F.dialogueact2007	4275.08	4275.47	F	Grad	s	-1	0	separate that problem 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2008	4276.52	4278.21	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	out so um 
Bed015.E.dialogueact2009	4276.75	4277.11	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	out so um 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2010	4279.15	4288.06	C	Professor	s	-1	0	very resistant nothing you can do is that that you can't do by just having more construction just uglier instead yes that's right 
Bed015.E.dialogueact2011	4286.09	4287.64	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	more construction just yes 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2012	4288.06	4291.02	C	Professor	s^ba^bd^df	-1	0	uglier instead of the deep linguistic insights and stuff uh that's right uh 
Bed015.E.dialogueact2013	4288.16	4288.79	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	uglier instead that's right 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2014	4291.55	4292.32	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh i uh whatever yeah no no yeah those it 
Bed015.E.dialogueact2015	4291.8	4292.43	E	Grad	s^bd	-1	0	uh i uh whatever yeah no no yeah those it 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2018	4292.78	4293.11	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	i whatever yeah no no no no by all means yeah those it is 
Bed015.E.dialogueact2017	4292.51	4293.18	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	i whatever yeah no no no no by all means yeah those it is 
Bed015.F.dialogueact2016	4292.4	4293.49	F	Grad	s^na	-1	0	i whatever yeah no no no no by all means yeah those it is 
Bed015.E.dialogueact2019	4293.45	4294.1	E	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	and so no no by all means right yeah sure is 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2021	4294.46	4300.01	C	Professor	s	+1	0	and so i thought i'd like to do is is in the short run focus on getting it right and what we right yeah sure 
Bed015.E.dialogueact2020	4294.1	4294.83	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	and so right yeah sure 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2022	4300.01	4303.7	C	Professor	s:s	+1	0	and what we think we have the right then saying uh hot can we 
Bed015.E.dialogueact2023	4300.05	4300.37	E	Grad	b	-1	0	and what we 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2024	4303.7	4304.93	C	Professor	qh	+1	1	uh hot can we make it more elegant 
Bed015.E.dialogueact2025	4303.94	4304.45	E	Grad	s^bk|%-	-1	0	uh hot can we make it more elegant 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2027	4305.52	4308.08	C	Professor	qh^e	-1	0	can can we what the generalizations and stuff rather than 
Bed015.E.dialogueact2026	4305.13	4305.36	E	Grad	b	-1	0	can can we 
Bed015.E.dialogueact2028	4306.28	4306.84	E	Grad	s	-1	0	what the generalizations 
Bed015.E.dialogueact2029	4306.9	4307.12	E	Grad	b	-1	0	what the generalizations and stuff 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2030	4308.32	4316.36	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	rather than to try to guess a here and structure and all that sort of stuff before know what they're doing so i was 
Bed015.E.dialogueact2031	4312.4	4312.59	E	Grad	b	-1	0	a here and 
Bed015.E.dialogueact2032	4314.96	4315.13	E	Grad	b	-1	0	of stuff before know what they're doing 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2033	4316.36	4319.13	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so i was in a short run when i could put we're not doing 
Bed015.E.dialogueact2034	4316.51	4316.8	E	Grad	b	-1	0	so i was 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2035	4319.13	4322.68	C	Professor	s	-1	0	put we're not doing them yet at all 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2036	4322.82	4325.65	C	Professor	s:s^fe	-1	0	at all and and it could be that halfway through we say ha we 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2037	4325.88	4327.88	C	Professor	s	-1	0	say ha we we now see how we want to clean it up 
Bed015.E.dialogueact2038	4328.13	4328.42	E	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed015.C.dialogueact2039	4329.76	4335.24	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and and heritages only one i mean that's one way to organize it but there are others 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2040	4335.24	4335.99	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it but there are others 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2042	4336.47	4337.84	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and may may not be the best way 
Bed015.E.dialogueact2041	4336.18	4336.54	E	Grad	b	-1	0	and may may not

Bed015.A.dialogueact2095	4473.78	4474.79	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so you have nothing 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2096	4476.34	4477.63	A	Grad	s	-1	0	just a white piece of paper 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2097	4476.42	4477.53	C	Professor	b	-1	0	just a white piece of paper 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2098	4477.79	4478.07	C	Professor	b	-1	0	of paper you 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2099	4479.09	4481.48	A	Grad	s	+1	0	sound clips like you know it's not a t. which 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2100	4481.85	4485.42	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	a t. which will tell you a bunch of stuff and parts are probably uh grab out the things that 
Bed015.F.dialogueact2101	4484.57	4487.15	F	Grad	s^2	+1	0	and parts are probably uh then right grab out the things that 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2102	4487.43	4487.69	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	then right 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2103	4487.98	4493.61	A	Grad	s	-1	0	then you're simply rights uh these into onto your your white piece of paper right 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2104	4494.38	4497.98	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and you would get a lot of no it's and stuff out of there you 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2105	4497.98	4500.94	A	Grad	s^df	+1	0	it's and stuff out of there you won't get you want really get any c. be keys therefore 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2106	4500.94	4505.02	A	Grad	s	+1	0	c. be keys therefore we need everything that can figures to what the situation is i eat the context 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2107	4505.02	4506.57	A	Grad	s	-1	0	i eat the context and stuff so you get 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2108	4506.57	4508.65	A	Grad	s^rt	+1	0	and stuff so you get whatever comes from discourse 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2109	4509.78	4510.77	A	Grad	s	-1	0	but also for 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2110	4510.87	4514.26	A	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	for the time to cheat right of and stuff from the discourse that's the situation 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2112	4514.59	4516.18	A	Grad	s	+1	0	that's the situation they use them i don't 
Bed015.F.dialogueact2111	4514.16	4514.48	F	Grad	b	-1	0	that's the situation 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2113	4517.12	4524.35	A	Grad	s	+1	1	and that because in your c. p. keys but which you can then call airy um the the net did you just wrote 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2114	4525.2	4530.48	A	Grad	s:s	+1	1	and find out how thing exodus construed ass and not friends you 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2115	4531.68	4534.78	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and be in bed to travel base work six second act that that once 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2116	4534.78	4535.49	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	second act that that once you 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2117	4536.05	4538.62	A	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	we have really precise plummeted which tried to three right 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2118	4538.62	4539.48	A	Grad	s	-1	0	tried to three right down your courage 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2119	4539.61	4540.19	A	Grad	s	-1	0	down your courage to get the and 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2120	4540.29	4540.98	A	Grad	s	-1	0	to get the and 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2121	4540.98	4541.78	A	Grad	s	-1	0	to get the and it sort of way 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2122	4543.04	4548.14	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and the the nice thing about this idea is that you don't ever have to sit down and think about it all right about it you may have some 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2123	4548.5	4556.53	A	Grad	s	+1	1	it you may have some general rule it's as to how things can be can be construed as watts so that women are you craft the the the initiative no it's but 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2124	4556.91	4559.63	A	Grad	s	-1	0	no it's but it's in that respect it's complete these cable 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2125	4560.14	4565.43	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because it doesn't have any prior um configuration it's just you 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2126	4565.43	4568.17	A	Grad	s	-1	0	it's just you need an apology of the the main and you need the context 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2127	4568.36	4571.55	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and you need the context depend modules and if 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2128	4571.82	4576.86	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and if this can be made to work at all be kind of empty 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2129	4577.68	4580.82	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	um it sounds to me like you want drams 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2130	4581.67	4583.32	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i'm so as at p. r. i'm i mean 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2131	4583.81	4587.98	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	i mean it it's says you can i followed the p. r. and into a straightforward pays that no no you 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2132	4583.84	4585.47	C	Professor	s^df.%-	-1	0	i mean it it's says you can i followed the p. 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2133	4587.49	4588.62	C	Professor	s^ar|s	-1	0	pays that no no you can't see the the 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2134	4588.7	4593.92	C	Professor	s	-1	0	can't see the the critical thing about the p. r. and is it gives these relations in general for 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2135	4594.22	4603.18	C	Professor	s	+1	0	then you're kind uhhuh yeah so once you have in stand shaded the p. r. and with the instances and there then you can then you can unfold 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2136	4601.05	4601.75	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	then you're kind there then you can 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2137	4603.41	4604.02	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	uhhuh yeah no i 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2138	4604.41	4606.52	A	Grad	s^ar|s^df	-1	0	no i was more amusing a generic so 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2139	4606.62	4610.72	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so probably provo take whatever tradition moderates 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2140	4611.06	4612.0	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	whatever you right it's whatever 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2142	4612.77	4613.19	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	whatever that it matters a lot 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2141	4612.69	4614.03	C	Professor	s	-1	0	whatever that it matters a lot because 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2143	4614.98	4618.36	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because you know you wonder these generalized worlds 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2144	4619.51	4620.63	C	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	about the way things are like they 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2145	4620.63	4622.67	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and then then essentially them things are like they do that in stand shade in each case 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2146	4621.39	4623.05	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	and then then essentially them that's maybe maybe do that in stand shade in each case yeah that's 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2148	4623.4	4626.02	A	Grad	s^am	-1	0	that's maybe maybe the the way it the only way it works yeah that's yeah that's all they could work 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2147	4623.24	4623.85	C	Professor	s^aa|%-	-1	0	that's maybe maybe yeah that's 
Bed015.A.dialogueact2149	4626.02	4626.02	A	Grad	%	-1	0	yeah that's all they could work 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2150	4626.15	4627.27	C	Professor	s^aa|s^aap	-1	0	yeah that's all they could work i 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2151	4627.55	4631.37	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i we have a our local expert on your rams uh 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2152	4631.77	4635.46	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh but my guess is that they're not currently good enough to do that that would we'll have 
Bed015.C.dialogueact2153	4635.46	4636.49	C	Professor	s	-1	0	do that that would we'll have to see
