The idea to create a language generation module for the system , along with the language understanding , was met with interest , although it was made clear that generation is not just the inverse of understanding.
Understanding what a construction entails does not mean the system can use the construction in all appropriate circumstances.
A dialogue producing system would be useful for training the system further , even though the number of input permutations could render the process computationally unwieldy.
Regarding the conference paper , it was noted that at this stage they have not completed any big parts of the system and there is no evaluation.
Similarly , the length of the paper would not allow for presentation of the formalism in detail.
The focus would have to be on cognitive motivations of the research , and not on system design , anyway.
Such motivations also apply to the belief-net: there are various direct or indirect ways to link features of the Ontology or Discourse with specific intentions.
The originating observation behind the whole project is that utterances like "Where is X?" are seemingly unambiguous , but , in context , they can acquire much more complex interpretations.
