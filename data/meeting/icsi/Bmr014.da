Bmr014.C.dialogueact50	103.809	105.349	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	It could be touching and fiddling ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact52	105.349	106.719	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and the other thing is that it could {disfmarker}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact53	107.079	109.149	C	Grad	s	-1	0	the fact that it 's on a wired mike is suspicious .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact54	109.149	110.039	C	Grad	s	-1	0	It might be a connector .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact55	110.221	110.681	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact56	110.811	111.311	F	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	Well maybe {disfmarker}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact57	111.591	113.291	F	Postdoc	s^cs.%--	-1	0	Then we don't really have to talk about that as an {disfmarker}
Bmr014.B.dialogueact59	113.423	116.683	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	You could try an experiment and say " OK , I 'm about to test for spikes " ,
Bmr014.F.dialogueact58	113.291	114.491	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I take that off the agenda .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact60	116.683	118.043	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	and then wiggle the thing there ,
Bmr014.B.dialogueact61	118.103	122.361	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and then go and when they go to transcribe it , it could , ask them to come and get you .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact62	118.306	118.546	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact63	118.636	118.896	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .

Bmr014.E.dialogueact66	125.634	126.134	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	Um .

Bmr014.B.dialogueact69	127.51	127.64	B	PhD	x	-1	0	
Bmr014.E.dialogueact70	129.251	143.14	E	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , were this a professional audio recording , {vocalsound} what we would do {disfmarker} {comment} what you would do is {disfmarker} in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that things are not giving that kind of performance .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact71	143.14	144.79	E	Professor	s	-1	0	And if they are , then they can't be used .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact72	145.179	145.429	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact73	146.733	147.113	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact74	148.974	149.894	E	Professor	fh|s^t1	-1	0	Um . Let 's see .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact75	149.894	157.309	E	Professor	s^t^tc	+1	0	I guess {pause} I would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on uh , recording , transcription
Bmr014.E.dialogueact76	157.449	159.719	E	Professor	s	+1	0	you know , basically you know where we are on the corpus .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact77	160.335	160.445	F	Postdoc	b.x	-1	0	Good .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact78	161.136	168.118	E	Professor	s^t	-1	0	And then um , the other thing which I would like to talk about which is a real meta - quest , I think , deal is , uh , agendas .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact79	169.975	171.575	E	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	So maybe I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll start with that actually .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact80	171.575	179.977	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , um . {vocalsound} Andreas brought up the fact that he would kinda like to know , if possible , what we were gonna be talking about
Bmr014.E.dialogueact81	179.977	184.365	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because he 's sort of peripherally involved to this point ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact82	184.525	191.935	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and if there 's gonna be a topic about {disfmarker} discussion about something that he uh strongly cares about then he would come
Bmr014.E.dialogueact83	191.935	195.977	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} And I think part of {disfmarker} part of his motivation with this is that he 's trying to help us out ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact84	195.977	203.592	E	Professor	s	-1	0	in the {disfmarker} because of uh the fact that the meetings are {disfmarker} are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up
Bmr014.E.dialogueact85	203.852	207.162	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and so , he figures he could help that out by not showing {disfmarker}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact87	207.469	207.869	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact86	207.162	209.562	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and I 'm sure help out his own time .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact88	210.476	213.556	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	by not showing up if it 's a meeting that he 's {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact89	214.076	215.466	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So , uh in order {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact90	215.586	218.904	E	Professor	s	-1	0	I 'd {disfmarker} I think that this is a wish on his part .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact91	218.904	220.644	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh . It 's actually gonna be hard
Bmr014.E.dialogueact92	220.644	225.794	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because it seems like a lot of times uh things come up that are unanticipated
Bmr014.E.dialogueact93	225.794	226.514	E	Professor	%--	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact95	227.39	227.61	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact94	227.365	230.045	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	But um , we could try anyway ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact96	230.235	235.615	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh , do another try at coming up with the agenda uh , at some point before the meeting ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact97	236.075	237.365	E	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	uh , say the day before .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact98	236.94	245.74	C	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	Well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to {pause} like on Wednesday , or Tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact99	245.591	245.861	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact100	247.519	247.859	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	OK .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact101	248.429	249.509	E	Professor	qy^cs^rt	-1	0	You {disfmarker} you wanna volunteer to do that ?
Bmr014.C.dialogueact102	249.742	249.912	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Sure .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact103	250.339	250.629	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact104	251.384	253.604	E	Professor	s	-1	0	Alright so we 'll send out agenda request .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact106	254.313	254.613	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	Let me
Bmr014.E.dialogueact105	254.164	254.614	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact107	255.07	255.39	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	That 'll be {disfmarker}
Bmr014.B.dialogueact108	255.39	256.37	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I think that 'll help {disfmarker}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact109	255.51	258.26	C	Grad	s	-1	0	I 'll put that on my spare brain or it will not {pause} get done .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact110	257.344	258.614	B	PhD	s^r	-1	0	That 'll help a lot , actually .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact111	258.55	264.76	E	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah , I have to tell you for the uh {disfmarker} for the admin meeting that we have , Lila does that um every time before an admin meeting .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact112	265.447	270.647	E	Professor	s	-1	0	And uh , she ends up getting the agenda requests uh , uh ten minutes before the meeting .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact113	270.707	273.087	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} {comment} But .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact114	273.697	275.576	E	Professor	s^cs^rt	-1	0	Uh . {comment} But we can try .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact115	276.246	276.806	E	Professor	s	-1	0	Maybe it 'll work .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact117	277.415	277.885	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact116	277.373	277.563	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact118	277.563	278.023	C	Grad	s^am	-1	0	Maybe .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact120	279.089	280.169	C	Grad	s^j^rt	-1	0	Weirder things have happened .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact119	278.947	279.147	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact121	282.543	286.273	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I 'm wondering if he were to just , uh , specify particular topics ,
Bmr014.F.dialogueact122	286.273	286.693	F	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	I mean .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact123	288.048	292.488	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Maybe we 'd be able to meet that request of his a little more .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact124	292.42	298.45	B	PhD	s	-1	0	I would {disfmarker} I would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there 'll be more things of interest to him .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact125	292.985	293.455	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	Well then {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact126	298.68	298.88	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact127	299.827	300.507	E	Professor	fg|%-	-1	0	Actually it {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact128	300.757	303.907	E	Professor	s^tc.%--	-1	0	This {disfmarker} this maybe brings up another topic which is um {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact129	304.627	305.607	E	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	So we 're done with that topic .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact130	305.607	311.467	E	Professor	s^t	+1	1	The other topic I was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact131	310.862	313.962	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , actually I {disfmarker} I was going to say we need to {pause} talk about that too .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact132	312.8	312.96	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact133	314.53	315.58	E	Professor	qh^cs	-1	0	Why {disfmarker} why don't we do that .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact134	315.706	315.926	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact135	316.106	318.706	C	Grad	fh|s	+1	2	Um , the new microphones , the two new ones are in .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact136	319.38	323.07	C	Grad	fh|s	+1	0	Um . {pause} And they are being assembled as we speak , I hope .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact137	323.57	326.34	C	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	And I didn't bring my car today so I 'm gonna pick them up tomorrow .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact138	327.056	330.786	C	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	Um , and then the other question I was thinking about is {disfmarker} well , a couple things .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact139	330.786	336.71	C	Grad	s^cs	+1	0	First of all , if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable , we should probably just go ahead and get them .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact140	337.475	339.725	C	Grad	s	+1	0	So we 'll have to evaluate that when they come in ,
Bmr014.A.dialogueact142	339.865	339.945	A	PhD	b	-1	0	
Bmr014.C.dialogueact141	339.725	342.185	C	Grad	s	+1	0	and get people 's opinions on {disfmarker} on what they think of them .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact143	342.77	346.85	C	Grad	fh|s^cs	-1	0	Um , then the other question I had is maybe we should get another wireless .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact144	347.568	348.558	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	Another wireless setup .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact145	348.558	353.518	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	I mean it 's expensive , but it does seem to be {pause} better than the wired .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact146	354.13	358.34	E	Professor	qw	+1	0	So how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup ?
Bmr014.C.dialogueact147	358.997	362.777	C	Grad	h|s	+1	0	Um , well , I 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together
Bmr014.C.dialogueact148	362.777	366.077	C	Grad	s	+1	2	so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact149	366.791	369.661	C	Grad	s	+1	0	So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact150	370.251	372.031	C	Grad	s	-1	0	possibility of six wireless receivers ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact151	372.031	373.901	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and apparently you can chain those together .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact152	374.424	379.964	C	Grad	s	+1	2	And so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact153	380.91	382.32	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	So , um .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact154	382.052	382.372	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact156	383.022	385.242	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So , you know it 's still , it 's fifteen minus six .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact155	382.89	383.37	E	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	So let 's see we {disfmarker}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact157	386.484	386.694	C	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr014.C.dialogueact158	386.694	388.044	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So we could have up to nine .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact159	389.44	390.83	E	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	And right now we can have up to six .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact160	390.76	391.06	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact161	391.52	393.13	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And we have five , we 're getting one more .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact162	393.53	393.82	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact163	396.41	399.6	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And it 's um , about nine hundred dollars for the base station ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact164	399.94	401.55	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and then eight hundred per channel .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact165	403.8	404.02	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact166	404.09	405.56	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So yeah so the only {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact167	405.79	409.34	E	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	Beyond the mike {disfmarker} the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact168	408.676	408.916	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact169	409.942	410.572	E	Professor	s^co	-1	0	Oh , we should do it .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact170	411.078	411.298	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact172	412.2	416.51	C	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	OK , so I 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and {disfmarker} and then just go ahead and order them .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact171	412.02	412.28	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact173	414.68	414.91	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact174	415.49	417.84	B	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	I don't quite understand how that {disfmarker} how that works , .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact175	417.84	418.14	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	If {disfmarker}
Bmr014.B.dialogueact176	419.21	421.33	B	PhD	s^bu	+1	0	So we 're not increasing the number of channels .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact178	421.33	421.92	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact177	420.955	424.755	C	Grad	s^ar|s	+1	2	No , we 're just replacing the wired {disfmarker} the two wired that are still working ,
Bmr014.B.dialogueact179	421.92	422.31	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact180	422.31	422.65	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact181	425.731	430.201	C	Grad	s	+1	2	along with a couple of the wired that aren't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with a wireless .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact182	430.73	430.95	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact184	431.97	432.91	B	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	Three wireds work ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact183	431.51	432.44	E	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	Basically we found {disfmarker}
Bmr014.B.dialogueact185	432.91	433.07	B	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr014.C.dialogueact186	433.95	436.46	C	Grad	s^na	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I guess three wireds work , yeah .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact187	434.89	435.01	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact188	435.19	435.61	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact189	435.739	436.019	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact190	436.449	437.849	E	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	But we 've had more problems with that .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact191	438.122	438.362	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact192	438.189	441.539	E	Professor	s	-1	0	And that sort of bypasses the whole {disfmarker} the whole Jimbox thing and all that .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact193	441.25	441.47	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact194	441.609	449.431	E	Professor	s	-1	0	And so um , we {disfmarker} we seem to have uh , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra Sony radio mikes ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact195	449.431	451.291	E	Professor	s	-1	0	as long as we 're conscious about the batteries .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact197	451.55	451.79	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact196	451.401	454.096	E	Professor	s	-1	0	That seems to be the key issue .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact198	452.63	453.41	C	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Everyone 's battery OK ?
Bmr014.B.dialogueact199	454.586	455.396	B	PhD	s	-1	0	I checked them this morning ,
Bmr014.B.dialogueact200	455.396	455.736	B	PhD	s^na	-1	0	they should be .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact201	455.398	455.738	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact202	456.293	456.613	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact203	457.346	460.508	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um , {vocalsound} That 's the only thing with them .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact204	460.508	461.938	E	Professor	s	-1	0	But the quality seems really good
Bmr014.E.dialogueact205	461.938	462.088	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact206	463.354	471.224	E	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	Um I heard from UW that they 're {disfmarker} they 're uh very close to getting their , uh setup purchased .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact207	471.284	474.514	E	Professor	s	-1	0	They 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact208	475.18	479.56	C	Grad	s^cs	+1	1	Well we should talk to them about it because I know that SRI is also in the process of looking at stuff ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact209	480.328	484.528	C	Grad	s	+1	1	and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone {disfmarker} on the same page with that .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact210	482.81	483.11	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact211	484.448	484.878	B	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	SRI ,
Bmr014.B.dialogueact212	484.878	485.178	B	PhD	qy^bh^rt	-1	0	really ?
Bmr014.C.dialogueact213	485.256	485.466	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact214	485.83	485.9	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact215	486.09	486.79	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	They got sa apparent
Bmr014.C.dialogueact216	487.55	491.42	C	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Well , Maybe {pause} this needs to be bleeped out ?
Bmr014.C.dialogueact217	491.42	492.03	C	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I have no clue .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact218	493.067	493.997	E	Professor	h|s^no	-1	0	Uh , I don't know .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact219	493.98	495.11	C	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I don't know how much of it 's public .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact220	493.997	495.897	E	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	Probably we shouldn't {disfmarker} probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact221	496.41	496.61	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact222	496.714	496.974	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact223	497.224	504.464	E	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	But anyway there 's {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and {disfmarker} and uh {disfmarker} and NIST and UW .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact224	504.464	504.784	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact225	505.661	511.511	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um . But {disfmarker} but yeah I thin I think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is {disfmarker} is quite positive with the Sony ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact227	511.93	512.14	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact226	511.761	513.031	E	Professor	s	-1	0	uh , radio - mikes .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact228	513.548	517.588	E	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	Now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets
Bmr014.E.dialogueact229	517.588	521.755	E	Professor	s	-1	0	meaning changing the connector , which means some hand - soldering or something ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact230	521.755	522.075	E	Professor	qy^bu^d^g	-1	0	right ?
Bmr014.C.dialogueact231	522.31	523.09	C	Grad	h|s^ar	-1	0	Uh , no ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact233	523.09	524.79	C	Grad	s	-1	0	we 're having the {disfmarker} them do it .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact232	522.81	523.11	E	Professor	qy^bh^m^rt	-1	0	No ?
Bmr014.C.dialogueact234	524.79	527.07	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So it 's so hand - soldering it , but I 'm not doing it .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact235	525.26	525.41	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact237	527.98	529.4	C	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	So , they {disfmarker} they charge
Bmr014.E.dialogueact236	527.49	527.8	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact238	528.85	530.58	E	Professor	s	-1	0	Nothing against you and your hand - soldering
Bmr014.C.dialogueact239	529.71	529.95	C	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact240	530.76	530.97	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact241	531.817	533.067	C	Grad	s	-1	0	You 've never seen my hand - soldering .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact242	534.643	537.16	C	Grad	s	-1	0	But uh , a as I said they 're coming in .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact243	535.078	537.488	E	Professor	fh|s^bs^tc.%--	-1	0	Uh , OK , so that 's being done professionally
Bmr014.E.dialogueact244	537.488	537.588	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact246	538.21	538.68	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact245	537.838	538.008	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact247	538.68	538.94	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact248	538.94	539.35	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	I mean .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact249	539.399	539.629	E	Professor	s^aa^r	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact250	539.98	541.7	C	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	As professionally as I guess you can get it done .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact251	543.36	544.64	E	Professor	s^arp.%--	-1	0	Well , it could {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact252	544.64	545.91	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	if they do a lot of it , it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact253	545.17	547.12	C	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean i it 's just their repair shop .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact254	548.26	548.42	C	Grad	qy^f^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr014.C.dialogueact255	548.55	549.58	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Their maintenance people .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact256	550.331	551.781	E	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , we 'll see what it {disfmarker} it 's like .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact257	551.427	551.637	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact258	551.781	553.221	E	Professor	s	-1	0	That {disfmarker} tha that can be quite good .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact259	553.221	553.851	E	Professor	%--	-1	0	Th - this {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact260	554.031	554.591	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , OK .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact261	557.67	557.85	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	Good .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact262	557.85	558.05	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact263	558.05	558.86	E	Professor	s^co	-1	0	So let 's go with that .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact265	559.82	562.24	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And , I mean we 'll see , tomorrow , you know , what it looks like .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact264	559.68	560.28	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	Uh ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact266	561.499	561.869	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact267	563.69	571.22	E	Professor	s	-1	0	So , um , uh , Dave isn't here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact268	572.03	575.25	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , so he 'll be interested in what 's going on with that .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact269	575.25	575.71	E	Professor	%--	-1	0	I guess {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact270	576.11	583.91	E	Professor	qy^bu^rt	+1	1	Was {disfmarker} the decision last time was that the {disfmarker} the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well ?
Bmr014.E.dialogueact272	583.91	585.28	E	Professor	qr.%--	+1	1	Has that started , or is that {disfmarker} ?
Bmr014.F.dialogueact271	583.548	583.838	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact273	584.048	584.208	F	Postdoc	s^aa	+1	1	Yeah .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact274	584.828	589.088	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Uh , it would be to use his interface and I was going to meet with him today about that .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact275	589.33	593.9	C	Grad	s^bk|fg|s	-1	0	Right , so , the decision was that Jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact276	593.9	596.13	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So I did the {disfmarker} all that last week .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact277	596.81	600.49	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So all the {disfmarker} all the forms are now {pause} on the computer .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact278	601.51	607.73	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And uh , then I have a bunch of scripts that we 'll read those and let the uh {pause} transcribers use different tools .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact279	607.73	611.1	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And I just want to talk to Jane about how we transition to using those .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact280	610.834	610.984	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact281	611.394	612.794	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	So he has a nice set up that they {disfmarker}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact282	613.034	614.844	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it w it will be efficient for them to do that .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact283	615.08	615.41	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact285	615.64	616.9	C	Grad	s	+1	0	I {disfmarker} I don't think it 'll take too long .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact284	615.56	615.98	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	So anyway {disfmarker}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact286	617.23	620.52	C	Grad	s^e	+1	1	So , you know , just uh , a matter of a few days I suspect .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact287	621.48	627.45	E	Professor	s	-1	0	So anyway I think we {disfmarker} we have at least one uh , user for the digits once they get done , which will be Dave .

Bmr014.C.dialogueact351	707.18	708.78	C	Grad	fg|s	+1	1	Well , we have about thirty - two hours
Bmr014.C.dialogueact352	709.84	715.248	C	Grad	h|s	-1	0	uh as of , I guess a week and a half ago ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact353	715.338	717.858	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so we probably now have about thirty - five hours .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact354	718.285	720.395	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and that 's {disfmarker} that 's uh {disfmarker}

Bmr014.E.dialogueact357	722.365	723.295	E	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	that 's including digits ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact358	723.29	724.23	C	Grad	s^m^na	+1	0	That 's including digits .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact359	723.295	723.565	E	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	right ?
Bmr014.C.dialogueact361	724.74	727.57	C	Grad	s	-1	0	I haven't separated it out so I have no clue how much of that is digits .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact360	724.465	724.745	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact362	726.95	727.22	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact363	727.56	729.55	E	Professor	s	-1	0	So anyway there 's at least probably thirty hours ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact364	729.55	730.44	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	or something of {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact365	731.587	732.597	E	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	There 's got to be more than thirty hour {disfmarker}
Bmr014.A.dialogueact369	733.066	734.446	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact367	732.73	733.87	C	Grad	qy^bu^rt	+1	1	Of {disfmarker} of non - digits ?
Bmr014.E.dialogueact366	732.597	732.997	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	i it couldn't {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact368	733.057	734.42	E	Professor	s^m^na	-1	0	of {disfmarker} Of non - digits .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact370	733.96	734.84	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , absolutely .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact372	734.84	736.59	C	Grad	s	+1	0	I mean , the digits don't take up that much time .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact371	734.42	735.31	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact373	736.708	736.998	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact374	737.862	739.652	F	Postdoc	fg|s.%--	-1	0	OK , and the transcribers h
Bmr014.F.dialogueact375	739.732	741.152	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I , uh , don't have the exact numbers ,
Bmr014.F.dialogueact376	741.152	746.75	F	Postdoc	s.x	+1	2	but I {pause} think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh , transcribing from them right now .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact377	747.19	754.242	F	Postdoc	s.x	+1	2	The next step is to {disfmarker} that I 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact378	754.672	757.152	F	Postdoc	s.x	+1	1	What I mean by clean is that they 're spell - checked ,
Bmr014.F.dialogueact379	757.272	759.332	F	Postdoc	s.x	+1	2	that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout ,
Bmr014.F.dialogueact380	759.402	772.691	F	Postdoc	s.x	+1	2	and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh , Liz requested in terms of um , um {pause} in terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which I hadn't been specific about .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact381	773.277	776.917	F	Postdoc	h|s	-1	0	Um , for example , i they 'll say uh " ninety - two " .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact382	777.217	778.687	F	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	And you know , so how {disfmarker} you could {disfmarker}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact383	779.11	779.75	C	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Nine two ,
Bmr014.F.dialogueact384	779.234	780.404	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	e Exactly .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact385	779.99	780.34	C	Grad	b	-1	0	right .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact386	780.404	783.134	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So if you just say " nine two " , the {disfmarker} there are many s ways that could have been expressed .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact387	783.134	783.974	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	An - and I just had them {disfmarker}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact388	784.284	786.734	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I mean , a certain number of them did put the words down ,
Bmr014.F.dialogueact389	787.197	792.947	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by , um , a gloss th and things .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact390	792.18	792.63	B	PhD	qy^d^g	-1	0	You know , Jane ?
Bmr014.C.dialogueact391	792.341	792.591	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact392	792.88	793.72	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Um , one suggestion
Bmr014.B.dialogueact393	793.72	794.85	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	and you may already be doing this ,
Bmr014.B.dialogueact394	794.85	801.584	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but I 've noticed in the past that when I 've gone through transcriptions and you know in {disfmarker} in order to build lexicons and things ,
Bmr014.B.dialogueact395	801.584	811.497	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	if you um , just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them , {comment} a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of {pause} inconsistencies and mis
Bmr014.C.dialogueact396	809.7	810.28	C	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Misspelled .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact397	810.34	810.67	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact398	810.622	813.582	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	You 're talking about the type token frequency listings , and I use those too .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact399	813.812	816.652	F	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	Y you mean just uh {pause} on each {disfmarker} on each line there 's a one word
Bmr014.F.dialogueact400	816.652	816.882	F	Postdoc	qy^d^g	-1	0	right ?
Bmr014.F.dialogueact401	816.882	818.792	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It 's one token from the {disfmarker} from the corpus .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact402	817.928	818.338	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .

Bmr014.F.dialogueact404	819.051	820.581	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Yeah , those are e extremely efficient
Bmr014.F.dialogueact405	820.581	822.601	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	and I and I {disfmarker} I agree that 's a very good use of it .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact406	821.701	822.481	B	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	Oh so you already have that ,
Bmr014.B.dialogueact407	822.481	822.761	B	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact408	822.921	824.341	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	Well that 's {disfmarker} that 's a way {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact409	824.341	826.251	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	You know , the spell - check basically does that
Bmr014.F.dialogueact410	826.251	827.251	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but in addition {disfmarker}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact411	827.401	834.102	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yes , that 's {disfmarker} that 's exactly the strategy I wanna do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact412	833.802	834.012	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact414	834.452	837.162	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other , and uh ,

Bmr014.B.dialogueact417	837.922	841.452	B	PhD	s	-1	0	i in alphabetized lists , they 'll appear next to each other and {disfmarker} and so it makes it easier .

Bmr014.F.dialogueact421	843.667	847.977	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And that was {disfmarker} that 's my strategy for handling a lot of these things , in terms of things that need to be glossed .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact422	847.977	849.377	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I didn't get to that point
Bmr014.F.dialogueact423	849.377	849.617	F	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact424	849.916	852.096	F	Postdoc	s^rt	+1	1	So there are numbers , then there are acronyms ,
Bmr014.F.dialogueact425	852.446	861.946	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and then um , there 's a {disfmarker} he she wants the uh , actually a {disfmarker} an explicit marker of what type of comment this is ,

Bmr014.B.dialogueact433	877.83	878.69	B	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Oh that 's great .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact432	877.545	879.975	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but I {disfmarker} I haven't been asking these people to do it systematically
Bmr014.F.dialogueact434	879.975	883.215	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	cuz I think it most {disfmarker} ha most efficiently handled by uh {disfmarker} by a {disfmarker} a filter .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact435	883.215	884.545	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	That was what I was always planing on .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact436	884.545	885.965	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	So that , you know you get a whole long list {disfmarker}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact437	885.965	886.825	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	exactly what you 're saying ,
Bmr014.F.dialogueact438	887.161	889.871	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you get a whole list of things that say " curly bracket laugh curly bracket " ,
Bmr014.B.dialogueact439	889.937	890.377	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact440	890.331	891.911	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	then y you know it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact441	891.911	899.381	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	You {disfmarker} you risk less error if you handle it by a filter , than if you have this transcriber ch laboriously typing in sort of a VOC space ,
Bmr014.B.dialogueact442	898.14	898.34	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact443	899.381	901.391	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so man So many ways that error prone .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact444	900.27	900.56	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact445	901.0	901.32	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact446	901.928	910.246	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	So , um , {vocalsound} um I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm going to convert that via a filter , into these tagged uh , subcategorized comments ,
Bmr014.F.dialogueact447	910.818	914.118	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and same thing with you know , we see you get a subset when you do what you 're saying ,
Bmr014.B.dialogueact449	914.465	915.285	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact448	914.118	918.118	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you end up with a s with uh , you 're collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens
Bmr014.B.dialogueact451	918.143	918.803	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact450	918.118	922.188	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and you can um , have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact452	922.468	924.928	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	But the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand ,
Bmr014.F.dialogueact453	924.928	926.428	F	Postdoc	s^df.%--	-1	0	because , you know I mean , jus
Bmr014.C.dialogueact454	926.29	927.29	C	Grad	s^2	-1	0	You don't know what they could be .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact456	927.87	928.33	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact455	927.661	931.591	F	Postdoc	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah now TIMIT 's clear um {pause} and PLP is clear
Bmr014.F.dialogueact457	932.511	935.971	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	but uh there are things that are not so well known , in {disfmarker}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact458	936.021	941.531	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	or {disfmarker} or have variant {disfmarker} u u uses like the numbers you can say " nine two " or you can say " ninety - two " ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact460	942.56	943.82	C	Grad	qw.%--	-1	0	So how are you doing the {disfmarker}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact459	942.271	942.531	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and uh
Bmr014.F.dialogueact461	943.848	945.408	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I 'd handle the numbers individually .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact462	945.56	949.76	C	Grad	qw	+1	0	How are you doing the uh , acronyms so if I say PZM what would it appear on the transcript ?
Bmr014.F.dialogueact463	949.226	949.896	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It would be separate {disfmarker}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact464	949.896	951.986	F	Postdoc	s^e	+1	0	The letters would be separated in space
Bmr014.C.dialogueact465	951.064	951.304	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact466	952.266	955.836	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and potentially they 'll have a curly bracket thing afterwards
Bmr014.F.dialogueact467	955.836	956.136	F	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	e
Bmr014.F.dialogueact468	956.326	958.416	F	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	but I 'm not sure if that 's necessary , clarifying what it is ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact469	957.46	957.71	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact470	958.416	959.876	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so gloss of {pause} whatever .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact471	960.02	960.29	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact472	960.303	961.873	F	Postdoc	s^no^r	-1	0	I don't know if that 's really necessary to do that .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact473	962.255	971.073	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Maybe it 's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is uh , a step away from i indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there ,
Bmr014.F.dialogueact474	971.073	977.087	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and indicating why they 're there to indicate that it 's uh {vocalsound} the you know , {comment} uh enumerated , or i
Bmr014.C.dialogueact475	972.918	973.358	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact476	977.267	978.407	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it 's not a good way of saying {disfmarker}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact477	978.547	983.357	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but it 's {disfmarker} it 's the {vocalsound} specific uh way of stating these {disfmarker} these letters .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact478	983.094	983.354	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact479	983.424	984.044	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So it sounds good .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact480	985.29	987.48	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And so anyway , the clean {disfmarker} those are those things
Bmr014.F.dialogueact481	987.48	992.47	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and then channelized is to then um , get it into this multichannel format .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact482	992.929	996.429	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And at that point then it 's ready for use by Liz and Don .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact483	996.669	999.759	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But that 's been my top priority {disfmarker} beyond getting it tanel channelized ,
Bmr014.F.dialogueact484	999.759	1002.99	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact485	1002.49	1002.8	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact486	1002.89	1003.09	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact487	1003.55	1013.05	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	And uh , Thilo had a {disfmarker} e e a breakthrough with this {disfmarker} this last week in terms of getting the channel - based um uh s s speech - nonspeech segmentation um , up and running
Bmr014.F.dialogueact488	1013.05	1014.88	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and I haven't {disfmarker} I haven't been able to use that yet
Bmr014.F.dialogueact489	1014.88	1015.4	F	Postdoc	s^df.%--	-1	0	cuz I 'm working
Bmr014.F.dialogueact490	1015.4	1015.81	F	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	s re
Bmr014.F.dialogueact491	1016.01	1019.0	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	this is my top priority {disfmarker} get the data clean , and channelized .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact492	1018.49	1019.19	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I actually gave
Bmr014.C.dialogueact493	1018.82	1020.47	C	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Have you also been doing spot checks , Jane ?
Bmr014.F.dialogueact494	1020.86	1021.43	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Oh yes .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact495	1021.48	1021.86	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Okay , good .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact496	1021.56	1022.89	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Well you see that 's part of the cleaning process .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact497	1022.89	1024.27	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	I spent um
Bmr014.F.dialogueact498	1024.62	1029.73	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	actually um I have a segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by two of our transcribers ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact499	1029.46	1030.03	C	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Oh good .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact500	1030.03	1030.22	C	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Good .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact501	1030.13	1035.23	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and I went through it last night , it 's {disfmarker} it 's almost spooky how similar these are , word for word .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact502	1035.31	1039.55	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And there are some differences in commas cuz commas I {disfmarker} I left them discretion at commas .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact503	1039.78	1039.96	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact504	1039.99	1041.29	F	Postdoc	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker} and so
Bmr014.F.dialogueact505	1041.7	1044.98	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	because it 's not part of our st of our ne needed conventions .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact506	1044.73	1045.1	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact507	1045.47	1046.26	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	And um ,
Bmr014.F.dialogueact508	1047.67	1049.94	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} so they 'll be a difference in commas ,
Bmr014.F.dialogueact509	1049.94	1053.77	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but it 's word - by - word the same , in {disfmarker} in huge patches of the data .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact510	1053.77	1056.26	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And I have t ten minute stretch where I can {disfmarker} where I can show that .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact511	1056.48	1060.92	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon ,
Bmr014.F.dialogueact512	1061.0	1063.39	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact513	1063.39	1068.03	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So um , the one i i the colloquial speech person picked up " gobbledy - gook " .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact514	1064.04	1064.55	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact515	1068.86	1069.9	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And the other one didn't .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact516	1070.17	1077.97	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And on this side , this one 's picking up things like " neural nets " and the one that 's good on the sp o on th the vocabulary on the uh colloquial didn't .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact517	1076.7	1076.83	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact518	1077.71	1078.25	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	When {disfmarker}
Bmr014.B.dialogueact519	1078.25	1080.76	B	PhD	qw	-1	0	for the person who missed " gobbledy - gook " what did they put ?
Bmr014.F.dialogueact520	1081.42	1084.13	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It was an interesting approximation , put in parentheses ,
Bmr014.F.dialogueact521	1084.13	1087.53	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	cuz I have this convention that , i if they 're not sure what it was , they put it in parentheses .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact522	1087.32	1088.02	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact523	1087.53	1089.44	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	So they tried to approximate it , but it was {disfmarker}
Bmr014.B.dialogueact524	1088.72	1089.31	B	PhD	s^ba^rt	-1	0	Oh good .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact525	1090.02	1093.07	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	it was spelled GABBL {disfmarker}
Bmr014.B.dialogueact526	1093.03	1093.97	B	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Sort of how it sounds .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact529	1094.41	1094.78	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact527	1093.95	1094.37	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact528	1094.38	1095.6	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	More of an attempt to {disfmarker}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact530	1096.0	1100.79	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean apparently it was very clear to her that these {disfmarker} the a this {disfmarker} this was a sound {disfmarker} these are the sounds ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact531	1099.1	1101.08	C	Grad	s	-1	0	It was a technical term that she didn't recognize ,
Bmr014.B.dialogueact532	1101.15	1101.48	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact533	1101.28	1101.41	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact534	1101.41	1101.67	F	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact535	1101.67	1102.85	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But she knew that she didn't know it .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact536	1102.86	1103.63	F	Postdoc	s^na.%--	-1	0	Maybe it was a technical ter
Bmr014.F.dialogueact537	1103.63	1104.03	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	exactly .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact538	1104.26	1107.59	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	But she {disfmarker} even though her technical perception is just really {disfmarker} uh you
Bmr014.F.dialogueact539	1107.6	1112.26	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	know I 've {disfmarker} I 'm tempted to ask her if she 's taken any courses in this area or if she 's taken cognitive science courses
Bmr014.C.dialogueact540	1112.12	1112.35	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact541	1112.26	1116.88	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	then cuz " neural nets " and {disfmarker} oh she has some things that are {disfmarker} oh " downsampled " , she got that right .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact542	1112.83	1113.02	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact543	1117.51	1119.81	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And some of these are rather {pause} uh unexpected .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact544	1119.45	1119.95	C	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Obscure ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact545	1119.95	1120.23	C	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact546	1120.24	1124.73	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But ch ten solid uh {disfmarker} m ch s chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact548	1125.66	1128.51	E	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and again the main track that you 're working with is elev eleven hours ?
Bmr014.F.dialogueact547	1125.17	1125.83	F	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	And um {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact549	1128.59	1129.04	E	Professor	qy^g	-1	0	Is that right ?
Bmr014.F.dialogueact550	1129.15	1129.8	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yes exactly .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact551	1129.96	1130.32	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , OK .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact552	1130.35	1131.07	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And that 's part of this {disfmarker}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact553	1132.05	1132.8	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Eleven hours .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact554	1133.06	1134.78	E	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Is that {disfmarker} is that {disfmarker} that including digits ?
Bmr014.E.dialogueact556	1135.78	1136.0	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact555	1135.4	1135.94	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yes it is .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact557	1136.37	1139.11	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So let 's say roughly {pause} ten hours or so of {disfmarker}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact558	1136.5	1136.65	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact559	1140.04	1144.5	E	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean it 's probably more than that but {disfmarker} but with {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of non - digits .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact561	1141.19	1141.59	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact560	1140.94	1141.73	F	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	It 'd be more than that
Bmr014.F.dialogueact562	1141.73	1146.76	F	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because I {disfmarker} my recollection is the minutes {disfmarker} that da digits don't take more than half a minute . Per person .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact563	1147.34	1147.79	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact564	1148.04	1152.22	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But um {pause} the {disfmarker} the total set that I gave them is twelve hours of tape ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact565	1152.93	1153.33	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , I see .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact566	1153.01	1154.82	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But they haven't gotten to the end of that yet .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact568	1155.17	1155.68	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , I see .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact567	1154.82	1159.18	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So they 're still working {disfmarker} some of them are {disfmarker} Two of them are still working on completing that .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact569	1161.14	1161.38	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact570	1164.53	1165.46	B	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Boy , they 're moving right along .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact572	1165.95	1166.18	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact571	1165.6	1166.08	F	Postdoc	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yeah . They are .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact573	1166.24	1167.16	F	Postdoc	s^aa|s^ba^na	-1	0	Mm - hmm . They 're very efficient .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact574	1167.16	1169.69	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	There 're some who have more hours that they devote to it than others .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact576	1169.91	1170.32	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact575	1169.66	1169.99	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact577	1170.89	1171.02	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact578	1172.52	1174.34	E	Professor	qw^tc.%--	-1	0	So what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what 's the deal with {disfmarker} with your {disfmarker}
Bmr014.A.dialogueact579	1175.22	1176.24	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	The channel u thing ?
Bmr014.E.dialogueact580	1176.15	1176.36	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact581	1176.89	1181.78	A	PhD	s	+1	1	Oh , it 's just uh , I ran the recognizer {disfmarker} uh , the {pause} {comment} speech - nonspeech detector on different channels
Bmr014.A.dialogueact582	1181.79	1185.65	A	PhD	s	+1	0	and , it 's just in uh {disfmarker} in this new multi - channel format and output ,
Bmr014.A.dialogueact583	1185.65	1192.67	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and I just gave one {disfmarker} one meeting to {disfmarker} to Liz who wanted to {disfmarker} to try it for {disfmarker} for the recognizer
Bmr014.E.dialogueact584	1185.68	1186.35	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , I see .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact585	1193.19	1201.1	A	PhD	s	+1	1	as uh , apparently the recognizer had problems with those long chunks of speech , which took too much memory or whatever ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact586	1197.54	1197.86	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact588	1201.7	1205.1	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and so {pause} she {disfmarker} she will try that I think
Bmr014.E.dialogueact587	1201.25	1201.44	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact589	1205.1	1205.59	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr014.A.dialogueact590	1206.18	1207.23	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm working on it .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact591	1207.43	1208.48	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So , I hope {disfmarker}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact592	1208.06	1211.47	C	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Is this anything different than the HMM system you were using before ?
Bmr014.E.dialogueact593	1208.18	1208.38	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact594	1209.85	1210.15	A	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact595	1211.83	1217.72	A	PhD	h|s.%--	-1	0	Uh , I {pause} mmm , use some {disfmarker} some different features but not {disfmarker} not {disfmarker}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact596	1216.79	1217.15	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact597	1218.02	1220.03	A	PhD	s	+1	0	The basic thing is this HMM base .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact598	1219.34	1224.43	C	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	So there 's still no {disfmarker} no knowledge using different channels at the same time .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact600	1224.77	1229.45	A	PhD	s	-1	0	There is some , uh as the energy is normalized across channels
Bmr014.C.dialogueact599	1224.6	1225.17	C	Grad	qy^f	-1	0	You know what I mean ?
Bmr014.C.dialogueact601	1228.83	1229.6	C	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Across all of them .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact602	1229.66	1229.75	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact603	1229.69	1229.93	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact604	1230.26	1230.48	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact605	1231.41	1234.32	A	PhD	s	-1	0	But basically that 's one of the main changes .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact606	1233.96	1234.25	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact607	1234.96	1235.35	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact608	1236.19	1239.8	E	Professor	qw	-1	0	What are some of the other features ? Besides the energy ?
Bmr014.E.dialogueact609	1240.43	1242.25	E	Professor	s	-1	0	You said you 're trying some different features , or something .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact610	1242.34	1249.2	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Oh I just uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Mmm , I just use um our loudness - based things
Bmr014.A.dialogueact611	1249.28	1250.15	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	now as they {disfmarker}
Bmr014.A.dialogueact612	1250.15	1255.92	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	before there were {disfmarker} they were some in {disfmarker} in the log domain and I {disfmarker} I changed this to the {disfmarker} to the {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact613	1255.67	1256.51	E	Professor	s^2^bu^rt	-1	0	Cu - Cube root ?
Bmr014.A.dialogueact614	1256.82	1256.93	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact615	1257.3	1257.69	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	To {disfmarker}
Bmr014.A.dialogueact616	1259.13	1263.29	A	PhD	s^aa^bsc|s.%--	-1	0	No , I changed this to the {disfmarker} to the {disfmarker} to the loudness thingy with the {disfmarker} with the
Bmr014.C.dialogueact617	1261.75	1262.51	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact618	1262.34	1262.51	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Ah .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact619	1263.4	1264.11	A	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	how do you call it ?
Bmr014.A.dialogueact620	1264.12	1264.74	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I 'm not sure .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact621	1265.38	1267.15	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	With the , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact622	1266.67	1267.46	E	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Fletcher Munson ?
Bmr014.E.dialogueact623	1267.78	1268.02	E	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact624	1269.5	1270.53	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I 'm not sure about the term .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact625	1270.91	1271.24	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact626	1271.75	1272.91	A	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	Uh , I 'll look it up .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact628	1273.54	1274.09	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And say it to you .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact627	1273.11	1273.56	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , alright .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact629	1274.55	1276.68	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh , OK , and {disfmarker}
Bmr014.A.dialogueact630	1277.22	1277.48	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact631	1277.91	1279.91	A	PhD	s	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker} that 's basically the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the thing .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact633	1282.26	1290.76	A	PhD	fg|s	+1	2	Yeah , and I {disfmarker} and I tried t to normalize uh {disfmarker} uh the features , there 's loudness and modified loudness , um , within one channel ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact632	1282.16	1282.7	E	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact634	1291.8	1298.03	A	PhD	s	+1	2	because they 're , {vocalsound} yeah to {disfmarker} to be able to distinguish between foreground and background speech .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact635	1298.75	1301.08	A	PhD	s	+1	1	And it works quite well .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact636	1301.08	1302.65	A	PhD	s	+1	0	But , not always .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact637	1301.74	1302.19	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact638	1303.11	1303.33	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact639	1304.55	1304.82	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact640	1305.12	1305.49	E	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact641	1306.2	1306.31	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Good .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact642	1308.59	1309.7	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um , let 's see .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact643	1310.61	1311.52	E	Professor	%--	-1	0	I think the uh {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact644	1312.94	1314.09	E	Professor	qr^tc.%-	-1	0	Were {disfmarker} were you basically done with
Bmr014.E.dialogueact645	1315.58	1318.28	E	Professor	s^t^tc	+1	2	the transcription part ? So I guess the next thing is this uh {disfmarker} bleep editing .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact646	1318.63	1318.88	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact647	1318.88	1321.66	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So the {disfmarker} The idea is that we need to have {disfmarker}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact648	1321.74	1327.82	C	Grad	s	+1	2	We need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact649	1328.35	1337.2	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So I 've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages , uh with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece {disfmarker} pieces and they can scroll through and read them ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact650	1337.2	1340.32	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact651	1340.96	1346.98	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And then , it 's a form , HTML form , so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact652	1347.64	1351.05	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And so , uh , some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact654	1351.76	1357.08	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And so I thought about this a little bit and I think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact653	1351.66	1352.39	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact655	1357.08	1357.78	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	a single password .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact656	1357.78	1360.6	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Each person will have a single password , user name and password .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact657	1361.19	1366.14	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And then each meeting , we 'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact658	1367.14	1369.63	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And that way each person only has to remember one password .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact659	1371.98	1376.27	E	Professor	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I can't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact660	1376.52	1378.84	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean if people have {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact661	1380.47	1381.0	E	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact662	1381.79	1389.21	E	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , for me I would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and I would sort of flip through it .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact663	1390.07	1394.12	E	Professor	s	-1	0	And then {pause} um {pause} if I thought it was OK , I 'd say " it 's OK " .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact664	1394.35	1394.66	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact665	1394.91	1395.92	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And , I {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact666	1396.82	1399.88	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh {disfmarker} I mean it depends how this really ends up working out ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact667	1399.88	1409.96	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but I guess my thought was that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something was OK or not and needing to listen to it was gonna be extremely rare .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact668	1410.37	1417.11	C	Grad	s^aa|s^df	-1	0	Right , I mean so th th th the fact that you could listen to it over the web is a minor thing that I had already done for {pause} other reasons .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact669	1415.72	1416.14	E	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact670	1417.51	1419.02	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And so that {disfmarker} that 's a minor part of it ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact671	1419.02	1423.32	C	Grad	s	-1	0	I just wanted some web interface so that people {disfmarker} you didn't actually have to send everyone the text .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact672	1423.83	1430.72	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So m what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready , um {pause} I would take them , and generate the web pages
Bmr014.C.dialogueact673	1430.72	1434.63	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact674	1435.26	1438.32	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and just uh , tell them , " here 's the web page " ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact675	1438.99	1440.92	C	Grad	s	-1	0	um , " you need a password " .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact676	1440.92	1443.66	C	Grad	qw	-1	0	So th th question number one is how do we distribute the passwords ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact677	1444.11	1448.34	C	Grad	qw	-1	0	and question number two is how else do we wanna provide this information if they want it .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact678	1448.89	1449.44	E	Professor	%--	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact679	1449.92	1453.77	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I think what I was sort of saying is that if you just say {vocalsound} " here is a {disfmarker} here is {disfmarker} "
Bmr014.E.dialogueact680	1454.56	1465.51	E	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	I mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but {disfmarker} but I just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper , that said , uh , " here 's what was said in this transcription is it OK with you ?
Bmr014.E.dialogueact681	1465.99	1470.07	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and if it is , here 's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it 's OK " .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact682	1470.35	1474.63	C	Grad	s	-1	0	I think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact683	1470.62	1471.95	E	Professor	s	-1	0	And then they 'd hand it back to you .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact684	1474.95	1476.41	C	Grad	s	-1	0	But certainly I wouldn't want a printout .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact685	1476.41	1477.05	C	Grad	s	-1	0	These are big ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact686	1477.5	1481.93	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	and I would much rather be {pause} ha be able to just sit and leaf through it .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact687	1480.47	1482.34	E	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	You find it easier to go through a large {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact688	1482.34	1483.73	E	Professor	qw	-1	0	I mean how do you read books ?
Bmr014.C.dialogueact689	1484.35	1485.61	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Well I certainly read books by hand .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact690	1485.61	1488.53	C	Grad	s	-1	0	But for something like this , I think it 's easier to do it on the web .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact691	1488.66	1488.94	E	Professor	qy^bh^rt	-1	0	Really ?
Bmr014.E.dialogueact692	1489.84	1490.57	E	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , it {disfmarker}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact693	1490.82	1495.13	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Cuz you 're gonna get , you know , if I {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm in a bunch of meetings and I don't wanna get a stack of these .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact694	1495.13	1498.8	C	Grad	s	-1	0	I wanna just be able to go to {disfmarker} go to the web site {comment} and visit it as I want .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact695	1498.88	1500.25	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Going to a web site is easy ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact696	1500.25	1504.37	E	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	but flipping through a hundred pounds {disfmarker} a hundred pages of stuff is not easy on the web .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact697	1504.73	1506.77	C	Grad	s^df^ng	-1	0	Well , I don't think it 's that much harder than , paper .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact700	1507.63	1507.87	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact699	1507.33	1507.59	E	Professor	qy^bh^rt	-1	0	Really ?
Bmr014.F.dialogueact698	1507.23	1507.96	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I have one question .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact701	1507.96	1511.87	F	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	So are you thinking that um the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the transcript ?
Bmr014.F.dialogueact702	1511.87	1516.0	F	Postdoc	s^df.%-	-1	0	Because I {disfmarker} I do think that there 's a benefit to being able to hear the tone of voice and the {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact703	1515.75	1517.83	E	Professor	s	-1	0	So here 's the way I was imagining it , and maybe I 'm wrong ,
Bmr014.F.dialogueact704	1516.82	1517.11	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact705	1517.83	1526.65	E	Professor	s	+1	0	but the way I imagined it was that um , the largest set of people is gonna go " oh yeah , I didn't say anything funny in that meeting
Bmr014.E.dialogueact706	1526.65	1527.27	E	Professor	s^co	+1	0	just go ahead ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact707	1527.27	1528.5	E	Professor	qw	+1	0	where 's the {disfmarker} where 's the release ? "
Bmr014.E.dialogueact708	1529.95	1532.14	E	Professor	s	-1	0	And then there 'll be a subset of people ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact709	1532.42	1532.68	E	Professor	qy^f^rt	-1	0	right ? {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact710	1533.08	1533.47	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	OK there 's {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact711	1533.47	1535.76	E	Professor	s^co	-1	0	I mean think of who it is we 've been recording mostly .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact713	1536.23	1536.38	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact712	1536.12	1542.7	E	Professor	s	+1	0	OK there 'll be a subset of people , who um , will say uh " well , yeah , I really would like to see that . "
Bmr014.E.dialogueact714	1543.1	1548.51	E	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	And for them , the easiest way to flip through , if it 's a really large document ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact715	1548.68	1549.64	E	Professor	s	+1	0	I mean unless you 're searching .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact716	1549.64	1551.53	E	Professor	s	+1	0	Searching , of course , should be electronic ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact717	1551.61	1552.15	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but if you 're not {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact718	1552.15	1556.26	E	Professor	s	-1	0	so if you provide some search mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that ,
Bmr014.A.dialogueact719	1555.8	1556.22	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact720	1556.26	1558.1	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but see then we 're getting more elaborate with this thing .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact721	1558.88	1565.75	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um if {disfmarker} if uh you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really , really long document ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact722	1565.75	1571.6	E	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean whenever I 've had a really , really long document that it was sitting on the web , I 've always ended up printing it out .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact723	1571.73	1573.34	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , so it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact724	1573.34	1576.75	E	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , you {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} you 're not necessarily gonna be sitting at the desk all the time ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact725	1576.75	1581.52	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	you wanna figure you have a train ride , and there 's all these situations where {disfmarker} where I {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact726	1581.53	1583.25	E	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , this is how I was imagining it , anyway .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact727	1583.25	1590.66	E	Professor	s	-1	0	And then I figured , that out of that group , there would be a subset who would go " hmm you know I 'm really not sure about this section here , "
Bmr014.E.dialogueact728	1591.14	1592.56	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and then that group would need it {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact729	1592.56	1594.37	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	S It seems like i
Bmr014.E.dialogueact730	1594.43	1602.76	E	Professor	s	-1	0	if I 'm right in that , it seems like you 're setting it up for the most infrequent case , rather than for the most frequent case .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact731	1603.21	1605.89	E	Professor	s	-1	0	So that uh , now we have to worry about privacy ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact732	1605.34	1606.62	C	Grad	s^nd.%-	-1	0	Well , no fre for the most {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact733	1605.89	1609.13	E	Professor	s	-1	0	we have to worry about all these passwords , for different people
Bmr014.C.dialogueact734	1608.75	1611.87	C	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	For the most frequent case they just say {pause} " it 's OK "
Bmr014.C.dialogueact735	1611.97	1612.71	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and then they 're done .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact736	1614.01	1617.82	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And I think {pause} almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact737	1614.83	1615.28	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact738	1619.12	1620.6	F	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	The other thing too is it seems like {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact739	1620.2	1621.64	E	Professor	h|s^aa	-1	0	Um , yeah , that 's true .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact740	1620.85	1621.11	F	Postdoc	s^co	-1	0	Go ahead .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact741	1621.49	1624.2	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	I mean , cuz you don't have to visit the web page if you don't want to .
Bmr014.A.dialogueact742	1622.69	1622.94	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact743	1624.59	1625.05	E	Professor	%--	-1	0	I guess {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact744	1625.05	1627.11	E	Professor	s^am	-1	0	Yeah , I guess we don't need their signature .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact745	1627.11	1628.96	E	Professor	s	-1	0	I guess an email OK is alright .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact746	1628.43	1629.3	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Oh that was another thing
Bmr014.C.dialogueact747	1629.3	1633.75	C	Grad	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I had assumed that we didn't need their signature , that it {disfmarker} that an email approval was sufficient .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact748	1635.0	1636.81	C	Grad	s^no	-1	0	But {pause} I don't actually know .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact749	1636.08	1642.66	B	PhD	qy^rt	+1	1	Are {disfmarker} are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they weren't speaking ?
Bmr014.C.dialogueact750	1642.74	1643.05	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact752	1646.83	1651.52	C	Grad	s	+1	0	If someone feels strongly enough about it , then I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think they should be allowed to do that .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact751	1646.44	1646.83	F	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	I also {disfmarker}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact753	1646.83	1646.93	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	mm - hmm .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact754	1652.94	1655.09	B	PhD	qy^bu^rt	+1	1	So that means other people are editing what you say ?
Bmr014.E.dialogueact755	1652.97	1656.45	E	Professor	s^nd^no	-1	0	Uh {pause} I don't know about that .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact756	1655.05	1655.15	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact757	1656.38	1657.27	B	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I don't know if I like that .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact758	1657.65	1661.33	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Well , the only other choice is that the person would say " no , don't distribute this meeting at all " ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact759	1661.33	1665.12	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and I would rather they were able to edit out other people then just say " don't distribute it at all " .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact760	1667.81	1676.0	E	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	But th what they signed in the consent form , was something that said you can use my voice .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact761	1676.29	1682.05	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , but if {disfmarker} if someone is having a conversation , and you only bleep out one side of it , that 's not sufficient .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact762	1676.73	1677.07	E	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr014.E.dialogueact763	1679.11	1679.32	E	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact764	1682.7	1683.9	E	Professor	s^bk|s^ng	-1	0	Yeah , but that 's our decision then .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact765	1683.9	1684.17	E	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr014.C.dialogueact766	1684.64	1686.1	C	Grad	h|s^nd	-1	0	Um , I don't think so .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact768	1686.61	1688.74	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , because if I object to the conversation .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact767	1686.43	1687.01	E	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	I think it is .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact769	1688.74	1700.39	C	Grad	s	-1	0	If I say " we were having a conversation , and I consider that conversation private , " and I consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer , I wanna be able to bleep out your side .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact770	1700.93	1701.24	F	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	The {disfmarker}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact771	1701.24	1704.16	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	I agree that the consent forms were {disfmarker} uh , I cons
Bmr014.F.dialogueact772	1704.26	1713.26	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	agree with what Adam 's saying , that {vocalsound} um , the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe whether they said them or didn't say them .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact773	1712.46	1712.94	E	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact774	1713.78	1714.89	E	Professor	s	-1	0	OK , well , if that 's what it said .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact775	1713.78	1715.98	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And the other thing is from the standpoint of the l of the l
Bmr014.F.dialogueact776	1716.1	1717.05	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I 'm not a law lawyer ,
Bmr014.F.dialogueact777	1717.05	1722.13	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but it strikes me that {vocalsound} uh , we wouldn't want someone to say " oh yes , I was a little concerned about it
Bmr014.F.dialogueact778	1722.19	1724.3	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but {vocalsound} it was too hard to access " .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact779	1725.05	1729.02	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So I think it 's kind of nice to have this facility to listen to it .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact780	1729.02	1737.11	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Now {disfmarker} in terms of like editing it by hand , I mean I think it 's {disfmarker} i some people would find that easier to specify the bleep part by having a document they edited .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact781	1737.11	1749.45	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but it seems to me that sometimes um , you know i if a person had a bad day , and they had a tone in their voice that they didn't really like , you know it 's nice {disfmarker} it 's nice to be able to listen to it and be sure that that was OK .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact782	1749.45	1752.22	C	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	I mean I can certainly provide a printable version if people want it .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact784	1753.09	1753.58	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact783	1752.81	1754.91	E	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Um {pause} I mean it 's also a mixture of people ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact785	1754.91	1760.76	E	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean some people are r do their work primarily by sitting at the computer , flipping around the web ,

Bmr014.C.dialogueact791	1767.96	1770.81	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Well I think most of the people in the meetings are the former .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact792	1767.97	1769.39	E	Professor	s	-1	0	It depends on what meetings .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact793	1768.31	1768.69	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	That 's true .

Bmr014.A.dialogueact841	1832.35	1832.53	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact842	1833.61	1834.19	B	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	What um {disfmarker}
Bmr014.B.dialogueact843	1834.19	1837.82	B	PhD	qw	-1	0	When you display it on the web page , what are {disfmarker} what are you showing them ?
Bmr014.B.dialogueact844	1837.82	1838.7	B	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	Utterances ,

Bmr014.C.dialogueact845	1838.55	1838.91	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact847	1839.46	1841.31	B	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	And so can they bleep within an utterance ?
Bmr014.C.dialogueact848	1841.29	1841.43	C	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact849	1841.77	1842.77	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	Whole utterances only .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact850	1842.33	1843.21	B	PhD	s^bk^m	-1	0	Whole utterances .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact851	1844.09	1847.78	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	And that was just convenience for my sake , that it 's uh , uh
Bmr014.C.dialogueact852	1848.82	1853.44	C	Grad	s	-1	0	it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we would do it at the sub - utterance level .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact853	1853.85	1858.21	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Because this way I can just delete an entire line out of a transcript file rather than have to do it by hand .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact854	1858.29	1862.53	E	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	There 's another aspect to this which maybe {disfmarker} is part of why this is bothering me .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact855	1863.19	1870.34	E	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um , I think you 're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact857	1871.84	1872.11	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact856	1871.79	1874.95	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	I mean that 's why I did the web form , because for me that would be my most convenient .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact858	1873.27	1875.05	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I understand .

Bmr014.E.dialogueact859	1875.1	1876.39	E	Professor	s	-1	0	I think that 's the bad idea .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact861	1876.36	1876.54	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact862	1878.87	1880.06	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	See because you 're gon you 're {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker}

Bmr014.E.dialogueact864	1880.65	1887.85	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	You 're gonna end up with all these little patchy things , whereas really what we want to do is have the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the bias towards letting it go .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact865	1888.43	1889.32	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Because nob you

Bmr014.E.dialogueact867	1890.2	1890.5	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	There was a {disfmarker}

Bmr014.E.dialogueact869	1895.58	1898.37	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but overall people are talking about technical topics .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact870	1898.83	1899.98	E	Professor	s	-1	0	Nobody 's gonna get hurt .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact871	1900.06	1901.88	E	Professor	s	-1	0	Nobody 's being l libeled .

Bmr014.E.dialogueact873	1904.09	1908.25	E	Professor	s	-1	0	We 're playing the lawyer 's game , and we 're playing we 're {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} we 're looking for the extreme case .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact874	1908.74	1914.14	E	Professor	s	-1	0	If we really orient it towards that extreme case , make it really easy , we 're gonna end up encouraging a headache .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact875	1915.37	1916.41	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	That {disfmarker} I think that 's {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact876	1916.82	1918.82	E	Professor	s	-1	0	I 'm sort of psyching myself out here ,

Bmr014.C.dialogueact879	1919.96	1925.67	C	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	I guess I don't see having a few phrases here and there in a meeting being that mu much of a headache , bleeped out .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact878	1919.93	1920.76	E	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	but I {disfmarker} I think that 's {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact880	1925.38	1926.26	E	Professor	s^nd.%-	-1	0	Well , it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact881	1925.9	1926.18	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact883	1926.69	1929.85	B	PhD	s^bs	-1	0	I think what Morgan 's saying is the easier it is , the more is gonna be bleeped .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact882	1926.66	1927.19	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	but i
Bmr014.E.dialogueact884	1930.4	1933.05	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and it really depends on what kind of research you 're doing .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact885	1933.56	1941.73	E	Professor	s^df	-1	0	I think some researchers who are gonna be working with this corpus years from now are really gonna be cursing the fact that there 's a bunch of stuff in there {comment} that 's missing from the dialogue .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact886	1941.76	1942.05	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact887	1942.33	1944.05	E	Professor	s^r	-1	0	You know , it depends on the kind of research they 're doing ,
Bmr014.A.dialogueact888	1942.9	1943.27	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact889	1944.05	1947.63	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but it might be , uh {pause} it might be really a {disfmarker} a pain .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact890	1948.36	1951.9	E	Professor	s	+1	0	And , you know where it 's really gonna hurt somebody , in some way {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact891	1951.9	1957.9	E	Professor	s	+1	0	the one who said it or someone who is being spoken about , {comment} we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact892	1958.26	1961.72	E	Professor	s	+1	1	But I really think we wanna make it the rare incidence .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact893	1962.37	1966.81	E	Professor	s	+1	1	And {disfmarker} and uh , I am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact894	1966.81	1970.34	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and so much fun ! {vocalsound} that they 're gonna go through and bleep out stuff .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact895	1969.52	1970.03	F	Postdoc	s^m	-1	0	So much fun .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact896	1970.53	1972.1	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and they can bleep out stuff they don't like too ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact897	1972.1	1972.28	E	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	right
Bmr014.E.dialogueact898	1972.28	1973.52	E	Professor	s	-1	0	from somebody else , as you say ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact899	1973.52	1975.43	E	Professor	s^e	-1	0	you know , so " well I didn't like what he said . "
Bmr014.C.dialogueact900	1974.58	1976.39	C	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	Well I don't see any way of avoiding that .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact901	1977.18	1982.44	C	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , we have to provi we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they don't like .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact903	1983.66	1984.36	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	So that the {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact902	1983.31	1983.49	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact904	1984.97	1985.95	E	Professor	s^bsc.%-	-1	0	No , no , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact905	1985.6	1986.72	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	The only question is {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact906	1985.95	1987.24	E	Professor	s	-1	0	You - you 've talked me into that ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact907	1987.24	1989.31	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	but I {disfmarker} I just think that we should make it harder to do .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact908	1990.9	1993.26	C	Grad	s^df^ng	-1	0	The problem is if it 's harder for them it 's also harder for me .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact909	1993.61	1995.78	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Whereas this web interface , I just get email ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact910	1995.78	1996.7	C	Grad	s	-1	0	it 's all formatted ,
Bmr014.C.dialogueact911	1996.7	1998.65	C	Grad	s	-1	0	it 's all ready to go and I can just insert it .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact912	1997.43	2000.74	E	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	So maybe you don't give them access to the web interface unless they really need it .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact914	2002.23	2003.27	E	Professor	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} so
Bmr014.F.dialogueact913	2001.9	2002.47	F	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	Well I guess {disfmarker}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact915	2002.63	2002.83	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact916	2003.27	2003.59	E	Professor	s^fa	-1	0	I 'm sorry {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact917	2003.59	2006.1	E	Professor	s	-1	0	so {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} So maybe this is a s a way out of it .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact918	2003.96	2004.17	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact919	2006.1	2008.9	E	Professor	s	-1	0	You 've provided something that 's useful for you to do {disfmarker} handle ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact920	2009.25	2011.81	E	Professor	s	-1	0	and useful for someone else if they need it .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact921	2012.65	2019.24	E	Professor	s	-1	0	But I think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that uh , they get access to this if they really need it .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact922	2013.4	2013.58	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bmr014.B.dialogueact923	2019.86	2029.6	B	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	So you 're saying the {disfmarker} the sequence would be more like first Adam goes to the contact lists , contacts them via whatever their preferred method is , to see if they want to review the meeting .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact924	2029.82	2030.01	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact925	2030.55	2032.55	B	PhD	s	-1	0	And then if they don't , you 're done .
Bmr014.B.dialogueact926	2032.88	2035.66	B	PhD	s	-1	0	If they do , then he provides them access to the {disfmarker} the web site .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact928	2036.0	2039.79	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , to some extent I have to do that anyway because as I said we have to distribute passwords .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact927	2035.92	2036.48	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	W w
Bmr014.B.dialogueact929	2036.93	2038.3	B	PhD	s	-1	0	Or {disfmarker} a printed - out form .

Bmr014.C.dialogueact932	2040.66	2040.95	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact931	2040.17	2040.56	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	y
Bmr014.E.dialogueact933	2041.13	2044.23	E	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	but you don't necessarily have to distribute passwords is what I 'm saying .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact935	2044.93	2045.43	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	Well , but {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact934	2044.83	2045.19	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr014.B.dialogueact936	2045.98	2046.84	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	Only if they want it .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact937	2046.41	2049.65	C	Grad	s	-1	0	what I 'm saying is that I can't just email them the password because that 's not secure .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact940	2049.99	2051.66	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So they have to call me and ask .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact938	2049.65	2049.95	E	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	No , no , no .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact939	2049.95	2051.5	E	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	But you aren't necessarily giving them {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact941	2052.45	2052.83	E	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact942	2053.53	2057.32	E	Professor	s	-1	0	But {disfmarker} we don't even necessarily need to end up distributing passwords at all .

Bmr014.C.dialogueact944	2057.75	2058.93	C	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Well , we do because of privacy .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact945	2058.93	2060.92	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	We can't just make it openly available on the web .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact946	2060.45	2060.69	E	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	No , no .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact947	2060.69	2061.55	E	Professor	s	-1	0	You 're missing the point .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact948	2060.89	2061.13	F	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact949	2062.11	2069.47	E	Professor	s	-1	0	We 're {disfmarker} We 're trying i We 're trying to make it less of an obvious just l l l l uh fall off a log , to do this .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact950	2069.92	2071.95	F	Postdoc	s^bs	-1	0	Not everyone gets a password , unless they ask for it .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact951	2071.17	2071.44	E	Professor	qy^f^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr014.E.dialogueact952	2071.91	2078.99	E	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	So th so what I would see , is that first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for the {disfmarker}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact953	2072.56	2072.69	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact954	2078.99	2079.91	E	Professor	s	-1	0	not just for fun ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact955	2080.73	2081.08	E	Professor	qy^f	-1	0	OK ?
Bmr014.E.dialogueact956	2081.08	2089.44	E	Professor	s	-1	0	but to {disfmarker} to check this for uh things that they 're worried about having said or if they 're willing to just send an approval of it , at {disfmarker} from their memory .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact957	2090.29	2095.91	E	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	Um {disfmarker} and , uh , and we should think carefully actually we should review {disfmarker} go through how that 's worded ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact958	2096.26	2096.61	E	Professor	qy^f^rt	-1	0	OK ?
Bmr014.E.dialogueact959	2097.44	2101.66	E	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Then , if someone uh {disfmarker} wants to review it , uh ,
Bmr014.E.dialogueact960	2101.71	2106.21	E	Professor	s^df|s^cs	-1	0	and I know you don't like this , but I 'm offering this as a suggestion , is that {disfmarker} is that we then give them a print out .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact961	2107.36	2118.41	E	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	And then if they say that " I have a potential problem with these things , " then , you {disfmarker} you say " OK well you might wanna hear this in context to s think if you need that , " you issue them a password , i in the {disfmarker}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact962	2117.58	2122.03	C	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	But the {disfmarker} the problem with what you 're suggesting is it 's not just inconvenient for them , it 's inconvenient for me .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact963	2122.77	2128.65	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Because that means multiple contacts every time {disfmarker} for every single meeting every time anyone wants anything .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact964	2129.52	2133.45	C	Grad	s^cs^df	-1	0	I would much prefer to have all be automatic , they visit the web site if they want to .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact965	2133.88	2134.97	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Obviously they don't have to .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact966	2135.26	2136.86	E	Professor	s^aap|s^arp.%-	-1	0	I know you 'd prefer it , but the proble
Bmr014.C.dialogueact968	2137.15	2137.25	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact967	2136.86	2137.19	E	Professor	%-	-1	0	we have {disfmarker}
Bmr014.C.dialogueact970	2137.64	2142.52	C	Grad	s	-1	0	So I think you 're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and I just don't think that 's gonna happen .

Bmr014.F.dialogueact973	2150.44	2162.94	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	You know , if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and didn't detect , then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn't pursue that next level and get the password and do that ,
Bmr014.F.dialogueact974	2163.5	2171.11	F	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	um , but {disfmarker} but they might be able to argue " oh well it was cumbersome , and I was busy and it was gonna take me too much time to trace it down " .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact975	2171.11	2173.38	F	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	So it could that the burden would come back onto us .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact976	2173.38	2176.86	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So I 'm a little bit worried about uh , making it harder for them , from the legal standpoint .
Bmr014.E.dialogueact977	2175.61	2179.61	E	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	Well you can go too far in that direction , and you need to find somewhere between I think ,

Bmr014.C.dialogueact980	2179.74	2185.78	C	Grad	s	-1	0	It seems to me that sending them email , saying " if you have an O - OK reply to this email and say OK ,

Bmr014.C.dialogueact983	2189.38	2192.62	C	Grad	s	-1	0	seems like is a perfectly , reasonable compromise .
Bmr014.C.dialogueact984	2192.62	2194.75	C	Grad	s	-1	0	And if they want a printout they can print it out themselves .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact985	2195.38	2196.4	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	Or we could print it up for them ,

Bmr014.F.dialogueact986	2196.4	2197.13	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	I mean we could offer that {disfmarker}
Bmr014.F.dialogueact988	2197.28	2207.79	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but there 's uh , another aspect to that and that is that in the informed consent form , um , my impression is that they {disfmarker} that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript .
Bmr014.F.dialogueact989	2207.79	2209.23	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and I ha

Bmr014.E.dialogueact1119	2432.77	2434.05	E	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	Well and furthermore I {disfmarker}
Bmr014.E.dialogueact1120	2434.05	2439.06	E	Professor	s	-1	0	it 's now fairly routine in a lot of arrangements that I do with people on contracts and so forth
Bmr014.E.dialogueact1121	2439.06	2448.46	E	Professor	s	-1	0	that {disfmarker} that uh if it 's {disfmarker} if it 's that sort of thing where you 're you 're saying uh " OK I agree , we want eighty hours of this person at such - and - such amount , and I agree that 's OK , "
