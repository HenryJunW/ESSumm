Bro028.D.dialogueact37	91.627	95.627	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	uh it means that it's like it can be succumbed in before 
Bro028.B.dialogueact39	98.862	100.322	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	and what are we sitting at currently so is 
Bro028.D.dialogueact38	98.64	99.11	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	and what are we sitting at currently 
Bro028.B.dialogueact41	100.816	101.076	B	Professor	b	-1	0	so is uh we 
Bro028.D.dialogueact40	100.42	104.51	D	PhD	s	+1	2	so is uh we have a system that has two hundred and thirty so 
Bro028.D.dialogueact42	104.58	105.993	D	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	and thirty so 
Bro028.B.dialogueact43	106.314	106.814	B	Professor	s^bu^m	-1	0	two thirty yeah 
Bro028.D.dialogueact44	106.986	107.136	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	two thirty yeah so that's the system 
Bro028.D.dialogueact45	107.376	111.256	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so it's we have to reduce it like ten so that's the system that's described discrepancy component of 
Bro028.B.dialogueact46	110.144	110.584	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	so it's 
Bro028.B.dialogueact47	111.125	112.975	B	Professor	s^bu	+1	2	we have to reduce it like ten know second some yeah 
Bro028.D.dialogueact48	112.98	113.61	D	PhD	s^aa|%-	-1	0	know second some yeah but that's yeah 
Bro028.D.dialogueact49	113.61	113.76	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	but that's yeah 
Bro028.D.dialogueact50	114.32	115.75	D	PhD	s^ba	+1	2	that's not a problem 
Bro028.B.dialogueact51	118.091	118.391	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay it's 
Bro028.B.dialogueact53	118.659	122.397	B	Professor	s^bu	+1	2	okay it's it's to probably primarily turn by the v. a. d. at this fine right 
Bro028.D.dialogueact52	118.52	119.16	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	okay it's it's to probably 
Bro028.B.dialogueact54	122.397	122.487	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	this fine right 
Bro028.D.dialogueact55	122.425	122.605	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	this fine right 
Bro028.B.dialogueact57	123.654	125.604	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	2	so we can make the videos for 
Bro028.D.dialogueact56	123.399	124.299	D	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	so we can make the videos 
Bro028.D.dialogueact58	124.299	124.459	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	we can make the videos 
Bro028.B.dialogueact59	125.694	125.874	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	for 
Bro028.D.dialogueact60	125.773	126.403	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	for yeah we probably should 
Bro028.B.dialogueact61	126.397	129.717	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	2	yeah we probably should do that pretty soon so they don't get used to it being a certain 
Bro028.D.dialogueact62	129.408	129.708	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	a certain 
Bro028.B.dialogueact63	130.757	131.117	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro028.D.dialogueact75	148.116	151.576	D	PhD	fg|s^rt^t^tc	+1	3	uh yeah so the second thing is the system that we have currency 
Bro028.D.dialogueact76	152.77	157.125	D	PhD	s	+1	3	we have like it's just going to get sixty two percent improvement but 
Bro028.D.dialogueact77	157.125	161.23	D	PhD	s.%--	+1	3	but if you want to stick to the uh the second seat but it 
Bro028.D.dialogueact78	161.777	163.407	D	PhD	s	+1	3	seat but it hasn't even shifted cookie but 
Bro028.D.dialogueact79	163.407	171.685	D	PhD	s^bd	+1	3	cookie but if you want us supposed to stick to the the number what features that make it to sixty then we go to debate down but they 
Bro028.D.dialogueact80	171.685	173.375	D	PhD	s^df	+1	3	debate down but they still sixty one person 
Bro028.D.dialogueact81	174.569	179.399	D	PhD	s	+1	1	if we drop depending the cork than we have fifty seven 
Bro028.B.dialogueact82	180.44	184.01	B	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	+1	1	uh but the the two two thirty includes attending now or

Bro028.B.dialogueact84	185.967	186.377	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	and 
Bro028.B.dialogueact85	186.984	192.104	B	Professor	qy	+1	1	and is attendant network uh small enough that it will sit on the terminal signs in terms of uh no i don't think 
Bro028.B.dialogueact87	192.104	192.694	B	Professor	s^e.%-	-1	0	in terms of no i don't think 
Bro028.D.dialogueact86	192.03	193.26	D	PhD	s^ar|s^nd	+1	1	in terms of no i don't think so 
Bro028.B.dialogueact88	193.995	194.175	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	so 
Bro028.D.dialogueact89	195.078	195.228	D	PhD	s^aa^m	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.B.dialogueact90	197.08	197.31	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	it's still 
Bro028.D.dialogueact91	197.616	206.32	D	PhD	s	+1	1	it's still in terms of computational for you was like their way of computing do i'm up so the the meats i think it fits but it's it's um 
Bro028.B.dialogueact92	203.21	203.46	B	Professor	b	-1	0	i'm up so the 
Bro028.B.dialogueact93	204.97	205.24	B	Professor	b	-1	0	the meats i think it fits 
Bro028.D.dialogueact94	206.32	208.82	D	PhD	s	+1	1	but it's it's um a problem if memory 
Bro028.B.dialogueact95	209.138	209.358	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.D.dialogueact96	209.603	210.583	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.D.dialogueact97	211.539	214.239	D	PhD	s^no	+1	1	and they don't know much that can be because i'm not 
Bro028.D.dialogueact98	215.529	216.909	D	PhD	s	+1	1	because it's good being around so 
Bro028.D.dialogueact99	216.909	218.899	D	PhD	s	+1	1	good being around so it's maybe not that expensive but 
Bro028.D.dialogueact100	218.899	219.059	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	how that expensive but 
Bro028.B.dialogueact101	219.881	221.551	B	Professor	qw.%-	+1	2	how how much memory does how many i i don't and remember 
Bro028.D.dialogueact102	220.214	222.714	D	PhD	s^no	+1	2	how much memory does how many i i don't and remember exactly but 
Bro028.D.dialogueact103	222.714	223.962	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	exactly but 
Bro028.D.dialogueact104	224.252	225.582	D	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	yeah i like to check out 
Bro028.B.dialogueact105	225.675	226.825	B	Professor	s^bk|s^na	+1	2	yeah i like to see that i check out 
Bro028.B.dialogueact106	226.825	228.965	B	Professor	s^df	+1	2	to see that i could think of a little bit about it because 
Bro028.B.dialogueact107	228.965	231.691	B	Professor	s^am^cs	+1	2	think of a little bit about it because we maybe we could make a little smaller or 
Bro028.B.dialogueact108	231.691	233.711	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	little smaller or maybe even if we consider know 
Bro028.D.dialogueact109	232.268	232.528	D	PhD	b	-1	0	maybe even if we 
Bro028.B.dialogueact110	234.444	236.694	B	Professor	s	+1	2	uh i'd let's see how far off

Bro028.B.dialogueact112	237.33	243.056	B	Professor	s^bu	+1	2	but i guess it's still within their rules to have have it on the uh service i

Bro028.B.dialogueact119	251.376	252.486	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i that's just that you gone 
Bro028.D.dialogueact120	255.349	258.259	D	PhD	s^bk|s^rt	+1	1	yeah there were small tricks to make this standing at work or

Bro028.D.dialogueact122	263.314	271.184	D	PhD	s	+1	1	and one of the trick west who um you lose some kind of few rocky kind of structure where the sinus 
Bro028.D.dialogueact123	271.184	276.914	D	PhD	s	+1	1	where the sinus probably the smoke computed by the finest mentor orbit died uh if you do get

Bro028.D.dialogueact125	279.535	285.987	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	so cranky looks better when uh we use the sinus probably from the eating of pork 
Bro028.B.dialogueact127	287.18	287.63	B	Professor	b	-1	0	we we scaled 
Bro028.D.dialogueact126	286.9	292.38	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and we we scaled together probably teased by one minus sinus probably

Bro028.D.dialogueact129	295.152	302.965	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so it's some kind of security kind of thing uh that scenario so tried um on spying and

Bro028.D.dialogueact227	522.734	524.674	D	PhD	s	-1	0	second stream of course if i guess on this also but 
Bro028.D.dialogueact228	524.674	527.939	D	PhD	s	-1	0	on this also but we need to try different things and 
Bro028.D.dialogueact229	527.939	528.079	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	try different things and uh but 
Bro028.D.dialogueact230	528.824	530.324	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	uh but they're nice estimation um 
Bro028.D.dialogueact231	530.694	533.611	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	me back um 
Bro028.B.dialogueact232	533.642	534.932	B	Professor	s	-1	0	me back on the second and 
Bro028.B.dialogueact233	534.932	536.582	B	Professor	s	-1	0	on the second and that's something we've talked about for a while i mean 
Bro028.B.dialogueact234	536.582	539.516	B	Professor	s	-1	0	a while i mean i think that's certainly i hope

Bro028.B.dialogueact236	541.845	542.175	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro028.B.dialogueact237	542.923	547.941	B	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	so we have this this fault idea about just using some sort of purely specter oh 
Bro028.D.dialogueact238	548.27	548.73	D	PhD	h|s^aa	-1	0	the second uh yeah but 
Bro028.B.dialogueact239	548.791	549.561	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	the second soon uh yeah but 
Bro028.D.dialogueact240	548.89	552.61	D	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	the second soon uh yeah but we we need the first try with this and 
Bro028.D.dialogueact241	552.61	555.307	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but try with this and purely arts 
Bro028.B.dialogueact242	555.902	558.182	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	but uh how was the strain combined 
Bro028.D.dialogueact243	556.295	564.134	D	PhD	s	-1	0	uh how was the strain combined u. s. u. s. just combined uh um maybe next month so there was 
Bro028.D.dialogueact244	564.134	567.15	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	right so i mean if you just had so there was no and you're on the tour 
Bro028.B.dialogueact245	566.653	574.671	B	Professor	s^bk|s^cs	-1	0	right so i mean if you just had a second streaming was just specter on have another on that and combine there that that uh the tour 
Bro028.D.dialogueact246	567.15	567.59	D	PhD	b	-1	0	i mean if you just had 
Bro028.D.dialogueact247	570.81	571.41	D	PhD	b	-1	0	on that and combine there that

Bro028.D.dialogueact253	583.176	589.201	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	in maybe try to train uh the training that definite and the 
Bro028.D.dialogueact254	589.646	594.526	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and the torque right now it's like using the noises from your asking and 
Bro028.D.dialogueact255	594.526	600.707	D	PhD	s	-1	0	asking and i think that people might try to arc about that because 
Bro028.D.dialogueact256	600.757	608.448	D	PhD	s	-1	0	about that because and some cases we have the same nice and for training in the torque then i just i i use for testing 
Bro028.B.dialogueact257	606.267	606.517	B	Professor	b	-1	0	then i just i

Bro028.D.dialogueact259	609.513	615.663	D	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah maybe just putting so to try to get rid of 
Bro028.B.dialogueact260	615.121	616.471	B	Professor	fg|s^cs	-1	0	yeah maybe just putting so nice something's

Bro028.B.dialogueact263	617.601	620.411	B	Professor	s	-1	0	different i mean it it probably helpful to have have a little nicer 
Bro028.B.dialogueact265	621.5	622.63	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but maybe something else they see 
Bro028.D.dialogueact264	621.138	621.478	D	PhD	b	-1	0	but maybe

Bro028.D.dialogueact302	703.237	703.837	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	well let me just 
Bro028.B.dialogueact303	704.734	705.454	B	Professor	s	+1	1	stupor i was there i mean is so 
Bro028.B.dialogueact304	705.454	713.911	B	Professor	s	+1	1	i was there i mean is so so the first is that by doing l. p. c. twelve it's it's a speech like you saying it's it it you're you're adding other day gradations 
Bro028.D.dialogueact305	705.804	706.084	D	PhD	b	-1	0	i was there i mean is so so the first is 
Bro028.B.dialogueact306	714.366	714.586	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right so it's not 
Bro028.B.dialogueact307	714.586	715.726	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	right so it's not just the noise but you're 
Bro028.B.dialogueact308	715.726	717.996	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	just the noise but you're adding in fact some degradation because 
Bro028.B.dialogueact309	717.996	719.706	B	Professor	s^df^e	+1	1	degradation because it's only an approximation 
Bro028.B.dialogueact310	720.42	720.8	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro028.B.dialogueact311	721.095	731.282	B	Professor	s	+1	1	the second thing is which is maybe more interesting is that um if you do it with whispered speech you get this number what if 
Bro028.B.dialogueact312	731.844	736.684	B	Professor	qh^cs	+1	1	what if you had done analysis or synthesis and taken the pits as well 
Bro028.B.dialogueact313	737.782	738.012	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	rice and now you put the pitch 
Bro028.B.dialogueact314	738.012	739.282	B	Professor	s	+1	1	and now you put the pitch and 
Bro028.D.dialogueact315	740.082	740.352	D	PhD	b	-1	0	what 
Bro028.B.dialogueact316	741.03	742.37	B	Professor	qh	+1	1	what the percentage be that 
Bro028.D.dialogueact317	742.88	744.02	D	PhD	h	-1	0	that see that's the question 
Bro028.B.dialogueact318	743.97	744.77	B	Professor	s	+1	1	see that's the question 
Bro028.B.dialogueact319	745.338	750.135	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so you see if it's if it's if it's uh let's say it's back down to one percent again that would say 
Bro028.D.dialogueact320	750.195	750.495	D	PhD	b	-1	0	that would say 
Bro028.B.dialogueact321	750.699	753.892	B	Professor	s	+1	1	that would say at least for people having the pitch is really really important 
Bro028.B.dialogueact322	754.394	755.794	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	which would be interesting in itself 
Bro028.B.dialogueact324	756.536	756.956	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro028.D.dialogueact323	756.412	757.272	D	PhD	s^aap|%-	-1	0	um if i on the other hand 
Bro028.B.dialogueact325	757.129	763.108	B	Professor	s:s^ba	-1	0	if i on the other hand if it stayed up there five percent then i'd say boy l. p. c. twelve was pretty calm you 
Bro028.B.dialogueact326	764.028	764.298	B	Professor	qy^d^f	-1	0	know

Bro028.B.dialogueact328	765.186	773.389	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	so i i i'm not sure i'm not sure how we can conclude from this anything about that our system is close to him for for us yeah that's the point is that if the point is 
Bro028.D.dialogueact329	770.532	770.642	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	that our system is 
Bro028.D.dialogueact330	771.92	785.85	D	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	close to him for for us yeah that's the point is that if the point is that um what i what i listen to an irish and just i just think you should try this spectrum it's you know way what the system uh hearing 
Bro028.D.dialogueact331	786.876	790.566	D	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	because all the old um expectation 
Bro028.D.dialogueact332	791.919	794.973	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but they vacation is he's not taking into account 
Bro028.D.dialogueact333	795.411	796.991	D	PhD	s	-1	0	that's what we do with our system 
Bro028.D.dialogueact334	797.725	798.085	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	well you're not this case 
Bro028.B.dialogueact335	798.476	799.956	B	Professor	s^nd.%--	-1	0	well you're not carrying you know p. c. i this case 
Bro028.D.dialogueact336	798.609	799.299	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	well you're not carrying you know p. c. i this case 
Bro028.B.dialogueact337	799.956	801.426	B	Professor	qh.%-	-1	0	carrying you know p. c. i mean so so what if you did it well it's not that b. c. fair 
Bro028.D.dialogueact338	800.832	802.122	D	PhD	s^bk^m|s^aa	-1	0	mean so so what if you did it what if you did well it's not that b. c. fair but 
Bro028.B.dialogueact340	802.583	804.083	B	Professor	qh^cs	-1	0	what if you did l. p. c. twenty but 
Bro028.D.dialogueact339	802.122	802.292	D	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	what if you did but

Bro028.B.dialogueact347	814.46	823.426	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so i'm saying is that you have in addition to the the uh removal of pitch you also are doing uh particular parameters station

Bro028.A.dialogueact365	850.231	857.616	A	PhD	qy^cs^rt	-1	0	couldn't you too couldn't you um test the human performance on just the original audio

Bro028.D.dialogueact366	858.191	859.551	D	PhD	s	-1	0	this is the one person 
Bro028.B.dialogueact367	860.45	861.13	B	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah that's what percent he's trying to move to pitch 
Bro028.B.dialogueact369	861.13	862.65	B	Professor	s	-1	0	oh he's trying to move to pitch information 
Bro028.D.dialogueact368	860.855	861.425	D	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah that's what percent he's trying to move to pitch 
Bro028.A.dialogueact370	862.972	864.312	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay i see information and make it closer to what 
Bro028.D.dialogueact371	863.782	864.102	D	PhD	b	-1	0	okay i see and make it closer to what 
Bro028.A.dialogueact373	864.312	864.772	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay i see it closer to what 
Bro028.B.dialogueact372	863.871	866.951	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	okay i see and make it closer to what what we're seeing is the featured factors 
Bro028.A.dialogueact374	867.262	869.912	A	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	okay so we go your performance was one percent 
Bro028.A.dialogueact376	870.404	873.054	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and then when you recent the size of the b. c. troubling to five okay 
Bro028.D.dialogueact375	870.085	870.335	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and then when you 
Bro028.D.dialogueact377	873.197	873.427	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	okay 
Bro028.A.dialogueact378	873.898	874.288	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bro028.B.dialogueact379	875.381	881.086	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we were we were just it it it's a little bit still apples and oranges because we 
Bro028.B.dialogueact380	881.086	885.513	B	Professor	s	-1	0	because we are choosing these teachers in order to be the best for recognition

Bro028.B.dialogueact382	886.321	887.631	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bro028.B.dialogueact383	888.191	893.941	B	Professor	s	-1	0	if you listen to them they still might not be or even if you made something closer over it it might not sound very good 
Bro028.D.dialogueact384	894.266	894.396	D	PhD	b	-1	0	uh 
Bro028.B.dialogueact385	894.774	902.504	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh and see degradation from that might might actually make it even harder uh to understand understanding l. p. c. twelve so all the 
Bro028.B.dialogueact386	902.504	906.457	B	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	c. twelve so all the things that the l. p. c. twelve puts in synthesis puts and 
Bro028.B.dialogueact387	906.457	908.217	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	puts and some degradation that's not what 
Bro028.B.dialogueact389	908.571	910.091	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that's not what we're used to hearing and 
Bro028.D.dialogueact388	908.458	908.708	D	PhD	b	-1	0	that's not what 
Bro028.B.dialogueact390	910.658	912.243	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and is um it's not 
Bro028.B.dialogueact391	912.741	920.464	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it's not it's not just a question of how much information is there is if you always take maximum advantage of any information it's presented to you in fact you 
Bro028.D.dialogueact392	919.761	919.941	D	PhD	b	-1	0	information it's presented 
Bro028.B.dialogueact393	920.464	923.117	B	Professor	s	-1	0	to you in fact you hear something's better than others so it isn't 
Bro028.B.dialogueact394	923.297	924.337	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so it isn't but i 
Bro028.A.dialogueact395	923.905	924.085	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	so it isn't but i 
Bro028.B.dialogueact396	924.397	934.602	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	but i agree that it says that uh the kind of information that we're feeding it is probably um uh a little bit um minimum minimalist definitely 
Bro028.B.dialogueact397	934.602	936.682	B	Professor	s	-1	0	minimum minimalist definitely some things that was thrown away 
Bro028.B.dialogueact398	937.299	943.687	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that's why i was saying it might be interesting if you an interesting test of this would be if you if you actually put the pitch back in 
Bro028.B.dialogueact399	944.852	947.902	B	Professor	s	-1	0	she just extracted from the actual speech and put it back in 
Bro028.B.dialogueact400	948.371	950.581	B	Professor	qh	-1	0	and see does that is that is that makes a difference 
Bro028.B.dialogueact402	951.346	966.68	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	if that if that takes it down to one percent again thing to say okay it's it's in fact having um not justice specter on vault but also the also the the pitch that uh has information that people can use anyway 
Bro028.D.dialogueact401	951.09	951.41	D	PhD	b	-1	0	if that if that 
Bro028.D.dialogueact403	964.313	964.793	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	has information 
Bro028.A.dialogueact404	967.552	975.675	A	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	from this it's pretty safe to say that the system is with either to to seven percent away from the performance of the human right

Bro028.D.dialogueact419	1000.0	1009.92	D	PhD	s	-1	0	the thing that like disliking makes us period excelling and uh and is always sound um the noise which 
Bro028.B.dialogueact420	1009.57	1009.93	B	Professor	b	-1	0	um the noise which 
Bro028.D.dialogueact421	1009.92	1012.73	D	PhD	s	-1	0	um the noise which is mostly uh nice i

Bro028.D.dialogueact423	1015.13	1018.57	D	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	so what what do you mean exactly but getting back to teaching because

Bro028.B.dialogueact426	1023.12	1024.81	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	yeah you did l. t. c. b. synthesis 
Bro028.D.dialogueact428	1023.48	1023.66	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	yeah you did l. t. c. 
Bro028.B.dialogueact430	1024.81	1026.08	B	Professor	s^r	-1	0	b. synthesis tissue synthesis so 
Bro028.D.dialogueact429	1024.58	1024.96	D	PhD	s^aa^rt	-1	0	b. synthesis 
Bro028.B.dialogueact431	1026.08	1029.57	B	Professor	fh|s^bu	-1	0	so uh and he did it with a noise source rather 
Bro028.B.dialogueact433	1029.95	1032.58	B	Professor	s^bu^e	-1	0	rather than with with uh periodic source 
Bro028.D.dialogueact432	1029.91	1030.13	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	rather than with with 
Bro028.B.dialogueact434	1033.59	1033.86	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right so 
Bro028.B.dialogueact435	1033.86	1039.32	B	Professor	s	-1	0	right so if you actually did real just like you do in l. p. c. synthesizer worse on voice to use noise where it's forced to 
Bro028.B.dialogueact436	1039.33	1042.42	B	Professor	s	-1	0	where it's forced to use uh periodic this

Bro028.B.dialogueact438	1044.5	1044.8	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	yeah but

Bro028.D.dialogueact440	1049.13	1051.02	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	well especially because there's noise 
Bro028.B.dialogueact441	1051.82	1052.93	B	Professor	s^bd^na	-1	0	well i'd be hard to do it but

Bro028.B.dialogueact443	1052.93	1061.81	B	Professor	s^df^nd	-1	0	i'd be hard to do it but it but but the thing is that if you um if you detect that there's periodic sister strong periodic components and you can use a voice worst thing 
Bro028.D.dialogueact444	1053.38	1053.54	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	it but but the thing

Bro028.B.dialogueact447	1062.3	1063.71	B	Professor	fg|s^bd	+1	2	i mean it's probably not worth your time it's it's 
Bro028.B.dialogueact448	1063.71	1064.84	B	Professor	s^df^e	+1	2	worth your time it's it's a side thing and 
Bro028.B.dialogueact449	1064.84	1066.33	B	Professor	s^df^e	+1	2	a side thing and and and it's not to do but i'm i'm saying 
Bro028.D.dialogueact450	1065.27	1065.67	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and and it's not 
Bro028.B.dialogueact451	1066.33	1070.82	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	to do but i'm i'm saying at least as a thought experiment that's what i would want to test 
Bro028.D.dialogueact452	1068.69	1068.85	D	PhD	b	-1	0	experiment 
Bro028.B.dialogueact453	1071.12	1076.46	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh one would want to drive it with uh the two source system rather than a going to one source system and

Bro028.B.dialogueact456	1077.08	1079.08	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	then that would tell you whether in fact it's because we talked about texas 
Bro028.B.dialogueact457	1079.14	1083.83	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because we talked about texas harmonic time lying or other things people have done based on pitch 
Bro028.B.dialogueact458	1084.24	1085.7	B	Professor	s^am^cs	-1	0	maybe that's really a key element maybe 
Bro028.B.dialogueact459	1085.84	1092.14	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	a key element maybe maybe uh i was out that it's it's not possible to do a whole lot better than we're doing back there could be yeah

Bro028.A.dialogueact498	1185.49	1191.01	A	PhD	s	+1	2	so i've um downloaded uh couple of things from mississippi state um one 
Bro028.A.dialogueact499	1191.3	1194.1	A	PhD	s	-1	0	um one is there software their a b. 
Bro028.A.dialogueact500	1194.1	1195.85	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	their a b. c. it's our system 
Bro028.A.dialogueact501	1196.61	1198.18	A	PhD	s	-1	0	download the latest version of that got compiled 
Bro028.A.dialogueact502	1198.67	1200.01	A	PhD	s	-1	0	got compiled and everything um downloaded 
Bro028.A.dialogueact503	1200.48	1203.62	A	PhD	s	-1	0	um downloaded be scripts they wrote 
Bro028.A.dialogueact504	1203.62	1209.23	A	PhD	s	+1	1	they wrote some scripts to sort of make it easy to run the system on the wall street journal uh data um 
Bro028.A.dialogueact505	1209.98	1212.14	A	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	um so i haven't run the scripts yet um waiting 
Bro028.A.dialogueact506	1212.57	1215.08	A	PhD	s	+1	1	um waiting there was one problem with part of it and i wrote a note to joe 
Bro028.A.dialogueact507	1215.08	1217.12	A	PhD	s	+1	1	and i wrote a note to joe asking him about it so i'm waiting to 
Bro028.A.dialogueact508	1217.61	1218.72	A	PhD	s	+1	1	so i'm waiting to hear from him 
Bro028.A.dialogueact509	1219.17	1224.57	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but um i did print something out just to give you an idea about where the system is uh 
Bro028.A.dialogueact510	1224.98	1233.76	A	PhD	s	-1	0	is uh they on their website they uh did this little table of where their system performs relative to other systems that have done this this task 
Bro028.A.dialogueact511	1234.45	1241.36	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and uh the uh the city state system using a by gram grammar uh is it about eight point two percent they're 
Bro028.A.dialogueact512	1241.91	1248.07	A	PhD	s	-1	0	they're comparable systems from uh we're getting from uh like six point nine six twenty percent so there this 
Bro028.A.dialogueact513	1248.3	1248.63	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	so there this 
Bro028.B.dialogueact514	1249.03	1250.87	B	Professor	qy^bu^d	-1	0	is unclean is on queen to set 
Bro028.A.dialogueact515	1250.12	1252.01	A	PhD	s^m^na|s^aa	-1	0	is unclean unclean stuff yeah they they've started the table to set 
Bro028.A.dialogueact516	1252.01	1256.92	A	PhD	s	-1	0	they've started the table where they're showing the results in various different noise conditions but 
Bro028.A.dialogueact517	1256.92	1259.06	A	PhD	s	-1	0	noise conditions but they they don't have a whole lot of it filled in and and i didn't 
Bro028.A.dialogueact519	1259.06	1266.33	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and and i didn't noticing talker printed out that um they don't say here what these different testing conditions are ya have to click 
Bro028.B.dialogueact518	1258.64	1259.1	B	Professor	x	-1	0	of it filled in and and i didn't 
Bro028.A.dialogueact520	1266.33	1268.29	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	are ya have to click on it on the website to see him so i 
Bro028.A.dialogueact521	1268.8	1271.02	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	see him so i i don't know what those numbers and what kind of numbers are they getting on these 
Bro028.B.dialogueact522	1270.37	1273.18	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	numbers and well see i was little confused because what kind of numbers are they getting on these on them or 
Bro028.A.dialogueact523	1272.49	1273.61	A	PhD	s	-1	0	well see i was little confused because on them or 
Bro028.A.dialogueact524	1273.61	1277.48	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	confused because on this table i'm these they're showing where the error rate but on this 
Bro028.A.dialogueact525	1277.48	1278.48	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	rate but on this one 
Bro028.A.dialogueact526	1279.85	1281.66	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	i i don't know if these are word error rates because 
Bro028.A.dialogueact527	1281.66	1283.08	A	PhD	s^ba^df	-1	0	error rates because they're really big so under 
Bro028.A.dialogueact528	1283.14	1286.55	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so under condition one here is ten percent 
Bro028.A.dialogueact529	1287.25	1289.78	A	PhD	s	-1	0	in under three goes to sixty four point six percent 
Bro028.B.dialogueact530	1290.21	1291.26	B	Professor	s^aa|s^am	-1	0	yeah yeah that's probably were irish 
Bro028.A.dialogueact532	1291.66	1292.14	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah so um i irish 
Bro028.B.dialogueact531	1291.26	1291.48	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	yeah irish 
Bro028.A.dialogueact533	1292.49	1294.35	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so um i guess maybe their rates but they're uh 
Bro028.A.dialogueact534	1294.35	1295.92	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	rates but they're uh they're really high 
Bro028.B.dialogueact535	1296.6	1298.05	B	Professor	s^ba.%--	-1	0	so i i i don't find that spread anyway what's 
Bro028.A.dialogueact536	1297.11	1297.4	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so i don't find that spread 
Bro028.B.dialogueact537	1298.05	1298.37	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	anyway what's 
Bro028.B.dialogueact538	1298.46	1308.28	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	anyway what's what's some of the lower error rates on on on uh some of the higher error rates on uh some of these uh highly mismatch difficult conditions what's uh 
Bro028.B.dialogueact539	1308.28	1308.73	B	Professor	qw^e.%--	-1	0	what's uh 
Bro028.D.dialogueact540	1309.81	1313.61	D	PhD	h|s	-1	0	uh yeah it's their own fifteen twenty percent

Bro028.B.dialogueact547	1318.9	1321.41	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	yeah so twenty percent error rate on digits there right 
Bro028.D.dialogueact548	1319.79	1320.0	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	so twenty percent error rate on digits 
Bro028.A.dialogueact551	1322.47	1323.43	A	PhD	s^bk|s^bk^m	-1	0	oh one digits yeah so if you're doing so if you're doing and did i'm digits

Bro028.B.dialogueact562	1327.12	1332.8	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah if you're saying sixty thousand word recognition getting sixty percent error and some of these nice addition not at all surprising 
Bro028.A.dialogueact563	1331.14	1331.41	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah nice addition not at 
Bro028.D.dialogueact564	1333.56	1335.72	D	PhD	s	-1	0	the base ninety sixty percent of some digits 
Bro028.A.dialogueact565	1336.79	1337.17	A	PhD	s^bk|qy^bh^rt	-1	0	oh is it on them more mismatch 
Bro028.D.dialogueact566	1336.96	1339.05	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	oh is it okay on them more mismatch condition

Bro028.A.dialogueact571	1345.6	1348.19	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	yeah so they have a lot of different conditions are going to be selling it's uh bad side when you're looking at the 
Bro028.B.dialogueact572	1347.28	1351.6	B	Professor	s^ba^fe	-1	0	are going to be selling yeah it's uh bad side when you're looking at the numbers you can't tell whether it's actors or 
Bro028.A.dialogueact573	1350.51	1350.77	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah it's actors or 
Bro028.A.dialogueact574	1353.0	1354.23	A	PhD	fg|s^ba	-1	0	it's it's going to be hard um 
Bro028.A.dialogueact575	1354.47	1354.85	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro028.A.dialogueact576	1355.15	1360.72	A	PhD	s	+1	1	there i i'm still waiting for them to release the um multi c. p. u. version of their scripts because right 
Bro028.A.dialogueact577	1360.72	1364.41	A	PhD	s^df	+1	1	of their scripts because right now they're scripts only handles processing on a single c. p. u. which

Bro028.A.dialogueact633	1473.33	1474.25	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	about their system i i don't get any this 
Bro028.A.dialogueact634	1474.25	1475.83	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	i i don't get any mail is 
Bro028.B.dialogueact635	1475.6	1481.8	B	Professor	s	-1	0	mail is is something funny sounding about saying one of these big companies doesn't have enough keep people are to do that so they're 
Bro028.B.dialogueact636	1481.8	1483.86	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	are to do that so they're having to have it done by mississippi state

Bro028.B.dialogueact638	1484.8	1488.11	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	yeah it sounds funny 
Bro028.A.dialogueact639	1489.03	1489.88	A	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	so 
Bro028.B.dialogueact640	1489.5	1489.75	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro028.A.dialogueact642	1492.18	1493.49	A	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	yeah i'm i'm wondering about that because 
Bro028.B.dialogueact641	1491.88	1492.27	B	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	yeah i'm i'm wondering 
Bro028.A.dialogueact643	1493.49	1501.14	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	about that because there's this whole issue about you know simple tuning parameters like we're in session penalty and 
Bro028.D.dialogueact644	1501.31	1501.52	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bro028.A.dialogueact645	1501.89	1505.23	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and whether or not those are going to be tuned or not 
Bro028.A.dialogueact646	1505.23	1506.07	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.D.dialogueact647	1507.53	1508.01	D	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.A.dialogueact648	1509.61	1510.56	A	PhD	s	-1	0	it makes a big difference you change your 
Bro028.A.dialogueact649	1510.56	1515.36	A	PhD	s	-1	0	big difference you change your friend and you know the scale is completely can be completely different so 
Bro028.A.dialogueact650	1515.46	1515.74	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro028.A.dialogueact651	1517.34	1521.57	A	PhD	s	-1	0	seems reasonable that that at least should be tweak to match the friend and 
Bro028.A.dialogueact652	1521.85	1521.94	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	friend and 
Bro028.D.dialogueact653	1522.14	1525.02	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	i did but joe you didn't get any answer from joe 
Bro028.A.dialogueact654	1525.18	1525.67	A	PhD	s^na	-1	0	i did but joe 
Bro028.A.dialogueact655	1525.67	1528.98	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	i did but joe said you know what you're saying makes sense and 
Bro028.D.dialogueact656	1525.85	1526.01	D	PhD	b	-1	0	i did but joe said 
Bro028.A.dialogueact657	1528.98	1529.91	A	PhD	s:s^no	-1	0	makes sense and i don't know 
Bro028.A.dialogueact659	1530.45	1532.56	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	so he doesn't know what the answer is i mean that's 
Bro028.D.dialogueact658	1530.39	1530.62	D	PhD	b	-1	0	so he doesn't 
Bro028.A.dialogueact660	1532.67	1539.32	A	PhD	qh	-1	0	answer is i mean that's we had this back and forth a little bit about you know our sights going to ask are you going to run this data for different sites and 
Bro028.A.dialogueact661	1540.04	1547.15	A	PhD	s	-1	0	well if if if the state runs it then maybe they'll do a lot imitation on that parameter 
Bro028.A.dialogueact662	1548.08	1549.04	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and uh but then 
Bro028.A.dialogueact663	1549.74	1552.09	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but then he was in asks to run it for anybody so it's 
Bro028.A.dialogueact664	1552.09	1555.46	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so it's it's just not clear yet what's going to happen 
Bro028.D.dialogueact665	1555.61	1555.81	D	PhD	b	-1	0	to happen 
Bro028.A.dialogueact666	1556.44	1559.67	A	PhD	s	-1	0	uh he's been putting this stuff out on web website and for people to grab it 
Bro028.A.dialogueact667	1559.67	1563.64	A	PhD	s	-1	0	to grab it i haven't heard too much about so 
Bro028.B.dialogueact668	1563.92	1572.63	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	so could be i mean you kind of actually talked about this a couple times and river some lunches i think that um one thing we might want to do that there's 
Bro028.B.dialogueact669	1572.76	1575.13	B	Professor	qh	+1	1	to do that there's this question about you know what do you want to scale suppose you you can't 
Bro028.B.dialogueact670	1575.21	1578.91	B	Professor	s	+1	1	suppose you you can't adjust these words or some counties and so forth so 
Bro028.B.dialogueact671	1578.91	1580.93	B	Professor	s	+1	1	and so forth so you have to do everything at the level to features work 
Bro028.B.dialogueact672	1580.93	1581.55	B	Professor	qh	-1	0	level to features work that you do 
Bro028.B.dialogueact673	1582.52	1586.62	B	Professor	s	+1	1	and uh one thing i'd suggested it earlier times maybe some sort of scaling some sort of 
Bro028.B.dialogueact674	1586.62	1592.16	B	Professor	s	+1	1	scaling some sort of rude or or something of the um uh features the problem of that 
Bro028.B.dialogueact675	1592.47	1594.37	B	Professor	s	-1	0	the problem of that hasn't quite the same it occurred 
Bro028.B.dialogueact676	1594.37	1595.66	B	Professor	s	+1	1	it occurred to me later 
Bro028.B.dialogueact677	1596.07	1601.94	B	Professor	s^df.%-	+1	1	because what you really want to do scale though the range of the likelihood rather than and just 
Bro028.D.dialogueact678	1599.88	1600.4	D	PhD	s^2.%-	-1	0	the range of the likelihood and just 
Bro028.D.dialogueact679	1601.22	1601.62	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	rather than 
Bro028.B.dialogueact680	1602.8	1607.25	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but what might get it something so it just occurred to me it's kind of intermediate things because we do this 
Bro028.B.dialogueact681	1607.25	1618.98	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	because we do this strange thing that we do with the tandem system placed in that system much you could do is take see um values to come out of the net 
Bro028.B.dialogueact682	1619.14	1621.56	B	Professor	s	-1	0	which are something like lock probabilities 
Bro028.B.dialogueact683	1622.18	1623.28	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and scale those 
Bro028.B.dialogueact684	1624.5	1630.84	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then uh um then at least those things would have the right values and the right 
Bro028.B.dialogueact685	1630.84	1632.02	B	Professor	s^bsc	-1	0	right values and the right the right range and then that goes 
Bro028.B.dialogueact686	1632.51	1635.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then that goes into the rest of it and then she's just observation so it's 
Bro028.B.dialogueact687	1635.51	1643.3	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so it's it's 
Bro028.D.dialogueact688	1635.85	1636.14	D	PhD	b	-1	0	so it's it's 
Bro028.D.dialogueact689	1640.88	1641.09	D	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.D.dialogueact690	1645.16	1650.41	D	PhD	s^df^nd	-1	0	i know they're not but these values are not derek he uses probably sees anyway so there 
Bro028.B.dialogueact691	1649.96	1650.51	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	i know they're not probably sees anyway so there 
Bro028.D.dialogueact692	1650.41	1651.42	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	know they're not i know they're not but but so there there's 
Bro028.B.dialogueact693	1651.07	1651.61	B	Professor	s^m^na	-1	0	i know they're not but but there's 
Bro028.B.dialogueact694	1651.71	1652.25	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	i know they're not but but you know there's 
Bro028.B.dialogueact695	1652.57	1652.89	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	you know 
Bro028.B.dialogueact697	1653.48	1658.56	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	so it because what we're doing is pretty strange uncomplicated we don't really know what the effect is together and so 
Bro028.D.dialogueact696	1653.04	1653.24	D	PhD	b	-1	0	so it because 
Bro028.D.dialogueact698	1657.85	1658.15	D	PhD	b	-1	0	the effect is together and so 
Bro028.B.dialogueact699	1658.55	1661.3	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	together and so um my thought was maybe i mean they're not 
Bro028.B.dialogueact700	1661.3	1663.54	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	i mean they're not used this probabilities 
Bro028.B.dialogueact701	1664.23	1666.41	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but the log probabilities we're taking 
Bro028.B.dialogueact702	1666.91	1673.56	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we're taking advantage of the fact that something like log probabilities has more for gas in shape and guy was then probabilities and so we can 
Bro028.B.dialogueact703	1673.56	1675.01	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so we can model them better so 
Bro028.B.dialogueact704	1675.18	1679.11	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so in a way we taking advantage of the fact that the probabilities because 
Bro028.B.dialogueact705	1679.11	1684.42	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because there's this quantity that looks kind of got seeming tickets lock so 
Bro028.B.dialogueact706	1684.42	1689.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	lock so uh maybe maybe would have a reasonable affected do that i i don't know 
Bro028.D.dialogueact707	1684.96	1685.27	D	PhD	b	-1	0	lock so uh maybe 
Bro028.B.dialogueact708	1689.03	1689.77	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	i i don't know 
Bro028.B.dialogueact709	1690.62	1694.76	B	Professor	s	+1	1	but i mean i guess we still haven't had uh reeling back on this and we 
Bro028.B.dialogueact710	1694.76	1699.81	B	Professor	s	+1	1	on this and we may end up being a situation we just you really can't change that written sessions down to the 
Bro028.B.dialogueact711	1699.81	1702.71	B	Professor	s^cs.%--	+1	1	sessions down to the other thing we could do is also be could mean 
Bro028.B.dialogueact712	1702.87	1706.26	B	Professor	s^bd^df	+1	1	be could mean this this may not help us and the valuation it might help us in our 
Bro028.B.dialogueact713	1706.26	1708.08	B	Professor	s	+1	1	it might help us in our understanding at least we might just 
Bro028.B.dialogueact714	1708.08	1711.77	B	Professor	s	+1	1	we might just run it difference assertion shelties 
Bro028.B.dialogueact715	1712.27	1720.76	B	Professor	s:s	+1	1	and to show that uh well okay you not changing it playing real so we wanted to get this but in fact if we did that made it a big difference 
Bro028.A.dialogueact716	1721.53	1731.43	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	if it it might be possible too uh stimulate the back and with some other system so we we get 
Bro028.A.dialogueact717	1731.43	1733.3	A	PhD	s	-1	0	system so we we get our friend in features

Bro028.A.dialogueact719	1734.89	1735.39	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and then uh 
Bro028.A.dialogueact720	1737.82	1751.65	A	PhD	s	-1	0	as part of the process of figuring out the scaling of these teachers you know for can take it to ruder to a power or something we have some back and that we attach on our features that sort of simulates what would be happening 
Bro028.B.dialogueact721	1740.92	1741.3	B	Professor	b	-1	0	of these teachers you know for can 
Bro028.A.dialogueact722	1752.31	1752.81	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro028.B.dialogueact723	1753.09	1755.07	B	Professor	qy^bu^d	-1	0	and just adjusted until that and just adjusted until it's the best number 
Bro028.A.dialogueact724	1754.43	1760.74	A	PhD	s^m^na.%-	-1	0	and just adjusted until that our version of the back and decides that that it's the best number well it's probably use the 
Bro028.B.dialogueact725	1760.26	1761.52	B	Professor	fg|s^cs	-1	0	that that well it's probably use the real thing can't way and 
Bro028.B.dialogueact726	1761.52	1761.91	B	Professor	qy^g	-1	0	real thing can't way and 
Bro028.B.dialogueact727	1761.91	1765.39	B	Professor	s^cs^e	-1	0	yeah oh yeah that's true real thing can't way and then just just uh it at a reduced s. n. or something 
Bro028.A.dialogueact728	1763.61	1764.44	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah oh yeah it at a reduced s. n. or 
Bro028.A.dialogueact729	1765.14	1765.56	A	PhD	s^na	-1	0	that's true something 
Bro028.B.dialogueact730	1765.92	1766.14	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	that's true and then we just something 
Bro028.A.dialogueact731	1766.43	1769.96	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and then we just use that to determine some scaling factor that we 
Bro028.B.dialogueact732	1770.2	1772.74	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	yeah so i mean i i think that that's a reasonable thing to do and the only 
Bro028.B.dialogueact733	1772.74	1775.0	B	Professor	qh	-1	0	thing to do and the only question is what's the actual now believes in the knob that we use to 
Bro028.A.dialogueact735	1775.46	1775.62	A	PhD	b	-1	0	in the knob that we use to

Bro028.B.dialogueact736	1777.21	1780.11	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i i'd force like i say i don't know the only solution is because we really want to do 
Bro028.B.dialogueact737	1780.11	1782.62	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because we really want to do is change the skills like it's not the chain 
Bro028.A.dialogueact739	1782.93	1783.34	A	PhD	b	-1	0	it's not the chain upscale with a 
Bro028.B.dialogueact738	1782.62	1786.28	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	it's not the chain upscale with a observations but 
Bro028.B.dialogueact740	1786.34	1787.45	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but

Bro028.A.dialogueact744	1799.59	1801.78	A	PhD	qw	-1	0	um what to me say what kind 
Bro028.E.dialogueact745	1800.58	1800.78	E	Grad	qy.%-	-1	0	what to me 
Bro028.E.dialogueact746	1801.7	1804.25	E	Grad	qy	-1	0	say what kind yeah yeah caution mature 
Bro028.A.dialogueact747	1803.89	1804.06	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah yeah caution mature 
Bro028.A.dialogueact748	1804.62	1805.3	A	PhD	s^m^na	-1	0	yeah it's the same 
Bro028.E.dialogueact749	1804.81	1805.11	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah it's the same 
Bro028.A.dialogueact750	1805.68	1809.8	A	PhD	s	-1	0	it's the same system that they use when they participate in the hub five you valve it's 
Bro028.A.dialogueact751	1809.88	1817.92	A	PhD	s	-1	0	you valve it's uh um sort of came out of uh uh looking a lot like h. d. k. i mean 
Bro028.A.dialogueact752	1817.92	1823.44	A	PhD	s	-1	0	h. d. k. i mean they started off with um when they were building their system they were always comparing beach kid make sure they were getting similar results and so it's 
Bro028.A.dialogueact753	1823.44	1825.52	A	PhD	s	-1	0	results and so it's a guessing mixture system uh say 
Bro028.A.dialogueact754	1825.96	1826.32	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	system uh say this intermixed down 
Bro028.B.dialogueact755	1825.97	1831.66	B	Professor	qy	-1	0	system uh i don't know yeah and then say this intermixed down sort of procedure really start off with a small number is things and yeah 
Bro028.A.dialogueact756	1829.16	1829.78	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	i don't know start off with a small 
Bro028.A.dialogueact757	1831.2	1833.2	A	PhD	fg|s^2	-1	0	yeah and then divide the mixers and have i don't know if they do that things and yeah 
Bro028.B.dialogueact758	1831.66	1831.78	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	yeah and then things and yeah 
Bro028.B.dialogueact759	1832.01	1832.26	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	divide the mixers and 
Bro028.A.dialogueact760	1833.2	1834.08	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	have i don't know if they do that i'm not really sure 
Bro028.A.dialogueact761	1834.3	1835.07	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	i'm not really sure 
Bro028.B.dialogueact762	1834.38	1834.63	B	Professor	b	-1	0	i'm not really sure

Bro028.A.dialogueact768	1845.65	1851.02	A	PhD	s	-1	0	have it up here but i have a the whole system description that describes exactly what their system is and i'm not sure 
Bro028.B.dialogueact769	1850.45	1850.59	B	Professor	s^bk.%	-1	0	system is 
Bro028.A.dialogueact770	1851.02	1851.9	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	and i'm not sure

Bro028.B.dialogueact815	1943.84	1946.19	B	Professor	s	-1	0	the distribution so you you have the distribution so the training set 
Bro028.D.dialogueact816	1944.47	1944.65	D	PhD	%	-1	0	you you have the distribution 
Bro028.B.dialogueact817	1947.08	1948.38	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and then uh this this is just 
Bro028.B.dialogueact818	1948.52	1953.04	B	Professor	s	-1	0	this this is just uh hissed a gram of of yeah but it's i guess right and then

Bro028.B.dialogueact820	1953.45	1956.46	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	right and then um people do this image processing some you have this kind 
Bro028.D.dialogueact821	1953.61	1953.95	D	PhD	b	-1	0	right and then 
Bro028.B.dialogueact822	1956.52	1961.53	B	Professor	s	-1	0	some you have this kind of that's just a gram of of levels of greatness or whatever and and 
Bro028.B.dialogueact823	1961.53	1972.37	B	Professor	s	-1	0	whatever and and and then when you get a new new thing that you you want to adjust to be better in some way you adjusted so that that just to ground of the new day looks like feel they they use kind 
Bro028.A.dialogueact824	1962.24	1962.46	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and then 
Bro028.B.dialogueact825	1972.37	1977.54	B	Professor	s	-1	0	they they use kind of peace wise when linear or uh some kind of peace first approximation they did a 
Bro028.B.dialogueact826	1977.54	1983.83	B	Professor	s	-1	0	they did a one person was piece was funny another that have the power loss thing between them between the points and 
Bro028.B.dialogueact827	1983.93	1984.63	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	points and uh 
Bro028.B.dialogueact828	1985.7	1992.8	B	Professor	s	-1	0	they said they said they sort of see it in a way as for the speech cases bean kind of a generalization of spectra subtraction away because 
Bro028.B.dialogueact829	1992.8	1997.96	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	away because you inspectors attraction you're trying to get rid of this excess energy uh 
Bro028.B.dialogueact830	1997.96	1999.8	B	Professor	s	-1	0	energy uh know not supposed to be there 
Bro028.B.dialogueact831	2000.83	2002.86	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh and uh this 
Bro028.B.dialogueact832	2002.86	2006.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh this is sort of justin for for a lot of different levels and 
Bro028.B.dialogueact833	2006.94	2011.7	B	Professor	s	-1	0	of different levels and then they have they have some kind of uh four or something so forgets 
Bro028.E.dialogueact834	2010.16	2010.36	E	Grad	b	-1	0	uh four 
Bro028.B.dialogueact835	2011.7	2015.33	B	Professor	s	-1	0	or something so forgets to uh low you don't to it and they they claimed 
Bro028.A.dialogueact836	2014.45	2014.58	A	PhD	b	-1	0	to 
Bro028.B.dialogueact837	2015.44	2017.42	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so is it and they they claimed furniture so 
Bro028.D.dialogueact838	2015.55	2015.72	D	PhD	b	-1	0	it and they they claimed 
Bro028.A.dialogueact840	2017.73	2020.41	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	so is this just a gram across different frequency bins 
Bro028.B.dialogueact839	2017.42	2017.55	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so is 
Bro028.A.dialogueact841	2022.12	2022.42	A	PhD	qrr.%-	-1	0	or um 
Bro028.B.dialogueact842	2022.8	2024.52	B	Professor	h|s.%--	-1	0	or um i think it's you 
Bro028.B.dialogueact843	2024.94	2025.8	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	it's you know i remember that 
Bro028.B.dialogueact844	2026.09	2026.52	B	Professor	qy.%-	-1	0	ever 
Bro028.D.dialogueact845	2027.29	2029.57	D	PhD	s	-1	0	they think they have yeah different easter grounds

Bro028.D.dialogueact847	2031.7	2034.03	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	so one has to gram something like one per frequency than they did 
Bro028.B.dialogueact848	2033.19	2033.32	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	frequency than 
Bro028.A.dialogueact851	2034.18	2036.41	A	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	so one has to gram per frequency been they did yeah i guess 
Bro028.B.dialogueact850	2034.17	2034.88	B	Professor	%	-1	0	so one has to gram they did 
Bro028.D.dialogueact849	2034.03	2034.11	D	PhD	%--	-1	0	so one has to gram they did

Bro028.D.dialogueact853	2036.55	2037.42	D	PhD	s^aa|s^am	-1	0	been yeah i guess 
Bro028.A.dialogueact855	2039.16	2039.63	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	and that's i should read the paper i 
Bro028.D.dialogueact854	2038.98	2039.99	D	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	and that's but i should read the paper i 
Bro028.D.dialogueact856	2039.99	2042.21	D	PhD	s^bd^df	-1	0	and that's yeah and i remember whether it was filter i should read the paper i just went through the poster quickly and 
Bro028.B.dialogueact857	2040.5	2040.95	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah just went

Bro028.B.dialogueact858	2040.95	2044.49	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	yeah and i remember whether it was filter bank saying this or whether it just went through the poster quickly and 
Bro028.A.dialogueact861	2042.4	2042.62	A	PhD	s^bk.%	-1	0	it was filter and 
Bro028.D.dialogueact860	2042.21	2042.99	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	it was filter and 
Bro028.B.dialogueact862	2044.49	2046.64	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	this or whether it was a fifty band or 
Bro028.A.dialogueact864	2047.13	2047.27	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	uhhuh and and 
Bro028.B.dialogueact863	2046.64	2046.83	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	or 
Bro028.A.dialogueact865	2047.66	2055.61	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	uhhuh and and that that um just to grammar presents be different energy levels that have been seen at that frequency 
Bro028.B.dialogueact866	2047.67	2048.32	B	Professor	s^no.%	-1	0	uhhuh and and that that 
Bro028.B.dialogueact867	2055.63	2057.42	B	Professor	s^2^na|s^aa	-1	0	frequency 
Bro028.A.dialogueact869	2057.15	2057.57	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.E.dialogueact868	2056.76	2056.93	E	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.B.dialogueact870	2058.96	2061.28	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	and they do it they said that they could do it for the test so you don't have 
Bro028.B.dialogueact871	2061.65	2062.97	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so you don't have to change the training 
Bro028.B.dialogueact872	2063.19	2064.67	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you just do measurement of the training 
Bro028.B.dialogueact873	2065.45	2069.2	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then uh for testing uh you can do it for one per hour turns even relatively 
Bro028.B.dialogueact874	2069.53	2071.11	B	Professor	s	-1	0	even relatively short other answers they claim it 
Bro028.B.dialogueact875	2071.11	2072.74	B	Professor	s	-1	0	they claim it works pretty well 
Bro028.A.dialogueact876	2073.51	2074.64	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	so they uh 
Bro028.A.dialogueact877	2075.2	2080.1	A	PhD	qy	-1	0	is the idea that you you run a test that are in it's through some history gram generation thing and then you compare the 
Bro028.A.dialogueact878	2080.1	2086.68	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and then you compare the history rams and then tells you what to do to the outer rents to make it more like i guess impress 
Bro028.B.dialogueact879	2083.16	2083.72	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	what to do to i guess 
Bro028.B.dialogueact880	2085.61	2085.89	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	to make 
Bro028.B.dialogueact881	2086.98	2087.46	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	it more like i see impress why didn't read carefully 
Bro028.A.dialogueact883	2087.83	2088.24	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i see uhhuh why didn't read carefully how they actually 
Bro028.B.dialogueact882	2087.46	2089.7	B	Professor	s^bd^df	-1	0	i see uhhuh yeah why didn't read carefully how they actually implement where there is 
Bro028.A.dialogueact884	2088.47	2088.65	A	PhD	b	-1	0	uhhuh how they actually 
Bro028.A.dialogueact885	2089.61	2089.92	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah implement where there is 
Bro028.B.dialogueact886	2089.7	2094.5	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	yeah implement where there is some uh online thing where there was a second pass or what but but 
Bro028.B.dialogueact887	2094.5	2097.35	B	Professor	s	-1	0	or what but but they and those sort of the idea so that that seemed 
Bro028.A.dialogueact888	2095.71	2095.88	A	PhD	b	-1	0	they 
Bro028.B.dialogueact889	2097.35	2098.74	B	Professor	s	-1	0	the idea so that that seemed to you know different 
Bro028.B.dialogueact890	2099.25	2105.82	B	Professor	qh	-1	0	we're sort of curious about uh what are some things that are uh uh um conceptual a quite different from what we've done because 
Bro028.A.dialogueact892	2106.07	2106.48	A	PhD	b	-1	0	we you know one thing 
Bro028.B.dialogueact891	2106.02	2107.55	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	we you know one thing that that uh 
Bro028.B.dialogueact893	2107.85	2115.95	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that that uh stuff and and so nelson defined uh was if they could actually make a unified piece of software that handle a range of different things that people were talking about and 
Bro028.B.dialogueact894	2115.95	2118.63	B	Professor	s	-1	0	were talking about and it was really just sort of setting of different constance 
Bro028.B.dialogueact895	2119.28	2121.08	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and it would turn you know one thing into another turn winter filtering 
Bro028.B.dialogueact896	2121.08	2123.73	B	Professor	s	-1	0	turn winter filtering into spectra subtraction or whatever 
Bro028.B.dialogueact897	2124.43	2126.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but there's other things that were not doing so we're not making any 
Bro028.B.dialogueact898	2126.03	2127.74	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so we're not making any is pitch 
Bro028.B.dialogueact899	2128.72	2131.28	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh and which again like might be important 
Bro028.B.dialogueact900	2132.15	2136.16	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	uh because the stuff between the harmonic says probably smokes and and see 
Bro028.B.dialogueact901	2136.29	2139.65	B	Professor	s^j	-1	0	and and see uh transcribers i find that 
Bro028.B.dialogueact902	2140.21	2143.24	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh and um they 
Bro028.B.dialogueact903	2143.93	2146.45	B	Professor	s	-1	0	they uh stuff out the harmonic system so much and 
Bro028.B.dialogueact904	2146.82	2147.85	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	much and and uh 
Bro028.B.dialogueact905	2148.39	2153.87	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and it there's this overall idea of early sort of matching the the distribution of some 
Bro028.B.dialogueact906	2154.58	2155.6	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh not to us 
Bro028.B.dialogueact907	2155.71	2158.21	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	to us not just distracting 
Bro028.B.dialogueact908	2158.6	2160.81	B	Professor	s	-1	0	not just distracting off your estimate the noise 
Bro028.B.dialogueact909	2161.23	2161.49	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.B.dialogueact910	2163.64	2171.33	B	Professor	s^bu^t^tc	-1	0	so i guess um that there's going to play around with some of these things now over this next i don't know i don't have feedback 
Bro028.D.dialogueact911	2170.17	2171.53	D	PhD	h|s^no	-1	0	i don't know i don't have feedback 
Bro028.B.dialogueact912	2171.33	2171.37	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	i don't know i don't have feedback 
Bro028.D.dialogueact913	2171.53	2173.0	D	PhD	s^e^no	-1	0	i don't know i don't have feedback from him but

Bro028.B.dialogueact915	2173.62	2173.92	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.D.dialogueact916	2174.67	2175.99	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	well he's got 
Bro028.B.dialogueact917	2175.63	2176.57	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well he's got it anyway so you can't 
Bro028.B.dialogueact918	2176.57	2177.18	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it anyway so you can't so potentially 
Bro028.D.dialogueact919	2176.68	2176.88	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	it anyway so you can't 
Bro028.B.dialogueact921	2177.9	2185.24	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so potentially if he came up with something that was useful like a different better legislation module something he could ship it to you guys out there 
Bro028.D.dialogueact920	2177.41	2177.61	D	PhD	b	-1	0	so potentially 
Bro028.B.dialogueact923	2185.24	2185.37	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.D.dialogueact922	2184.88	2185.0	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	out there 
Bro028.B.dialogueact924	2186.36	2187.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	could put again 
Bro028.D.dialogueact925	2186.63	2187.82	D	PhD	b	-1	0	could put again 
Bro028.B.dialogueact926	2189.6	2189.9	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro028.B.dialogueact930	2196.55	2198.72	B	Professor	fg|qh.%--	-1	0	so we just uh um i think 
Bro028.B.dialogueact931	2198.84	2206.86	B	Professor	s	-1	0	um i think starting starting a couple weeks now especially if you're not going to be around for awhile will will be shifting moreover to some other other territory but 
Bro028.B.dialogueact932	2206.86	2209.28	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	territory but uh mm not not 
Bro028.B.dialogueact933	2209.28	2211.91	B	Professor	s	-1	0	mm not not so much in this meeting about her but 
Bro028.B.dialogueact934	2211.91	2213.34	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	meeting about her but but uh 
Bro028.B.dialogueact935	2214.17	2220.17	B	Professor	s^cs^t^tc	-1	0	uh maybe just uh quickly today about just a little bit about what you're to talking about with michael very okay 
Bro028.B.dialogueact936	2220.17	2220.31	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	very okay 
Bro028.B.dialogueact937	2220.76	2224.08	B	Professor	s^cs^t	-1	0	very can say something about but we're talking about okay so michael klein 
Bro028.C.dialogueact938	2220.9	2221.22	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	very can say something about okay 
Bro028.C.dialogueact939	2224.35	2229.1	C	Grad	s	+1	1	so michael klein snooze a p. h. d. student from germany showed up this week will be here for about six 
Bro028.C.dialogueact940	2229.1	2230.57	C	Grad	s	+1	1	will be here for about six months and he's done 
Bro028.C.dialogueact941	2230.57	2237.43	C	Grad	s	+1	1	months and he's done some work using an auditory model of um you mean hearing and 
Bro028.C.dialogueact942	2238.0	2242.71	C	Grad	s	+1	1	using that uh to generate speech recognition features 
Bro028.C.dialogueact943	2243.52	2256.16	C	Grad	s	+1	1	and he did work back in germany with um a toy recognition system using um isolated digit recognition as the past it was actually just a single 
Bro028.C.dialogueact944	2256.16	2260.74	C	Grad	s	-1	0	it was actually just a single airing newer that networks that classified words classified 
Bro028.C.dialogueact945	2260.95	2262.91	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	words classified digits in fact 
Bro028.C.dialogueact946	2263.45	2269.29	C	Grad	s	-1	0	um and he tried that on i think on some of our data and other was that he thought seemed respectable and 
Bro028.C.dialogueact947	2269.29	2269.54	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	and 
Bro028.C.dialogueact948	2270.07	2275.51	C	Grad	s	+1	1	he well he's coming here to use it on uh a real speech recognition system 
Bro028.C.dialogueact949	2277.87	2279.56	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so i'll be working with him on uh and 
Bro028.C.dialogueact950	2279.7	2280.48	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	on uh and um 
Bro028.C.dialogueact951	2281.69	2283.56	C	Grad	s	-1	0	maybe i should say a little more about these features although 
Bro028.C.dialogueact952	2283.94	2285.49	C	Grad	s^bd^df	-1	0	features although i don't understand out well 
Bro028.C.dialogueact953	2286.15	2288.87	C	Grad	s	-1	0	d. i think it's a two stage id uh and 
Bro028.C.dialogueact954	2288.87	2295.83	C	Grad	s	-1	0	id uh and um the first stage of the featured this correspond to what's called the peripheral auditory system 
Bro028.C.dialogueact955	2296.45	2302.22	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and i guess that is like a filter bank with a compresses non linear eighty and 
Bro028.C.dialogueact956	2302.62	2309.63	C	Grad	s^no	-1	0	and mm i'm not sure what we have in that that isn't ready modeled in something like um he l. t. i should learn 
Bro028.C.dialogueact957	2309.63	2310.79	C	Grad	s	-1	0	l. t. i should learn more about that 
Bro028.C.dialogueact958	2311.34	2317.61	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and and the second stage is um the most different thing i think from what we usually do it's um 
Bro028.C.dialogueact959	2317.61	2333.49	C	Grad	s	-1	0	do it's um it can keep features which are um based on sort of like based on different different uh wave lit basis functions used to analyze the input 
Bro028.C.dialogueact960	2333.57	2334.48	C	Grad	%	-1	0	so the 
Bro028.C.dialogueact961	2334.56	2338.63	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so the he uses analysis functions called gob our functions 
Bro028.C.dialogueact962	2339.21	2345.68	C	Grad	s	-1	0	um which have a certain extent um in time and in frequency 
Bro028.C.dialogueact963	2346.16	2354.45	C	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and the idea is either used to sample um the signal it representatives of time frequency representation 
Bro028.C.dialogueact964	2355.44	2358.62	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so you're sampling some piece of this time frequency plane 
Bro028.C.dialogueact965	2359.72	2365.79	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and um that um is is interesting because 
Bro028.C.dialogueact966	2365.79	2371.93	C	Grad	s	-1	0	interesting because for for one thing you could use it and i'm you know a multi scale way you 
Bro028.C.dialogueact967	2371.93	2372.62	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	way you could have these 
Bro028.C.dialogueact968	2373.35	2378.08	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	instead of having everything like we use a twenty five millisecond are so analysis windows typically uh and 
Bro028.C.dialogueact969	2378.71	2380.8	C	Grad	s	-1	0	uh and that's the time scale for features that you could 
Bro028.C.dialogueact970	2380.8	2385.17	C	Grad	s	-1	0	for features that you could using this um basis i said you've got some basis functions which have 
Bro028.C.dialogueact971	2385.63	2387.73	C	Grad	s	-1	0	which have a lot longer time scale 
Bro028.C.dialogueact972	2388.32	2390.47	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and um so much of a lot shorter and 
Bro028.C.dialogueact973	2390.47	2393.91	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and so it would be like i said a multi scale features 
Bro028.C.dialogueact974	2394.93	2396.22	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so he's interested in um 
Bro028.C.dialogueact975	2397.19	2406.35	C	Grad	s	+1	1	did this is because it's um there are these different brown is the shape of these bases functions um there are a lot of different possible basis functions and so he 
Bro028.C.dialogueact976	2406.35	2414.35	C	Grad	s	+1	1	what does he do to choose and so he he actually does an off of my station procedure to choose an an awful set a basis functions out of all the possible it's 
Bro028.A.dialogueact977	2412.92	2413.11	A	PhD	b	-1	0	functions out of all the possible 
Bro028.A.dialogueact978	2413.18	2413.41	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	out of all the possible 
Bro028.A.dialogueact979	2414.14	2415.28	A	PhD	qw	-1	0	what does he do to choose to it's 
Bro028.C.dialogueact980	2417.19	2419.02	C	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	that he uses this kind of money is um 
Bro028.C.dialogueact981	2419.02	2423.52	C	Grad	s	+1	1	is um he starts with he has a set of them 
Bro028.C.dialogueact982	2424.15	2424.81	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro028.C.dialogueact983	2425.36	2427.88	C	Grad	s	-1	0	he and then he uses that to classify 
Bro028.C.dialogueact984	2428.95	2433.6	C	Grad	s^rt	+1	1	and he he he tries um using just m. i. s. one of them so 
Bro028.C.dialogueact985	2433.94	2437.86	C	Grad	s	+1	1	one of them so there are m. possible subset of this lake pans actor 
Bro028.C.dialogueact986	2438.09	2442.24	C	Grad	s	+1	1	he tries classifying using each of the m. possible sub actors whichever you 
Bro028.D.dialogueact987	2439.28	2439.48	D	PhD	b	-1	0	using each you 
Bro028.C.dialogueact988	2442.68	2457.06	C	Grad	s	+1	1	surround yeah whichever sub factor um works the uh the best i guess he says that see feature that didn't use what's the most useless feature so we'll throw 
Bro028.B.dialogueact989	2451.47	2452.1	B	Professor	b	-1	0	he says that 
Bro028.B.dialogueact990	2455.32	2455.94	B	Professor	s^2	-1	0	surround what's the most 
Bro028.B.dialogueact991	2457.35	2457.61	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah so we'll throw 
Bro028.C.dialogueact992	2457.6	2458.73	C	Grad	s	+1	1	yeah so we'll throw it how and we're going 
Bro028.C.dialogueact993	2458.73	2464.25	C	Grad	s	+1	1	it how and we're going to randomly selects another feature from the set of possible basis function

Bro028.B.dialogueact1001	2470.88	2474.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it's much simpler but it's but it's it's this one of things i like about it i say so for sale 
Bro028.A.dialogueact1002	2471.51	2471.91	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	it's but it's it's 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1003	2474.54	2476.23	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so for sale you're absolutely right i mean it 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1004	2476.23	2482.97	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean it in truth both pieces of this are have their analogies and stuff we already do 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1005	2483.5	2486.38	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but it's a different take and how to approach it and 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1006	2486.51	2490.48	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it and potentially one that's maybe a bit more systematic and what we've done 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1007	2491.11	2494.9	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh and it's a bit more inspiration from from auditory thing so 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1008	2494.9	2496.74	B	Professor	s	-1	0	auditory thing so it's so i think it's neat thing to try 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1009	2497.19	2500.32	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	the primary features um are in fact yeah essentially 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1010	2500.64	2505.42	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah essentially it's it's uh you know kill p. e. or all caps from or something like that you've you've got 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1011	2505.42	2507.82	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that you've you've got some uh compression we always 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1012	2507.82	2509.24	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh compression we always have some compression we always have some 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1013	2509.24	2515.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we always have some you know the the the kind of filter bank was kind of quality log scaling um 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1014	2515.95	2519.1	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	um and if you put in if you also include the roster in it ross the the 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1015	2519.1	2531.46	B	Professor	s	-1	0	ross the the filtering being done the log in maine has an age you see like uh characteristic which you know people to pick typically put these kind of uh um uh auditory friend and so it's very very 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1016	2531.46	2532.56	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so it's very very similar 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1017	2533.07	2534.66	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh but is not exactly the same 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1018	2535.06	2535.43	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um i 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1019	2535.97	2539.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	um i would agree that the second one is is somewhat more different but um 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1020	2539.18	2549.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but um it's mainly different in that the things that we've been done like that has been um had a different kind of motivation and it ended up with different kinds of constraints 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1021	2550.14	2559.16	B	Professor	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	so for instance if you look at the l. t. a. ross the stuff you basically what they do is they they look at the different i can actors out of the l. c. a. and they form filters out of it right and 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1022	2559.82	2565.16	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and those filters have different uh kinds of temper like stance into pearl characteristics and so in 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1023	2565.67	2567.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so in fact the multi scale 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1024	2568.13	2573.9	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but they're not sort of systematically multi scale like it starts here and go to their go to their to their and so forth it's 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1025	2573.9	2578.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so forth it's more like you run it on this you do just an analysis you find out what's helpful it's multi 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1027	2578.97	2579.97	B	Professor	%	-1	0	it's multi scale because you use 
Bro028.C.dialogueact1026	2578.53	2581.38	C	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	yeah they it's multi scale because you use several in parallel so uh 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1029	2581.61	2582.61	B	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	yeah they several of them yeah so uh 
Bro028.C.dialogueact1028	2581.38	2581.97	C	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	yeah they so uh 
Bro028.C.dialogueact1030	2581.97	2582.11	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	yeah they several of them yeah so uh 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1032	2582.61	2582.83	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	several of them yeah 
Bro028.C.dialogueact1031	2582.58	2582.77	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	several of them yeah 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1033	2583.48	2584.74	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	uh you don't have to but but 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1034	2584.74	2586.42	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	you don't have to but but that uh he cats 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1035	2587.17	2587.6	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um but 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1036	2588.05	2590.02	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it's also uh 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1037	2590.18	2591.95	B	Professor	%	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.B.dialogueact1038	2592.17	2596.73	B	Professor	s	-1	0	even makes accept people do this kind of all the analysis they've done it on frequency direction and they've 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1039	2596.73	2598.42	B	Professor	s	-1	0	direction and they've done it on the time direction i 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1040	2598.98	2602.92	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i think he may have had some people sometimes doing it on both sanitation taste recent 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1041	2602.92	2603.46	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	taste recent too do you know be the closest 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1042	2603.46	2605.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	too do you know be the closest to these gabor function kind of things 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1043	2606.7	2608.81	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh but i don't think they've done that much and 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1044	2609.56	2613.78	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and uh the other thing that's interesting b. t. uh the future selection thing it's a simple 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1045	2613.78	2614.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	selection thing it's a simple method 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1046	2615.16	2616.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i kind of like it um there's 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1047	2616.08	2619.87	B	Professor	s	-1	0	um there's a a old old method for future selection i mean 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1048	2619.87	2624.37	B	Professor	s	-1	0	selection i mean uh i remember people referring to is old when i was flying with a twenty years ago so i know it's pretty 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1049	2624.37	2625.3	B	Professor	s	-1	0	ago so i know it's pretty old uh 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1050	2625.86	2628.35	B	Professor	s	-1	0	old uh cult step twice they're just going analysis and what shoe 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1051	2628.35	2629.19	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and what shoe which i think used and social 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1052	2629.19	2631.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	which i think used and social sciences a lot to you 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1053	2631.79	2633.86	B	Professor	s	-1	0	to you you you you pick the best teacher 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1054	2634.76	2639.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then you take you find the next feature that's the best in combination with it 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1055	2640.0	2641.02	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so on and so on and what what 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1056	2641.5	2644.55	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and what what michael striving seems to be much much better because 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1057	2645.08	2652.1	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	the problem with the supplies screaming analysis is that you don't know you know if you've picked the right set of features just because something's good 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1058	2652.1	2654.67	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	just because something's good feature doesn't mean you should be adding it so 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1059	2654.67	2656.75	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	be adding it so um uh here 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1060	2656.75	2658.55	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh here at least you're starting off of all of them 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1061	2659.06	2661.06	B	Professor	s	-1	0	endured during out useless features i think that's that seems 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1062	2661.06	2663.96	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	i think that's that seems seems like a lot better idea 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1063	2664.82	2667.79	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh you're always looking at things and combination of a features 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1064	2668.04	2668.31	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um so the 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1065	2668.84	2676.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	um so the only thing is of course there's this this artificial question of of uh exactly how you how you would how you assess it and if 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1066	2676.68	2679.27	B	Professor	s	-1	0	assess it and if if you order had been different and throwing them out me so 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1067	2679.75	2681.46	B	Professor	s	-1	0	me so is necessarily really optimal but it seems like 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1068	2681.46	2682.91	B	Professor	s^ba^df	-1	0	but it seems like a pretty good or a stick 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1070	2684.38	2686.57	B	Professor	s	+1	1	so i think it's it's i think it's kind of neat stuff and and 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1069	2684.05	2684.2	E	Grad	b	-1	0	so i think 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1071	2686.57	2688.19	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	stuff and and and uh 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1072	2689.06	2694.12	B	Professor	s	+1	1	the thing that i wanted to to add to it also is to have us use this in a multi stream way 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1073	2696.24	2696.65	E	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.B.dialogueact1074	2697.43	2697.93	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.B.dialogueact1075	2698.67	2708.56	B	Professor	s	+1	1	so so that um when you come up with these different things these different functions you don't necessarily just put them all into one huge factor 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1076	2709.39	2715.13	B	Professor	s	+1	1	but perhaps you have some of them in one some of another stream and so forth 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1077	2716.03	2720.61	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.B.dialogueact1078	2723.91	2729.01	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and we also talked a little bit about uh uh she had dramas stuff in which you 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1079	2729.01	2732.73	B	Professor	s	-1	0	which you the way you look at is that there's these different mapping and some 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1080	2732.73	2738.22	B	Professor	s	-1	0	mapping and some of some emphasize uh upwards moving uh energy infringing frequency in summer emphasizing 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1081	2738.22	2739.9	B	Professor	s	-1	0	in summer emphasizing downward in 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1082	2739.9	2743.94	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	downward in fast things slow things so forth 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1083	2744.16	2744.48	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1084	2745.11	2746.41	B	Professor	s	-1	0	there's a bunch of stuff to look at but uh 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1085	2746.41	2751.67	B	Professor	s	-1	0	at but uh wish are going to start off with what he uh came here with 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1086	2751.67	2753.8	B	Professor	s	-1	0	here with branch out branch out from there 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1087	2755.31	2758.36	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and his advisors here too same time so 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1088	2758.42	2758.65	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	time so 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1089	2759.16	2762.46	B	Professor	s	-1	0	will be another interesting source of with them 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1090	2763.28	2764.01	E	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.B.dialogueact1091	2764.8	2765.04	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.E.dialogueact1092	2766.44	2782.1	E	Grad	s^rt^tc	-1	0	as we're talking about this i was thinking um whether there's a relationship between between my close approach to uh some some sort of optimal brain damage our optimal brain surgeon on than your own that's so 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1093	2768.55	2768.63	B	Professor	b	-1	0	this i was thinking 
Bro028.C.dialogueact1095	2783.14	2783.34	C	Grad	b	-1	0	like if we 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1094	2782.94	2784.17	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so like if we 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1096	2784.54	2784.91	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.E.dialogueact1097	2785.9	2788.21	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	we have our we have our roster features and and presumably 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1098	2788.57	2800.53	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and and presumably they know and that's or are learning some sort of uh non mayor mapping uh from uh uh the features to to this this probability pushed your space 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1099	2796.95	2797.38	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	to to this 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1100	2801.04	2801.29	E	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.E.dialogueact1101	2801.29	2808.23	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and each of the hidden units is learning some sort of some sort of some sort of pattern right 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1102	2808.7	2809.01	E	Grad	s^f	-1	0	right could be like 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1103	2809.01	2814.79	E	Grad	s	-1	0	could be like like these he's auditory patterns that michael 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1104	2815.18	2828.61	E	Grad	s	-1	0	or and then when you're looking at d. the best features you can take out do the do this uh brain surgery by taking out um hidden units that don't really help at all 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1105	2823.79	2824.29	B	Professor	b	-1	0	do the do this uh brain surgery by 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1107	2828.9	2830.01	B	Professor	s^2	-1	0	or the or teachers right at all 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1106	2828.69	2829.8	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	or the or teachers at all 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1108	2830.26	2830.53	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1109	2830.66	2830.81	E	Grad	b	-1	0	right 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1110	2831.38	2845.92	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	i think you actually make me think that a very important point here is that um if we eat again try to look at how is this different from what we're doing uh there's uh they uh a nasty argument dixie made is that it's it's not different at all 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1111	2846.84	2850.45	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because uh uh if you you know the the selection part 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1112	2851.13	2855.56	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because we are going into a a very powerful uh not money already that 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1113	2855.99	2859.38	B	Professor	s	-1	0	already that uh in fact is combining overtime frequency and 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1114	2860.01	2862.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it's coming up with its own you know better than gabor functions it's 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1116	2862.94	2864.46	B	Professor	s	-1	0	functions it's you know girl that functions that whatever's 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1115	2862.88	2863.1	E	Grad	b	-1	0	functions it's you know girl that functions 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1118	2864.46	2866.27	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that whatever's finds to be best um 
Bro028.C.dialogueact1117	2864.15	2864.9	C	Grad	%	-1	0	that whatever's 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1119	2866.89	2869.5	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	um so you could argue that effected but i i 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1120	2869.77	2871.86	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but i i don't actually believe that argument because 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1121	2871.96	2875.44	B	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	that argument because i know that um you can uh 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1122	2876.05	2877.53	B	Professor	s	-1	0	computing features is useful 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1123	2878.74	2882.84	B	Professor	s	-1	0	even though in principle you haven't added anything 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1124	2883.09	2885.85	B	Professor	s	-1	0	in fact he's attracted something from there is no way for 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1125	2886.88	2891.91	B	Professor	s	-1	0	if you've processed it in some way you typically lost something some information and 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1126	2892.04	2897.55	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	so you've lost information yet it does better with with teachers that does with the way for them so 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1127	2897.55	2897.91	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	way for them so 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1128	2898.71	2902.72	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh i i know that sometimes it's useful to too constrained thing so that's 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1129	2902.72	2908.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	thing so that's what he really seems like the constraint and all this stuff it's the constraints that actually matters because it wasn't 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1130	2908.6	2912.91	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because it wasn't the constraints it matter then we would've completely solve this problem long ago because 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1131	2912.91	2917.05	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	long ago because long but we already knew how to put way forms into parcels to to school like 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1132	2917.83	2917.89	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro028.E.dialogueact1134	2919.69	2919.98	E	Grad	b	-1	0	we had continued processing 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1135	2921.44	2921.64	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.B.dialogueact1136	2923.26	2923.54	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	uh i guess you 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1137	2924.04	2924.62	B	Professor	s^2	-1	0	that would work yeah i agree away from 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1138	2924.62	2925.18	B	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	that would work yeah i agree away from 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1139	2927.29	2928.11	B	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah there's a problem 
Bro028.D.dialogueact1140	2927.4	2928.36	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	yeah there's a problem 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1141	2929.69	2930.43	B	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah that would work but but i mean 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1142	2930.49	2933.9	B	Professor	s	-1	0	would work but but i mean it it's with finite of those things i mean 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1143	2933.9	2937.42	B	Professor	s	-1	0	of those things i mean uh we we have done experiments relive really have put away forums and then and 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1144	2937.42	2938.73	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and then and and uh we kept 
Bro028.D.dialogueact1145	2937.77	2938.23	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and then and and uh we kept 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1146	2938.73	2940.97	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and uh we kept never parameters the same and so forth and 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1147	2940.97	2942.24	B	Professor	s	-1	0	same and so forth and use a lot of training day and it and it 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1148	2942.38	2943.63	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and it and it it uh i 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1149	2944.12	2944.7	B	Professor	s^bd^df	-1	0	not see that but a lot 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1150	2944.7	2946.94	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	not see that but a lot and i compared number premieres 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1151	2946.94	2949.56	B	Professor	s	-1	0	number premieres and it it uh it just doesn't do nearly as well 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1153	2950.4	2952.74	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so the point is that you want to suppress 
Bro028.D.dialogueact1152	2950.04	2951.02	D	PhD	b	-1	0	so the point is that you want to 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1154	2953.15	2954.69	B	Professor	s	-1	0	not just having an actual information you want 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1155	2954.69	2961.89	B	Professor	s	-1	0	information you want to suppress uh the aspects of input signal that are not helpful for before this commission of trying to make 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1156	2962.25	2962.54	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.B.dialogueact1157	2967.94	2969.48	B	Professor	s^t^tc.%--	-1	0	i'm just briefly 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1158	2970.16	2973.67	E	Grad	s	+1	1	well that's sort of segway isn't uh what what i'm doing 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1159	2972.3	2972.53	B	Professor	b	-1	0	what what 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1160	2974.15	2981.22	E	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	so uh the big picture is um come up with a set of uh intermediate categories and build intermediate 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1161	2981.22	2984.17	E	Grad	s	+1	1	and build intermediate category classifies and do recognition and 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1162	2984.58	2987.26	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and um improve speech recognition that way um 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1163	2987.64	2995.16	E	Grad	s	+1	1	way um so right now i'm in in a phase where looking at at um deciding uh initial setup intermediate categories and i'm looking 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1164	2995.28	3009.47	E	Grad	s	+1	1	and i'm looking for data data driven methods that can help me find um set of intermediate categories of speech that uh will help me to discriminate 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1165	3010.11	3015.49	E	Grad	s	+1	1	and one of the idea i wasn't too take uh picking on that 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1166	3016.53	3022.55	E	Grad	s^e	+1	1	train train ordinary knowing that to uh learn the poster probably the phones and 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1167	3022.89	3023.76	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	phones and so 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1168	3024.12	3025.92	E	Grad	s	-1	0	um at the end of the day you have the snowman 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1169	3025.92	3027.73	E	Grad	s	-1	0	you have the snowman has hidden hidden units in each of 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1170	3027.73	3031.4	E	Grad	s	-1	0	hidden units in each of these hidden units is um is learning some sort of pattern 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1171	3031.91	3035.04	E	Grad	qh	-1	0	what what are these patterns i don't know um 
Bro028.A.dialogueact1172	3033.78	3034.0	A	PhD	b	-1	0	what what are these patterns 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1173	3035.04	3035.64	E	Grad	s^no	-1	0	i don't know um 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1174	3035.79	3043.31	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i don't know um and i'm going to try to to look at those patterns to to see um from those patterns uh presumably 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1175	3043.62	3048.16	E	Grad	s	-1	0	uh presumably those are important patterns for discriminating between phone classes and maybe 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1176	3048.16	3056.61	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and maybe maybe some uh comedic categories can come from just looking at the patterns of um that the known that earns 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1177	3057.34	3066.58	B	Professor	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	but before again next part in and just plain out it's there's there's a are pretty nice relationship between when you're talking about doing what you're talking about doing their rights so 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1178	3058.8	3058.93	E	Grad	b	-1	0	next part in and 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1179	3066.58	3087.0	B	Professor	s	-1	0	their rights so it seems to me that you know if you take away the the the difference of this primary teachers and to use as we talked about maybe doing used rusted guilty or something for the the primary features um then this feature discovery uh uh thing is just what he's talking about doing too except that he's 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1180	3087.45	3098.54	B	Professor	s	-1	0	except that he's talking about doing them in order to discover intermediate categories that correspond to these uh uh what these some teachers are are are showing 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1181	3099.32	3106.6	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and um the other difference is that um he's doing this in a in a multi band setting 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1182	3107.18	3114.97	B	Professor	s|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	which means that he's can straining himself to look across time in some relatively limited uh uh specter okay right 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1183	3115.76	3119.41	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and where is in in this case using this just do it on constrain 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1184	3120.33	3122.07	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so they're they're really pretty related maybe they'll be at some 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1185	3122.07	3126.34	B	Professor	s	-1	0	maybe they'll be at some point oh cedric the connections little better 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1187	3126.34	3128.49	B	Professor	s	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.C.dialogueact1186	3125.96	3126.39	C	Grad	b	-1	0	the connections little better 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1188	3127.8	3128.61	E	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.E.dialogueact1189	3130.89	3131.3	E	Grad	fg	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.E.dialogueact1190	3132.13	3139.86	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	yeah so so that's the that's the first par uh what one of the idea ideas to get at some some patterns of intermediate categories 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1191	3140.26	3157.21	E	Grad	s	+1	1	um yeah that one was it um too um come up with a a a model um a graphical model that treats the intermediate categories as hidden hidden variables like variables that we don't know anything about but that through 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1192	3157.61	3170.73	E	Grad	s	+1	1	but that through um statistical training and b. m. outgrow them um at the end of the day we have um we have learned something about these these latent um make variables which happen 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1193	3170.74	3174.13	E	Grad	s^e	+1	1	variables which happen to correspond to intermediate category 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1194	3174.67	3181.12	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	yeah and so those are the the two directions um i'm looking into 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1195	3181.84	3185.2	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.E.dialogueact1196	3185.2	3186.56	E	Grad	s^tc	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro028.B.dialogueact1199	3193.03	3195.17	B	Professor	s^e^rt	-1	0	and to get our treats 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1200	3196.62	3197.14	E	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.B.dialogueact1201	3198.36	3201.86	B	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah it's kind of like you know the last with that little thing dropping down and we 
Bro028.A.dialogueact1202	3201.05	3201.34	A	PhD	s^bk.%--	-1	0	dropping down and we 
Bro028.B.dialogueact1203	3201.86	3203.57	B	Professor	s	-1	0	dropping down and we do the digits them me a treats 
Bro028.E.dialogueact1204	3219.1	3219.28	E	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro028.A.dialogueact1205	3420.64	3420.95	A	PhD	s^bk^rt	-1	0	okay
