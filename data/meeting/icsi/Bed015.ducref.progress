The revised semantic specification and construction formalism are more stable than the previous versions.
In the latter , we find both construction types and meaning types along with formal considerations like verb subcategorisation , or the ones a "directed motion" construction would dictate.
Semantic constraints also come into play.
The semantic specification , on the other hand , is split into three levels: "scenario" is a list of schemas and bindings between them , which describes the current event in terms of Source-Path-Goal , Container , etc.; "referent" is about the entities in the discourse and includes grammatical information and pointers to the ontology; "discourse segment" comprises utterance-specific things.
Apart from the presentation , JavaBayes can now run through the modified web page of the project.
