Bed009.B.dialogueact171	621.687	625.117	B	Grad	s	-1	0	not like the ones in munich pretty close to it the major difference 
Bed009.A.dialogueact172	624.77	625.01	A	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	to it the major difference 
Bed009.B.dialogueact173	625.577	630.425	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	the major difference of the munich ones is that we do it's via the telephone 
Bed009.A.dialogueact174	631.263	631.383	A	PhD	b	-1	0	in our all 
Bed009.B.dialogueact175	631.48	633.0	B	Grad	s	-1	0	in our all the recordings down here and 
Bed009.B.dialogueact176	633.753	638.424	B	Grad	s	+1	1	and so it's it's the for computer call system that they should first information deserve to get 
Bed009.A.dialogueact177	637.048	637.218	A	PhD	b	-1	0	that they should first information 
Bed009.B.dialogueact178	638.424	639.484	B	Grad	s	-1	0	deserve to get places 
Bed009.B.dialogueact179	640.2	643.55	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and it breaks halfway through the experiment in human operator comes on 
Bed009.B.dialogueact180	644.681	654.44	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and part of that is sort of tried to find out whether people change their linguistic verbal behavior when first thinking they speak your machine and then search 
Bed009.A.dialogueact181	652.869	653.069	A	PhD	b	-1	0	thinking they speak your machine and then search 
Bed009.B.dialogueact182	655.61	661.01	B	Grad	s	-1	0	we're setting it up so that we can we hope to ban certain intentions and people for example 
Bed009.B.dialogueact183	661.01	670.3	B	Grad	s:qw	-1	0	example um we have first looked at the suppose sentence but how do i get to the part of power 
Bed009.B.dialogueact184	671.24	673.09	B	Grad	s^f	-1	0	oh okay okay so yeah in fact classified work and there is a power 
Bed009.A.dialogueact185	672.386	672.636	A	PhD	b	-1	0	classified work 
Bed009.B.dialogueact186	673.09	675.04	B	Grad	s	-1	0	oh okay and there is a power and that's caught part of or 
Bed009.A.dialogueact187	673.84	674.26	A	PhD	b	-1	0	oh okay and there is a power and that's caught part of or 
Bed009.A.dialogueact188	674.39	674.54	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and that's caught part of or 
Bed009.B.dialogueact189	676.13	681.25	B	Grad	qh	-1	0	and um you parts of that um probably 
Bed009.B.dialogueact190	681.88	683.98	B	Grad	s	-1	0	probably something that we specified and see how that 
Bed009.B.dialogueact192	683.98	690.04	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and see how that is action go tool whatever domain object whatever part of power 
Bed009.D.dialogueact191	683.86	684.29	D	Grad	b	-1	0	and see how that is 
Bed009.B.dialogueact193	691.106	696.706	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and maybe some of those tell us some t. p. s. much oh animal less an area where the person is at the moment 
Bed009.B.dialogueact194	697.87	701.4	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and um they've sort of gone through that once before and the deepening project and we noticed 
Bed009.B.dialogueact195	701.4	704.12	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and we noticed that first or our um initiative 
Bed009.B.dialogueact196	704.12	706.62	B	Grad	s	-1	0	um initiative some sites 
Bed009.B.dialogueact197	707.11	708.93	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	but that are 
Bed009.B.dialogueact198	709.3	711.16	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so here's the power 
Bed009.B.dialogueact199	712.28	714.61	B	Grad	s	-1	0	to go this is the third dimension of representation of it or 
Bed009.B.dialogueact200	715.01	720.59	B	Grad	s	-1	0	in our system that people here to a point where they were facing a wall for that oh there's no entrance 
Bed009.B.dialogueact201	720.59	725.38	B	Grad	s	-1	0	for that oh there's no entrance there it just happens to be the closest point of the wrote that goes to the gym metrics enter 
Bed009.B.dialogueact202	726.804	728.224	B	Grad	s	-1	0	because that's how bad rhythm works 
Bed009.B.dialogueact203	729.69	731.76	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	so i took other part of the world that work as a hack 
Bed009.B.dialogueact204	732.08	733.96	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and then it's hard actually the way to the entrance 
Bed009.B.dialogueact205	735.13	737.1	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	which was not the coast part of work at cantor 
Bed009.A.dialogueact206	737.321	737.481	A	PhD	b	-1	0	cantor 
Bed009.B.dialogueact207	738.0	738.89	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	metric centric 
Bed009.B.dialogueact208	739.36	743.87	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but actually observed how to breakfast that most people when they want to go there they actually do my answer 
Bed009.B.dialogueact209	743.87	745.23	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	do my answer because it's not very interesting they want to go 
Bed009.B.dialogueact210	745.23	749.88	B	Grad	s	-1	0	they want to go it's a completely different but they can look at it and take a picture 
Bed009.A.dialogueact211	750.31	751.12	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and so 
Bed009.D.dialogueact212	750.846	751.526	D	Grad	b	-1	0	and so 
Bed009.A.dialogueact213	751.46	751.61	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and so 
Bed009.B.dialogueact214	751.69	755.74	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and so but uh i he said 
Bed009.B.dialogueact215	756.1	761.54	B	Grad	s	+1	0	let's a simple parts from this from a not turns won't really give us is the person actually she wants 
Bed009.B.dialogueact216	762.87	764.55	B	Grad	qy	-1	0	because i want to go there to see it does she want to go 
Bed009.B.dialogueact217	764.55	765.75	B	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	to see it does she want to go there now nader 
Bed009.B.dialogueact218	765.95	766.41	B	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	there now nader 
Bed009.B.dialogueact219	767.09	768.78	B	Grad	qw	-1	0	how this person want to go there is that 
Bed009.B.dialogueact220	768.78	772.23	B	Grad	qy	-1	0	want to go there is that person more likely to want to walk there walk scenic 
Bed009.B.dialogueact221	772.33	773.51	B	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	walk scenic route negro and some of 
Bed009.B.dialogueact222	773.51	773.93	B	Grad	s	-1	0	route negro and some of 
Bed009.B.dialogueact223	773.93	781.534	B	Grad	s	-1	0	route negro and some of all kinds of decisions that we have identified in terms of getting to places in in terms of finding information about things 
Bed009.B.dialogueact224	782.45	789.65	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and we are constructing and then we've identified more or less the extra linguist parameters that makes their own information 
Bed009.B.dialogueact225	789.95	793.23	B	Grad	s	-1	0	own information related to the u. s. or information relates to the situation 
Bed009.B.dialogueact226	794.13	799.19	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and we also wanted to cozy on the linguistic information what we can get 
Bed009.B.dialogueact227	799.44	800.73	B	Grad	s	-1	0	what we can get from the entrance that's part 
Bed009.B.dialogueact228	800.73	806.42	B	Grad	s	-1	0	from the entrance that's part of why we can't these intentions and the data collection to see whether people actually faced things differently whether 
Bed009.B.dialogueact229	806.42	811.42	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	whether they want to enter in order to buy something or other that just want to go there to look at it 
Bed009.B.dialogueact230	813.21	827.87	B	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	and um so the idea is to construct uh um suitable interfaces and belief that for a macho that actually tries to guess what yeah the lying intention once and 
Bed009.B.dialogueact231	827.97	837.25	B	Grad	s	-1	0	once and then enrich our our command b. m. payout structures without it taught what more sort of got part of that i friends so if 
Bed009.B.dialogueact232	837.791	840.151	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so if it can make a good suggestion hey you know that person 
Bed009.B.dialogueact233	840.501	841.901	B	Grad	s	-1	0	you know that person doesn't want to enter the 
Bed009.B.dialogueact234	841.901	846.161	B	Grad	s	-1	0	doesn't want to enter the person just wants to take a picture because he just bought film or that person wants to 
Bed009.B.dialogueact235	846.161	849.441	B	Grad	s	-1	0	or that person wants to answer because he discussed aid missions he before or 
Bed009.B.dialogueact236	849.911	852.731	B	Grad	s	-1	0	or that person wants to enter because she wants to buy something and that 
Bed009.B.dialogueact237	852.731	855.081	B	Grad	s	-1	0	something and that you usually do inside of buildings and so forth these uh 
Bed009.B.dialogueact238	855.631	867.987	B	Grad	s^rt	+1	0	these uh these times of uh these bits of additional information are going to be embedded into the i'm sorry as structure in and in sort of some feel that we have reserved 
Bed009.B.dialogueact239	868.87	871.91	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and if speed action kind of does something that that's great 
Bed009.B.dialogueact240	872.55	879.23	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	if not you know then that's also something um that we can't really 
Bed009.B.dialogueact241	879.88	885.89	B	Grad	s	-1	0	all for the extra information we don't really or not too worried i mean

Bed009.B.dialogueact248	902.37	906.24	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so that's a function of key that doesn't exist yet to do that dynamic d. but if i

Bed009.F.dialogueact296	999.374	1000.49	F	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	questions the other things that because 
Bed009.F.dialogueact297	1001.03	1007.59	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	we wanted not passover any you know questions or concerns that you 
Bed009.A.dialogueact298	1014.25	1019.73	A	PhD	s	-1	0	whether they're true though so forgiving announcer i guess on both levels i don't have any um for the questions and 
Bed009.D.dialogueact299	1014.59	1014.84	D	Grad	b	-1	0	whether they're true though 
Bed009.D.dialogueact300	1018.83	1019.01	D	Grad	b	-1	0	um for the questions and 
Bed009.A.dialogueact301	1020.0	1025.02	A	PhD	s	-1	0	the the two us will be as far as i'm concerned is uh sending your for the generation more do on the other is is 
Bed009.D.dialogueact302	1020.98	1021.28	D	Grad	b	-1	0	the the two us will be as far as i'm 
Bed009.A.dialogueact303	1025.02	1029.39	A	PhD	s	-1	0	on the other is is my understanding of what smart come uh supposed to be 
Bed009.F.dialogueact304	1028.9	1029.05	F	Professor	b	-1	0	uh supposed to be 
Bed009.A.dialogueact305	1030.26	1031.96	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	uh i think that fits in perfectly so let me 
Bed009.F.dialogueact306	1030.39	1035.66	F	Professor	s	-1	0	uh i think that fits in perfectly so let me let me expand that a little bit from the point of view of the generation so 
Bed009.D.dialogueact307	1031.89	1032.29	D	Grad	b	-1	0	fits in perfectly let me let me 
Bed009.A.dialogueact308	1034.3	1034.44	A	PhD	b	-1	0	from the point of view of the 
Bed009.F.dialogueact309	1036.03	1040.65	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	the idea is that we've actually got this all laid out and and we could show it to you um 
Bed009.F.dialogueact310	1040.9	1049.0	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it to you um or didn't bring it to there's a believe in that which is is the first 
Bed009.F.dialogueact311	1049.59	1054.33	F	Professor	s	-1	0	is the first caught in the belief that that does it just isn't fully um and stand shaded in particular 
Bed009.F.dialogueact312	1054.33	1059.37	F	Professor	s	-1	0	in particular some of that could become a nation rules and ways of getting it the conditional probabilities aren't there but we believe 
Bed009.F.dialogueact313	1059.67	1064.91	F	Professor	s	-1	0	there but we believe that we have laid out the fundamental decisions in this little space 
Bed009.A.dialogueact314	1065.25	1065.65	A	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	and the things 
Bed009.F.dialogueact315	1065.31	1066.9	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and the things that influence them 
Bed009.F.dialogueact316	1067.25	1070.77	F	Professor	s	+1	0	so one of decisions is what we call this t. v. thing do 
Bed009.F.dialogueact317	1070.87	1077.21	F	Professor	qh	-1	0	thing do you want too um access view or enter thing 
Bed009.D.dialogueact318	1077.58	1077.89	D	Grad	b	-1	0	thing 
Bed009.F.dialogueact319	1078.17	1079.48	F	Professor	s	+1	0	so that's a discreet decision are only three 
Bed009.A.dialogueact320	1078.96	1079.36	A	PhD	b	-1	0	so that's a discreet decision are only three 
Bed009.F.dialogueact321	1079.48	1082.29	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	decision are only three possibilities and thee with one would like 
Bed009.F.dialogueact322	1082.29	1093.32	F	Professor	s	-1	0	with one would like is for this uh no all age modeling module to add which of those ideas and give it to the plane 
Bed009.A.dialogueact323	1092.16	1092.48	A	PhD	b	-1	0	to the plane 
Bed009.F.dialogueact324	1095.14	1116.49	F	Professor	s	+1	1	but uh the the current design suggested that yes it seems to be an important decision and if the belief that is acquittal cool so that it doesn't say that one of these is much more probable the other than an option is to go back and ask for the information you will 
Bed009.A.dialogueact325	1114.75	1115.15	A	PhD	b	-1	0	for the information 
Bed009.F.dialogueact326	1117.72	1118.01	F	Professor	qy^d^f	-1	0	no two ways one can 
Bed009.F.dialogueact327	1118.01	1120.78	F	Professor	s	-1	0	two ways one can go imagine doing that 
Bed009.F.dialogueact328	1121.28	1124.26	F	Professor	s	-1	0	for the debunking will probably just have a a drop down menu and the while you're 
Bed009.F.dialogueact329	1124.26	1125.79	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and the while you're debunking you just okay 
Bed009.F.dialogueact330	1125.79	1126.08	F	Professor	b	-1	0	debunking you just okay but for full 
Bed009.F.dialogueact331	1126.62	1132.61	F	Professor	s	-1	0	but for full system than one might very well formulate a query 
Bed009.A.dialogueact333	1133.52	1133.77	A	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	give it to the 
Bed009.F.dialogueact332	1133.45	1137.54	F	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	give it to the dialogue planner and says you know are you are you planning to enter or whatever 
Bed009.F.dialogueact334	1137.54	1140.29	F	Professor	s	-1	0	to enter or whatever it whatever that might be so 
Bed009.F.dialogueact335	1140.87	1143.13	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so that's under that model then 
Bed009.F.dialogueact336	1143.84	1150.42	F	Professor	s	-1	0	then there would be a a um a loop in which this thing would formally query presumably give 
Bed009.A.dialogueact337	1148.81	1149.18	A	PhD	b	-1	0	this thing would formally 
Bed009.F.dialogueact338	1150.42	1151.81	F	Professor	s	-1	0	query presumably give it to you 
Bed009.F.dialogueact339	1152.15	1156.98	F	Professor	s	-1	0	that would get expressed and then hopefully you know you get an answer 
Bed009.A.dialogueact340	1157.33	1157.47	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed009.F.dialogueact341	1158.1	1160.0	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and that would of course the answer would have to be part right 
Bed009.D.dialogueact342	1159.31	1159.73	D	Grad	b	-1	0	would have to be part 
Bed009.D.dialogueact344	1160.94	1161.14	D	Grad	b	-1	0	right okay so 
Bed009.F.dialogueact343	1160.85	1161.03	F	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right okay so 
Bed009.F.dialogueact345	1161.03	1161.12	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	okay so 
Bed009.A.dialogueact347	1161.97	1162.17	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	okay so that that 
Bed009.F.dialogueact346	1161.48	1164.11	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	okay so that that uh we probably won't 
Bed009.F.dialogueact348	1164.11	1171.71	F	Professor	s	+1	2	we probably won't do this early on because the current focus is more on thee decision making and stuff like that 
Bed009.A.dialogueact349	1167.35	1167.44	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	focus is 
Bed009.F.dialogueact350	1172.14	1188.86	F	Professor	s	+1	1	but while we're on the subject or just wanted to give you a heads up it could be that some months from now we said okay we're now ready to try to close that loop in terms of query about some of these decisions 
Bed009.A.dialogueact351	1175.7	1175.88	A	PhD	b	-1	0	heads up 
Bed009.A.dialogueact352	1183.9	1184.1	A	PhD	b	-1	0	in 
Bed009.D.dialogueact353	1184.47	1184.73	D	Grad	b	-1	0	in 
Bed009.A.dialogueact354	1188.04	1188.19	A	PhD	b	-1	0	these decisions 
Bed009.A.dialogueact355	1190.08	1198.8	A	PhD	fg|s	+1	0	so mm my suggestion then is that do you um look into the currently ongoing discussion about holy action plans are suppose to look like 
Bed009.A.dialogueact356	1199.47	1212.08	A	PhD	s	+1	1	and they're currently um agreeing are in the process of agreeing on an x. amount of education off um something like a state transition network of hollowed i would proceed and 
Bed009.A.dialogueact357	1212.41	1219.39	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and the these um transition networks uh we'll be what the action plan other neck into in a sense mm 
Bed009.F.dialogueact358	1219.71	1219.95	F	Professor	b	-1	0	mm 
Bed009.F.dialogueact359	1220.21	1221.18	F	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	i mean you're did you know the summer 
Bed009.B.dialogueact360	1221.78	1222.66	B	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	i mean you're just doing that right 
Bed009.B.dialogueact361	1222.66	1222.82	B	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	just doing that right 
Bed009.A.dialogueact362	1223.81	1226.78	A	PhD	s^aap	-1	0	well the marcos look coast is actually implementing that stuff 
Bed009.A.dialogueact363	1227.03	1231.69	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and marcus in mission together or leading the discussion there 
Bed009.A.dialogueact365	1231.86	1231.99	A	PhD	b	-1	0	there 
Bed009.B.dialogueact364	1231.78	1232.12	B	Grad	s^bk^rt	-1	0	there so we we have 
Bed009.F.dialogueact366	1232.4	1233.77	F	Professor	s	+1	0	so we we have to get in on 
Bed009.A.dialogueact368	1234.38	1234.62	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yep because 
Bed009.B.dialogueact367	1234.14	1234.3	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yep because 
Bed009.D.dialogueact370	1234.96	1235.25	D	Grad	b	-1	0	yep because um 
Bed009.F.dialogueact369	1234.63	1239.79	F	Professor	s	-1	0	yep because um partly those are like x. games 
Bed009.A.dialogueact371	1236.27	1236.56	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed009.F.dialogueact372	1240.55	1241.74	F	Professor	s	-1	0	they transitioned diagrams 
Bed009.B.dialogueact373	1242.04	1242.47	B	Grad	b	-1	0	and it may be that 
Bed009.F.dialogueact374	1242.21	1250.19	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and it may be that that um we should early on make sure that they uh the flexibility that we need 
Bed009.B.dialogueact375	1250.34	1250.71	B	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed009.B.dialogueact376	1251.84	1252.99	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	but they 
Bed009.B.dialogueact377	1253.56	1254.51	B	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	have understood this that they they govern 
Bed009.B.dialogueact378	1254.51	1259.14	B	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	this that they they govern more or less the the dial up behavior or the action it's not 
Bed009.A.dialogueact379	1258.93	1259.25	A	PhD	s^aa^rt	-1	0	or the action it's not 
Bed009.B.dialogueact380	1259.67	1263.49	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	it's not really what you do to the content of the dies talk but it's 
Bed009.B.dialogueact381	1266.89	1269.15	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	so in this this this this nice it's it no it's it's also clients and uh 
Bed009.D.dialogueact382	1267.46	1268.23	D	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	this this this this nice it's no it's it's also 
Bed009.D.dialogueact383	1268.23	1270.55	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	this nice it's it is it no it's it's also clients and uh so there's 
Bed009.B.dialogueact384	1269.37	1270.77	B	Grad	qy^bu.%--	-1	0	it is it clients and uh so there's 
Bed009.F.dialogueact385	1270.84	1276.34	F	Professor	s	-1	0	is it so there's that act so it the word action okay is is what's ambiguous here so 
Bed009.D.dialogueact386	1272.78	1273.38	D	Grad	s^am	-1	0	the word action okay 
Bed009.D.dialogueact387	1275.2	1275.53	D	Grad	b	-1	0	ambiguous 
Bed009.A.dialogueact388	1276.54	1276.84	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	here so 
Bed009.F.dialogueact389	1276.69	1283.92	F	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	here so um one thing is there's an actual or that tells the person in first i mean now 
Bed009.A.dialogueact391	1284.52	1284.78	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay per tells a person i'd go 
Bed009.F.dialogueact390	1284.1	1285.16	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	okay per tells a person i'd go first go here first 
Bed009.F.dialogueact392	1285.16	1285.79	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	first go here first 
Bed009.D.dialogueact394	1286.17	1286.57	D	Grad	b	-1	0	go there 
Bed009.F.dialogueact393	1285.79	1286.58	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	first go here first go there 
Bed009.F.dialogueact395	1287.18	1288.39	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	uh you know take a bus whatever it is 
Bed009.F.dialogueact396	1288.39	1289.11	F	Professor	s	-1	0	a bus whatever it is so that's 
Bed009.F.dialogueact397	1289.73	1297.24	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so that's that's a form of planning and action and then the route planner and gee i guess all sort of stuff uh 
Bed009.F.dialogueact398	1297.94	1300.97	F	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	no uh but i think that what mean 
Bed009.A.dialogueact399	1301.12	1301.4	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	no in smart 
Bed009.A.dialogueact400	1301.46	1307.68	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	no in smart come terminology that this um called a function that's modeled by function modular 
Bed009.A.dialogueact401	1308.56	1312.96	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and it's that that's completely um calculated from uh the the dialect system 
Bed009.A.dialogueact402	1313.57	1316.57	A	PhD	s	-1	0	that simply affection allergy that you give stayed eyes in a career e. and then you get 
Bed009.A.dialogueact403	1316.57	1323.17	A	PhD	s	-1	0	e. and then you get back from that well functioning model um which might be a platter or a v. c. r. or whatever um some 
Bed009.A.dialogueact404	1323.48	1326.2	A	PhD	s	-1	0	um some results and that's then then you well okay so that's 
Bed009.F.dialogueact405	1324.74	1325.95	F	Professor	fg|s^bk	-1	0	results and that's then then you well okay so 
Bed009.F.dialogueact406	1325.94	1327.61	F	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	then then you okay so that's what i thought so action 
Bed009.F.dialogueact407	1327.62	1331.94	F	Professor	s^bu	+1	0	yeah yeah yeah in that in that sense what i thought so action he action here means die a speech a you know dialogue back 
Bed009.A.dialogueact408	1328.27	1328.75	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah yeah he action here 
Bed009.A.dialogueact410	1330.9	1332.18	A	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah in that in that sense yeah like a you know dialogue back yeah 
Bed009.B.dialogueact409	1330.73	1331.12	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah in that in that sense a you know dialogue back 
Bed009.A.dialogueact411	1332.18	1332.33	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah like yeah 
Bed009.A.dialogueact413	1332.45	1333.07	A	PhD	s^m	-1	0	yeah like yeah um 
Bed009.F.dialogueact412	1332.2	1332.4	F	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah like yeah 
Bed009.A.dialogueact414	1333.07	1333.13	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	um 
Bed009.F.dialogueact415	1333.62	1339.8	F	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um i think i think it's not going too i think it's not going to be good i i 
Bed009.F.dialogueact416	1339.8	1341.98	F	Professor	s	-1	0	good i i i know what what i meant by that 
Bed009.F.dialogueact417	1342.22	1351.61	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so i think the idea of having a you know transition diagram for the grammar of conversations is a good idea 
Bed009.A.dialogueact418	1350.75	1351.02	A	PhD	b	-1	0	is a good idea 
Bed009.F.dialogueact419	1352.26	1352.49	F	Professor	s^f	-1	0	okay and i think that 
Bed009.F.dialogueact420	1352.49	1355.33	F	Professor	s	-1	0	okay and i think that we do have definitely have to get in on it and uh 
Bed009.F.dialogueact421	1356.08	1360.39	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but i think that um 
Bed009.F.dialogueact422	1361.66	1368.23	F	Professor	s	+1	0	when so when we get to the poorest to me it's not just an information retrieval system right so 
Bed009.A.dialogueact423	1365.37	1365.64	A	PhD	b	-1	0	it's 
Bed009.A.dialogueact425	1368.77	1369.13	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right so this is this is where 
Bed009.A.dialogueact427	1369.13	1369.49	A	PhD	b	-1	0	this is this is where 
Bed009.F.dialogueact424	1368.64	1368.96	F	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right so 
Bed009.F.dialogueact426	1368.96	1371.14	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	right so this is this is where i think if people are going to have to think 
Bed009.F.dialogueact428	1371.14	1373.33	F	Professor	s	+1	0	people are going to have to think this a bit more carefully so 
Bed009.A.dialogueact429	1373.53	1373.7	A	PhD	b	-1	0	so 
Bed009.F.dialogueact430	1373.87	1378.69	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so if it's only like in in the in the film and t. v. saying 
Bed009.F.dialogueact431	1379.15	1380.09	F	Professor	s	-1	0	okay you can do this and you just get information 
Bed009.F.dialogueact432	1380.09	1381.85	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and you just get information and give it to people 
Bed009.F.dialogueact433	1382.62	1388.66	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	lot what happens when you actually get them moving and so forth and so on 
Bed009.A.dialogueact434	1387.61	1387.77	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and so

Bed009.B.dialogueact462	1463.18	1465.61	B	Grad	fg|s.%--	-1	0	and that and then it might actually okay i 
Bed009.B.dialogueact464	1465.61	1466.0	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	might actually okay i uh also because 
Bed009.B.dialogueact465	1466.07	1473.31	B	Grad	s	-1	0	uh also because um work again read it deep not to have faced in implemented those problems once already maybe we can even

Bed009.B.dialogueact474	1488.61	1490.4	B	Grad	s	-1	0	is what to do anyway so how 
Bed009.B.dialogueact475	1490.64	1499.35	B	Grad	qw.%--	-1	0	anyway so how far is the uh the the m. three out of specification for for the that that's language inputs gone and they the uh i haven't 
Bed009.B.dialogueact476	1499.6	1505.08	B	Grad	s	-1	0	uh i haven't seen anything or the uh tourists pass them and yeah it's it's not just find jan 
Bed009.D.dialogueact477	1504.16	1505.74	D	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	them and yeah it's it's not just find jan 
Bed009.B.dialogueact478	1507.45	1509.66	B	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	and um europe probably also involved boston that's right 
Bed009.D.dialogueact479	1508.18	1510.01	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	probably also involved boston that's right and together 
Bed009.B.dialogueact480	1509.66	1509.95	B	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	boston that's right 
Bed009.B.dialogueact481	1510.84	1512.67	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and together with her usual thing um it's uhhuh 
Bed009.B.dialogueact482	1512.67	1514.85	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	thing um it's uh and it's john uhhuh 
Bed009.D.dialogueact483	1513.03	1513.33	D	Grad	x	-1	0	uh and it's 
Bed009.D.dialogueact484	1515.19	1519.59	D	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah that's the me teen next week i think 
Bed009.B.dialogueact485	1522.17	1525.51	B	Grad	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	that's those i i think that 
Bed009.B.dialogueact486	1525.51	1532.11	B	Grad	qo	+1	1	i i think that the two key issue is is how dusty whatever comes other language and put pipeline look like and then what the action 
Bed009.B.dialogueact487	1532.11	1534.85	B	Grad	qo	+1	1	and then what the action center does with it 
Bed009.B.dialogueact488	1536.01	1537.97	B	Grad	qo	+1	0	how that this specified 
Bed009.B.dialogueact489	1538.59	1547.52	B	Grad	s	-1	0	i didn't think of speak internal workings of the the action center and the language at the function mother has sort of relevant 
Bed009.B.dialogueact490	1548.2	1553.5	B	Grad	s	-1	0	because what what they take a sort of this this fixed representation over over and intention 
Bed009.A.dialogueact492	1554.59	1554.94	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and that 
Bed009.B.dialogueact491	1554.56	1557.93	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and that can be asti or as crude as you want it to be 
Bed009.B.dialogueact493	1558.83	1561.95	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	but um the internal workings of of the uh whether 
Bed009.B.dialogueact494	1561.95	1567.78	B	Grad	s	-1	0	of the uh whether you know they're dial up actually understood what these cats are actual tennis at work but in a state uh time and 
Bed009.B.dialogueact495	1568.42	1570.38	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so that shouldn't really matter too much i mean it 
Bed009.B.dialogueact496	1570.73	1571.66	B	Grad	s	-1	0	i mean it does matter because it 
Bed009.B.dialogueact497	1571.66	1573.24	B	Grad	s^df.%--	-1	0	does matter because it does have to keep track of who brown partake 
Bed009.B.dialogueact498	1573.24	1577.74	B	Grad	s	-1	0	who brown partake suffer a route that consists of aids steps and so forth yeah they're they're there's 
Bed009.A.dialogueact500	1577.44	1577.71	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and so forth yeah they're they're there's 
Bed009.F.dialogueact499	1577.25	1580.27	F	Professor	fg|s^aa	-1	0	and so forth yeah they're they're there's i think there are a lot of reasons why it matters okay 
Bed009.F.dialogueact501	1580.38	1580.78	F	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	okay 
Bed009.F.dialogueact502	1581.06	1581.92	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so that 
Bed009.F.dialogueact503	1583.05	1583.8	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh for 
Bed009.F.dialogueact504	1583.89	1594.03	F	Professor	s	-1	0	uh for example it's the action planner is going to take some spec and make some suggestions about what the users should do 
Bed009.F.dialogueact505	1595.41	1605.01	F	Professor	s	-1	0	what the users this after that is going to be very much caught up with what the actually plantar told it if the if the parts 
Bed009.A.dialogueact506	1602.51	1602.88	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	what 
Bed009.F.dialogueact507	1605.01	1611.01	F	Professor	s^rt.%--	-1	0	if the if the parts are and the language and doesn't know what the person's been told okay 
Bed009.F.dialogueact508	1611.97	1612.28	F	Professor	s^f^rt	-1	0	okay it's you're making 
Bed009.F.dialogueact509	1612.28	1615.01	F	Professor	s	-1	0	it's you're making your life much more difficult than it has to be right 
Bed009.B.dialogueact510	1614.2	1614.38	B	Grad	b	-1	0	than it has to be 
Bed009.F.dialogueact511	1615.96	1616.24	F	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right so if 
Bed009.F.dialogueact512	1616.44	1621.12	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so if someone says the best way to to uh go there is by taxi let's say 
Bed009.F.dialogueact513	1621.77	1622.19	F	Professor	s	-1	0	let's say that the plantar comes 
Bed009.F.dialogueact514	1622.32	1624.56	F	Professor	s	-1	0	that the plantar comes out and says you want to get there fast take a taxi 
Bed009.F.dialogueact515	1624.7	1625.43	F	Professor	s	-1	0	fast take a taxi

Bed009.F.dialogueact517	1626.8	1629.94	F	Professor	s	-1	0	okay and the language and doesn't know that 
Bed009.F.dialogueact518	1631.54	1635.67	F	Professor	s	-1	0	uh there's all sorts of dialogues that won't make any sense which would be just fine 
Bed009.A.dialogueact519	1634.22	1634.42	A	PhD	fg.%	-1	0	which would be just 
Bed009.B.dialogueact521	1636.8	1637.13	B	Grad	b	-1	0	no but that i uh 
Bed009.F.dialogueact520	1636.74	1637.67	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	no but that i uh

Bed009.A.dialogueact523	1637.57	1640.88	A	PhD	s	-1	0	no but that i think that that's the point has been realized and 
Bed009.A.dialogueact524	1640.88	1644.12	A	PhD	s	-1	0	realized and it's it's not really um been defined get but there's going to be 
Bed009.A.dialogueact525	1644.12	1654.94	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but there's going to be some kind of feedback and input from um the action platter into all the analysis more deals telling them what to expect and what the current state also the discourse is beyond 
Bed009.D.dialogueact526	1651.3	1651.57	D	Grad	b	-1	0	them what to expect 
Bed009.A.dialogueact527	1655.04	1658.69	A	PhD	s	-1	0	what's currently being implemented which is just worthless yeah 
Bed009.F.dialogueact528	1658.72	1661.55	F	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	off special interest yeah this is not this this is not just a state of the discourse this is actually 
Bed009.B.dialogueact529	1659.25	1659.64	B	Grad	b	-1	0	this is not this this is

Bed009.A.dialogueact578	1776.84	1780.0	A	PhD	s	-1	0	off the project and all because somebody actually do these it ought to be action plan us if there is resistance 
Bed009.A.dialogueact579	1780.0	1784.7	A	PhD	s	-1	0	if there is resistance against changing it that's just because we don't want to change it that

Bed009.F.dialogueact583	1789.16	1800.25	F	Professor	s	+1	0	if if that in persist them are going to need another term for the thing that actually does the planning of the uh ralph's and whatever we're doing for the tourist 
Bed009.B.dialogueact584	1801.61	1803.51	B	Grad	s	-1	0	that's it's external services oh

Bed009.F.dialogueact586	1806.48	1808.8	F	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	that it has all the wrong connotations 
Bed009.F.dialogueact587	1809.09	1811.11	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	it's it sounds like it's you know standalone it doesn't 
Bed009.F.dialogueact588	1811.11	1812.06	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	it doesn't it doesn't 
Bed009.F.dialogueact589	1812.06	1812.49	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it doesn't 
Bed009.F.dialogueact590	1815.37	1815.79	F	Professor	s	-1	0	that's something i think 
Bed009.F.dialogueact591	1815.79	1816.45	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	that's something i think you can't it's 
Bed009.F.dialogueact592	1816.88	1820.75	F	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	you can't it's fine for looking up when t. when when the shows on t. v. you go to 
Bed009.F.dialogueact593	1820.75	1821.11	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	on t. v. you go to but 
Bed009.F.dialogueact594	1821.93	1829.49	F	Professor	s	-1	0	but i i i i is really really wrong headed for something that you a lot of state it's going to interact 
Bed009.F.dialogueact595	1829.49	1833.77	F	Professor	s	-1	0	of state it's going to interact caulking uncomplicated way with the uh understanding parts 
Bed009.B.dialogueact596	1831.56	1831.86	B	Grad	b	-1	0	way with the 
Bed009.B.dialogueact597	1834.9	1838.06	B	Grad	fg|s	+1	1	uh i think just the the specialty center and the route tattered i showed do once 
Bed009.B.dialogueact598	1838.35	1842.43	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	i showed do once the attack in between them among them in the deep man systems so 
Bed009.F.dialogueact599	1841.15	1841.29	F	Professor	b	-1	0	them in the deep man systems 
Bed009.B.dialogueact600	1842.43	1845.77	B	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	so the printout of the communication between those two fills up 
Bed009.B.dialogueact601	1846.16	1847.16	B	Grad	s^no	+1	1	and the whole many pages and that's just 
Bed009.A.dialogueact603	1847.64	1847.84	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and that's just 
Bed009.B.dialogueact602	1847.16	1850.32	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and that's just part of how do i get to one places 
Bed009.B.dialogueact604	1850.32	1852.58	B	Grad	s	-1	0	insane and uh 
Bed009.B.dialogueact605	1852.58	1853.29	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	insane and uh 
Bed009.B.dialogueact606	1855.15	1861.24	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but um so this is um definitely a good point to get uh because into the discussion or to enter

Bed009.A.dialogueact621	1890.24	1891.15	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	so yes was just 
Bed009.B.dialogueact622	1891.55	1893.07	B	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	yes was just foodline expression whatever we're going to stick

Bed009.B.dialogueact624	1893.07	1895.18	B	Grad	s	+1	0	no it's whatever we're going to stick to our local or not 
Bed009.A.dialogueact625	1895.23	1895.5	A	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	no it's 
Bed009.A.dialogueact626	1895.61	1897.04	A	PhD	s^ar^m|s	+1	1	no it's going to be fixed out

Bed009.B.dialogueact629	1900.85	1905.96	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but i do think that the function in concept has a certain makes sense in the in the system died because 
Bed009.A.dialogueact630	1904.7	1904.88	A	PhD	b	-1	0	makes sense in 
Bed009.B.dialogueact631	1906.02	1919.63	B	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah action kind of should not be hard to die luck manage in that case that um we have to worry about whether it's interfacing is uh something that does start planning and it's clear that way that it's i totally agree sure 
Bed009.A.dialogueact632	1917.27	1917.6	A	PhD	b	-1	0	something that does start 
Bed009.F.dialogueact633	1918.34	1919.2	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	planning and it's clear that way that it's i totally agree sure

Bed009.F.dialogueact634	1919.2	1919.49	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	that way that it's sure 
Bed009.B.dialogueact636	1919.98	1920.83	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	that way that it's sure yeah i i i agree there 
Bed009.F.dialogueact637	1920.04	1920.92	F	Professor	s^r	-1	0	yeah i i i agree there 
Bed009.F.dialogueact638	1920.91	1924.43	F	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah i i i agree there is there's a logic to dialogue which which is use 
Bed009.F.dialogueact639	1925.26	1925.46	F	Professor	%-	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed009.F.dialogueact640	1926.05	1926.12	F	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed009.B.dialogueact641	1926.61	1935.08	B	Grad	s	-1	0	sort of phony they'd it's what it's once and i rather i abstracts uh wait you 
Bed009.B.dialogueact642	1935.08	1937.71	B	Grad	s	-1	0	you find me a good route for this 
Bed009.F.dialogueact643	1935.51	1935.7	F	Professor	b	-1	0	you 
Bed009.B.dialogueact644	1938.11	1942.82	B	Grad	s	-1	0	it doesn't really have to worry about how center monterey or rock kind or be actually once it's 
Bed009.B.dialogueact645	1943.84	1947.55	B	Grad	s	-1	0	seems like a great idea 
Bed009.B.dialogueact646	1949.57	1950.13	B	Grad	s	-1	0	it's tricky 
Bed009.F.dialogueact647	1950.07	1950.69	F	Professor	s	-1	0	it's tricky 
Bed009.F.dialogueact648	1951.23	1953.54	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it's tricky because one could well imagine i think it will 
Bed009.F.dialogueact649	1953.54	1965.11	F	Professor	s	-1	0	imagine i think it will turn out to be the case that um this thing we're talking about the the extended uh knowledge muffler will fill in some parameters about what the person once one could well imagine 
Bed009.F.dialogueact650	1965.11	1975.91	F	Professor	s	-1	0	one could well imagine that the next thing that trying to fill out the detailed uh route planning let's say well also have questions that they would like to ask the user 
Bed009.F.dialogueact651	1976.67	1981.98	F	Professor	s	-1	0	you can well imagine you get to a point where it's got a a choice to make and it just doesn't know something 
Bed009.A.dialogueact653	1983.43	1983.8	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bed009.F.dialogueact652	1983.28	1990.94	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and so you would like it to also be able to uh formulate a query 
Bed009.F.dialogueact654	1992.41	2000.19	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and to run that back through uh the dialogue manager and to the output module and back around and 
Bed009.B.dialogueact655	2000.46	2001.06	B	Grad	b	-1	0	and i a a good design 
Bed009.F.dialogueact656	2001.01	2004.61	F	Professor	s	-1	0	i a a good design what would allow that to happen 
Bed009.B.dialogueact657	2003.22	2003.83	B	Grad	s^2.%--	-1	0	allow that to 
Bed009.B.dialogueact658	2003.83	2003.9	B	Grad	b	-1	0	allow that to 
Bed009.D.dialogueact659	2004.19	2004.43	D	Grad	b	-1	0	happen 
Bed009.F.dialogueact660	2005.39	2008.26	F	Professor	s	-1	0	but that doesn't necessarily contradict if if you know if if you can't make it have it if you do 
Bed009.A.dialogueact661	2006.78	2007.12	A	PhD	s^aap^rt	-1	0	but if you can't make it have it if you do 
Bed009.A.dialogueact662	2007.92	2013.87	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but that doesn't necessarily contradict um in architecture where there really is a person adhesive well defined interface it have it if you do i 
Bed009.A.dialogueact664	2014.39	2014.98	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	and and totally agree but 
Bed009.F.dialogueact663	2013.97	2014.52	F	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	interface and and i totally agree but 
Bed009.F.dialogueact665	2014.8	2015.79	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and and totally agree but but what i need but 
Bed009.F.dialogueact666	2015.94	2017.05	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but what i need but what the point is that in that case the 
Bed009.F.dialogueact667	2017.33	2020.57	F	Professor	s	-1	0	that in that case the dialogue manager you sort of event driven so the dialogue 
Bed009.F.dialogueact668	2020.69	2025.14	F	Professor	s	+1	0	driven so the dialogue manager may think it's you know dialogue state of one sort and 
Bed009.A.dialogueact670	2025.56	2026.02	A	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	and this one planning 
Bed009.F.dialogueact669	2025.35	2030.61	F	Professor	s:s	+1	2	and this one planning much of comes along and says hey right now we need to ask questions 
Bed009.F.dialogueact671	2031.08	2033.62	F	Professor	s	+1	1	so that forces the dialogue manager to change state 
Bed009.A.dialogueact672	2034.5	2034.89	A	PhD	s^bk^rt	-1	0	okay 
Bed009.F.dialogueact673	2035.02	2035.32	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	sure it could be 
Bed009.A.dialogueact675	2035.96	2036.16	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	sure yeah i think it could be yeah yeah it it 
Bed009.F.dialogueact674	2035.58	2036.05	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	sure yeah i think it could be yeah yeah it it 
Bed009.A.dialogueact676	2036.16	2039.15	A	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	yeah i think that's that's the um concept that people have yeah yeah it it 
Bed009.F.dialogueact677	2036.48	2037.14	F	Professor	fg|%-	-1	0	yeah i think that's that's the um yeah yeah it it 
Bed009.A.dialogueact679	2039.15	2039.3	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed009.F.dialogueact678	2038.96	2039.23	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	concept that people have 
Bed009.A.dialogueact680	2045.65	2058.64	A	PhD	s	+1	1	and then the thee underlying idea of course is that there is something like kernel modules of the kernel functional it that you can pluck a certain applications like a tourist information or um the whole scenario with uh controlling a v. c. r. and so on 
Bed009.A.dialogueact681	2060.61	2063.83	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and then extended to return number of publications eventually 
Bed009.A.dialogueact682	2065.03	2065.8	A	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	wouldn't wouldn't that's 
Bed009.A.dialogueact683	2065.88	2069.32	A	PhD	s	+1	1	wouldn't wouldn't that's an additional reason to have this well defined interface and keep these 
Bed009.A.dialogueact685	2069.32	2072.72	A	PhD	s	+1	1	and keep these things like a tourist information external 
Bed009.F.dialogueact684	2069.25	2069.6	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	and keep these 
Bed009.A.dialogueact686	2073.39	2075.27	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and then called the external services 
Bed009.B.dialogueact687	2074.95	2075.46	B	Grad	b	-1	0	the external services 
Bed009.A.dialogueact688	2079.59	2081.12	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	but of course the the more complex yeah yeah there's another philosophical 
Bed009.B.dialogueact689	2080.09	2086.14	B	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	the the more complex yeah yeah there's another philosophical issue that i think you know you can base but it 
Bed009.A.dialogueact690	2081.3	2081.53	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah philosophical 
Bed009.B.dialogueact691	2086.25	2094.83	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but it did did you make sense to me that sooner or later the service is going to come and describe itself to you 
Bed009.B.dialogueact692	2094.83	2105.05	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	to you that's what's reading is working on and and and abdominal uh project where um you you find a g. i. s. about that gives you information birthday and it's it's going to 
Bed009.A.dialogueact693	2097.25	2097.42	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and and abdominal 
Bed009.B.dialogueact694	2105.05	2109.24	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and it's it's going to be there and tell you what it can do and how it wants to do things and so 
Bed009.B.dialogueact695	2109.86	2113.85	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and so you can actually interface to such a system without ever having met it before 
Bed009.B.dialogueact696	2114.1	2120.98	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and the function monitor and the stuff description of the um x. in the service tag adults 
Bed009.A.dialogueact697	2114.64	2115.17	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and the function monitor and the

Bed009.B.dialogueact703	2132.99	2138.07	B	Grad	s	-1	0	took in at the moment but so they are getting into the realm of the contingent 
Bed009.A.dialogueact704	2138.28	2138.47	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed009.B.dialogueact705	2144.14	2150.29	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	but we are facing of course much more really sick problems 
Bed009.B.dialogueact706	2151.32	2158.39	B	Grad	s^rt	+1	0	and language and put or the percentages of course crucial it off when you're doing the sort of understanding analysis that we envision 
Bed009.B.dialogueact707	2159.21	2162.97	B	Grad	fh|s.%--	-1	0	then of course the uh 
Bed009.B.dialogueact708	2163.72	2164.1	B	Grad	qo	-1	0	what is it over of this through 
Bed009.B.dialogueact709	2164.21	2165.32	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	over of this through this it them but 
Bed009.B.dialogueact710	2165.32	2167.7	B	Grad	s	-1	0	this it them but the last weekend of that the better

Bed009.D.dialogueact717	2182.64	2185.09	D	Grad	s	-1	0	but in the next two days there was this um 
Bed009.B.dialogueact718	2185.53	2185.75	B	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed009.D.dialogueact720	2186.35	2186.83	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and this and 
Bed009.F.dialogueact719	2186.2	2186.69	F	Professor	qw.%--	-1	0	and this and 
Bed009.D.dialogueact721	2186.83	2187.78	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and this and it's um 
Bed009.D.dialogueact722	2187.78	2189.27	D	Grad	fg	-1	0	it's um i kind of access 
Bed009.D.dialogueact723	2189.27	2191.02	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i kind of access 
Bed009.F.dialogueact724	2191.47	2196.89	F	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	so uh yeah we we look at the current pattern matching thing 
Bed009.D.dialogueact725	2196.62	2196.89	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	thing 
Bed009.F.dialogueact726	2197.57	2200.39	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and as you say it's just a surface pattern match or uh 
Bed009.F.dialogueact727	2200.84	2202.88	F	Professor	qw	+1	0	match or uh so what are what are the plans roughly 
Bed009.D.dialogueact728	2203.7	2207.74	D	Grad	h|s^rt	+1	1	um it's two change a graduate and some tactic doses 
Bed009.D.dialogueact729	2208.71	2213.64	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and um that some more features slack segment patients 
Bed009.D.dialogueact730	2214.39	2223.13	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	so then um after him more than one after themselves the um the facade on a pasta is um 
Bed009.D.dialogueact731	2223.89	2226.37	D	Grad	s	-1	0	um assessment temptation koreans 
Bed009.D.dialogueact733	2229.34	2229.66	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	so the 
Bed009.F.dialogueact732	2229.07	2231.0	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	so the um 
Bed009.F.dialogueact734	2232.19	2238.05	F	Professor	s^bu.%--	-1	0	so the idea is to um to have a @reject@ your particular do a particular 
Bed009.D.dialogueact735	2233.27	2233.53	D	Grad	b	-1	0	to 
Bed009.F.dialogueact736	2238.05	2240.24	F	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	do a particular parse or in mind is it 
Bed009.F.dialogueact737	2240.24	2242.82	F	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	is it uh but i mean if 
Bed009.F.dialogueact738	2242.82	2244.15	F	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	but i mean if you thought through 
Bed009.F.dialogueact739	2245.23	2247.17	F	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	is it an h. b. o. c. parse or is it uh whatever 
Bed009.F.dialogueact740	2247.17	2248.23	F	Professor	qrr^rt	-1	0	no no is it uh whatever 
Bed009.D.dialogueact741	2248.75	2251.99	D	Grad	s^ar|s.%--	-1	0	no no it's uh i think it's too complicated for 
Bed009.D.dialogueact742	2252.53	2253.88	D	Grad	s	-1	0	that's just one month rossman okay 
Bed009.F.dialogueact743	2252.67	2252.99	F	Professor	fg	-1	0	that's just one okay 
Bed009.D.dialogueact744	2253.88	2256.28	D	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	month rossman some i have to keep it oh you have to do it you have to do it 
Bed009.F.dialogueact745	2255.65	2256.36	F	Professor	s^bk|s^bu	-1	0	to keep it oh you have to do it you have to do it 
Bed009.F.dialogueact746	2256.48	2257.0	F	Professor	s^bk^r	-1	0	it yeah uh do it you have to do it yeah

Bed009.D.dialogueact749	2257.94	2260.63	D	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah uh so thinks must be something yeah 
Bed009.F.dialogueact750	2261.27	2261.7	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	i see so 
Bed009.D.dialogueact752	2262.11	2266.57	D	Grad	s	-1	0	but um yeah this tactic us this this um finite state chancey was the people at d. f. yeah people 
Bed009.F.dialogueact751	2261.7	2261.98	F	Professor	%-	-1	0	i see so 
Bed009.F.dialogueact753	2264.16	2265.63	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	this um finite state chancey the people at d. f. 
Bed009.F.dialogueact754	2266.23	2266.52	F	Professor	fg	-1	0	was yeah people 
Bed009.F.dialogueact755	2267.01	2269.55	F	Professor	s	+1	0	would be okay i've written a fair number of parse yours 
Bed009.F.dialogueact756	2270.79	2275.56	F	Professor	s	-1	0	other people people over the years uh have written various person should be of i none of them 
Bed009.F.dialogueact757	2275.56	2277.44	F	Professor	qy^d^rt	+1	0	be of i none of them are suitable i i

Bed009.D.dialogueact760	2279.33	2282.81	D	Grad	s^bk|s	+1	1	yeah uh the problem is that it has to be five fast because 
Bed009.D.dialogueact761	2282.81	2287.46	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	five fast because um feel one tool for more than one possum uh okay 
Bed009.F.dialogueact762	2284.74	2285.01	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	one tool for okay 
Bed009.D.dialogueact763	2288.36	2291.43	D	Grad	qo	-1	0	that's in there that says some speech recognizes so it's 
Bed009.F.dialogueact764	2289.74	2290.08	F	Professor	b	-1	0	says some speech recognizes 
Bed009.D.dialogueact765	2291.43	2293.63	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so it's space close um 
Bed009.D.dialogueact766	2293.63	2293.88	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	close um 
Bed009.D.dialogueact767	2295.94	2297.68	D	Grad	s	-1	0	in town not trusting him

Bed009.D.dialogueact769	2300.5	2306.11	D	Grad	s	+1	1	and i also have to be very robust cos off um speech recognition house and okay 
Bed009.D.dialogueact770	2306.12	2306.38	D	Grad	%--	-1	0	and okay 
Bed009.F.dialogueact771	2306.42	2306.8	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	and okay 
Bed009.F.dialogueact772	2307.22	2317.37	F	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	so um so there was a chunk harsher and for immobile there was one of the branches noted like 
Bed009.F.dialogueact773	2317.37	2318.21	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	noted like there were these various 
Bed009.F.dialogueact774	2318.21	2324.81	F	Professor	s	-1	0	there were these various uh competing uh syntax modules 
Bed009.F.dialogueact775	2325.73	2328.09	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and i know one of them was a chunk parts are and i don't remember 
Bed009.F.dialogueact776	2328.09	2330.18	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and i don't remember who did that 
Bed009.B.dialogueact778	2331.47	2332.34	B	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	i think it's it's 
Bed009.D.dialogueact777	2331.08	2332.75	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i think it's it's

Bed009.A.dialogueact783	2341.41	2344.83	A	PhD	s	-1	0	tubing was at least involved in putting the chunks together 
Bed009.D.dialogueact784	2341.86	2342.8	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	tubing was at least involved 
Bed009.A.dialogueact785	2345.21	2350.47	A	PhD	s	-1	0	con court recall whether they actually produce the chunks in the first place 
Bed009.D.dialogueact786	2350.56	2350.9	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	place 
Bed009.F.dialogueact787	2350.93	2351.54	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	place i said yeah that's right

Bed009.F.dialogueact795	2359.72	2364.06	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and then there was a kind of trying to fit them together that used more context right 
Bed009.A.dialogueact796	2362.03	2362.32	A	PhD	b	-1	0	that used 
Bed009.A.dialogueact797	2363.05	2363.32	A	PhD	b	-1	0	more context 
Bed009.F.dialogueact798	2364.27	2364.48	F	Professor	b	-1	0	right 
Bed009.A.dialogueact799	2365.9	2368.69	A	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	well used and and especially you did some some 
Bed009.A.dialogueact800	2369.25	2371.04	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	um little was a learning 
Bed009.A.dialogueact801	2371.78	2375.3	A	PhD	s	-1	0	was a learning based approach which learned from a big corpus off of trees and yes right right 
Bed009.D.dialogueact803	2374.8	2375.18	D	Grad	b	-1	0	corpus off of trees and yes right right

Bed009.A.dialogueact805	2375.71	2382.67	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and yes the the term person was a fun at stake machine that um mark like originally will worked on and when he was in tubing and then right 
Bed009.F.dialogueact804	2375.51	2375.67	F	Professor	b	-1	0	and yes right 
Bed009.A.dialogueact806	2382.67	2385.93	A	PhD	s	-1	0	in tubing and then somebody else into being picked that up so stunning tubing yeah 
Bed009.A.dialogueact807	2385.93	2386.12	A	PhD	b	-1	0	tubing yeah but is that 
Bed009.A.dialogueact808	2386.32	2386.68	A	PhD	b	-1	0	but is that

Bed009.F.dialogueact810	2387.9	2390.13	F	Professor	s	-1	0	the kind of thing it sounds like the kind of thing you were thinking of 
Bed009.A.dialogueact812	2391.65	2392.59	A	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah i guess so 
Bed009.D.dialogueact811	2391.25	2391.51	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah i guess 
Bed009.D.dialogueact813	2392.16	2392.25	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	so 
Bed009.D.dialogueact814	2392.31	2395.62	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so that action 
Bed009.D.dialogueact815	2395.62	2395.79	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	action 
Bed009.F.dialogueact816	2396.06	2396.15	F	Professor	qw^br	-1	0	yeah it's

Bed009.B.dialogueact823	2415.18	2420.93	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so this is sort of came as a surprise to me that featuring a nice parts or 
Bed009.B.dialogueact824	2421.82	2428.97	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but that because look at that and see whether there's some synergy possible uhhuh yeah yeah and testing mm uhhuh

Bed009.B.dialogueact833	2440.59	2443.41	B	Grad	s	-1	0	then there's of course more ways of thinks 
Bed009.F.dialogueact834	2444.36	2444.87	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	of course but 
Bed009.F.dialogueact835	2444.87	2454.32	F	Professor	s^arp	+1	2	of course but but um given that could be constraints you want to be small and fast and so forth and my guess as you were probably into some kind of chopped parsley

Bed009.F.dialogueact1008	2845.05	2851.06	F	Professor	qo	+1	0	about that that something about was the agent a tourist or a native or businessperson or 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1009	2851.28	2853.76	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	or uh younger rolled whatever 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1010	2853.76	2854.09	F	Professor	s	-1	0	younger rolled whatever that information 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1011	2854.49	2855.19	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	that information and also about 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1012	2855.44	2857.27	F	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	and also about thee uh 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1013	2857.93	2859.5	F	Professor	s	+1	0	uh older calling the entity is 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1014	2859.91	2860.86	F	Professor	qo^e	-1	0	is a castle is at 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1015	2860.86	2861.58	F	Professor	qo^e	-1	0	a castle is at the bank 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1016	2862.11	2863.29	F	Professor	qo^e	-1	0	to this town squares a statue 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1017	2863.29	2864.19	F	Professor	qo^e	-1	0	a statue whatever 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1018	2864.34	2864.72	F	Professor	s	-1	0	whatever 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1019	2865.2	2871.24	F	Professor	s	+1	0	so all that kind of information could be combined in two decision networks and the decisions but the other 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1020	2871.67	2880.9	F	Professor	qo	+1	1	but the other half the problem is how would you get that kind of information from the parts input 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1021	2881.57	2883.19	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so um so what you might 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1022	2883.67	2888.86	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so what you might try to do is just to build more templates saying uh we're 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1023	2888.86	2890.39	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh we're trying to build a template you know build a template 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1024	2890.39	2896.58	F	Professor	s	-1	0	you know build a template that uh somehow would capture the fact that you want take a picture 
Bed009.D.dialogueact1025	2891.35	2891.92	D	Grad	b	-1	0	that uh 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1026	2897.42	2897.77	F	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	okay and and 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1027	2897.77	2899.49	F	Professor	s	-1	0	okay and and we could you could do this and 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1028	2899.49	2902.56	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	this and it's a small enough to maine it probably 
Bed009.D.dialogueact1029	2902.56	2902.92	D	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed009.F.dialogueact1030	2903.64	2903.95	F	Professor	b	-1	0	okay 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1031	2903.95	2904.4	F	Professor	s	-1	0	okay do but 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1032	2904.79	2909.22	F	Professor	s	-1	0	do but uh that from our point of view this is also research project and they're couple 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1033	2909.3	2915.75	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and they're couple people not here for various reasons who are doing doctoral dissertations 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1034	2914.72	2915.02	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed009.F.dialogueact1035	2915.85	2924.67	F	Professor	s	+1	0	the idea that we're really after is a very deep semantics based on cognitive linguistics and the notion 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1036	2924.67	2933.8	F	Professor	s	+1	0	and the notion that there are a relatively small number of is conceptual scheme is that characterized a lot of activity 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1037	2934.22	2938.64	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so typical one in this formulation is a container 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1038	2939.02	2940.26	F	Professor	s	-1	0	this is a static thing 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1039	2940.85	2948.83	F	Professor	s	-1	0	thing and the notion is that all sorts of physical situations are characterized in terms of containers going 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1040	2948.83	2950.95	F	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	of containers going in and out the portals 
Bed009.D.dialogueact1041	2950.7	2951.1	D	Grad	b	-1	0	okay 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1042	2951.19	2951.44	F	Professor	b	-1	0	okay 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1043	2952.12	2958.94	F	Professor	s	-1	0	but also importantly for like often these guys itself as a metaphor cole things are also characters christ practice what you 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1044	2958.94	2960.43	F	Professor	s	-1	0	christ practice what you get in trouble and 
Bed009.D.dialogueact1045	2959.83	2960.07	D	Grad	b	-1	0	get in trouble and 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1046	2960.43	2960.81	F	Professor	%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed009.F.dialogueact1047	2961.24	2969.34	F	Professor	s	+1	0	so what we really trying to do is to map from the discourse to the conceptual semantics level 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1048	2970.13	2973.45	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and from there to the appropriate decisions 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1050	2975.8	2976.23	A	PhD	b	-1	0	so another one of these 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1049	2975.42	2982.51	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so another one of these primitive what are called image team is he is uh goal seeking 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1051	2983.2	2988.06	F	Professor	s	-1	0	is the notion of the source have coal trajectory possibly obstacles yeah i did 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1052	2983.84	2984.11	A	PhD	b	-1	0	is the notion of the source 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1053	2988.65	2990.9	F	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah i did this is another conceptual primitive 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1055	2992.79	2993.1	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and that all 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1054	2992.66	3001.03	F	Professor	s^rt	+1	0	and that all sorts of things typically the first to me can be represented in terms of uh a second so the idea would be 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1056	3001.03	3004.97	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	the idea would be could we build in analyzing we've taken out or it's 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1057	3006.02	3006.91	F	Professor	s:s^fe^rt	-1	0	say huh 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1058	3007.36	3010.8	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	that daughter and she is talking about an attempt to reach a goal 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1059	3011.28	3012.11	F	Professor	s	-1	0	the goal is this the person or the 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1060	3012.11	3015.57	F	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	the person or the uh travelers that uh the sort 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1061	3015.63	3015.9	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh the sort 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1062	3015.9	3017.75	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh the sort where at now is is this 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1063	3018.21	3020.16	F	Professor	s	-1	0	they mentioned possible obstacles et cetera so 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1064	3020.83	3026.13	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so they'd be and this isn't again attempt to get very wide coverage so if you can do 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1065	3026.25	3038.28	F	Professor	s	+1	1	so if you can do this then the notion would be that across a very large range of the maine's you could use this deep conceptual basis as the interface 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1066	3028.72	3029.06	A	PhD	b	-1	0	then the notion would be that across a very 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1067	3035.91	3036.18	A	PhD	b	-1	0	as the 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1068	3038.76	3039.65	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed009.F.dialogueact1069	3040.35	3041.17	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed009.F.dialogueact1070	3042.79	3051.59	F	Professor	s	-1	0	the processing of that both on the input in recognizing that certain words in know language talk about containers or goals et cetera 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1071	3052.51	3061.25	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and on the output and given this kind of information you can then uh make decisions about what actions to take 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1072	3062.76	3070.14	F	Professor	s	-1	0	provides they claim a very powerful general notion of deep semantics so if we're 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1073	3070.79	3071.65	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so if we're really do 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1074	3072.29	3072.84	A	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed009.F.dialogueact1075	3074.7	3076.24	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	nancy is going 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1076	3076.24	3077.55	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	nancy is going too her 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1077	3077.98	3088.48	F	Professor	s	-1	0	too her talk he is going to be gone about using this in applications but about modeling help children might learn there's kind of uh deep samantha grammar 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1078	3085.11	3085.38	A	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	there's kind 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1079	3086.07	3086.66	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	of 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1080	3092.21	3098.09	A	PhD	qw	-1	0	and how do you envision um the the um is deep semantic to be worked with would be highly ambiguous 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1081	3098.09	3100.14	A	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	would be highly ambiguous if and then there would be 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1082	3100.14	3106.66	A	PhD	qy^bu^d	-1	0	and then there would be another more deal that takes that um highly under specified deep semantic construction method 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1083	3106.66	3112.47	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	construction method on to the current context to find out what the person really was talking about in that context word well that's that's 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1085	3112.47	3114.48	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	word well that's that's that's where the belief that comes into the 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1084	3112.42	3114.87	F	Professor	s	-1	0	word well that's that's that's where the belief that comes into the 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1086	3114.87	3116.03	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	belief that comes into the the idea is let's take this 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1087	3116.19	3119.04	F	Professor	s	-1	0	let's take this business about going to the powder tower so 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1088	3119.33	3119.57	A	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	so 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1089	3119.96	3124.72	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so part of what you'll get out of this will be the fact that but if 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1090	3124.86	3125.79	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	that but if it works right 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1091	3126.12	3128.92	F	Professor	s	-1	0	okay that this is an agent that wants to go to this place in that 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1092	3128.92	3129.65	F	Professor	s	-1	0	to this place in that circle 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1094	3130.15	3130.49	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and they'll be additional 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1093	3130.08	3132.79	F	Professor	s	-1	0	oh and they'll be additional situational information 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1095	3132.88	3133.38	A	PhD	b	-1	0	oh okay information uh okay 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1096	3133.11	3133.87	F	Professor	s^f	-1	0	okay uh okay 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1097	3133.62	3133.82	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	okay uh okay 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1098	3134.0	3135.42	F	Professor	s	-1	0	part of company on apology the towers 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1099	3135.5	3136.82	F	Professor	s	-1	0	the towers it's kind of about 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1100	3136.12	3136.37	A	PhD	b	-1	0	it's kind of about 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1101	3136.92	3137.68	A	PhD	b	-1	0	it's kind of about part of that comes from the user 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1102	3137.11	3138.55	F	Professor	s	-1	0	part of that comes from the user mark 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1103	3139.03	3139.28	A	PhD	b	-1	0	the idea 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1104	3139.61	3147.71	F	Professor	s	+1	0	the idea of the belief that is it combines thee information from the dialogue which comes across in this general way 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1105	3148.16	3148.41	A	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	yeah this is this 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1106	3148.31	3156.06	F	Professor	s	-1	0	okay yeah this is this is a goal seeking behavior along with specific information from the apology about the kind of objects involved in about the situation 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1107	3150.73	3150.84	A	PhD	b	-1	0	along 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1108	3155.48	3155.77	A	PhD	b	-1	0	okay of objects involved 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1109	3155.77	3155.85	A	PhD	b	-1	0	okay of objects involved 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1110	3156.02	3157.33	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	in about the situation about 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1111	3156.06	3159.48	F	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	in about the situation about is it raining i whatever 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1112	3159.48	3159.69	F	Professor	s^no	-1	0	it raining i whatever 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1113	3159.69	3160.33	F	Professor	s	-1	0	it raining i whatever it is and so that's 
Bed009.F.dialogueact1114	3160.68	3163.27	F	Professor	s	-1	0	it is and so that's the belief that that we've laid out 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1115	3163.68	3163.98	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed009.F.dialogueact1116	3164.65	3176.12	F	Professor	s	+1	0	and so the the toppling the situation comes in this model from at the at that that the belief that combining evidence from thee dialogue with an apology with the situation 
Bed009.A.dialogueact1117	3172.46	3172.62	A	PhD	b	-1	0	evidence from
