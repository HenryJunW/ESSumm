The ICSI Meeting Recorder Group at Berkeley met once more to discuss group members' progress.
The majority of the group are working on tasks related to the Aurora Project , including on-line normalization and Wiener filtering.
Other progress was also reported.
A large part of the meeting was spent discussing calculations and approaches using the white-board in the room.
