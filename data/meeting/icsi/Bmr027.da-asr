Bmr027.B.dialogueact32	46.907	55.386	B	Professor	s^bu	+1	2	we said last week there was there's the suggestion of alternating weeks on more uh automatic speech recognition related or not is that sort right 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact34	55.506	57.156	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	is that sort of the division switch weaker right 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact33	55.46	55.72	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	is that sort right 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact35	57.516	58.456	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	switch weaker when well 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact36	59.03	61.407	F	Grad	s	+1	2	we haven't really started but i thought 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact37	61.407	65.597	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	but i thought we @reject@ last did meeting recorder stuff last week so i thought we 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact38	65.597	66.747	F	Grad	s^cs.%-	-1	0	last week so i thought we could do uh 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact39	67.002	69.622	B	Professor	s^arp	-1	0	probably the thing about speech recognition last week too 
Bmr027.C.dialogueact41	71.052	71.342	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	i figure also if they're 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact40	71.049	74.419	F	Grad	s^cs	+1	1	i figure also if they're shortage and items that could also do a little bit of each 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact42	74.857	75.137	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	each 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact43	74.909	75.159	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	each 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact44	77.993	80.173	F	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	seem to be having difficulty getting this adjusted again 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact45	80.173	80.603	F	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	again 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact46	80.73	80.96	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	again

Bmr027.C.dialogueact119	199.218	199.838	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	it makes it easy understanding 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact120	208.081	210.171	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	i just didn't member we just need to tell them that they can do it if they want

Bmr027.B.dialogueact123	211.301	211.511	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and so no reply 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact124	211.33	214.161	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and he's got it so and so no reply is no changes 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact125	214.326	217.966	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and he's got it so that the default thing you see when you look at the pages okay 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact126	214.346	214.646	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and he's got it so 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact127	218.62	219.39	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so it's very clear all the way down the page 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact128	219.39	220.51	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	clear all the way down the page okay and they have 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact129	220.66	221.59	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	okay and they have two options they can change 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact130	221.59	225.63	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	two options they can change it to one of them is censor and the other one is in correct 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact131	225.89	227.14	A	Postdoc	qh	-1	0	correct these jurors incorrect which means also right 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact132	226.309	226.519	F	Grad	b	-1	0	these jurors incorrect right 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact133	227.44	234.096	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	which means also we get feedback on if um there's something of that they would that needs to be adjusted because 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact134	234.096	237.266	A	Postdoc	s^df^rt	-1	0	because these are very highly technical things i mean as an added 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact135	237.266	241.166	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i mean as an added uh level of checking on the accuracy the transcription as i see it but in any case well 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact136	241.166	243.706	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it but in any case people can agree to things that are wrong so well 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact137	241.64	241.94	F	Grad	fg	-1	0	it but in any case well 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact138	243.946	244.216	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	that are wrong so yeah the reason 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact139	244.62	251.06	F	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	and the reason i yeah the reason i did that was just so that people would not censor not asked to have stuff removed because it was transcribed incorrectly 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact140	251.48	253.1	A	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	and the reason i liked it was because as opposed to uh 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact141	252.49	253.62	F	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	liked it was because as opposed to uh 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact142	254.36	259.18	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	was because it um it gives them the option of uh being able to correct it 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact143	259.35	259.55	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	it 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact144	260.338	261.358	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	approving uncorrected 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact145	262.69	263.47	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact146	264.52	267.49	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so you have it nicely set up so they email you and uh

Bmr027.B.dialogueact196	328.29	330.26	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	so that we have a uniform thing so that 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact197	330.3	331.67	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so that that's a month which is fine twelve well 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact198	331.67	332.15	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	that's a month which is fine it seems twelve hours well the only thing i said in the 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact201	332.15	332.75	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	it seems hours the only thing i said in the 
Bmr027.C.dialogueact199	331.95	332.58	C	PhD	s	-1	0	that's a month which is fine it seems twelve hours well the only thing i said in the 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact200	331.996	336.296	F	Grad	s	-1	0	that's a month which is fine it seems twelve hours well the only thing i said in the email is that the data is going to be released on the fifteenth i didn't get any other 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact202	336.296	337.546	F	Grad	s	-1	0	i didn't get any other debt on 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact203	337.727	338.017	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	debt on so my feeling is if someone 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact204	338.219	344.18	F	Grad	s:s	-1	0	so my feeling is if someone after the fifteen says wow i suddenly found something we'll deleted from our record we just won't deleted 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact205	344.38	346.72	F	Grad	s	-1	0	we just won't deleted from whatever's already been released 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact206	346.993	348.583	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	that's a little bit difficult released 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact207	351.35	352.06	F	Grad	qo	-1	0	what else can we do

Bmr027.A.dialogueact212	362.25	363.11	A	Postdoc	s^aap	-1	0	i i agree that part but i think that would be a 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact213	363.11	371.397	A	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	but i think that would be a that we need to have uh uh a message to them very clearly that beyond the state you can't make additional changes 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact214	374.626	375.036	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i mean um

Bmr027.B.dialogueact217	381.292	382.472	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	even though we say that but i think it's 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact218	382.472	384.982	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	that but i think it's good to be start some place like that so

Bmr027.A.dialogueact248	449.645	451.625	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i i think that there's one missing line well the one thing 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact249	451.392	457.492	B	Professor	s	-1	0	line well the one thing that that i did read that you just repeated to me was that you gave the specific dated july fifteenth and 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact250	456.498	456.778	F	Grad	b	-1	0	dated july fifteenth 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact251	457.913	461.183	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and you also just said that the reason you said that was because someone said it too so what i'm right 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact253	461.629	467.349	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so what i'm telling you is that what you should do is come up with at length of time that you guys think it's enough right 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact252	461.29	461.59	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	so what i'm right

Bmr027.A.dialogueact297	561.29	567.41	A	Postdoc	s.%-:s.%-	-1	0	well the farm about a form doesn't say if uh you know if you don't respond by x. number of days or x. number of weeks okay so what does it say about uh 
Bmr027.H.dialogueact298	561.429	561.809	H	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	well the farm

Bmr027.H.dialogueact301	566.686	572.274	H	PhD	qw	-1	0	or x. number of weeks it doesn't have a time limit that you be provided access so what does it say about uh the the process of of uh the review process

Bmr027.E.dialogueact312	584.342	586.542	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i guess when i read it um i'm not 
Bmr027.H.dialogueact313	585.625	585.885	H	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	read it 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact314	586.712	588.102	E	PhD	s	-1	0	um i'm not as diligent as check but i had the feeling i 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact315	588.102	589.982	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but i had the feeling i should probably respond until 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact316	589.982	593.982	E	PhD	s:s	-1	0	should probably respond until adam like i got this and i will do it by the state 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact317	594.342	602.162	E	PhD	s^cs:s	-1	0	and if you don't hear from me by then you know in other words responding to your email once right away sink as soon as you get this could you please respond and then if you right 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact318	598.308	598.588	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	once right 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact319	602.565	609.015	E	PhD	s^cs^rt	-1	0	and then if you if the person thinks so me more time because they're out of town or whatever they can tell you at that point because 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact320	609.71	610.14	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	because oh i just 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact321	610.59	611.86	F	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	oh i just i didn't want to do that because 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact322	611.86	614.91	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	i didn't want to do that because i don't want to have a discussion with every person if i can avoid it 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact323	616.174	616.584	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	well so what i wanted 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact324	616.451	618.271	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	well so what i wanted to do was just send it out and say 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact325	618.271	621.34	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and say on the fifteenth date is releasing you want to do something 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact326	620.388	620.658	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	the fifteenth date is releasing 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact327	621.34	623.25	F	Grad	s	-1	0	you want to do something about it do something about it but that's it 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact328	623.33	623.96	F	Grad	s	-1	0	it but that's it 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact329	624.22	625.52	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	i i kind of like this yeah okay 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact330	624.832	625.222	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	i i kind of like this yeah okay 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact332	625.82	626.03	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	of like this yeah okay so we're assuming well that's 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact331	625.77	627.86	E	PhD	s^bk|s.%-	-1	0	of like this yeah okay so we're assuming that well that's that would be great 
Bmr027.H.dialogueact333	626.588	628.758	H	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so we're assuming that well that's that would be great if 
Bmr027.H.dialogueact334	629.048	631.988	H	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	but you should probably have uh legal person look at this and 
Bmr027.H.dialogueact335	631.988	633.368	H	PhD	s^e	-1	0	person look at this and make sure it's okay because 
Bmr027.H.dialogueact336	633.438	651.211	H	PhD	s^df.%-	+1	1	or they they may never have gotten because if you if you uh do this and you then there's a dispute later and uh some you know someone who understands these matters concludes that they didn't have uh you know enough opportunity to actually exercise their their rights 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact337	650.282	652.562	E	PhD	s	-1	0	or they they may never have gotten the email because although their their rights 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact338	652.562	657.132	E	PhD	s^df	+1	2	the email because although they sign this they don't know by which state to expect your e. mail and 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact339	657.813	661.213	E	PhD	s.%--	+1	2	and so someone who's machine is down or whatever i mean we 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact340	661.213	662.803	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i mean we have no intern 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact341	661.754	662.174	B	Professor	b	-1	0	i mean we have no intern 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact342	662.803	664.843	E	PhD	s	-1	0	have no intern only we know that people are there but we well okay let me let me reverse

Bmr027.E.dialogueact344	664.843	667.533	E	PhD	s	-1	0	people are there but we have no confirmation and that they got him out let me let me reverse this so let's say someone i send this out 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact345	666.401	668.271	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and that they got him out so let's say someone i send this out and someone doesn't 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact346	668.271	669.651	F	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and someone doesn't respond 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact347	670.11	672.04	F	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	do we delete every meeting that they were in 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact349	674.08	674.49	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	then don't think so no 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact348	673.954	674.814	F	Grad	s	-1	0	well then i don't think so no 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact351	675.09	676.77	E	PhD	s	-1	0	it we're hoping that doesn't happen but that's

Bmr027.A.dialogueact420	769.983	773.163	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	in this case i i'm i agree i agree with was that we need to be in the clear and not have 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact421	773.433	776.143	A	Postdoc	s.%--:s.%--	-1	0	and not have to after the fact say oh but i assumed and oh i'm sorry that

Bmr027.B.dialogueact496	929.92	932.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uhhuh something as opposed to that was the kind of dispute i was making before but um 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact497	931.104	931.434	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	uhhuh i was making before

Bmr027.B.dialogueact499	932.64	937.97	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but um the attorneys i uh i can guarantee you turn east will always come back with and 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact500	937.97	940.48	B	Professor	s	-1	0	come back with and we have to decide how stringent we want to be in these things but they were always 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact501	940.54	952.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	in these things but they were always come back saying that um you need to if you want to have some to some paper trail which includes electronic trail that they have uh in fact okay it 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact502	952.734	952.974	F	Grad	b	-1	0	it 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact503	953.425	954.565	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact504	955.076	958.636	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	i think that if if if we send email as you have an if there's 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact505	958.636	966.923	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	2	as you have an if there's half the people say who don't respond at all by you know some period of time we can just make a list of these people and 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact506	966.923	968.273	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	of these people and hand to to um you know just give it to me 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact507	968.273	969.103	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you know just give it to me you don't have to administrative 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact508	969.103	970.833	B	Professor	s	+1	2	you don't have to administrative staff whatever they'll right 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact509	970.064	970.334	F	Grad	b	-1	0	staff whatever they'll right 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact510	970.833	972.753	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	2	staff whatever they'll just call them up and say you know have you right 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact511	973.47	979.02	B	Professor	s^cs:s	+1	2	is is this okay and would you please mail email adam that it is it's it's it's you know is or not so yeah 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact512	979.9	981.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so you can do yeah they're saying that there's a psychological effect 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact513	979.9	992.33	E	PhD	s	+1	3	so you can do yeah they're saying that there's a psychological effect that these for most people that if they've responded to your email saying yes i will do it or yes i got your email they're more likely to actually do it later than to just ignore it of course 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact514	990.619	991.029	B	Professor	b	-1	0	it later than to just ignore 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact515	992.833	994.643	E	PhD	s	-1	0	it of course we don't want them to plead things out but it 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact516	994.643	1004.06	E	PhD	s	-1	0	things out but it a little bit better forgetting the uh final response once they've answered you once and if they never answer you at all at all that's how 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact517	1004.83	1006.1	E	PhD	s	-1	0	that's how these mailing houses works i mean it's not completely 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact518	1006.1	1008.33	E	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean it's not completely lost work because it might benefit 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact519	1008.33	1011.56	E	PhD	s	-1	0	work because it might benefit us in terms of getting responses 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact520	1009.46	1009.59	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	us in terms of getting 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact521	1012.53	1018.21	E	PhD	s	+1	2	you know an official okay from somebody is better than no answer even if they responded that they got your email and i'm probably more 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact522	1018.21	1021.64	E	PhD	s	-1	0	i and i'm probably more likely to do that once they've responded that they got the email 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact523	1021.75	1023.37	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i think they just simply appreciated i think it's a good the email 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact524	1023.44	1027.98	A	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	i think it's a good a good way of oh drinking willem or something 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact525	1028.49	1029.83	A	Postdoc	s^bsc	-1	0	yes i think there are things 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact526	1029.08	1032.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yes i think there are things they lawyers do is they always look at worst cases so they so that having lots of spam yep 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact527	1030.49	1031.36	F	Grad	s	-1	0	they lawyers do is they always look at worst cases having lots of spam 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact528	1032.25	1034.6	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so they so that so that that's what they're paid to do and so yep 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact529	1032.61	1032.77	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	so they so that yep 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact530	1034.78	1039.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	paid to do and so it is certainly possible that uh somebody server would be down or something and they wouldn't actually 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact531	1039.1	1041.12	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and they wouldn't actually here for mass and then they find this thing 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact532	1041.12	1042.63	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then they find this thing is in there and we varies 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact533	1042.63	1044.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	is in there and we varies distributed someone so what 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact534	1044.17	1049.05	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so what it says in there in fact is that they will be given an opportunity to blah blah but in fact if 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact535	1048.1	1048.24	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	to blah blah 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact536	1049.28	1057.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but in fact if we sent them something we thought we sent them something but they didn't actually receive but for some reason um then we haven't given that well so how far do 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact537	1056.79	1058.65	F	Grad	fg|qw	-1	0	haven't given that well so how far do we have to go do we need 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact538	1058.65	1060.15	F	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	we have to go do we need to get someone signature or

Bmr027.B.dialogueact547	1068.58	1071.93	B	Professor	s^df	+1	1	i worry that says things that things like this a few times employers now so 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact548	1071.24	1071.49	F	Grad	b	-1	0	employers now so 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact549	1071.93	1074.41	B	Professor	s^df	+1	1	employers now so i i i'm pretty comfortable 
Bmr027.C.dialogueact550	1076.74	1079.37	C	PhD	qy^tc	-1	0	do you track um when people log again 
Bmr027.C.dialogueact551	1080.26	1080.78	C	PhD	s^e.%--	-1	0	uh 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact552	1080.37	1082.73	F	Grad	h|s^na	-1	0	uh if they submit the form i get it 
Bmr027.C.dialogueact553	1083.04	1083.29	C	PhD	b	-1	0	if they don't submit 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact554	1083.42	1086.03	F	Grad	s	-1	0	if they don't submit the form it goes in the general web log but that's not 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact555	1086.45	1087.72	F	Grad	s	-1	0	but that's not sufficient 
Bmr027.C.dialogueact556	1088.1	1088.36	C	PhD	b	-1	0	right because 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact557	1088.79	1088.92	F	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right because 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact558	1088.92	1092.75	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	right because if someone just because it's the website that doesn't imply anything in particular 
Bmr027.C.dialogueact559	1093.02	1094.51	C	PhD	s^2^aap	-1	0	that's except that you know they got the mail right 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact560	1094.57	1095.26	A	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	that's right i i could the mail right 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact561	1094.65	1094.87	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	that's the mail right 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact562	1095.52	1098.01	A	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	right i i could get two on the notify list if you want me to i'm already on it 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact563	1098.24	1098.83	F	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	i'm already on it 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact564	1099.82	1100.49	A	Postdoc	qy^bu^d	-1	0	for that directory 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact566	1100.89	1101.43	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	directory 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact565	1100.51	1100.76	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	directory 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact567	1105.03	1110.36	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so again hopefully um this shouldn't be quite as early as a problem either way um 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact568	1110.58	1112.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	um any the extremes we've talked about because 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact569	1112.51	1117.11	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	about because uh we're talking a pretty small number of people for this that i'm not worried because 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact570	1114.9	1115.18	F	Grad	%-	-1	0	we're talking a pretty small 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact571	1116.03	1117.61	F	Grad	s	-1	0	number of people for this that i'm not worried because 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact572	1117.61	1120.53	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	not worried because we basically know everyone on it 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact573	1118.54	1118.99	B	Professor	b	-1	0	we 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact574	1120.57	1120.75	A	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	on it 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact575	1120.98	1121.33	B	Professor	b	-1	0	on it you know they're all more or less 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact576	1121.1	1122.42	F	Grad	s	-1	0	you know they're all more or less here or it's it's 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact577	1122.42	1124.63	F	Grad	s	-1	0	here or it's it's eric and and and so on 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact578	1125.14	1131.58	F	Grad	s	-1	0	but for some of the others you're talking about visitors who are gone for make see who was e. mail addresses may or may not work 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact579	1129.3	1129.7	B	Professor	b	-1	0	who was e. 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact581	1131.93	1132.19	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	not work and 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact580	1131.9	1132.31	B	Professor	b	-1	0	not work and 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact582	1132.19	1132.74	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	and 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact583	1134.61	1138.04	F	Grad	qw	+1	3	i don't think so what are we going to do when we run into someone that we can't get in touch with 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact584	1138.58	1141.27	A	Postdoc	s	+1	3	i don't think there's so recent these visitors i and and 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact586	1141.35	1141.6	F	Grad	b	-1	0	i and and 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact585	1141.35	1143.87	A	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	i and and the they're also so 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact587	1142.17	1142.82	B	Professor	b	-1	0	the they're 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact588	1144.57	1146.82	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	the prominent enough they're easy to find true i i 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact589	1146.86	1151.51	A	Postdoc	s	+1	3	to find true i i mean i i i will be able to if you have any trouble finding and i really think i could find other methods 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact590	1147.37	1148.0	F	Grad	qy^2^bu^d^rt	-1	0	mean i i i will be able to other methods 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact591	1151.45	1151.72	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	could find 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact592	1153.92	1158.1	B	Professor	fg|s^df	-1	0	yeah because it what what it really does promise here is that we will ask their permission um 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact593	1158.88	1165.52	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	um and i think if you go into a room and close the door and and ask their permission out there doesn't seem that's the intent 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact594	1165.52	1167.32	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that's the intent of the union here so 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact595	1167.32	1167.67	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	here so 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact596	1168.11	1171.1	F	Grad	s	-1	0	well like what the question is just whether how active it has to be me because they they feel 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact597	1171.1	1173.65	F	Grad	s	-1	0	me because they they feel about contact information that's run 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact598	1173.65	1175.16	F	Grad	s	-1	0	information that's run sending information and so 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact599	1175.08	1175.37	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and so 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact600	1175.7	1177.32	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and so far everyone has done email there is and anyone 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact601	1177.32	1180.66	F	Grad	s	-1	0	well the there is and anyone who did uh any other contact method 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact602	1180.76	1188.78	B	Professor	s	+1	2	well the way if she goes people uh who uh we're here ten years ago still have work of forwards to other conference on that's method 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact603	1185.9	1186.13	F	Grad	b	-1	0	have work of 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact604	1188.78	1190.5	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	on that's unusual but so my original impressions 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact605	1189.83	1192.89	F	Grad	s	-1	0	unusual but so my original impressions was that that was sufficient 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact606	1193.03	1199.86	F	Grad	s	+1	3	still here they just come back that if they give us contact information i contact information isn't accurate that we filled our burden 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact607	1193.53	1194.14	B	Professor	b	-1	0	they that if they give us contact information 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact608	1194.97	1196.05	E	PhD	s^2	-1	0	they just come back us contact information i contact information isn't accurate 
Bmr027.C.dialogueact609	1198.53	1199.84	C	PhD	s	-1	0	still here we filled our burden 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact610	1200.05	1200.89	E	PhD	s	-1	0	i just if 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact611	1200.83	1201.23	A	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	i just if we get to a boundary 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact612	1200.93	1204.98	B	Professor	s	+1	3	i just if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe i will call the attorney about it 
Bmr027.C.dialogueact613	1201.11	1201.32	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	we get to a boundary 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact614	1204.32	1204.52	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	the attorney about it 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact615	1205.16	1206.61	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i there's something but you know hopefully me too 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact616	1206.41	1207.6	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i there's something we will me too right 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact618	1208.3	1209.61	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	for all the reasons that we discuss so supposed 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact617	1207.89	1208.15	F	Grad	s^bk^rt	-1	0	we will for all the reasons that we right 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact619	1209.43	1210.73	B	Professor	s	-1	0	discuss so supposed to be figuring out yeah and then we'll see how 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact620	1210.07	1212.77	F	Grad	fg|s^cc	-1	0	to be figuring out yeah and then we'll see how many people respond to that email 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact621	1210.87	1211.16	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	to be figuring out yeah and then we'll see how many people respond 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact622	1212.86	1214.26	F	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah i think very to that email talk two people have so 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact623	1214.43	1215.9	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	yeah i think very few people oil and so 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact624	1214.62	1214.87	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	yeah i think very so 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact625	1215.9	1224.06	B	Professor	s	-1	0	few people oil and and and you know people people see long emails about things that they don't think it's going to be high priority that typically uh don't don't read or half read it right 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact626	1224.22	1224.49	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact627	1225.09	1226.04	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	and actually people are swamped 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact629	1226.56	1227.29	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and actually um i 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact628	1226.41	1226.64	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and actually 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact630	1227.52	1229.78	A	Postdoc	fh|s^df	-1	0	um i i didn't anticipate the so i 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact631	1229.78	1231.52	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	anticipate the so i that's why i think it is common in it i 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact632	1231.57	1242.88	A	Postdoc	s^cs:s	+1	2	common in it i this discussion is made me think it might be nice to have a follow up email within the next couple of days saying by the way you know we want to hear back from you by x. date

Bmr027.A.dialogueact634	1245.14	1246.26	A	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	and then add what was said please uh 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact635	1246.45	1249.32	A	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	please uh responded please indicate you receive this mail uh 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact636	1250.07	1253.24	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	or it wouldn't even additionally uh um even if 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact637	1253.69	1259.19	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	is even if you've decided you have no changes you'd like to make if you could right that respond to the email yep 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact638	1258.39	1259.53	F	Grad	s^2^cs|s^aa	-1	0	is right that respond to the email yep 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact639	1259.36	1259.66	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	is right that yep 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact642	1259.85	1261.17	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	is the first time through the cycle right that would that would definitely work on me yep 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact641	1259.48	1259.83	B	Professor	b	-1	0	is right that yep 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact640	1259.38	1262.03	E	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	is the first time through the cycle right that would that would definitely work on me you know it makes you feel yep 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact643	1262.03	1263.77	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	you know it makes you feel more like 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact644	1264.69	1265.07	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	um if you're going to 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact645	1265.47	1270.23	E	PhD	s	-1	0	if you're going to if you're predicting that you might not answer you have a chance now to say that 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact646	1271.35	1273.98	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	whereas i i mean i would be much more likely myself 
Bmr027.C.dialogueact647	1274.37	1274.97	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	and the other given all my email 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact648	1274.44	1279.24	E	PhD	s:s	-1	0	and the other given all my email to to respond at that point saying you know what i'm probably not going to get to it or whatever rather 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact649	1279.83	1282.31	E	PhD	s	-1	0	rather than just having seen email thing can make it too and and never really 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact650	1282.31	1286.74	E	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah i was i was thinking too and and never really uh pushing myself to actually do it until it's too late 
Bmr027.C.dialogueact651	1284.01	1284.65	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	i was pushing myself 
Bmr027.C.dialogueact652	1286.67	1292.25	C	PhD	s	-1	0	i was thinking that it also lets them know that they don't have to go to the page to accept this it's too late right right that's true 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact653	1291.4	1293.25	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	accept this i mean i i yeah right right that's true 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact654	1292.58	1292.9	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	this right that's true 
Bmr027.C.dialogueact655	1293.24	1293.9	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i mean i i yeah 
Bmr027.C.dialogueact656	1293.9	1294.17	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	i mean i i yeah so that way they could 
Bmr027.C.dialogueact657	1294.17	1299.68	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so that way they could they can see from that email that if they just write back and say i got it no changes they're off the hook they don't have 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact658	1299.05	1299.44	B	Professor	b	-1	0	off the hook they don't have 
Bmr027.C.dialogueact659	1299.68	1300.86	C	PhD	s	-1	0	off the hook they don't have to go to the web page 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact661	1301.25	1314.47	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah the thing i've learned from dealings things people sending interviews and so forth uh is um if you say you've got three months to do this or do um people do it you know too and seven eight months from now if you save right

Bmr027.F.dialogueact907	1639.32	1646.18	F	Grad	s	+1	1	oh okay well mice expectation is is that we'll send out one of these e. mails every time i'm meeting has been checked and is ready 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact909	1640.72	1641.04	E	PhD	s^bd^no	-1	0	expectation is is that we'll send out one 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact910	1646.43	1647.13	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay so this time so that that 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact912	1647.56	1649.68	E	PhD	s|s^bk	-1	0	so this time was just the first child okay so that that was my intention it's just yeah that we would happen have 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact911	1647.36	1648.75	F	Grad	s	-1	0	so this time was just the first child so that that was my intention it's just 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact913	1648.75	1649.06	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	was just the first child okay was my intention it's just yeah that we would happen have 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact914	1649.06	1649.28	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	okay yeah that we would happen have 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact915	1649.28	1651.18	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	okay well that's a good idea yeah that we would happen have a bunch all at once made 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact916	1650.44	1651.39	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	well that's a good idea a bunch all at once made 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact917	1651.9	1652.41	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	idea made maybe is that the way 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact918	1652.41	1653.96	F	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	i agree with you maybe is that the way it's going to be using chain 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact919	1653.17	1653.76	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i agree with you it's going to be using chain 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact920	1654.13	1656.73	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that we could do it i i i could i'd be happy with either way back twice 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact921	1656.73	1657.24	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	with either way back twice what i was thinking uh 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact922	1657.24	1657.95	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	what i was thinking uh 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact923	1657.95	1658.69	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	what i was thinking uh so this one that 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact924	1658.83	1659.88	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so this one that was exactly right that 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact925	1659.95	1660.66	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	was exactly right that we had i i 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact926	1660.96	1664.03	A	Postdoc	s^rt	-1	0	we had i i i had wanted to get the entire set of twelve hours ready don't have it 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact927	1664.5	1665.08	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	don't have it but uh this was 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact928	1665.36	1669.45	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but uh this was the biggest club i could do buy a time where i thought it was reasonable people be able 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact929	1668.91	1669.61	B	Professor	b	-1	0	where i thought it was reasonable people be able 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact930	1669.45	1671.5	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	people be able to check it still ever ready by then my 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact931	1671.94	1676.55	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	by then my um i was thinking that would be an essay meetings i like there are three of them and they're 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact932	1676.55	1680.37	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	of them and they're uh i i well have them done by monday uh 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact933	1680.81	1682.48	A	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	uh unfortunately the time is later in i don't know how this 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact934	1682.48	1683.69	A	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	is later in i don't know how this going to work out but i thought 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact935	1683.69	1685.9	A	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	going to work out but i thought it be good to have that releases the o'clock too because 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact936	1685.9	1689.28	A	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	the o'clock too because then another they they have it it's in the category it's not quite so distracting 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact937	1689.28	1691.49	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it's not quite so distracting to them is what i was thinking and 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact938	1691.59	1692.69	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	thinking and so on what you but 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact939	1692.88	1699.67	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so on what you but after that when we're caught up a bit on this process then um i could imagine sending them out periodically as they become available 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact940	1700.26	1700.61	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i could 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact941	1700.82	1701.69	A	Postdoc	s^cs^rt	-1	0	i could do it either way i mean the question 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact942	1701.69	1704.44	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	do it either way i mean the question of how distracting is to the people have to do the checking 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact943	1708.49	1709.59	B	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt^t^tc	+1	2	yeah it might be on 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact944	1710.36	1710.67	B	Professor	s^e^rt	-1	0	mm uh

Bmr027.C.dialogueact950	1717.12	1722.76	C	PhD	s	+1	3	adam had a script whole everything back together and there was well there was one small problem but it was a simple thing to fix 
Bmr027.C.dialogueact951	1723.47	1727.98	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and then um we uh i sent him pointer two three more 
Bmr027.C.dialogueact952	1728.65	1732.26	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and so he's off and working on this no we haven't actually had 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact953	1731.38	1736.62	F	Grad	fg|s	+1	3	working on this no we haven't actually had anyone go through that meeting to see whether the transcript is correct and to see how 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact954	1736.62	1738.98	F	Grad	s	-1	0	that's is correct and to see how much was missed and all that sort of stuff so 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact955	1738.91	1739.71	A	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	that's on my list all that sort of stuff so at some point we need to do 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact956	1738.98	1740.38	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	that's on my list well someone of all that sort of stuff so at some point we need to do that 
Bmr027.C.dialogueact957	1739.64	1739.8	C	PhD	b	-1	0	on my list at some point we need to do 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact958	1740.38	1741.16	A	Postdoc	s^r	-1	0	well someone of yeah it's that 
Bmr027.C.dialogueact959	1741.64	1744.32	C	PhD	fg|s	+1	2	yeah it's going to have to go through our regular process you're the one thing i notice is it did 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact960	1743.8	1746.43	F	Grad	s	+1	2	process you're the one thing i notice is it did miss a lot of back channels there a fair number 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact961	1746.43	1749.96	F	Grad	s	-1	0	there a fair number of b. as in uh is that it's just that aren't in there 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact962	1750.42	1750.72	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bmr027.B.dialogueact964	1752.34	1755.09	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but i think yeah like you said i mean that's that's got to be a standard process with the transcribers 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact965	1755.09	1758.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	with the transcribers going most of the time doing i would imagine once once we yes absolutely 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact966	1755.8	1756.06	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	with the transcribers going most of the time 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact967	1757.11	1757.88	A	Postdoc	b	-1	0	doing i would imagine 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact968	1758.17	1759.09	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	one question once once we yes absolutely yeah 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact969	1758.31	1759.52	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	one question once once we yes absolutely yeah 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact970	1759.78	1761.09	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	one question about that actual you suppose that was because yeah 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact971	1759.91	1760.49	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	one question about that actual yeah 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact972	1761.09	1764.16	A	Postdoc	qy^rt	+1	2	you suppose that was because they weren't caught by the precinct signature oh yes absolutely 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact973	1764.15	1765.81	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	oh interesting yes absolutely absolutely 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact974	1764.92	1765.52	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	oh interesting yes absolutely absolutely

Bmr027.F.dialogueact976	1767.94	1769.72	F	Grad	fg|s	+1	2	yeah they're not they're not in the segment it it's not 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact978	1770.04	1770.34	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	that uh i 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact977	1769.83	1772.19	F	Grad	s	+1	2	okay the segment it it's not that uh i b. m. people didn't do it 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact979	1772.86	1773.17	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	okay it just they didn't get marked 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact980	1773.15	1774.16	F	Grad	s	-1	0	okay so just they didn't get marked 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact981	1774.53	1777.55	A	Postdoc	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	okay so maybe when the detector for that it's better i 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact982	1777.86	1778.3	A	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	i i there's another issue 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact983	1778.48	1779.81	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	i there's another issue which is this we've 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact984	1779.81	1783.16	A	Postdoc	s.%--	+1	2	which is this we've been uh contacted by university of washington now of course to um we sent 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact985	1783.69	1786.86	A	Postdoc	s^rt	+1	2	we sent them the transcript correspond to those six meetings 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact986	1787.24	1790.35	A	Postdoc	s	+1	2	and they're downloading be audio files so i'll be

Bmr027.F.dialogueact1001	1823.5	1825.31	F	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	there's another meeting in here what it's for 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1003	1826.59	1826.86	F	Grad	qy^d^g	-1	0	right 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1004	1827.09	1829.13	F	Grad	s^co	-1	0	yeah so we have to finish by three forty five to do so does washington does does he w. 
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1005	1827.43	1834.67	H	PhD	qr	-1	0	yeah so we have to finish by three forty five to do so does washington does does he w. one they do this i want to use this data for recognition of something else 
Bmr027.C.dialogueact1006	1835.18	1836.03	C	PhD	s	-1	0	uh for recognition i think they're doing once 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact1008	1836.13	1837.09	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i think they're doing once and that was your language 
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1007	1836.1	1836.43	H	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i think they're doing once 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact1009	1837.09	1840.94	E	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	and that was your language modeling on you know recognition compatible transfers 
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1010	1839.06	1840.65	H	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	recognition compatible transfers 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1013	1841.69	1844.99	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	to show you uh some of the things that turn up during checking procedure 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact1011	1841.26	1841.42	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	to 
Bmr027.E.dialogueact1012	1841.28	1841.31	E	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	to 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1014	1846.35	1848.46	A	Postdoc	s	+1	2	so this is from one of the and i said meetings and 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1015	1848.46	1852.32	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and uh if you're familiar with the different out there it's a lot just what it was it and they're to the right 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1016	1852.32	1855.15	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it and they're to the right is what it was change too so um 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1017	1855.15	1855.49	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1018	1856.61	1857.25	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	now first one okay so then we started 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1019	1857.25	1858.76	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	one okay so then we started we can meaning the last 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1020	1858.91	1861.98	A	Postdoc	s^ba:s	-1	0	we can meaning the last time uh and the transcriber thought little too much 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1021	1863.13	1864.45	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	but um 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1022	1865.68	1867.73	A	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	really um he was we learned too much which 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1023	1867.94	1869.67	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	learned too much which makes more sense in technically as well and these 
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1024	1869.51	1871.99	H	PhD	s^bu.%-	-1	0	as well oldest and these depressive he's where 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1025	1870.61	1870.87	A	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	depressive he's where 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1026	1871.69	1873.93	A	Postdoc	s^bk|s	-1	0	oldest that's a convention frantic hitting on certain so on certain it's 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1027	1872.01	1873.0	F	Grad	s	-1	0	that's a convention frantic hitting on certain so on certain it's 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1028	1873.93	1875.32	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	hitting on certain so the transcriber was right you know she was 
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1029	1874.49	1874.79	H	PhD	%-	-1	0	the transcriber was right 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1030	1875.52	1876.97	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know she was on certain about that okay 
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1031	1876.73	1877.12	H	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	on certain about that she's she's right to be okay 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1032	1877.29	1878.58	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	she's she's right to be uncertain 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1034	1879.09	1881.07	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and it's also a good indication of the uh that the next one 
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1033	1879.03	1879.81	H	PhD	b	-1	0	and it's also a good 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1035	1881.07	1883.39	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	the next one this was about a claudia and she'd been 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1036	1883.39	1886.8	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and she'd been really busy with stuff such as the waivers 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1037	1888.66	1889.1	A	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	okay um next 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1038	1889.39	1890.39	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	um next one um 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1039	1890.39	1892.45	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	one um this was an interesting one so the 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1040	1892.69	1896.42	A	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	one so the original was so that's not so quality is not the bad master here 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1041	1896.86	1897.73	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	here and he'll pass but it really webmaster 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1043	1897.73	1899.04	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and he'll pass but it really webmaster webmaster 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1042	1897.5	1898.14	F	Grad	s	-1	0	and he'll pass but it really webmaster webmaster 
Bmr027.D.dialogueact1044	1898.35	1899.48	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	webmaster 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1045	1900.7	1904.68	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and i see another type of uncertainty which is you know they just didn't know what to make out of that so 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1046	1904.78	1907.8	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	make out of that so so the split upon on known it's split in principle cheney's 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1047	1904.8	1904.97	F	Grad	b	-1	0	make out of that so 
Bmr027.D.dialogueact1048	1907.87	1909.22	D	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	in principle no cheney's or from i. b. m. the top line spit upon

Bmr027.A.dialogueact1087	1958.8	1959.58	A	Postdoc	fg|s.%--	-1	0	group meetings okay then you got um 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1088	1959.58	1961.01	A	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	then you got um uh instead of from 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1089	1961.19	1964.73	A	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	instead of from something or other cards for multi cast 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1090	1965.5	1969.02	A	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	and set of and system related in the system related this was changed in akron 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1091	1969.02	1970.61	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	this was changed in akron initially it shouldn't

Bmr027.A.dialogueact1095	1978.5	1979.77	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	understand this is this is a lot of jargon 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1096	1980.29	1981.55	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	um and the final one 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1097	1982.13	1984.88	A	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	the transfer birds in the corn at work itself

Bmr027.A.dialogueact1101	1992.58	1994.38	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	provider not the internet backbone core classes a lot 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1102	1994.47	1996.23	A	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	classes a lot of terminology and 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1104	1996.99	1998.6	A	Postdoc	s^ba.%--	-1	0	and they're generally extremely good but you 
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1103	1996.92	1997.33	H	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and they're generally extremely 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1105	1998.75	2002.54	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	good but you know and this this area it really does pay to um to double check and i'm hoping 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1106	2002.54	2008.64	A	Postdoc	s	+1	2	check and i'm hoping that when be checked versions are run through the recognizes that you'll sees substantial improvements in performance because we 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1107	2008.64	2010.47	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	in performance because we know there are a lot of these in there 
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1108	2011.07	2012.33	H	PhD	fg|qw.%-	-1	0	yeah but i bet i bet they're yeah so how often 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1109	2011.6	2015.26	F	Grad	fg|s	+1	2	actually no yeah but i bet i bet they're acoustically challenging parts anyway though yeah so how often 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1111	2015.51	2016.16	A	Postdoc	s^ar	+1	2	actually no uhuh oh really i 
Bmr027.D.dialogueact1110	2015.33	2015.7	D	Grad	b	-1	0	actually no

Bmr027.F.dialogueact1114	2016.92	2017.27	F	Grad	%--	-1	0	uhuh oh really i so it's just jargon 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1115	2017.27	2018.22	F	Grad	s^bk|s	+1	2	it's starting so it's just jargon 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1116	2018.7	2019.36	A	Postdoc	s^bk^m|s^aa	-1	0	it's starting i mean this is because 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1117	2019.36	2024.37	A	Postdoc	s^df	+1	2	i mean this is because the you know you don't realize in daily life how much you have top down influences and what you're hearing and well that's but 
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1118	2020.08	2020.5	H	PhD	%-	-1	0	the you know you don't realize well that's 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1120	2025.0	2027.36	A	Postdoc	s	+1	2	it's jar is jargon coupled with a foreign accent that's but we don't i mean our language

Bmr027.H.dialogueact1123	2031.94	2036.32	H	PhD	s	-1	0	the problem do any better you know i'm until you actually get a decent language model uh uh right you're probably one not 
Bmr027.F.dialogueact1125	2035.88	2036.87	F	Grad	s^2	-1	0	the problem do any better uh right you're probably one not 
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1126	2036.32	2037.95	H	PhD	s	-1	0	do any better you're probably one not so different but 
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1127	2037.95	2040.2	H	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	so different but it's i mean if that's any good that these effects i mean 
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1128	2040.2	2042.01	H	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	well i also from the standpoint i mean obviously 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1130	2042.07	2044.3	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	well i also from the standpoint of getting people's approval cause if someone sees

Bmr027.A.dialogueact1138	2060.15	2061.46	A	Postdoc	s^aa|s	-1	0	exactly it's where we discuss that yes i was afraid people would say

Bmr027.F.dialogueact1139	2060.21	2063.64	F	Grad	s	-1	0	exactly it's where we discuss that yes i was afraid people would say let's answer that because it's wrong and i don't 
Bmr027.B.dialogueact1142	2063.93	2064.2	B	Professor	b	-1	0	it's wrong and i don't want them to do that

Bmr027.A.dialogueact1143	2065.57	2070.57	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and then i also the final thing i have for transcriptionist that i made a purchase a some other headphones because 
Bmr027.H.dialogueact1144	2066.33	2066.4	H	PhD	%--	-1	0	also the final thing i 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1145	2070.57	2073.09	A	Postdoc	s^df	+1	1	because of the problem will gain an original and and 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1146	2073.46	2076.77	A	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and and they very much a proof they much prefer the new ones and actually 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1147	2076.77	2081.0	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	the new ones and actually i i mean i i think that there'll be fewer things to correct because of the the choice we originally chosen 
Bmr027.A.dialogueact1148	2081.0	2084.62	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	originally chosen uh very expensive had headsets but

Bmr027.A.dialogueact1155	2094.08	2094.79	A	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i don't know say but we chosen

Bmr027.A.dialogueact1156	2094.79	2098.56	A	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	i don't know say but we chosen because that's what's been used here by prominent projects in transcription so if see
