Bro014.C.dialogueact35	65.201	67.901	C	PhD	s	+1	2	i have something just fairly brief to report on 
Bro014.B.dialogueact36	68.08	68.33	B	Professor	b	-1	0	um 
Bro014.C.dialogueact37	68.79	76.607	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um i did some experiment uh just a few more experiments before i had uh uh go away for the what was that week 
Bro014.B.dialogueact38	69.55	69.76	B	Professor	s^ba^fe	-1	0	i did 
Bro014.C.dialogueact39	77.177	78.317	C	PhD	qy	-1	0	was the last week or whatever um 
Bro014.C.dialogueact40	78.792	79.382	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	um so 
Bro014.C.dialogueact41	79.912	84.002	C	PhD	s	+1	1	so what i was started playing with was uh again this h. t. k. back and and 
Bro014.C.dialogueact42	84.442	85.632	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bro014.C.dialogueact43	86.644	95.81	C	PhD	s	+1	1	i was curious because the way that they train up the models they go through about four sort of rounds of of training 
Bro014.C.dialogueact44	96.31	101.462	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and in the first round they do uh i think it's three iterations and 
Bro014.C.dialogueact45	101.872	108.192	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and for the last three rounds you they do seven iterations of reactor nation in each of those three and 
Bro014.C.dialogueact46	109.023	109.983	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro014.C.dialogueact47	110.623	115.653	C	PhD	s	+1	1	i'm sorry i didn't you know that's part of what takes so long to train it uh the back end for this 
Bro014.B.dialogueact48	115.586	115.916	B	Professor	s^fa	-1	0	i'm sorry i didn't this 
Bro014.B.dialogueact49	115.916	116.726	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i'm sorry i didn't quite get that there's this 
Bro014.B.dialogueact50	116.726	118.406	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	quite get that there's this foreigner seven i'm sorry yeah 
Bro014.B.dialogueact51	118.406	118.636	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	i'm sorry yeah 
Bro014.B.dialogueact52	118.636	119.156	B	Professor	s^fa	-1	0	i'm sorry yeah uh maybe i should 
Bro014.C.dialogueact53	118.797	119.157	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i'm sorry yeah uh maybe i should 
Bro014.C.dialogueact54	119.307	119.627	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh maybe i should 
Bro014.C.dialogueact55	119.627	120.707	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	uh maybe i should write on the board so 
Bro014.C.dialogueact56	120.707	123.687	C	PhD	s	-1	0	write on the board so there's four rounds of training 
Bro014.C.dialogueact57	124.187	124.687	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro014.C.dialogueact58	125.917	128.057	C	PhD	s	-1	0	i guess i i guess considerations the first one 
Bro014.C.dialogueact59	128.612	131.452	C	PhD	s	+1	1	the first one is three than seven seven and seven and 
Bro014.C.dialogueact60	131.948	138.598	C	PhD	s^e	+1	1	seven and what these numbers refer to is the number of times that be uh h. m. m. react the nation is run it's 
Bro014.C.dialogueact61	138.888	140.658	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	is run it's this program called h. e. rest 
Bro014.B.dialogueact62	141.987	148.047	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	but in a here what's the difference between uh eight in inner loop in an hour considerations okay so what happens 
Bro014.C.dialogueact63	147.695	147.965	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	considerations okay 
Bro014.C.dialogueact64	148.385	155.982	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so what happens is um at each one of these points you increase the number of doubts into the model 
Bro014.B.dialogueact65	152.533	152.863	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.B.dialogueact66	156.57	157.31	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	oh right this is the mix 
Bro014.B.dialogueact67	157.31	159.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	right this is the mix up stuff yeah that makes up right 
Bro014.C.dialogueact68	158.438	158.718	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	up stuff yeah that 
Bro014.C.dialogueact69	158.968	159.458	C	PhD	s^m^na	-1	0	up stuff yeah that makes up right 
Bro014.B.dialogueact71	160.15	160.56	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	that's right and the and 
Bro014.C.dialogueact70	159.718	159.928	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	makes up right 
Bro014.B.dialogueact72	160.56	161.14	B	Professor	s^t1	-1	0	that's right and the and so in 
Bro014.C.dialogueact73	160.772	171.822	C	PhD	s	-1	0	that's right and the and so in the final one here you end up with uh for all of the the digit words you end up with uh three mixtures per state 
Bro014.B.dialogueact74	172.328	172.648	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.C.dialogueact75	173.77	175.07	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and the final thing so i had done 
Bro014.C.dialogueact76	175.528	180.038	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so i had done some experiments where was i want to play with the number of mixtures but um 
Bro014.B.dialogueact77	180.13	180.53	B	Professor	b	-1	0	but um 
Bro014.C.dialogueact78	180.398	181.188	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	but um 
Bro014.C.dialogueact80	182.301	188.931	C	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	uh i wanted to first test to see if we actually need to do this many iterations early on 
Bro014.E.dialogueact79	182.085	182.425	E	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	uh 
Bro014.B.dialogueact81	188.483	189.023	B	Professor	b	-1	0	early on and so 
Bro014.C.dialogueact82	189.431	190.271	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	and so 
Bro014.C.dialogueact83	191.114	200.374	C	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	um i i ran a couple of experiments where i reduced that's to to be three two two uh five i think and i got almost 
Bro014.C.dialogueact84	200.374	202.734	C	PhD	s	+1	1	think and i got almost the exact same results 
Bro014.B.dialogueact86	203.329	203.739	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and but it runs 
Bro014.C.dialogueact85	203.232	205.212	C	PhD	s	+1	2	and but it runs much much faster so 
Bro014.C.dialogueact87	205.782	206.892	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bro014.C.dialogueact88	207.352	213.042	C	PhD	s	+1	2	as opposed to i i think it's only took something like uh three or four hours to do the full training 
Bro014.B.dialogueact89	213.4	214.31	B	Professor	qw^d.%--	-1	0	as opposed to as opposed to 
Bro014.F.dialogueact90	213.465	213.615	F	PhD	s^ba.x	-1	0	as opposed to 
Bro014.C.dialogueact91	214.225	217.275	C	PhD	qw^rt	+1	2	as opposed to what sixteen hours or something like that yeah 
Bro014.C.dialogueact93	218.055	221.505	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	i mean it takes you have to do an overnight basically the way it is set up now so it's it's 
Bro014.F.dialogueact92	217.83	218.66	F	PhD	s^na	-1	0	that i mean it takes you have to do yeah it's it's 
Bro014.A.dialogueact94	218.912	220.312	A	PhD	b	-1	0	i mean it takes you have to do an overnight basically the way it is set it's it's 
Bro014.B.dialogueact95	219.4	219.9	B	Professor	b	-1	0	an overnight basically 
Bro014.C.dialogueact96	222.006	222.366	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bro014.C.dialogueact97	222.952	223.292	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh even if we 
Bro014.C.dialogueact98	223.652	228.842	C	PhD	s	+1	1	and even if we don't do anything else doing something like this could allow us to turn experiments around a lot faster 
Bro014.B.dialogueact99	229.013	231.773	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	then when you have your final thing beautiful for one and when you have a final thing would go back 
Bro014.C.dialogueact100	230.439	232.739	C	PhD	s	+1	1	thing beautiful for one and when you have a final thing would go back to this 
Bro014.F.dialogueact101	232.39	232.59	F	PhD	b	-1	0	to this 
Bro014.C.dialogueact102	233.304	234.224	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	so um and it's a real 
Bro014.C.dialogueact103	234.494	236.214	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and it's a real simple change to make i mean it's like 
Bro014.C.dialogueact104	236.524	239.614	C	PhD	s^e	+1	1	i mean it's like one little exile you had to change those numbers 
Bro014.C.dialogueact105	240.168	241.388	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and you don't do anything else and then you just run 
Bro014.F.dialogueact106	240.755	241.165	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and you don't do anything else and then you just run 
Bro014.A.dialogueact108	241.574	242.064	A	PhD	b	-1	0	else and then you just run so it's 
Bro014.C.dialogueact107	241.488	242.328	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	else and then you just run so it's 
Bro014.F.dialogueact109	241.591	242.081	F	PhD	b	-1	0	else and then you just run so it's 
Bro014.C.dialogueact110	242.818	244.308	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	so it's a very simple change to make and it doesn't seem to 
Bro014.C.dialogueact111	244.308	245.868	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	make and it doesn't seem to hurt all that much 
Bro014.A.dialogueact112	246.265	249.575	A	PhD	qy^bu^d.%--	-1	0	so you you run we treat to two sites so i uh i have to look to see 
Bro014.C.dialogueact113	246.268	246.538	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	so you you so i 
Bro014.C.dialogueact114	248.97	251.18	C	PhD	h|s^no	-1	0	to two sites uh i have to look to see what the exact numbers were i thought it was like 
Bro014.A.dialogueact115	250.269	250.759	A	PhD	b	-1	0	what the exact numbers were 
Bro014.C.dialogueact116	251.18	253.7	C	PhD	s^na	-1	0	i thought it was like three two two five i'll 
Bro014.A.dialogueact118	253.865	254.325	A	PhD	b	-1	0	five i'll hold double check 
Bro014.C.dialogueact117	253.82	255.19	C	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	five i'll hold double check it was 
Bro014.C.dialogueact119	255.32	257.75	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	it was over a week ago that did it so i can't 
Bro014.A.dialogueact120	256.547	256.787	A	PhD	b	-1	0	over a week 
Bro014.A.dialogueact123	257.987	258.087	A	PhD	b	-1	0	ago that did it so i can't remember exactly but 
Bro014.C.dialogueact122	257.75	258.81	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	ago that did it so i can't remember exactly but 
Bro014.E.dialogueact121	257.361	257.651	E	Grad	b	-1	0	ago that did it so i can't 
Bro014.C.dialogueact124	258.81	259.27	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	remember exactly but uh um 
Bro014.B.dialogueact125	259.779	260.079	B	Professor	b	-1	0	uh um but it's so much 
Bro014.C.dialogueact126	259.995	261.565	C	PhD	s	-1	0	uh um but it's so much faster yeah 
Bro014.C.dialogueact128	262.015	263.475	C	PhD	s	-1	0	it makes a big difference so 
Bro014.E.dialogueact127	261.941	262.111	E	Grad	b	-1	0	faster yeah it makes a big difference 
Bro014.C.dialogueact129	263.845	266.925	C	PhD	s	+1	1	that's so we could do a lot more experiments and throw a lot more stuff in there 
Bro014.F.dialogueact130	265.538	265.898	F	PhD	b	-1	0	and throw a lot 
Bro014.B.dialogueact131	266.898	267.368	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	that's great more stuff in there um 
Bro014.C.dialogueact132	267.739	268.069	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	great um well the other thing that i did 
Bro014.C.dialogueact133	268.069	274.239	C	PhD	s^bk|s^rt	+1	2	well the other thing that i did was um i compiled the h. t. k. stuff for the linux boxes so we have 
Bro014.C.dialogueact134	274.695	277.517	C	PhD	s	+1	1	so we have this big thing we got from i. b. m. which is uh 
Bro014.C.dialogueact135	277.667	279.767	C	PhD	s^e	+1	1	b. m. which is uh five processor machine 
Bro014.C.dialogueact136	280.252	281.152	C	PhD	s^e	+1	1	really fast but it's running linux 
Bro014.C.dialogueact137	281.372	282.422	C	PhD	s	+1	1	but it's running linux so 
Bro014.C.dialogueact138	282.772	286.562	C	PhD	s	+1	1	so you can now run your experiments on that machine and you can run 
Bro014.C.dialogueact139	286.562	287.992	C	PhD	s	-1	0	machine and you can run five at a time it 
Bro014.C.dialogueact140	287.992	292.633	C	PhD	s	-1	0	five at a time it runs uh as fast as you know uh five different machines 
Bro014.A.dialogueact141	290.613	291.633	A	PhD	b	-1	0	as you know uh five different 
Bro014.F.dialogueact142	291.404	291.674	F	PhD	b	-1	0	uh five different 
Bro014.C.dialogueact143	293.208	294.138	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	so um i forgot now 
Bro014.C.dialogueact144	294.508	296.118	C	PhD	s^no	+1	1	i forgot now what the name of that machine is but i can 
Bro014.C.dialogueact145	296.118	299.148	C	PhD	s^cc	+1	1	but i can i can send email around about it and so we've 
Bro014.A.dialogueact146	297.539	297.899	A	PhD	b	-1	0	i can send 
Bro014.C.dialogueact147	299.599	300.499	C	PhD	s	-1	0	it and so we've got it now 
Bro014.C.dialogueact148	300.599	304.929	C	PhD	s	-1	0	got it now h. t. case compiled for both the lennox and for um the sparks 
Bro014.C.dialogueact149	305.605	316.19	C	PhD	s	+1	1	um you have to make you have to make sure that in your dot c. s. h. r. c. um it detects whether you're running on a linux or uh a sparking points to the right executed bulls uh 
Bro014.C.dialogueact150	316.36	316.64	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh

Bro014.C.dialogueact154	324.09	327.61	C	PhD	s	+1	1	uh i can i can tell you exactly what you need to do to get all that to work 
Bro014.C.dialogueact156	328.193	330.683	C	PhD	s	-1	0	but it'll it really increases what we can run on so 
Bro014.E.dialogueact157	328.218	328.778	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	but it'll it 
Bro014.C.dialogueact158	330.683	340.067	C	PhD	s	-1	0	we can run on so together with the fact we've got these faster linux boxes and that it takes less time to do these um we should be able to crank they're a lot more experiment

Bro014.C.dialogueact162	342.604	346.654	C	PhD	s	+1	1	so after i did that then wanted to do was try increase in the number of mixers just to see 
Bro014.C.dialogueact163	346.654	350.371	C	PhD	s^df	+1	1	of mixers just to see um see how how that affects performance so 
Bro014.A.dialogueact164	350.029	350.239	A	PhD	b	-1	0	so 
Bro014.C.dialogueact165	350.714	351.004	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah in fact so 
Bro014.B.dialogueact166	351.433	357.753	B	Professor	fg|s^cs	+1	1	yeah in fact you could do something like keep exactly the same procedure and then as if this thing on to it 
Bro014.C.dialogueact167	358.349	358.619	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	that's uhhuh exactly 
Bro014.B.dialogueact169	358.88	359.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that's that's more yeah uhhuh exactly

Bro014.C.dialogueact174	365.559	365.829	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	uhhuh showing that you're 
Bro014.C.dialogueact176	368.83	369.3	C	PhD	h	-1	0	uh let's see 
Bro014.E.dialogueact175	368.39	368.66	E	Grad	qrr.%--	-1	0	uh 
Bro014.C.dialogueact177	369.73	370.09	C	PhD	s^t1	-1	0	let's see

Bro014.C.dialogueact179	371.126	372.266	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	it goes from 
Bro014.C.dialogueact180	374.023	380.244	C	PhD	s	-1	0	will try to go backwards this at this point it's two mixtures per state so that's just 
Bro014.C.dialogueact181	380.65	381.9	C	PhD	s^na	-1	0	so that's just that's one 
Bro014.C.dialogueact182	382.303	389.108	C	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	except that uh actually for the silence model it's six extras per state

Bro014.C.dialogueact185	390.13	391.42	C	PhD	s	-1	0	uh so it goes to to um

Bro014.C.dialogueact187	393.619	395.759	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and i think what happens here is 
Bro014.B.dialogueact188	398.199	402.498	B	Professor	s	-1	0	might be between a shared uh share experiences or something or yeah i think that's what it is uh 
Bro014.C.dialogueact189	400.572	401.772	C	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	share experiences or something yeah i think that's what it is 
Bro014.B.dialogueact190	402.498	402.758	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	or uh 
Bro014.C.dialogueact191	402.762	403.392	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	or uh yeah

Bro014.C.dialogueact194	406.79	409.33	C	PhD	s^no	-1	0	she i i can't remember now what happens is that first one uh i have 
Bro014.C.dialogueact195	409.52	411.03	C	PhD	s	-1	0	one uh i have to look it up and see 
Bro014.E.dialogueact196	409.56	409.94	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	one uh i have

Bro014.C.dialogueact198	413.05	417.204	C	PhD	s	-1	0	there's because they start off with uh an initial model which is just the school 
Bro014.C.dialogueact199	417.204	418.744	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which is just the school model and 
Bro014.C.dialogueact200	418.864	420.894	C	PhD	s	-1	0	model and then they split it to the individuals and 
Bro014.C.dialogueact201	420.894	423.152	C	PhD	s	-1	0	individuals and so it may be that that's what's happening here i i have 
Bro014.C.dialogueact202	423.152	424.902	C	PhD	s	-1	0	here i i have to look it up and see i

Bro014.A.dialogueact214	449.788	456.646	A	PhD	s	+1	3	do that but the points that they were supposed to discuss is still uh things like the weights 
Bro014.A.dialogueact215	457.834	458.594	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh oh this is a conference 
Bro014.B.dialogueact216	458.373	462.893	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	oh this is a conference call for uh uh over a participant i

Bro014.A.dialogueact234	478.802	487.045	A	PhD	s	+1	1	so the points where the with the weights oh to wait to the front or rates but our pain from different language and and conditions um 
Bro014.A.dialogueact235	487.898	488.808	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro014.A.dialogueact236	489.738	492.128	A	PhD	s	+1	1	it's not scared that they would keep the same kind of freaking right now it's a waiting 
Bro014.A.dialogueact237	492.368	494.888	A	PhD	s	-1	0	right now it's a waiting on on 
Bro014.B.dialogueact238	495.195	495.615	B	Professor	b	-1	0	some people 
Bro014.A.dialogueact239	495.751	499.041	A	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	some people are doing that that would be better weights some uh 
Bro014.A.dialogueact240	499.81	500.35	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh but 
Bro014.A.dialogueact241	500.692	504.232	A	PhD	s	+1	1	but to to combine error rates before computing improvement 
Bro014.A.dialogueact242	505.25	510.36	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	uh and the fact is that for rhino for english they have weights that they combine 
Bro014.A.dialogueact243	510.47	512.51	A	PhD	s	-1	0	that they combine our rates but for 
Bro014.A.dialogueact244	512.57	515.65	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but for the other languages they combine improvements 
Bro014.A.dialogueact245	516.222	517.392	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so it's not very consistent 
Bro014.A.dialogueact247	518.278	519.168	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	um yeah 
Bro014.B.dialogueact246	517.965	518.895	B	Professor	b	-1	0	um 
Bro014.A.dialogueact248	520.024	520.314	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and um 
Bro014.A.dialogueact249	520.514	521.284	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bro014.A.dialogueact250	522.162	522.472	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.A.dialogueact251	523.684	524.064	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and so um 
Bro014.A.dialogueact252	524.344	526.034	A	PhD	s	-1	0	um a point 
Bro014.A.dialogueact253	527.43	541.574	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and right now like check every single so uh that happens with the current wages that very none significant improvement on the web much k.'s resulting you which differences and find now number 
Bro014.B.dialogueact254	542.053	542.563	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and so 
Bro014.A.dialogueact256	542.565	547.017	A	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	and so perhaps they would uh changed the way weight too 
Bro014.C.dialogueact255	542.349	542.799	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and so 
Bro014.A.dialogueact257	548.293	548.543	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.C.dialogueact258	549.07	549.93	C	PhD	qw	-1	0	how should that be done 
Bro014.C.dialogueact259	550.24	553.28	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	i mean it it seems like there's a simple way 
Bro014.A.dialogueact260	550.914	551.134	A	PhD	b	-1	0	i mean it it seems 
Bro014.C.dialogueact261	555.963	557.723	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	well uh this seems like an obvious steak or something that they're 
Bro014.B.dialogueact263	557.923	560.643	B	Professor	s	+1	1	well i mean the fact is inconsistent just not this mistake but the or something that they're 
Bro014.C.dialogueact262	557.723	558.103	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	well i mean the fact is or something that they're 
Bro014.B.dialogueact264	560.643	562.733	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	this mistake but the but um the other thing i know 
Bro014.A.dialogueact265	561.272	561.502	A	PhD	x	-1	0	but um the 
Bro014.B.dialogueact266	562.733	563.093	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	other thing i know i am through but one 
Bro014.B.dialogueact267	563.093	563.853	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i am through but one 
Bro014.B.dialogueact268	563.853	566.589	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i am through but one one would think that each it it's

Bro014.C.dialogueact300	625.261	626.151	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and then give you a score here's a score and then 
Bro014.C.dialogueact301	626.151	626.811	C	PhD	s	-1	0	here's a score and then 
Bro014.C.dialogueact302	626.811	628.631	C	PhD	s	-1	0	here's a score and then they can do the same thing for the baseline system here's it 
Bro014.C.dialogueact303	628.631	629.371	C	PhD	s	-1	0	system here's it score and then you can look 
Bro014.C.dialogueact304	629.371	630.261	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	well that's score and then you can look at 
Bro014.A.dialogueact305	630.567	630.817	A	PhD	b	-1	0	well that's at 
Bro014.B.dialogueact306	630.759	632.789	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well that's the same is one of the things they could do it at 
Bro014.A.dialogueact308	632.799	633.249	A	PhD	b	-1	0	they could do it just when you when you get 
Bro014.B.dialogueact307	632.789	636.254	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	they could do it just when you when you get all done i think that they probably i i i was 
Bro014.B.dialogueact309	636.254	637.404	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i i i was in there but i think they started 
Bro014.B.dialogueact310	637.404	644.235	B	Professor	s	+1	1	in there but i think they started off this process with a notion that you should be significantly better than the previous standard 
Bro014.C.dialogueact311	644.538	644.948	C	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.B.dialogueact312	645.21	646.2	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and um so they said how much 
Bro014.B.dialogueact313	646.2	648.04	B	Professor	s	+1	1	so they said how much is significantly better with you and and so 
Bro014.B.dialogueact314	648.04	648.5	B	Professor	qw.%--	-1	0	with you and and so 
Bro014.B.dialogueact315	648.5	653.636	B	Professor	s	+1	1	with you and and so they said well you know i should have half so or something that you had before so 
Bro014.A.dialogueact316	650.265	650.605	A	PhD	b	-1	0	you know i should have 
Bro014.A.dialogueact317	651.255	652.545	A	PhD	b	-1	0	half so or something that you 
Bro014.C.dialogueact318	652.568	653.138	C	PhD	b	-1	0	that you had before so 
Bro014.A.dialogueact319	653.781	654.031	A	PhD	b	-1	0	had before so it's 
Bro014.B.dialogueact320	653.94	654.67	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	had before so it's 
Bro014.B.dialogueact321	655.45	655.9	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.B.dialogueact323	657.332	658.372	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	but it does seem like 
Bro014.C.dialogueact322	656.954	657.254	C	PhD	b	-1	0	but it does seem like 
Bro014.B.dialogueact324	659.01	661.66	B	Professor	s^r	+1	1	it does seem like it's more logical to combine them first and then do 
Bro014.B.dialogueact325	661.66	662.25	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	them first and then do 
Bro014.A.dialogueact326	663.399	664.809	A	PhD	s^2^rt	-1	0	combined or rates and 
Bro014.A.dialogueact328	664.809	665.199	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	or rates and and yeah 
Bro014.B.dialogueact327	664.722	665.072	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	or rates and and yeah 
Bro014.A.dialogueact329	665.359	665.649	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and yeah 
Bro014.A.dialogueact331	666.295	666.555	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	um 
Bro014.B.dialogueact330	665.862	666.162	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and yeah um 
Bro014.A.dialogueact332	667.744	670.384	A	PhD	s	+1	1	but there just these these stayed this program if waste when when you combine 
Bro014.A.dialogueact333	670.384	674.774	A	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	waste when when you combine there are eighteen tends to be more importance to the difficult cages 
Bro014.A.dialogueact335	675.476	677.066	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and some people think that by they have different 
Bro014.B.dialogueact334	675.067	675.367	B	Professor	qy^bh^rt	-1	0	and some people 
Bro014.A.dialogueact336	677.316	680.686	A	PhD	s	-1	0	by they have different um opinions about this 
Bro014.A.dialogueact337	681.116	691.062	A	PhD	s^e	+1	1	some people think that it's more important to look at too it's ten percent and critique improvement um wet much gaze down to a fifty percent on them mismatched other people 
Bro014.A.dialogueact338	691.452	695.911	A	PhD	s^e	+1	1	other people things that it's more important too grew up the me so much and 
Bro014.A.dialogueact339	695.911	696.131	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	up the me so much and it's 
Bro014.A.dialogueact341	697.142	697.622	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	so but not like they don't really 
Bro014.C.dialogueact340	696.8	701.08	C	PhD	s	+1	1	so but well it's not like they don't really have a good idea about what the final application is going to be 
Bro014.A.dialogueact342	697.622	698.392	A	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	so but not like they don't really have a good idea about 
Bro014.A.dialogueact343	701.278	701.558	A	PhD	b	-1	0	well 
Bro014.B.dialogueact344	701.489	716.104	B	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	well you know the the thing is that if you look at the numbers on the on the more difficult cases um if you really believe that was going to be the predominant use none of this would be good enough nothing anybody 
Bro014.A.dialogueact345	702.088	702.468	A	PhD	b	-1	0	you know the 
Bro014.A.dialogueact346	702.468	703.378	A	PhD	b	-1	0	you know the the thing is 
Bro014.A.dialogueact348	716.483	716.743	A	PhD	b	-1	0	nothing anybody 
Bro014.B.dialogueact349	716.554	717.334	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	nothing anybody whereas 
Bro014.C.dialogueact347	716.388	716.808	C	PhD	b	-1	0	nothing anybody 
Bro014.B.dialogueact350	717.334	724.5	B	Professor	s	-1	0	whereas you sort of with some reasonable error recovery could imagine in the better cases these these systems working 
Bro014.B.dialogueact351	725.387	726.147	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so um i think 
Bro014.B.dialogueact352	726.147	726.757	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um i think 
Bro014.B.dialogueact353	726.757	732.823	B	Professor	s	-1	0	um i think the hope would be that it would uh it would work well for the good cases and 
Bro014.B.dialogueact354	732.823	739.85	B	Professor	s	-1	0	cases and uh it would have reasonable reasons soft segregation is you got to worse and worse conditions 
Bro014.B.dialogueact355	740.14	740.7	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro014.C.dialogueact356	740.145	740.495	C	PhD	b	-1	0	um 
Bro014.C.dialogueact357	741.125	742.075	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i guess what i'm i mean 
Bro014.C.dialogueact358	742.901	746.381	C	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean i i was thinking about it in terms if i were building the final product and i was going to test 
Bro014.C.dialogueact359	746.381	749.424	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and i was going to test to see which friend and that uh i want to do is i would 
Bro014.C.dialogueact360	749.424	756.108	C	PhD	s	-1	0	but but no to do is i would try to wait things depending on the exact environment that i was going to be using the system and if i 
Bro014.B.dialogueact362	756.289	756.949	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	but but no if i 
Bro014.C.dialogueact361	756.108	756.438	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	but but no if i 
Bro014.B.dialogueact363	757.009	757.219	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	no no i mean 
Bro014.B.dialogueact364	757.219	757.469	B	Professor	s^ar^r	-1	0	no no i mean 
Bro014.B.dialogueact365	757.469	759.434	B	Professor	s	-1	0	no no i mean as evaporating here and there they 
Bro014.B.dialogueact366	759.434	763.504	B	Professor	s	+1	1	here and there they they don't they don't really no 
Bro014.C.dialogueact367	760.06	760.44	C	PhD	b	-1	0	they don't they don't really 
Bro014.B.dialogueact368	764.03	764.49	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	so if they don't 
Bro014.C.dialogueact369	764.198	767.548	C	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	so if they don't know doesn't that suggest a way for them to go 
Bro014.C.dialogueact370	768.319	768.769	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bro014.C.dialogueact371	770.307	771.527	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	you assume everything's equal i mean you 
Bro014.C.dialogueact372	771.587	772.647	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	well equal i mean you i mean you 
Bro014.B.dialogueact373	773.038	776.798	B	Professor	h|s^cs	-1	0	i mean i i think one thing to do is to just not rely on a single number to maybe 
Bro014.B.dialogueact374	776.798	778.478	B	Professor	s^cs^e	-1	0	a single number to maybe have two or three numbers you know and yeah right 
Bro014.C.dialogueact375	777.539	777.909	C	PhD	b	-1	0	have two or three numbers yeah 
Bro014.B.dialogueact377	778.478	778.858	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	you know and right 
Bro014.C.dialogueact376	778.329	778.679	C	PhD	b	-1	0	you know and right 
Bro014.B.dialogueact378	778.858	785.934	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you know and and and say here's how much to uh you improve the uh that the relatively clean case and right 
Bro014.B.dialogueact379	785.934	786.444	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	clean case and here's or or a romance 
Bro014.B.dialogueact380	786.444	787.704	B	Professor	s^bsc	-1	0	here's or or a romance case and here's 
Bro014.B.dialogueact381	787.704	789.274	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	case and here's how here's how much you 
Bro014.C.dialogueact382	787.995	788.465	C	PhD	b	-1	0	case and here's how here's how much 
Bro014.B.dialogueact383	790.045	790.445	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.C.dialogueact384	790.619	790.869	C	PhD	x	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.B.dialogueact386	791.45	791.54	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so not try to combine 
Bro014.C.dialogueact385	791.291	792.551	C	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	yeah so not try to combine them 
Bro014.B.dialogueact387	792.6	792.82	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah them 
Bro014.B.dialogueact388	793.11	793.91	B	Professor	s	-1	0	actually it's true i 
Bro014.C.dialogueact389	793.128	793.398	C	PhD	b	-1	0	actually it's true i 
Bro014.B.dialogueact390	793.91	795.05	B	Professor	s	-1	0	actually it's true i i forgot in this uh but uh 
Bro014.B.dialogueact391	795.05	797.98	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh but uh well matched just not actually clean what 
Bro014.B.dialogueact392	797.98	799.22	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	not actually clean what it is is just that the the training 
Bro014.B.dialogueact394	799.705	801.795	B	Professor	s^m^na	-1	0	that the training and testing or somewhere the training and testing 
Bro014.C.dialogueact393	799.447	800.627	C	PhD	s^2	-1	0	that the training and testing the training and testing 
Bro014.A.dialogueact395	801.977	802.197	A	PhD	b	-1	0	or somewhere so 
Bro014.B.dialogueact396	802.085	802.655	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro014.B.dialogueact397	803.155	810.487	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i guess what you would do in practice as you try to get as many uh examples of a similar sort of stuff that you could and 
Bro014.B.dialogueact399	810.96	811.64	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and then uh 
Bro014.C.dialogueact398	810.692	811.042	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and then uh 
Bro014.B.dialogueact400	812.0	812.65	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so the argument 
Bro014.B.dialogueact401	812.65	823.235	B	Professor	s	+1	1	so the argument for that being that the the more important thing is that you're going to try and do that but you want to see how badly it deviate from that when when when the uh it's a little different um so so 
Bro014.C.dialogueact402	822.243	822.643	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	uh it's a little different so 
Bro014.B.dialogueact403	823.75	824.38	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um so you should wait those other conditions 
Bro014.C.dialogueact404	823.935	828.121	C	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	um but no so you should wait those other conditions very you know really small 
Bro014.B.dialogueact405	828.301	828.581	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	but no 
Bro014.B.dialogueact406	828.811	829.031	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	but no that's that's that's i mean that's more of an information 
Bro014.B.dialogueact407	829.031	830.441	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	that's that's that's an art i mean that's more of an information kind of thing 
Bro014.C.dialogueact408	829.119	831.169	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	that's that's that's an art that's an art now i mean that's more of an information kind of thing 
Bro014.B.dialogueact409	831.179	831.739	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	that's an art now 
Bro014.B.dialogueact410	831.739	833.089	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that's an art now that's an argument for running or the opposite i 
Bro014.B.dialogueact411	833.089	834.249	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	running or the opposite i the opposite argument 
Bro014.B.dialogueact413	834.249	837.789	B	Professor	s	+1	1	the opposite argument is you're never really going to have a good sample of all these different things 
Bro014.C.dialogueact412	834.084	834.414	C	PhD	b	-1	0	the opposite argument 
Bro014.B.dialogueact414	838.28	841.72	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	mean are you going to have uh uh examples with windows open half 
Bro014.B.dialogueact415	841.72	842.46	B	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	open half open full open 
Bro014.B.dialogueact416	842.46	843.14	B	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	open full open going seventy

Bro014.B.dialogueact420	847.313	848.303	B	Professor	s	-1	0	with what passing you with uh i mean 
Bro014.B.dialogueact421	848.303	848.563	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	you with uh i mean 
Bro014.B.dialogueact422	848.563	849.083	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	you with uh i mean i

Bro014.B.dialogueact424	850.002	854.482	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i think that you could make the opposite argument that the well matched cases of fantasy 
Bro014.C.dialogueact425	854.742	855.272	C	PhD	b	-1	0	you know 
Bro014.B.dialogueact427	855.801	856.041	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	you know so i 
Bro014.B.dialogueact428	856.041	856.621	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so i 
Bro014.E.dialogueact426	855.691	856.091	E	Grad	b	-1	0	you know so i 
Bro014.B.dialogueact429	856.891	868.499	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so i think the thing is is that if you look at the well matched case versus the you know the the medium in the in the foot uh mismatch case um we're seeing really really big differences in performance right 
Bro014.B.dialogueact430	868.499	868.839	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right 
Bro014.B.dialogueact431	869.653	872.853	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and and you would like that to be the case 
Bro014.B.dialogueact432	873.083	875.253	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	you wouldn't like as soon as you step outside a lot 
Bro014.B.dialogueact433	875.785	877.705	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	a lot of the the cases it's it's well that'll teach enroll their window up 
Bro014.C.dialogueact434	876.671	878.101	C	PhD	s^j	-1	0	of the the cases it's it's well that'll teach enroll their window up 
Bro014.B.dialogueact435	882.156	884.586	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i mean these cases if you go from that of the uh i mean 
Bro014.B.dialogueact436	884.876	886.266	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh i mean i remember the numbers i don't know if you if you go 
Bro014.B.dialogueact437	886.266	895.269	B	Professor	s^r	-1	0	don't know if you if you go from the well matched case to the medium it's not any enormous difference in uh in uh that training testing situation and and 
Bro014.B.dialogueact438	895.269	898.864	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and and and it's a really big performance job 
Bro014.C.dialogueact439	895.429	895.809	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and and 
Bro014.B.dialogueact440	899.154	899.404	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	you know so

Bro014.B.dialogueact443	902.89	911.933	B	Professor	s^bk|s	-1	0	yeah i mean the reference one for instance is back to hold on to an italian uh was like six percent there for the well matched in 
Bro014.B.dialogueact444	911.933	913.463	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well matched in eighteen for the medium ashton sixty 
Bro014.B.dialogueact445	913.463	916.363	B	Professor	s	-1	0	ashton sixty for the or how they mismatch uh 
Bro014.B.dialogueact446	916.991	917.291	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh and you know these 
Bro014.B.dialogueact447	917.291	921.372	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and you know these other systems we we help it out quite a bit but still there's 
Bro014.B.dialogueact448	921.372	926.262	B	Professor	s	-1	0	a bit but still there's there's something like factor too or something between well matched media managed and 
Bro014.B.dialogueact449	926.262	933.244	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and so i think that if what you're if the goal of this is to come up with robust features it does mean 
Bro014.B.dialogueact450	934.083	937.533	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so you could argue in fact that the well master something you shouldn't be looking at at all 
Bro014.B.dialogueact451	938.812	944.642	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that that the goal is to come up with features that will still give you reasonable performance 
Bro014.B.dialogueact452	945.181	947.451	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and again gentle bigger get it degradation um 
Bro014.B.dialogueact453	947.991	951.891	B	Professor	fh|s^e	-1	0	um even though the the testing condition is not the same as the training 
Bro014.C.dialogueact454	952.228	952.658	C	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.B.dialogueact455	953.06	959.92	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	so you know i i could argue strongly something like the media mismatch which is you know not pathological but 
Bro014.B.dialogueact456	960.13	962.08	B	Professor	qw^rt	-1	0	what was the the media mismatch condition again 
Bro014.A.dialogueact457	963.528	965.388	A	PhD	h|s.%--	-1	0	um it it's 
Bro014.A.dialogueact458	965.868	966.048	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	it's me me as much as 
Bro014.A.dialogueact459	966.208	970.118	A	PhD	s	-1	0	me me as much as everything with thus far microphone but trained 
Bro014.A.dialogueact460	970.468	974.217	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but trained um like little noisy condition like those speed 
Bro014.A.dialogueact461	974.217	975.277	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	like those speed and or 
Bro014.A.dialogueact462	975.277	977.417	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and or stop the car and tested 
Bro014.A.dialogueact463	977.767	980.837	A	PhD	s	-1	0	the car and tested um i speak conditions like 
Bro014.A.dialogueact464	980.837	981.977	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	like when i leave 
Bro014.A.dialogueact465	981.977	982.087	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	when i leave 
Bro014.B.dialogueact466	983.242	983.492	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	right so it's still 
Bro014.A.dialogueact468	983.903	984.073	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	right so it's still the same same microphone 
Bro014.B.dialogueact467	983.492	986.632	B	Professor	s	-1	0	see microphone but right so it's still the same same microphone in both cases 
Bro014.A.dialogueact469	985.34	986.21	A	PhD	s^m^na	-1	0	see microphone but in both cases 
Bro014.A.dialogueact470	986.21	986.35	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	but cases 
Bro014.A.dialogueact471	986.59	986.8	A	PhD	b	-1	0	but cases 
Bro014.B.dialogueact472	987.348	991.088	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	but uh it's there's a mismatch between the car conditions and that's 
Bro014.B.dialogueact473	991.088	991.468	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and that's 
Bro014.B.dialogueact474	991.917	995.616	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and that's you could argue that's a pretty realistic situation and 
Bro014.C.dialogueact475	994.1	994.42	C	PhD	b	-1	0	situation 
Bro014.A.dialogueact476	995.44	995.94	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bro014.B.dialogueact477	995.616	998.496	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and uh it almost argue for waiting that highest but the way they have 
Bro014.B.dialogueact478	998.496	1001.57	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	highest but the way they have it now it's i guess it's it's 
Bro014.B.dialogueact479	1002.16	1004.3	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	they they can be with a relative improvement first and then average that 
Bro014.B.dialogueact480	1004.3	1005.76	B	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	and then average that with the waiting 
Bro014.A.dialogueact481	1005.92	1006.21	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	with the waiting and so then 
Bro014.B.dialogueact482	1006.55	1010.27	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so then the that that makes the highly matched the really big thing 
Bro014.A.dialogueact483	1010.95	1011.2	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.B.dialogueact484	1011.28	1012.08	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro014.B.dialogueact485	1013.0	1023.29	B	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	it since they have these three categories it seems like a reasonable thing to do is to go across the languages and to come up with an improvement for each of those 
Bro014.A.dialogueact486	1023.07	1024.21	A	PhD	b	-1	0	say okay 
Bro014.B.dialogueact487	1024.49	1027.63	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	say okay in in the highly match case this is what happens in the 
Bro014.B.dialogueact488	1027.63	1031.5	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	happens in the the so they can medium insist happens and i mismatched 
Bro014.B.dialogueact489	1031.5	1034.03	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and i mismatched that happens and 
Bro014.A.dialogueact490	1032.52	1032.78	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.B.dialogueact491	1034.55	1035.55	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bro014.B.dialogueact492	1036.31	1040.6	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you should see uh a gentle degradation 
Bro014.A.dialogueact493	1039.42	1040.23	A	PhD	b	-1	0	degradation 
Bro014.B.dialogueact494	1041.82	1042.45	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.B.dialogueact495	1045.21	1045.58	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro014.A.dialogueact497	1047.97	1048.19	A	PhD	b	-1	0	i think 
Bro014.B.dialogueact498	1048.83	1049.59	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i think that that 
Bro014.B.dialogueact499	1050.62	1051.08	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i i i 
Bro014.B.dialogueact500	1052.01	1058.31	B	Professor	s	+1	1	gather that these meetings it's it's really tricky to make anything actually make any policy change because 
Bro014.B.dialogueact501	1058.31	1062.57	B	Professor	s^df	+1	1	because everybody has has uh their own opinion 
Bro014.A.dialogueact503	1063.01	1063.24	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.B.dialogueact502	1062.57	1062.73	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	own opinion

Bro014.A.dialogueact505	1064.9	1065.04	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.B.dialogueact506	1065.25	1065.47	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.A.dialogueact507	1067.04	1067.6	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	so yeah 
Bro014.A.dialogueact508	1067.69	1067.9	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so yeah 
Bro014.A.dialogueact509	1069.88	1069.98	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah but 
Bro014.A.dialogueact510	1069.98	1073.81	A	PhD	s	+1	1	yeah but there is probably uh a big change that to be made is that 
Bro014.A.dialogueact511	1073.81	1077.9	A	PhD	s	+1	1	be made is that the the bays dying they want to have a new byzantine perhaps 
Bro014.A.dialogueact512	1078.5	1079.5	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which is them s. you see but with 
Bro014.A.dialogueact513	1079.5	1082.07	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	s. you see but with voice acute detector 
Bro014.A.dialogueact514	1083.43	1092.86	A	PhD	s	+1	1	and the parents be uh some people are pushing too to keep just sixty percent number so 
Bro014.A.dialogueact515	1092.86	1097.37	A	PhD	s	+1	1	number so they want at least fifty percent improvement on the baseline 
Bro014.A.dialogueact517	1098.27	1100.27	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	but which would be a much better business and 
Bro014.B.dialogueact516	1097.79	1098.27	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	but which would 
Bro014.B.dialogueact518	1100.51	1100.9	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	and 
Bro014.A.dialogueact519	1101.02	1108.65	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	you look at uh it's i mean it sounds just to think of did in the bed nine improve like more than twenty percent 
Bro014.B.dialogueact520	1108.69	1109.06	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	percent which would mean down then 
Bro014.A.dialogueact521	1109.22	1116.5	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	which would mean down then mean that fifty percent on these new byzantine it's like more than sixty percent improvement in 
Bro014.A.dialogueact523	1117.94	1119.39	A	PhD	x	-1	0	rhino so nobody would be they're probably right 
Bro014.B.dialogueact522	1117.68	1119.5	B	Professor	s^bu|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	rhino so nobody would be they're probably right 
Bro014.A.dialogueact524	1119.65	1121.11	A	PhD	s^m^na	-1	0	rhino nobody would be there but right 
Bro014.A.dialogueact525	1121.11	1121.28	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	but 
Bro014.A.dialogueact527	1121.88	1122.01	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	but work 
Bro014.B.dialogueact526	1121.67	1121.86	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	but 
Bro014.B.dialogueact528	1122.99	1123.45	B	Professor	s^j	-1	0	work to do 
Bro014.A.dialogueact529	1125.67	1126.07	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	uhhuh so mostly the idea 
Bro014.B.dialogueact530	1126.42	1127.38	B	Professor	qw^rt	+1	1	so mostly the idea is is is 
Bro014.B.dialogueact531	1127.38	1128.43	B	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	uh is is is uh 
Bro014.A.dialogueact532	1128.94	1130.29	A	PhD	h|s	+1	1	uh they didn't decide it's i guess you just this uh 
Bro014.A.dialogueact533	1130.29	1133.66	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	it's i guess you just this one point of the conference calls so but 
Bro014.A.dialogueact534	1133.66	1133.87	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	calls so but 
Bro014.A.dialogueact535	1134.21	1134.36	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro014.A.dialogueact536	1135.16	1135.55	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	so i don't know uh

Bro014.B.dialogueact541	1143.59	1146.02	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i i think that would be good i mean it's not that the design 
Bro014.B.dialogueact542	1146.02	1148.61	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean it's not that the design of the v. a. d. isn't important 
Bro014.B.dialogueact543	1149.18	1157.43	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but it's just that it it it does seem to be a lot of to do a good job on on that as well as 
Bro014.B.dialogueact544	1157.43	1161.45	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	that as well as being a lot of work to do a good job in the future design so

Bro014.A.dialogueact556	1175.44	1187.12	A	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah just it's someone told that perhaps it's not fair to do that because and um to make a good g. e. d. you don't have enough to with that the features that uh the business teacher so

Bro014.A.dialogueact559	1192.68	1193.83	A	PhD	s	-1	0	you need more features

Bro014.B.dialogueact577	1212.31	1212.96	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	well let's say friends 
Bro014.B.dialogueact578	1212.96	1217.31	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well let's say friends m. i. c. c. francis doesn't have anything in it uh related to the pitch 
Bro014.B.dialogueact579	1218.23	1219.49	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so just just for example so suppose 
Bro014.B.dialogueact580	1219.49	1223.53	B	Professor	s	-1	0	example so suppose you that what you really want to do is put a good pitches sector on there and if it gets 
Bro014.B.dialogueact581	1223.53	1225.0	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	on there and if it gets in on they give us i gets oh oh i see 
Bro014.C.dialogueact582	1224.43	1224.85	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	in on they give us oh oh 
Bro014.C.dialogueact583	1224.85	1225.59	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	in on they give us i gets oh oh i see 
Bro014.A.dialogueact584	1225.35	1226.08	A	PhD	b	-1	0	i gets nine biggest yourself i see 
Bro014.B.dialogueact585	1225.64	1231.19	B	Professor	s^r	-1	0	i gets nine biggest yourself then you definitely in a in a in a voice and they uh beach and the speech i see so there's this 
Bro014.B.dialogueact587	1231.82	1232.31	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so there's this assumption that the the 
Bro014.C.dialogueact586	1231.33	1235.5	C	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	so there's this assumption that the the voice activities hector can only use p. m. a c. c. 
Bro014.A.dialogueact588	1236.26	1237.04	A	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	that's not there but this 
Bro014.A.dialogueact589	1237.04	1238.75	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but this well for the baseline 
Bro014.B.dialogueact590	1238.11	1238.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well for the baseline 
Bro014.C.dialogueact591	1239.42	1239.68	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.B.dialogueact592	1240.42	1242.38	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so so if you use other features than it that's just a question 
Bro014.B.dialogueact593	1242.38	1244.12	B	Professor	s	-1	0	than it that's just a question of what is your baseline right 
Bro014.B.dialogueact594	1245.01	1245.18	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	is it that you're supposed i 
Bro014.B.dialogueact596	1245.18	1246.87	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	is it that you're supposed to do better than and i 
Bro014.C.dialogueact595	1245.03	1245.37	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	is it that you're supposed i 
Bro014.C.dialogueact597	1245.37	1245.78	C	PhD	b	-1	0	is it that you're supposed i 
Bro014.B.dialogueact598	1246.87	1247.63	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	to do better than and so 
Bro014.B.dialogueact600	1248.11	1256.19	B	Professor	s	-1	0	having the baseline b. d. m. cici's means that people could choose to pour their their effort into trying to do really good v. a. d. okay i don't but they seemed like two 
Bro014.C.dialogueact599	1248.04	1248.55	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	having the baseline b. i don't 
Bro014.C.dialogueact601	1256.12	1258.31	C	PhD	s	-1	0	okay they're sort but they seemed like two separate issues right i mean 
Bro014.B.dialogueact602	1256.74	1257.06	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	okay but they seemed like two separate issues 
Bro014.B.dialogueact605	1258.71	1259.58	B	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	they're sort of separate unfortunately right i mean 
Bro014.C.dialogueact603	1258.31	1258.66	C	PhD	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	they're sort right i mean 
Bro014.C.dialogueact604	1258.66	1258.95	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	they're sort right i mean 
Bro014.B.dialogueact606	1259.58	1261.09	B	Professor	s^arp	-1	0	of separate unfortunately this coupling between them which is part of it 
Bro014.B.dialogueact607	1261.36	1267.39	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	which is part of it i think sometimes gets too is that you can choose your features in such a ways to improve the v. a. d. 
Bro014.A.dialogueact608	1268.11	1268.28	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and you also can choose 
Bro014.B.dialogueact609	1268.13	1271.85	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and you also can choose your features in situations prove prove recognition that may but 
Bro014.B.dialogueact611	1271.85	1272.91	B	Professor	s	-1	0	recognition that may not be the same thing but at they to both 
Bro014.C.dialogueact610	1271.81	1272.91	C	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	recognition that may not be the same thing but at they to both 
Bro014.B.dialogueact613	1273.43	1274.21	B	Professor	s^m^na	-1	0	you should do both and and i i think right 
Bro014.C.dialogueact612	1273.11	1273.53	C	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	you should do both right 
Bro014.B.dialogueact614	1274.21	1277.79	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and and i i think that the still makes i still think it's makes sense as a baseline 
Bro014.B.dialogueact615	1278.58	1280.45	B	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	is just thing as a baseline we know that 
Bro014.A.dialogueact616	1279.2	1280.15	A	PhD	b	-1	0	as a baseline we know that 
Bro014.B.dialogueact617	1281.05	1282.69	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	we had the other cici's before lots of people 
Bro014.B.dialogueact618	1282.69	1284.87	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	before lots of people don't voice activity detectors 
Bro014.A.dialogueact619	1285.13	1285.5	A	PhD	b	-1	0	you might 
Bro014.B.dialogueact620	1285.77	1288.78	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you might go pick some voice activity detector make that the baseline just like 
Bro014.B.dialogueact621	1288.78	1291.84	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that the baseline just like you pick some person at least became k. made that the baseline 
Bro014.A.dialogueact622	1291.73	1291.95	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	that the baseline 
Bro014.A.dialogueact623	1292.66	1292.93	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and then 
Bro014.B.dialogueact624	1292.73	1295.09	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then let's try make everything better 
Bro014.B.dialogueact625	1295.68	1296.24	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.B.dialogueact626	1297.39	1304.19	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and if one of the ways you make it better is by having your teachers better features of the eight days and that's so be it but uh 
Bro014.A.dialogueact628	1304.28	1304.75	A	PhD	b	-1	0	it but uh 
Bro014.B.dialogueact627	1304.19	1304.34	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	it but uh 
Bro014.B.dialogueact629	1304.95	1307.33	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it but uh at least you have a starting point it's 
Bro014.B.dialogueact630	1308.23	1308.7	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um because 
Bro014.B.dialogueact631	1308.93	1312.36	B	Professor	s^bu^df	-1	0	um because if some of the some of the people didn't to have the idea at all i guess right and 
Bro014.B.dialogueact632	1312.36	1312.7	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	guess right and 
Bro014.B.dialogueact633	1312.69	1313.31	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	guess right and and and 
Bro014.A.dialogueact634	1313.78	1313.94	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and and 
Bro014.B.dialogueact635	1313.89	1315.2	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and and they they look pretty bad and and 
Bro014.B.dialogueact636	1315.2	1317.83	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and and in fact what they're doing wasn't so bad at all but 
Bro014.A.dialogueact637	1315.72	1316.07	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and and in fact what they're doing wasn't 
Bro014.A.dialogueact639	1318.08	1318.42	A	PhD	b	-1	0	it seems 
Bro014.B.dialogueact638	1317.83	1318.04	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so bad at all but it seems 
Bro014.B.dialogueact641	1318.7	1319.1	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	it seems like you should 
Bro014.C.dialogueact640	1318.67	1322.39	C	PhD	fg|s^cs	-1	0	it seems like you should try to make your baseline is good as possible and if 
Bro014.C.dialogueact642	1322.82	1328.67	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	and if it turns out that you can't improve on that wall i mean it you know nobody wins they just use in f. c. c. right 
Bro014.C.dialogueact643	1328.77	1329.05	C	PhD	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	yeah i mean f. c. c. right 
Bro014.B.dialogueact644	1329.69	1329.87	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah i mean 
Bro014.B.dialogueact645	1329.87	1330.52	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah i mean it seems like 
Bro014.B.dialogueact646	1331.21	1331.69	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bro014.B.dialogueact647	1332.67	1337.99	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it should include sort of the current state of the art that you want to try and improve and 
Bro014.B.dialogueact648	1337.99	1344.18	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	to try and improve and i'm at cici's you know kill guilty or something it seems like reasonable baseline for the teachers and anybody doing 
Bro014.B.dialogueact649	1344.18	1349.95	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	and anybody doing this task it's going to have some sort of voice activity action at some level someway they 
Bro014.B.dialogueact650	1349.95	1354.15	B	Professor	s	-1	0	level someway they might use the whole recognize to do it but rather separate thing but but 
Bro014.B.dialogueact651	1354.15	1356.48	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but but don't have it on some level so 
Bro014.B.dialogueact652	1356.64	1356.92	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	level so 
Bro014.B.dialogueact653	1358.22	1359.35	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	seems like whatever they choose 
Bro014.C.dialogueact654	1359.08	1367.16	C	PhD	s	-1	0	well i seems like whatever they choose they shouldn't you know purposely brain damage a part of the system to make a worse baseline or you know 
Bro014.C.dialogueact655	1367.16	1367.43	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	well i or you know 
Bro014.B.dialogueact657	1367.7	1368.82	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	well i think people just said it wasn't or you know 
Bro014.C.dialogueact656	1367.58	1368.03	C	PhD	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	well i think people just said it wasn't or you know 
Bro014.B.dialogueact658	1368.82	1370.42	B	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	think people just said it wasn't that they purposely brain damage i think people hadn't 
Bro014.B.dialogueact659	1370.42	1374.81	B	Professor	s^df^nd	-1	0	damage i think people hadn't really thought through about the uh to be idiots 
Bro014.C.dialogueact660	1374.98	1375.54	C	PhD	b	-1	0	be idiots 
Bro014.A.dialogueact661	1376.78	1377.43	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and and then when that uh 
Bro014.B.dialogueact662	1376.81	1382.18	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and and then when that uh the proposals actually came and half of them had p. h. d.'s and have them didn't nafta did that 
Bro014.B.dialogueact663	1382.18	1383.52	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	nafta did that were around 
Bro014.B.dialogueact664	1383.52	1385.45	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	were around have to didn't it poorly so 
Bro014.C.dialogueact665	1383.74	1384.28	C	PhD	b	-1	0	were around have to didn't it 
Bro014.B.dialogueact666	1385.45	1386.09	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	poorly so 
Bro014.A.dialogueact667	1386.06	1386.73	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.A.dialogueact668	1390.44	1391.81	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	um 
Bro014.B.dialogueact669	1390.72	1391.06	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro014.A.dialogueact670	1392.68	1392.96	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	yeah so 
Bro014.A.dialogueact671	1392.96	1393.44	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	yeah so we she what happened 
Bro014.A.dialogueact672	1393.44	1394.65	A	PhD	s^co^tc	-1	0	we she what happened with this 
Bro014.A.dialogueact673	1396.68	1397.71	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.A.dialogueact674	1400.04	1400.26	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so what i've since 
Bro014.A.dialogueact675	1400.26	1404.12	A	PhD	s.%--	+1	3	so what i've since um last week is well 
Bro014.A.dialogueact676	1405.02	1409.85	A	PhD	s^rt	+1	2	i'm from what judges ideas experiment some things you beyond uh baseline 
Bro014.A.dialogueact677	1411.29	1418.22	A	PhD	s	+1	1	and these experimental so are using uh some kind of nice compensation so spectra subtraction 
Bro014.A.dialogueact678	1418.22	1419.36	A	PhD	s	+1	1	so spectra subtraction 
Bro014.A.dialogueact679	1420.43	1425.59	A	PhD	s	+1	1	and the thing on nine on my education uh just after they so 
Bro014.A.dialogueact680	1426.01	1429.66	A	PhD	s	+1	1	i think specter subtraction and gets you ring and online on my which is 
Bro014.A.dialogueact681	1429.66	1435.85	A	PhD	s^e	+1	1	on my which is should be darko point propose i won but with the construction addition 
Bro014.A.dialogueact682	1436.38	1441.56	A	PhD	s	+1	1	and it seems that the minimize on and and disorder when you inspector subtraction 
Bro014.C.dialogueact683	1444.17	1449.23	C	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	i is this related to the issue that you brought up a couple of meetings ago with uh the musical tones in 
Bro014.A.dialogueact684	1448.11	1448.33	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	musical tones 
Bro014.C.dialogueact685	1449.23	1449.44	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	i in 
Bro014.A.dialogueact686	1449.98	1450.68	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	i have no idea because in 
Bro014.A.dialogueact687	1450.68	1455.55	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	have no idea because of the sharper that west with a very simple speakers traction approach 
Bro014.C.dialogueact688	1454.77	1455.09	C	PhD	b	-1	0	traction approach 
Bro014.A.dialogueact689	1456.55	1464.7	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	and the one that they use it which i use one from from the proposed that that or upper uh proposals 
Bro014.A.dialogueact690	1465.32	1467.15	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which might be much better 
Bro014.A.dialogueact691	1468.26	1468.71	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so yeah i 
Bro014.A.dialogueact692	1468.81	1471.59	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so yeah i asked somebody for more information about that 
Bro014.A.dialogueact693	1472.76	1473.45	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	but uh 
Bro014.A.dialogueact694	1474.09	1474.72	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	i don't know it 
Bro014.A.dialogueact695	1476.04	1477.03	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.A.dialogueact696	1479.1	1481.05	A	PhD	s.%--	+1	2	and what happened here is that to be so we have this kind of 
Bro014.A.dialogueact697	1481.05	1490.29	A	PhD	s^rt	+1	2	so we have this kind of new uh restaurants just them which use uh nice a clean don't think of sampling we 
Bro014.A.dialogueact698	1490.92	1494.51	A	PhD	s^e	+1	2	we choose a new who filter that's not short term 
Bro014.A.dialogueact699	1495.09	1499.18	A	PhD	s^e	+1	2	and which also got the frequency of sixty fours which trusted 
Bro014.B.dialogueact700	1495.52	1495.68	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and which also 
Bro014.A.dialogueact701	1499.57	1502.4	A	PhD	s^e^rt	-1	0	which trusted um um our first proposal we should we have 
Bro014.B.dialogueact702	1502.53	1504.92	B	Professor	qy^bu^rt	+1	2	we should we have that this don't have it now too where 
Bro014.A.dialogueact703	1503.98	1504.15	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	that this don't have it now too where 
Bro014.A.dialogueact705	1505.38	1505.57	A	PhD	s^ar	+1	2	no no 
Bro014.B.dialogueact704	1504.92	1505.11	B	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	no no have it now too where 
Bro014.A.dialogueact706	1505.99	1506.18	A	PhD	s^ar^r	-1	0	no no because 
Bro014.B.dialogueact707	1506.13	1506.48	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	because 
Bro014.A.dialogueact708	1506.82	1507.93	A	PhD	s^df^rt	+1	2	because we're still testing so 
Bro014.A.dialogueact709	1507.93	1513.04	A	PhD	s	-1	0	we're still testing so we have the results forum uh just teachers we are 
Bro014.B.dialogueact710	1508.37	1508.6	B	Professor	b	-1	0	we have the results 
Bro014.A.dialogueact711	1513.77	1517.87	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	we are currently testing weight lifting when you're on your towards indicated t. 
Bro014.A.dialogueact712	1519.4	1522.97	A	PhD	fh|s^rt	+1	2	um it seems to improve on the web much gays 
Bro014.A.dialogueact713	1524.79	1530.85	A	PhD	fh|s^rt	+1	2	um but it's edited but worse on the mismatch and id me smashed 
Bro014.A.dialogueact714	1531.74	1533.22	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	i mean when we put the new around at work and we'd 
Bro014.A.dialogueact715	1533.8	1537.62	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and we'd occurrence way think i think it's such it's would be better 
Bro014.A.dialogueact716	1538.03	1539.69	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because doing much skating better 
Bro014.A.dialogueact717	1541.11	1541.76	A	PhD	b	-1	0	but 
Bro014.B.dialogueact718	1541.94	1544.1	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	but how much worse since the waiting might change how how much worse is 
Bro014.B.dialogueact719	1544.1	1546.61	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	how how much worse is it on the other conditions it's it's 
Bro014.B.dialogueact720	1546.61	1547.83	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	it's it's a of worse 
Bro014.A.dialogueact721	1548.47	1556.43	A	PhD	s	-1	0	it's like uh ten percent remedy

Bro014.B.dialogueact883	1870.86	1871.39	B	Professor	b	-1	0	for the consent ends and then they 
Bro014.A.dialogueact884	1875.77	1877.52	A	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	yeah so there's there's days there 
Bro014.A.dialogueact885	1877.7	1884.0	A	PhD	s	-1	0	days there could be also the um something like the mexican almost to correlation function though is 
Bro014.A.dialogueact886	1884.0	1884.24	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	is 
Bro014.A.dialogueact888	1885.31	1885.52	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	this uh this 
Bro014.C.dialogueact887	1884.97	1887.17	C	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	is this uh this a train system or is it the 
Bro014.C.dialogueact889	1887.49	1889.81	C	PhD	qrr	-1	0	or is it the somewhere you just pick some threshold 
Bro014.C.dialogueact890	1889.81	1891.07	C	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	right now we just threshold how does it work 
Bro014.A.dialogueact891	1891.38	1894.18	A	PhD	s	+1	1	right now we just trying to find some features and 
Bro014.A.dialogueact893	1894.81	1895.27	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and 
Bro014.C.dialogueact892	1894.4	1894.71	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and 
Bro014.A.dialogueact894	1896.27	1897.66	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh yeah hopefully 
Bro014.A.dialogueact895	1897.7	1904.02	A	PhD	s^bk|s.%--	+1	1	yeah hopefully i think what we wanted to to ivy's to put these teachers in kind of 
Bro014.A.dialogueact896	1905.57	1906.2	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	um west too 
Bro014.A.dialogueact897	1906.2	1909.23	A	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	west too took things that you can mother owns teachers largest just 
Bro014.A.dialogueact898	1909.23	1911.2	A	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	largest just using your on the work and 
Bro014.A.dialogueact899	1911.9	1914.49	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and hopefully these teachers without because 
Bro014.C.dialogueact900	1914.78	1921.6	C	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	well you because it seems like what you said about the meaning of the the voice and the and voiced that seemed pretty encouraging right 
Bro014.A.dialogueact901	1918.22	1918.51	A	PhD	b	-1	0	the voice 
Bro014.B.dialogueact902	1921.78	1923.18	B	Professor	s^aa|s^arp	-1	0	except the various just great well you exit the variance inspector encouraging right well 
Bro014.C.dialogueact903	1921.85	1922.14	C	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	except well you exit the variance inspector encouraging right 
Bro014.A.dialogueact904	1922.37	1922.52	A	PhD	b	-1	0	except exit the variance inspector 
Bro014.A.dialogueact905	1923.0	1924.43	A	PhD	s^ba^m	-1	0	the various just great mean well like i don't know 
Bro014.B.dialogueact906	1923.18	1923.46	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	the various just great well 
Bro014.C.dialogueact907	1923.74	1924.07	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	the various just great mean well like i don't know 
Bro014.A.dialogueact909	1924.43	1924.56	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	mean like i don't know 
Bro014.C.dialogueact908	1924.23	1926.07	C	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	mean like i don't know that i would trust that so much because you're doing these kind 
Bro014.C.dialogueact910	1926.07	1928.77	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because you're doing these kind of an uncle mapping from timid labeling is right 
Bro014.A.dialogueact912	1928.93	1929.2	A	PhD	b	-1	0	labeling is right so 
Bro014.C.dialogueact911	1928.77	1929.1	C	PhD	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	labeling is right so 
Bro014.C.dialogueact913	1929.1	1929.45	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro014.C.dialogueact914	1930.32	1933.89	C	PhD	s^df	+1	2	really that's sort of a cartoon picture about what's and a boy say 
Bro014.C.dialogueact915	1933.89	1935.91	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and a boy say that could be giving you a lot of variants 
Bro014.A.dialogueact917	1936.53	1936.78	A	PhD	b	-1	0	i mean 
Bro014.C.dialogueact916	1936.52	1936.84	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	i mean 
Bro014.C.dialogueact918	1937.95	1940.67	C	PhD	s	-1	0	it it may be that that you're finding something good and that the variance 
Bro014.C.dialogueact919	1940.67	1944.12	C	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah something good and that the variance is sort of artificial because of how you're getting your truth 
Bro014.A.dialogueact920	1944.6	1944.94	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bro014.B.dialogueact921	1945.06	1945.3	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	but another way 
Bro014.B.dialogueact922	1945.42	1947.85	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but another way of looking at might be that i mean 
Bro014.B.dialogueact923	1947.97	1950.65	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	might be that i mean what where we are coming with feature sets after all 
Bro014.B.dialogueact924	1951.24	1961.52	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it's another way of looking at is that um the mail caps or no spectrum l. catch term any of these variance um give you this food spectrum suspect 
Bro014.B.dialogueact925	1961.52	1962.7	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	suspect trauma blocked 
Bro014.B.dialogueact926	1963.25	1969.95	B	Professor	s	-1	0	by going back to the s. f. t. you're getting something that is more like the raw data 
Bro014.B.dialogueact927	1970.67	1973.62	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so the question is what characterization and you're playing 
Bro014.B.dialogueact928	1973.62	1974.79	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and you're playing around with this another way 
Bro014.B.dialogueact929	1974.8	1986.23	B	Professor	qw	+1	2	around with this another way of looking is what characterization of the difference between the raw data and this smooth version is something that you're missing that could help 
Bro014.B.dialogueact930	1987.2	1990.63	B	Professor	s	+1	2	so i mean looking at different statistical measures of that difference coming 
Bro014.B.dialogueact931	1991.03	1993.23	B	Professor	s	-1	0	of some things and just try him out and saying if you have them 
Bro014.B.dialogueact932	1993.23	1997.13	B	Professor	s	+1	2	and saying if you have them on to the future actors that make things better or worse annoys where you really 
Bro014.B.dialogueact933	1997.75	1998.8	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	where you really just it the way i'm 
Bro014.B.dialogueact934	1998.8	2004.31	B	Professor	s	+1	2	just it the way i'm looking at is not so much trying to find the best world's best voice tone voiced uh across the fire but it's more that 
Bro014.C.dialogueact935	2003.44	2003.9	C	PhD	b	-1	0	uh across the fire 
Bro014.A.dialogueact936	2004.17	2006.81	A	PhD	b	-1	0	but it's more that you know uh try some 
Bro014.B.dialogueact937	2004.31	2010.08	B	Professor	s	+1	2	but it's more that you know uh try some different statistical characterization so that difference back to the raw data and and 
Bro014.C.dialogueact938	2008.07	2008.49	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	so that difference 
Bro014.B.dialogueact939	2010.08	2010.69	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and and 
Bro014.B.dialogueact941	2011.16	2013.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	maybe there's something that system can use 
Bro014.C.dialogueact940	2011.04	2011.43	C	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	maybe there's something that 
Bro014.A.dialogueact942	2013.85	2014.07	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	can use 
Bro014.A.dialogueact943	2015.33	2016.65	A	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	yeah but they're more excuses that yeah 
Bro014.A.dialogueact944	2016.86	2017.01	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	excuses that yeah the more 
Bro014.A.dialogueact945	2017.57	2020.01	A	PhD	s^r.%--	-1	0	the more you see that by 
Bro014.A.dialogueact946	2020.56	2031.0	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	by using the the the fifty um you just guess you just information about if it's barstow so not always it's mainly i mean so 
Bro014.A.dialogueact947	2031.24	2031.82	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro014.B.dialogueact948	2031.61	2031.86	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	so 
Bro014.A.dialogueact949	2034.01	2040.04	A	PhD	s	-1	0	just why we we stopped it took by having set of voice phoniness and well that's true what arguing is that yeah i mean what i'm arguing is that 
Bro014.B.dialogueact950	2036.28	2036.9	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	by having well that's true 
Bro014.B.dialogueact951	2036.9	2038.19	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	by having set of voice well that's true what arguing is that 
Bro014.B.dialogueact952	2039.33	2039.53	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	phoniness yeah i mean 
Bro014.B.dialogueact953	2039.53	2043.41	B	Professor	s	-1	0	phoniness and yeah i mean what i'm arguing is that that that's give you gives you your intuition 
Bro014.A.dialogueact954	2040.04	2040.31	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and what i'm arguing is that 
Bro014.A.dialogueact955	2044.31	2044.68	A	PhD	b	-1	0	but in in 
Bro014.B.dialogueact956	2044.4	2048.8	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but in in reality it's you know there's all this this overlap and so forth 
Bro014.E.dialogueact957	2048.71	2049.13	E	Grad	s^fa^t3	-1	0	and so forth and but 
Bro014.B.dialogueact958	2049.29	2051.72	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and but what i'm saying is that maybe okay 
Bro014.B.dialogueact959	2052.34	2055.46	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because what you're really getting is not actually voice her son force both for the 
Bro014.B.dialogueact960	2055.46	2060.2	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	force both for the uh the reason they're overlap and and then you know structural reasons uh 
Bro014.B.dialogueact961	2060.86	2062.39	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	uh like on the trucks that that 
Bro014.B.dialogueact962	2062.81	2066.58	B	Professor	s^e	+1	2	that that that in fact well the data itself is she working with is not perfect so 
Bro014.A.dialogueact963	2064.08	2064.32	A	PhD	b	-1	0	itself is 
Bro014.A.dialogueact964	2064.9	2065.05	A	PhD	b	-1	0	itself is she working with is not 
Bro014.B.dialogueact965	2066.58	2069.44	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	2	perfect so i'm saying is maybe that's not a killer because 
Bro014.B.dialogueact966	2069.61	2072.27	B	Professor	s^df	+1	2	because you're just getting some characterization when this driven by your 
Bro014.B.dialogueact967	2072.27	2075.1	B	Professor	s^e	+1	2	when this driven by your intuition about forcing voice certainly there's just some characterization 
Bro014.A.dialogueact968	2073.96	2075.26	A	PhD	b	-1	0	intuition about forcing voice certainly there's just some characterization 
Bro014.B.dialogueact969	2075.34	2082.97	B	Professor	s	-1	0	there's just some characterization something back in the in the in the almost raw data rather than the smooth version 
Bro014.A.dialogueact970	2082.06	2082.62	A	PhD	b	-1	0	the smooth version 
Bro014.B.dialogueact971	2083.43	2094.55	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and your intuition is driving you towards particular kinds of uh statistical characterization of um what's missing from the specter on bought 
Bro014.A.dialogueact972	2094.77	2095.22	A	PhD	b	-1	0	on bought um 
Bro014.B.dialogueact973	2095.3	2097.95	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um obviously if something about the expectation 
Bro014.B.dialogueact974	2098.5	2098.9	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.B.dialogueact975	2099.92	2101.56	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and what is it about the expectation 
Bro014.B.dialogueact976	2102.31	2104.74	B	Professor	s	+1	2	and yet you and you're not getting the expectation anyway you know so 
Bro014.B.dialogueact977	2104.8	2105.01	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	anyway you know so so i 
Bro014.B.dialogueact978	2105.61	2107.52	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so i would almost take uh 
Bro014.B.dialogueact979	2108.47	2118.2	B	Professor	fh|s^cs^r	-1	0	uh especially if these trainings and so forth it faster and almost just take a uh scatter shot at a few different ways of look of characterizing that difference and uh 
Bro014.B.dialogueact980	2118.45	2121.77	B	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	and uh you know one of them but and and see you which is them helps 
Bro014.A.dialogueact981	2121.95	2122.54	A	PhD	b	-1	0	is them helps so is 
Bro014.A.dialogueact983	2123.02	2123.11	A	PhD	b	-1	0	the idea that you're going 
Bro014.C.dialogueact982	2122.59	2128.43	C	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	so is the idea that you're going to take whatever features you develop and and just have them on to the future victor or 
Bro014.C.dialogueact984	2129.02	2132.12	C	PhD	qw	-1	0	what's the use of the the voice and voice detector 
Bro014.A.dialogueact985	2133.56	2135.6	A	PhD	h|s^no	-1	0	uh i guess we don't know exactly yeah but

Bro014.B.dialogueact1007	2172.81	2181.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so it's kind of like you're just multiplying together these um probably some individual teachers within each mixture so it's

Bro014.A.dialogueact1080	2314.54	2317.5	A	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	both um it seems that an addictive and 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1081	2318.2	2326.39	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	well some voice sound kind and also um like know no easy talk on high frequency 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1082	2326.39	2326.58	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.A.dialogueact1084	2328.06	2328.22	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	but uh it's no it's make sense to look 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1083	2327.62	2327.77	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1086	2328.46	2329.28	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but uh it's just no it's make sense to look at frequencies so this is 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1085	2328.16	2330.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but uh it's just no it's make sense to look at frequencies so this is basically 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1087	2329.31	2336.08	C	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	just at frequencies right so it's only so this is basically this is comparing an original version of the signal to a smooth diversion of the same signal yeah 
Bro014.F.dialogueact1088	2335.33	2335.65	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	of the same signal yeah 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1089	2336.3	2336.51	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right so it's only 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1090	2336.51	2338.5	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	right so it's only it this is i mean 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1091	2338.72	2343.24	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	i mean you could argue about whether she enter place interplay center or r.'s or if order but but 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1092	2343.24	2343.85	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but but 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1093	2343.68	2344.01	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	but but any rate something 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1094	2344.22	2348.74	B	Professor	s	-1	0	any rate something like this is what you're feeding your recognize are typically like 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1095	2348.97	2349.95	C	PhD	qw^d.%--	-1	0	typically no like which 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1096	2349.82	2350.11	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	no it seldom know caps term which 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1097	2350.11	2355.9	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so this is yeah it seldom know caps term is is is the caps term of this the suspect rumor like spectrum whatever yeah 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1098	2351.15	2351.87	A	PhD	s^t3.%--	-1	0	so this is yeah is is is yeah 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1099	2351.87	2352.1	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so this is yeah is is is the caps term of yeah 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1100	2352.02	2352.25	C	PhD	b	-1	0	the caps term of 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1101	2355.14	2355.57	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	rumor like spectrum whatever 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1102	2355.9	2356.23	B	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	rumor like spectrum whatever you use attracting 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1103	2356.23	2359.83	B	Professor	qr	-1	0	you know you use attracting in in in part i mean a lot to me 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1104	2359.69	2360.36	A	PhD	s	-1	0	you know a lot to me loved him 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1106	2360.4	2360.49	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	loved him 
Bro014.F.dialogueact1105	2360.23	2360.88	F	PhD	s	-1	0	loved him 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1107	2361.1	2361.37	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay so like division 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1108	2361.37	2364.36	B	Professor	s	-1	0	okay so like division thing you do that yeah the spectre the ratio 
Bro014.F.dialogueact1109	2363.12	2363.39	F	PhD	b	-1	0	you do that yeah the spectre 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1110	2363.86	2364.79	A	PhD	b	-1	0	you do that yeah the spectre the ratio 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1111	2364.56	2365.35	C	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	um the ratio 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1112	2365.41	2365.97	B	Professor	h	-1	0	um 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1113	2366.98	2367.28	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	but anyway 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1114	2367.76	2368.63	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	but anyway um 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1115	2368.71	2369.36	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	um 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1116	2370.96	2371.65	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	that's so what's 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1117	2371.7	2374.81	C	PhD	qw	-1	0	that's so what's it what's the intuition behind this kind of a thing i i 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1118	2374.81	2379.05	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	so kind of a thing i i don't really know the signal processing well enough to understand what what is that doing 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1119	2378.1	2378.51	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	so what is that doing 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1120	2380.27	2380.47	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah what i've yeah i guess 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1123	2380.81	2387.71	A	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah what i've been said what we honest if what you would like to read is sums like from a expectation single yeah i guess that makes sense 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1121	2380.64	2380.73	B	Professor	s^aa^t3	-1	0	yeah what i've yeah i guess 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1122	2380.73	2381.62	B	Professor	s^na^t3	-1	0	yeah what i've been said what yeah i guess that makes sense 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1124	2381.62	2381.77	B	Professor	s^aa^t3	-1	0	been said what that makes sense 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1125	2388.16	2390.09	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which is for for selling yeah the the post rain 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1126	2390.09	2391.24	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	the post rain uhhuh 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1127	2391.79	2392.18	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	uhhuh 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1128	2393.02	2395.65	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and for on the hardest it's something that's more that uhhuh 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1129	2395.78	2396.15	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	more that uhhuh right 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1130	2396.43	2396.69	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	right 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1131	2397.23	2399.07	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and the way to do days is that but we have to have 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1132	2399.07	2402.65	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but we have to have a fifty because it's computing and consistent and we have 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1133	2402.65	2405.75	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	and we have the man your bags 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1134	2402.71	2403.01	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and we have the man 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1135	2405.79	2406.3	C	PhD	b	-1	0	bags and so 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1136	2406.76	2417.23	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and so if we if we like remove the a bank from the fifty we have something that's close to the expectation thing 
Bro014.E.dialogueact1137	2417.83	2418.22	E	Grad	x	-1	0	okay 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1139	2419.12	2423.98	A	PhD	s^e^rt	-1	0	it's something that's like a train of thought oppose trained for voice on and oh okay yeah 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1138	2418.76	2419.35	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	it's something that's like okay

Bro014.B.dialogueact1228	2496.76	2507.33	B	Professor	s	-1	0	they should be more close yeah so they uh they there's a difference what the filters are the filters roughly act like uh um a in overalls resonance have some residences and so forth that that that processing expectation so if i know went through these 
Bro014.F.dialogueact1229	2496.82	2497.06	F	PhD	s^na^t3	-1	0	what the filters are the filters roughly 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1230	2498.47	2499.55	A	PhD	s^t3	-1	0	they should be more close act like uh um i 
Bro014.F.dialogueact1231	2500.01	2500.31	F	PhD	s^ar^t3	-1	0	a know 
Bro014.F.dialogueact1232	2500.31	2500.98	F	PhD	s^rt^t3	-1	0	a know

Bro014.C.dialogueact1235	2504.59	2505.13	C	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah so they and so forth that that that 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1237	2505.61	2505.81	A	PhD	s^bk^t3	-1	0	yeah so they that 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1236	2505.12	2505.39	C	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah so they that 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1238	2505.81	2506.43	A	PhD	s^t3.%--	-1	0	yeah so they uh they there's that processing expectation 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1239	2506.43	2507.73	A	PhD	s^t3	-1	0	uh they there's a difference processing expectation so if 
Bro014.F.dialogueact1240	2506.56	2506.99	F	PhD	b	-1	0	uh they there's processing expectation 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1241	2507.76	2513.06	B	Professor	s	-1	0	a difference there's just this world is so if you look at the specter on the love just the very smooth properties of it you get something closer to that and then is it was yeah 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1242	2508.41	2509.91	A	PhD	s^t3	-1	0	there's just this world is you look at the specter on the love just the very 
Bro014.F.dialogueact1243	2510.24	2510.86	F	PhD	s^m^na^t3	-1	0	smooth properties it was yeah 
Bro014.F.dialogueact1244	2510.93	2511.19	F	PhD	s^aa^t3	-1	0	smooth properties of it you get something it was yeah 
Bro014.A.dialogueact1245	2513.41	2513.84	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and then is 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1246	2513.56	2519.87	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then is if you have the full spectrum at all the little nitty gritty details that that has the affect of both and 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1247	2516.88	2517.22	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	details that that 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1249	2519.87	2523.64	B	Professor	s	-1	0	of both and it would be a multiplication in in frequency domain so that would be 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1248	2519.8	2520.27	C	PhD	b	-1	0	of both and it would be a multiplication 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1250	2523.64	2527.89	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	domain so that would be like in addition in bog respect and i 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1251	2526.68	2527.0	C	PhD	b	-1	0	respect and i 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1252	2527.39	2527.67	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and i 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1253	2528.49	2536.24	B	Professor	s	+1	2	and so this is saying well if you really do have that similar vocal track i'm hoping and you should check that off which gives us the expectation i call that 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1254	2536.55	2538.74	B	Professor	s	+1	2	i call that lies because you don't really have that you just 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1255	2538.74	2543.18	B	Professor	s^df	+1	0	have that you just have some kind of signal processing trickery to get something that's kind of smooth it's not really 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1256	2543.61	2545.39	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	it's not really what's happening the vocal tracks you're not really yeah right 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1257	2544.88	2545.26	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	what's happening the vocal tracks you're not really yeah right 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1258	2545.39	2547.49	B	Professor	s^df	+1	2	tracks you're not really getting vocal expectation that's right 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1259	2545.46	2545.9	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	tracks you're not really right 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1260	2547.96	2554.48	B	Professor	s^df	+1	2	that's why i was going to the i was referring to it in a more more um conservative way of saying well 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1261	2554.48	2555.54	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	2	way of saying well if it 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1262	2555.54	2555.68	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	if it 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1263	2555.88	2556.48	B	Professor	s	+1	2	if it expectation is that really really 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1264	2556.48	2557.64	B	Professor	s	+1	2	expectation is that really really expectation it's whatever 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1265	2557.64	2559.61	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	expectation it's whatever it is it's different between uh 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1266	2559.52	2559.86	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	between uh 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1268	2560.25	2561.17	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so so say to say back from that you sort this in there yeah 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1267	2560.25	2564.13	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so so say to say back from that you sort of say there's this very detailed representation you go to a smooth this in there yeah 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1269	2561.17	2561.55	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	say back from that you sort there yeah 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1271	2564.52	2566.11	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you go to a smooth representation you go to smooth 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1270	2564.26	2564.77	C	PhD	b	-1	0	you go to a smooth 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1272	2566.51	2569.53	B	Professor	s^df^r	-1	0	you go to smooth representation because it's typically generalize better 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1273	2569.57	2570.15	C	PhD	b	-1	0	better um but 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1274	2570.16	2570.58	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um but 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1275	2570.87	2572.75	B	Professor	s	-1	0	um but whenever you smooth he was something 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1276	2573.14	2575.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so the question is if you want something you can use 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1277	2575.51	2575.92	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	use 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1278	2576.19	2581.36	B	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	um probably wouldn't want to go to the extreme of just a saying okay our future set will be a fifty because i 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1279	2581.8	2585.4	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because i really think we do gain something in the is from going to something smoother maybe 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1281	2585.78	2587.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	maybe or something when asked so what is 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1280	2585.6	2585.94	C	PhD	b	-1	0	maybe 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1283	2587.63	2588.37	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	so what is it and then you 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1282	2587.36	2587.69	C	PhD	b	-1	0	so what is 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1284	2588.37	2590.21	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it and then you go back to the intuition that well you don't really get 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1285	2590.21	2591.76	B	Professor	s	+1	2	that well you don't really get the expectation but you 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1286	2591.76	2593.08	B	Professor	s	+1	2	the expectation but you get something related to it and 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1287	2592.89	2593.27	C	PhD	b	-1	0	get something related to it and 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1289	2593.8	2599.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and and as you can see from those pictures you do get something that show's period a city uh in frequency you know 
Bro014.C.dialogueact1288	2593.5	2593.8	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1291	2599.76	2600.12	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	you know and and you know sometimes 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1292	2600.12	2601.26	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and and you know sometimes so that's that's

Bro014.B.dialogueact1293	2601.26	2601.5	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so that's that's

Bro014.B.dialogueact1500	2948.84	2949.38	B	Professor	qy^d.%--	-1	0	think uh 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1502	2951.05	2951.44	B	Professor	qy^d	-1	0	no not not much is 
Bro014.D.dialogueact1501	2950.78	2952.4	D	Grad	h|s^nd	+1	2	um no not not much is new so when i talked 
Bro014.D.dialogueact1503	2952.4	2969.89	D	Grad	s	+1	1	new so when i talked about what i'm trying to do last time i said i was um going to use i've been down a method of um using a transformation um to map from long analysis frames which i use for removing reverberations a short analysis frames for feature calculation and 
Bro014.D.dialogueact1504	2970.52	2975.03	D	Grad	s	-1	0	he has a trick for doing that involving viewing the d. s. t. as the matrix um 
Bro014.D.dialogueact1505	2975.63	2976.1	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro014.D.dialogueact1506	2976.91	2981.02	D	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	but and i i um i decided not to do that after i because 
Bro014.D.dialogueact1507	2981.02	2990.3	D	Grad	s^df	+1	1	i realized to use that i need to have these short analysis frames get plugged directly to the feature computations somehow and right now i think our 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1508	2990.1	2990.79	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and right now i think our 
Bro014.D.dialogueact1509	2990.3	2997.16	D	Grad	s^df	+1	1	and right now i think our future computations set up to um take um audio audio is but in general so i 
Bro014.D.dialogueact1510	2997.61	3002.24	D	Grad	s^cc	+1	1	so i decided that i i'll do the river ration removal and long analysis windows in industry since 
Bro014.D.dialogueact1511	3002.24	3003.91	D	Grad	s^cc	+1	1	in industry since the size audio 
Bro014.D.dialogueact1512	3003.91	3005.08	D	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	this the size audio and then send that 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1513	3005.98	3008.82	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	this is in order to use the surround system um 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1515	3009.13	3009.27	B	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.D.dialogueact1514	3009.0	3009.46	D	Grad	h	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro014.D.dialogueact1516	3010.28	3010.65	D	Grad	%--	-1	0	or 
Bro014.D.dialogueact1517	3011.73	3016.59	D	Grad	s^arp	-1	0	or even if i'm using our system i was thinking it might be easier to just recent the audio 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1518	3013.76	3014.03	B	Professor	qy^bh^rt	-1	0	i was thinking it might be easier to 
Bro014.D.dialogueact1519	3017.13	3019.4	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because then i could just you see calc as as i wouldn't have to change 
Bro014.D.dialogueact1520	3019.4	3020.81	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	as i wouldn't have to change the code 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1521	3021.07	3021.46	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1522	3023.4	3023.69	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah i mean 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1523	3023.86	3024.74	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah i mean it's 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1524	3025.81	3026.3	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	certainly 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1525	3027.01	3029.93	B	Professor	s	-1	0	in short short term sounds easy

Bro014.B.dialogueact1527	3030.87	3031.13	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	i mean longer term if it's 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1528	3031.13	3036.69	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	i mean longer term if it's turns out to be useful yeah but right that's true 
Bro014.D.dialogueact1529	3035.66	3036.42	D	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	yeah but right that's true 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1530	3036.69	3036.88	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah but true 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1531	3037.94	3045.19	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh i mean in knows you you maybe putting other kinds of errors in from the synthesis process some recent this is um 
Bro014.D.dialogueact1532	3037.95	3039.12	D	Grad	fg	-1	0	uh i mean in knows you you maybe 
Bro014.D.dialogueact1533	3044.46	3045.59	D	Grad	s^2	-1	0	synthesis process some recent this is um 
Bro014.D.dialogueact1534	3045.59	3045.91	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	this is um 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1535	3046.16	3047.1	B	Professor	b	-1	0	okay i don't know anything about recent 
Bro014.D.dialogueact1536	3046.25	3046.83	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay i don't 
Bro014.D.dialogueact1537	3046.83	3048.71	D	Grad	s^no	-1	0	okay i don't know anything about recent this is a whole 
Bro014.D.dialogueact1538	3048.71	3050.31	D	Grad	qw	-1	0	this is a whole likely do you think that is 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1539	3051.37	3053.27	B	Professor	h|s	-1	0	uh it depends what you could do 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1540	3054.3	3056.56	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and it's it's it's uh

Bro014.B.dialogueact1542	3061.82	3062.11	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	don't know but i always sounds like reasonable 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1543	3062.19	3064.79	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	but i always sounds like reasonable way to go for for initial thing we can 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1544	3064.79	3067.62	B	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	initial thing we can look at at exactly what you end up doing and and 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1545	3067.62	3073.75	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	end up doing and and figure out if there's something that could be be hurt by and part of the process

Bro014.E.dialogueact1555	3085.62	3086.04	E	Grad	h	-1	0	well 
Bro014.E.dialogueact1556	3086.85	3089.09	E	Grad	s	+1	2	well i've been continuing reading i went off in a little 
Bro014.E.dialogueact1557	3089.09	3091.66	E	Grad	s	+1	2	i went off in a little tangent this past week um 
Bro014.E.dialogueact1558	3091.66	3092.15	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	week um looking 
Bro014.E.dialogueact1559	3092.76	3096.73	E	Grad	s^e	+1	1	looking at uh uh much relations spectrum stuff 
Bro014.E.dialogueact1560	3097.21	3097.89	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro014.E.dialogueact1561	3098.1	3102.46	E	Grad	s	+1	1	and and i'm learning a bit about what what um what it is and 
Bro014.E.dialogueact1562	3102.92	3105.71	E	Grad	s	-1	0	is and uh the importance of it in speech recognition and 
Bro014.E.dialogueact1563	3105.71	3115.73	E	Grad	s^rt	+1	1	recognition and i found some some uh the papers um historical papers for um um kind of their uh herman ski and right 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1564	3116.19	3116.46	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and they 
Bro014.E.dialogueact1565	3116.27	3125.76	E	Grad	s.%--	+1	1	and they they did a lot of experiments whereas where um they take speech and um they modify he uh they 
Bro014.E.dialogueact1566	3125.98	3133.3	E	Grad	s	+1	1	he uh they they they measure the relative importance of having different um portions of uh much relation spectrum intact and 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1568	3133.91	3134.22	B	Professor	b	-1	0	and they find 
Bro014.E.dialogueact1567	3133.87	3143.35	E	Grad	s^rt	+1	1	sir and they find that the the spectrum between one and sixteen hurts in the much relation is uh is an important for speech recognition 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1570	3144.01	3144.3	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	i mean it sort of goes 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1571	3144.3	3146.81	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean it sort of goes back to the earlier stuff my drama and 
Bro014.E.dialogueact1569	3143.84	3144.36	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	sir i mean it sort of goes 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1573	3147.46	3152.37	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and and uh the the m. s. g. features we're sort of built up this notion but i guess 
Bro014.E.dialogueact1572	3147.04	3147.38	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	and 
Bro014.E.dialogueact1574	3150.43	3150.61	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	we're sort of built 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1575	3152.59	3157.8	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	but i guess i thought you would brought this up in the context of um target somehow right 
Bro014.E.dialogueact1576	3157.92	3158.68	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	somehow but it right um 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1577	3158.63	3159.16	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but it it it's not um 
Bro014.E.dialogueact1578	3158.68	3159.29	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	but it it it's not um 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1579	3159.29	3164.38	B	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	it it's not i mean they're sort of not in the same kind of category say fanatic target or so a car or um 
Bro014.E.dialogueact1580	3159.94	3160.08	E	Grad	b	-1	0	it it's not i mean they're sort of not in 
Bro014.E.dialogueact1581	3162.24	3162.55	E	Grad	b	-1	0	say fanatic target 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1582	3164.38	3164.83	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	or um 
Bro014.E.dialogueact1583	3164.79	3171.07	E	Grad	fg|s^cs	+1	1	or or feature or something oh i see um i was thinking more like using them as has the inputs to to the detectors 
Bro014.B.dialogueact1584	3165.5	3166.99	B	Professor	s	-1	0	or feature or something i was thinking more like using them
