The tourist dialogue system group of ICSI met with the sole purpose of discussing one member's thesis proposal , and upcoming presentation.
Mn015 ran the group through the basic contents of his talk and proposal , and is looking for some feedback.
The group suggested subjects he might add to his talk , but some he was uncomfortable talking about.
There was one particular aspect , metaphor representation , that was considered important for addition.
Mn015 wanted a good example that highlighted the group's work , and the group discussed various possibilities.
Speaker fe004 has made some changes , and will mail mn015 with the revisions.
The group will give mn015 feedback electronically.
The group were unable to come up with a good example for use in mn015's upcoming talk.
