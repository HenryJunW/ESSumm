Buw001.A.dialogueact91	111.432	117.466	A	Professor	qh.%--	-1	0	So , I think the goal {disfmarker} the goal was what can we do {disfmarker} how can you do the data collection differently to get {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact92	111.741	112.231	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact93	118.175	123.992	A	Professor	qh	+1	0	what can you add to it to get , um , some information that would be helpful for the user - interface design ?

Buw001.H.dialogueact107	141.748	145.238	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So he has , um , these , uh , um , tsk {comment} note - taking things ,
Buw001.A.dialogueact109	145.739	146.199	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.H.dialogueact108	145.572	148.322	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	then that would sort of be a summary which you wouldn't have to solicit .
Buw001.H.dialogueact110	148.82	151.608	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	y if {disfmarker} if we were able to {disfmarker} to do that .
Buw001.A.dialogueact111	150.916	159.885	A	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	Well , if {disfmarker} if you actually take notes as a summary as opposed to n take notes in the sense of taking advantage of the time - stamps .
Buw001.A.dialogueact112	159.885	165.8	A	Professor	s:s	-1	0	So action item or uh , reminder to send this to so - and - so , blah - blah - blah .
Buw001.H.dialogueact113	165.797	166.107	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.A.dialogueact114	166.451	167.721	A	Professor	s	-1	0	So that wouldn't be a summary .
Buw001.A.dialogueact115	167.751	170.781	A	Professor	s	-1	0	That would just be {disfmarker} that would b relate to the query side .
Buw001.G.dialogueact117	170.757	176.647	G	Grad	s^df^nd	+1	1	But if we had the CrossPads , we could ask people , you know , if {disfmarker} if something comes up {vocalsound} write it down and mark it {vocalsound} {pause} somehow ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact116	170.752	171.052	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.E.dialogueact119	177.06	181.21	E	PhD	s^aa|s	+1	1	Right . I mean , we {disfmarker} because you 'd have several people with these pads , you could collect different things .
Buw001.G.dialogueact118	176.727	177.017	G	Grad	s^f	-1	0	you know .
Buw001.A.dialogueact121	181.569	181.849	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.E.dialogueact120	181.21	183.55	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	I mean , cuz I tend to take notes which are summaries .
Buw001.E.dialogueact122	183.55	184.93	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	And so , you know {disfmarker}
Buw001.F.dialogueact123	185.164	193.09	F	PhD	s	+1	1	I mean , the down - side to that is that he sort of indicated that the , uh , quality of {vocalsound} the handwriting recognition was quite poor .
Buw001.A.dialogueact124	195.579	195.829	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Buw001.G.dialogueact125	196.06	196.65	G	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	But that 's alright .
Buw001.G.dialogueact126	197.076	200.722	G	Grad	s^df	-1	0	I don't think there 'd be so many that you couldn't have someone clean it up

Buw001.A.dialogueact134	221.318	225.358	A	Professor	s	-1	0	if that {disfmarker} you know , if {disfmarker} if we just keep it simple then maybe it 's still useful .

Buw001.H.dialogueact180	296.845	298.615	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I have a question on protocol in these meetings ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact181	298.615	306.869	H	Postdoc	qy^rt	+1	0	which is when you say " Jimlet " and the person listening won't know what that is , sh shou How {disfmarker} how do we get {disfmarker} Is that important information ?

Buw001.H.dialogueact183	308.346	309.886	H	Postdoc	s^df^e.%--	-1	0	I mean , the box that contains the {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact184	310.137	313.987	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , I mean , suppose we broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just these internal ones .
Buw001.D.dialogueact185	313.987	320.066	D	Professor	s	-1	0	There 's gonna be lots of things that any group of people who know each other have in column {disfmarker} common {comment} that we will not know .
Buw001.A.dialogueact187	318.142	318.462	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .

Buw001.D.dialogueact194	327.09	329.63	D	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , we {disfmarker} we were originally gonna do this with VLSI design ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact195	329.63	336.01	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and the reason we didn't go straight to that was because immediately ninety percent of what we heard would be {vocalsound} jargon to {disfmarker} to us .
Buw001.D.dialogueact196	336.01	336.15	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Buw001.G.dialogueact197	336.013	337.023	G	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	Well , that was just one of the reasons .
Buw001.G.dialogueact198	337.023	337.893	G	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	But , yeah , definitely .
Buw001.D.dialogueact199	337.57	337.77	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.H.dialogueact200	337.64	337.85	H	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK . Good .
Buw001.D.dialogueact201	338.37	338.87	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	That {disfmarker} that 's right .
Buw001.D.dialogueact202	338.87	339.67	D	Professor	s	-1	0	There were others of course .
Buw001.D.dialogueact203	339.96	340.06	D	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.H.dialogueact204	341.491	344.771	H	Postdoc	fg|s^t^tc	-1	0	OK , so we were on the data collection {pause} {comment} and the summary issue .
Buw001.D.dialogueact205	343.29	343.54	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.D.dialogueact206	343.54	343.95	D	Professor	s.%	-1	0	We can go back .
Buw001.A.dialogueact207	345.792	346.152	A	Professor	fg	-1	0	So ,
Buw001.A.dialogueact208	346.663	347.013	A	Professor	%--	-1	0	uh , u u
Buw001.A.dialogueact209	347.463	349.353	A	Professor	s	+1	0	So , actually there 's kind of three issues .
Buw001.A.dialogueact210	349.453	350.843	A	Professor	s	+1	0	There 's the CrossPad issue .
Buw001.A.dialogueact211	351.395	353.915	A	Professor	qh	+1	0	Should we do it and , if so , what 'll we have them do ?
Buw001.A.dialogueact212	355.195	357.225	A	Professor	qh	+1	0	Um , do we have s people write summaries ?
Buw001.A.dialogueact213	358.031	359.391	A	Professor	qh	+1	0	Everybody or one person ?
Buw001.A.dialogueact214	360.519	364.019	A	Professor	qh	+1	0	And then , do we ask people for how they would query things ?
Buw001.A.dialogueact216	366.25	366.64	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	Is that {disfmarker}
Buw001.F.dialogueact215	366.115	367.635	F	PhD	s	-1	0	There 's {disfmarker} there 're sub - problems in that ,
Buw001.F.dialogueact217	367.635	371.065	F	PhD	qh^e	+1	0	in that where {disfmarker} or when do you actually ask them about that ?
Buw001.A.dialogueact219	371.469	371.869	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.F.dialogueact218	371.065	380.766	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , that was {disfmarker} One thing I was thinking about was is that Dan said earlier that , you know , maybe two weeks later , which is when you would want to query these things , you might ask them then .
Buw001.A.dialogueact220	379.542	379.982	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.F.dialogueact221	381.504	386.43	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But there 's a problem with that in that if {pause} you 're not {disfmarker}
Buw001.F.dialogueact222	386.62	391.14	F	PhD	s	-1	0	If you don't have an interactive system , it 's gonna be hard to go beyond sort of the first level of question .
Buw001.A.dialogueact223	391.527	391.777	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.F.dialogueact224	391.77	392.02	F	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.F.dialogueact225	392.15	394.16	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	And furth id explore the data further .
Buw001.A.dialogueact226	394.692	394.982	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.F.dialogueact227	394.863	395.353	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Buw001.D.dialogueact229	395.479	396.689	D	Professor	s	-1	0	There 's {disfmarker} there 's another problem
Buw001.G.dialogueact228	395.178	395.468	G	Grad	%--	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact230	396.689	402.649	D	Professor	s	-1	0	which is , um , we certainly do want to branch out beyond , uh , uh , recording meetings about Meeting Recorder .
Buw001.D.dialogueact231	403.171	409.21	D	Professor	s	+1	1	And , uh , once we get out beyond our little group , the people 's motivation factor , uh , reduces enormously .
Buw001.D.dialogueact232	409.21	411.61	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And if we start giving them a bunch of other things to do ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact233	412.121	414.991	D	Professor	s	-1	0	how {disfmarker} you know , we {disfmarker} we did n you know another meeting here for another group
Buw001.D.dialogueact234	414.991	416.741	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and , uh , they were fine with it .
Buw001.D.dialogueact235	416.741	421.923	D	Professor	qh^df.%-	-1	0	But if we 'd said , " OK , now all eight of you have to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} have to come up with , uh , the summar "
Buw001.G.dialogueact236	421.115	422.025	G	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , I asked them to
Buw001.G.dialogueact237	422.025	422.745	G	Grad	s	-1	0	and none of them did .
Buw001.D.dialogueact238	423.81	424.18	D	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	t See ?
Buw001.D.dialogueact241	424.38	425.15	D	Professor	s	-1	0	There we go .
Buw001.G.dialogueact240	424.32	428.25	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	So , I {disfmarker} I asked them to send me ideas for queries after the meeting
Buw001.H.dialogueact239	423.88	424.19	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.A.dialogueact242	424.908	425.068	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	They {disfmarker}
Buw001.G.dialogueact243	428.46	429.42	G	Grad	s	-1	0	and no one ever did .
Buw001.E.dialogueact244	429.631	429.901	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.G.dialogueact245	429.66	430.79	G	Grad	s^bd^df	-1	0	I didn't follow up either .
Buw001.A.dialogueact247	431.379	431.759	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.G.dialogueact246	431.293	434.153	G	Grad	s^bd^e:s	-1	0	So I didn't track them down and say " please do th do it now " .
Buw001.G.dialogueact248	434.153	438.442	G	Grad	s	-1	0	But , uh , no one spontaneously provided anything .
Buw001.D.dialogueact249	437.753	437.963	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	I
Buw001.D.dialogueact250	438.582	442.902	D	Professor	s	-1	0	I 'm worried that if you did {disfmarker} even if you did push them into it , it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it might be semi - random ,
Buw001.A.dialogueact251	443.239	443.609	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.D.dialogueact252	443.381	446.421	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	uh , as opposed to what you 'd really want to know if you were gonna use this thing .
Buw001.E.dialogueact253	443.73	443.99	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.A.dialogueact255	447.26	447.66	A	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Buw001.G.dialogueact254	447.02	452.92	G	Grad	s^df^no:s	+1	2	I just don't know how else to generate the queries other than getting an expert to actually listen to the meeting and say " that 's important ,
Buw001.G.dialogueact256	453.07	454.14	G	Grad	s^df^e:s	-1	0	that might be a query " .
Buw001.H.dialogueact257	454.936	455.036	H	Postdoc	%	-1	0	Tsk .
Buw001.H.dialogueact258	455.486	462.476	H	Postdoc	s^df^ng	-1	0	Well , there is this other thing which y which you were alluding to earlier , which is , um , there are certain key words like , you know , " action item " and things like that ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact259	462.476	467.52	H	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	which could be used in , uh , t to some degree finding the structure .
Buw001.A.dialogueact261	466.51	466.84	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.E.dialogueact260	466.14	466.47	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	Although {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact262	466.84	466.93	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	W
Buw001.H.dialogueact263	467.52	472.095	H	Postdoc	s	+1	0	And {disfmarker} and I also , um , was thinking , with reference to the n uh , note - taking ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact264	472.445	477.405	H	Postdoc	s	+1	0	the advantage there is that you get structure without the person having to do something artificial later .
Buw001.H.dialogueact265	477.495	479.715	H	Postdoc	s	+1	2	And the fir third thing I wanted to say is the summaries afterwards ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact266	480.209	482.499	H	Postdoc	s	+1	0	um , I think they should be recorded instead of written
Buw001.H.dialogueact267	483.099	487.639	H	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because I think that , um , it would take so long for people to write that I think you wouldn't get as good a summary .
Buw001.A.dialogueact268	488.251	489.621	A	Professor	qw	-1	0	How about this idea ?
Buw001.A.dialogueact269	489.801	495.425	A	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	That normally at most meetings somebody is delegated to be a note - taker .
Buw001.H.dialogueact270	495.321	495.751	H	Postdoc	s^aa|s^ba	-1	0	Yeah , good .
Buw001.H.dialogueact271	495.971	496.391	H	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Good point .
Buw001.A.dialogueact273	496.578	500.238	A	Professor	qh^cs	+1	2	And {disfmarker} So why don't we just use the notes that somebody takes ?
Buw001.H.dialogueact272	496.511	496.741	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.G.dialogueact274	500.804	502.204	G	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	I mean , that gives you a summary
Buw001.G.dialogueact275	502.204	503.414	G	Grad	s^nd.%--	-1	0	but it doesn't really {disfmarker}
Buw001.G.dialogueact276	503.414	504.984	G	Grad	qh^df^ng	-1	0	How do you generate queries from that ?
Buw001.E.dialogueact277	504.839	508.539	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Well . But , I mean , maybe a summary is one of the things we 'd want from the output of the system .
Buw001.H.dialogueact278	505.49	505.63	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.A.dialogueact280	508.793	509.143	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.E.dialogueact279	508.539	508.839	E	PhD	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Right ?
Buw001.E.dialogueact281	509.276	509.966	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	I mean , they 're something .
Buw001.E.dialogueact282	509.966	511.776	E	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's a {disfmarker} a kind of output you 'd like .
Buw001.B.dialogueact283	510.633	511.083	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	Actually {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact285	511.505	511.925	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	And so {disfmarker}
Buw001.G.dialogueact284	511.202	513.382	G	Grad	s	-1	0	Uh , James and I were talking about this during one of the breaks .
Buw001.G.dialogueact286	513.382	516.862	G	Grad	s	-1	0	And the problem with that is , I 'm definitely going to do something with information retrieval
Buw001.G.dialogueact287	517.062	521.386	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	even if it 's sort of not full full - bore what I 'm gonna do for my thesis .
Buw001.A.dialogueact288	518.419	518.629	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.G.dialogueact289	521.386	522.186	G	Grad	s	-1	0	I 'm gonna do something .
Buw001.G.dialogueact290	522.186	524.056	G	Grad	s	-1	0	I 'm not gonna do anything with summarization .
Buw001.G.dialogueact291	524.614	526.434	G	Grad	s	-1	0	And so if someone wants to do that , that 's fine ,
Buw001.G.dialogueact292	526.434	527.314	G	Grad	s	-1	0	but it 's not gonna be me .
Buw001.D.dialogueact293	527.807	535.935	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Well , I think that we {disfmarker} I mean , the {disfmarker} the f the core thing is that you know once we get some of these issues nailed down , we need to do a bunch of recordings
Buw001.A.dialogueact294	528.329	528.499	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact295	536.214	537.574	D	Professor	s^cs^e	-1	0	and send them off to IBM
Buw001.D.dialogueact296	537.574	538.904	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and get a bunch of transcriptions
Buw001.D.dialogueact297	538.904	540.334	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	even if they 're slightly flawed
Buw001.G.dialogueact298	538.97	539.2	G	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Buw001.D.dialogueact299	540.334	540.994	D	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	or need some other {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact300	541.421	542.991	D	Professor	s	-1	0	And then we 'll have some data there .
Buw001.A.dialogueact302	543.756	544.026	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.D.dialogueact301	543.455	548.139	D	Professor	s	-1	0	And then , i i we can start l looking and thinking , what do we want to know about these things
Buw001.D.dialogueact303	548.139	549.409	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and {disfmarker} at the very least .
Buw001.E.dialogueact304	548.794	549.044	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.A.dialogueact306	549.667	549.957	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact305	549.55	551.66	B	PhD	s	-1	0	I actually want to say something about the note pad .
Buw001.B.dialogueact307	551.66	568.977	B	PhD	s	+1	1	So , if you could sense just when people are writing , and you tell them not to doodle , or try not to {pause} be using that for other purposes , {comment} and each person has a note pad . They just get it when they come in the room . Then you c you can just have a fff {comment} plot of wh you know , who 's writing when .
Buw001.D.dialogueact308	552.403	552.643	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Buw001.B.dialogueact310	569.247	570.037	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	That 's all you {disfmarker}
Buw001.E.dialogueact309	569.06	569.61	E	PhD	s^2	-1	0	Activity .
Buw001.E.dialogueact311	569.94	570.14	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.B.dialogueact312	570.579	572.559	B	PhD	s	+1	0	And , you can also have notes of the meeting .
Buw001.B.dialogueact313	572.559	578.279	B	PhD	s	+1	1	But I bet that 's {disfmarker} that will allow you to go into the {disfmarker} sort of the hot places where people are writing things down .
Buw001.D.dialogueact314	573.07	573.25	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.G.dialogueact315	577.713	578.163	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , I see .
Buw001.B.dialogueact316	578.279	582.049	B	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , you can tell when you 're in a meeting when everybody stops to write something down that something was just said .
Buw001.A.dialogueact317	579.062	579.542	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.B.dialogueact318	582.409	585.514	B	PhD	s	-1	0	It may not be kept in the later summary ,
Buw001.B.dialogueact319	585.514	587.934	B	PhD	s	-1	0	but at that point in time is was something that was important .
Buw001.H.dialogueact320	587.594	587.924	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.B.dialogueact321	588.388	589.748	B	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	And that wouldn't take any extra {disfmarker}
Buw001.H.dialogueact322	589.79	590.55	H	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	That 's a nice idea .
Buw001.A.dialogueact325	590.811	591.311	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.B.dialogueact323	590.475	592.785	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Or someone could just pu you could just put your hand on the pad
Buw001.D.dialogueact324	590.519	590.679	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	It {disfmarker}
Buw001.C.dialogueact326	591.19	591.56	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.B.dialogueact327	592.835	594.285	B	PhD	s^cs^e	-1	0	and go like that if you want to .
Buw001.B.dialogueact329	595.018	595.478	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact328	594.534	595.214	D	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	That 's a good idea
Buw001.D.dialogueact330	595.214	595.834	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but that doesn't {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact331	596.094	596.794	D	Professor	s^bd^df	-1	0	Maybe I 'm missing something ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact332	596.854	600.134	D	Professor	s^bu|qy^d^g	-1	0	but that doesn't get to the question of how we come up with queries , right ?
Buw001.A.dialogueact334	600.162	601.182	A	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	Well , what it does {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact333	600.103	604.833	B	PhD	fg|s^df	-1	0	Well , then you can go to the points where the {disfmarker} you could actually go to those points in time
Buw001.B.dialogueact335	604.833	606.723	B	PhD	s^df^e	-1	0	and find out what they were talking about .
Buw001.B.dialogueact336	606.723	607.083	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	And you r
Buw001.A.dialogueact338	608.312	610.602	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Well , what it does is provide a different {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact337	607.89	608.22	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.B.dialogueact339	608.49	608.9	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Buw001.G.dialogueact340	608.667	609.117	G	Grad	%	-1	0	Uh , y
Buw001.A.dialogueact341	610.792	612.152	A	Professor	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I think it 's an interesting thing .
Buw001.A.dialogueact342	612.152	614.755	A	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	I don't think it gets at the {disfmarker} the queries per - se ,
Buw001.A.dialogueact343	614.755	624.397	A	Professor	s	-1	0	but it does give us an information fusion sort of thing that , you know , you wanna i say " what were the hot - points of the meeting ? "
Buw001.B.dialogueact344	622.02	622.37	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.D.dialogueact345	624.512	626.672	D	Professor	s	-1	0	That {disfmarker} that 's what I mean , is that I think it gets at something interesting
Buw001.D.dialogueact346	626.672	639.603	D	Professor	s^df	+1	2	but if we were asking the question , which I thought we were , of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of , um , " how do we figure out what 's the nature of the queries that people are gonna want to ask of such a system ? " , knowing what 's important doesn't tell you what people are going to be asking .
Buw001.B.dialogueact347	639.792	642.032	B	PhD	s^df^ng	+1	0	But I bet it 's a good {pause} superset of it .
Buw001.D.dialogueact348	640.091	640.491	D	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	Does it ?
Buw001.A.dialogueact350	643.282	644.222	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Well , yeah .
Buw001.E.dialogueact349	642.912	643.532	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Well , see , there are th
Buw001.A.dialogueact351	644.222	653.411	A	Professor	s	-1	0	I think you could say they 're gonna ask about , uh , when {disfmarker} uh , when did so - and - so s talk about blah .
Buw001.A.dialogueact352	653.611	657.411	A	Professor	s	-1	0	And at least that gives you the word {pause} that they might run a query on .
Buw001.B.dialogueact353	656.292	659.162	B	PhD	s	-1	0	At least you can find the locations where there are maybe keywords
Buw001.D.dialogueact355	658.43	658.77	D	Professor	s^am	-1	0	Maybe .
Buw001.G.dialogueact354	658.388	660.728	G	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , i this would tell you what the hit is ,
Buw001.B.dialogueact356	659.162	659.432	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Buw001.G.dialogueact357	660.728	661.668	G	Grad	s	-1	0	not what the query is .
Buw001.A.dialogueact360	661.99	662.38	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.B.dialogueact359	661.81	662.53	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right , right .
Buw001.G.dialogueact358	661.668	661.868	G	Grad	%-	-1	0	What {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact361	662.38	664.2	A	Professor	s^na	-1	0	It 'll tell you the hit but not the query .
Buw001.B.dialogueact362	662.53	666.53	B	PhD	s	-1	0	But I think {disfmarker} I think thinking about queries is a little bit dangerous right now .
Buw001.G.dialogueact363	663.194	665.674	G	Grad	s	-1	0	And so you could {disfmarker} you can generate a query from the hits ,
Buw001.A.dialogueact365	665.833	666.043	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.G.dialogueact364	665.754	665.984	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact366	666.53	667.55	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	We don't even know what {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact367	668.16	673.24	B	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , if you want to find out what any user will use , that might be true for one domain and one user ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact368	668.91	669.24	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.B.dialogueact369	673.24	675.26	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	but I mean a different domain and a different user {disfmarker}
Buw001.H.dialogueact370	674.383	674.633	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.D.dialogueact371	675.57	677.45	D	Professor	fg|s^df	-1	0	Yeah , but we 're just looking for a place to start with that
Buw001.B.dialogueact372	676.724	677.084	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um .
Buw001.D.dialogueact373	677.45	682.873	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because , you know , th what {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what James is gonna be doing is looking at the user - interface
Buw001.D.dialogueact374	682.873	684.333	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and he 's looking at the query in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact375	684.928	687.958	D	Professor	s	+1	1	i We {disfmarker} we have five hours of pilot data of the other stuff
Buw001.D.dialogueact376	687.958	690.478	D	Professor	s	+1	0	but we have zero hours of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of queries .
Buw001.D.dialogueact377	690.478	693.046	D	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	So he 's just sort of going " where {disfmarker} where do I {disfmarker} where do I start ? "
Buw001.A.dialogueact378	692.869	692.979	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	w
Buw001.A.dialogueact379	693.199	694.249	A	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	Well , th you could do {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact380	694.249	697.389	A	Professor	s	-1	0	I think the summaries actually may help get us there ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact381	696.495	696.875	D	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Buw001.A.dialogueact382	697.86	699.26	A	Professor	s^e	-1	0	for a couple reasons .
Buw001.A.dialogueact383	699.26	711.757	A	Professor	s	-1	0	One , if you have a summary {disfmarker} if you have a bunch of summaries , you can do a word frequency count and see what words come up in different types of meetings .
Buw001.D.dialogueact384	711.851	712.151	D	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.A.dialogueact385	712.553	717.653	A	Professor	s	-1	0	So " action item " is gonna come up whether it 's a VLSI meeting , or speech meeting , or whatever .
Buw001.A.dialogueact386	718.072	722.722	A	Professor	s	-1	0	So words that come up in different types of meetings may be something that you would want to query about .
Buw001.G.dialogueact387	722.798	723.098	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.A.dialogueact388	723.665	736.854	A	Professor	s:qw	+1	0	Um , the second thing you could possibly do with it is just run a little pilot experiment with somebody saying " here 's a summary of a meeting , what questions might you want to ask about it to go back ? "
Buw001.G.dialogueact389	736.652	737.582	G	Grad	fg|s^ba^nd	-1	0	Yeah , I think that 's difficult
Buw001.G.dialogueact390	737.582	740.332	G	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because then they 're not gonna ask the questions that are in the summary .
Buw001.A.dialogueact391	743.165	743.585	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Buw001.G.dialogueact392	743.567	744.887	G	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	But , I think it would give {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact393	744.668	748.118	A	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's one possi one possible scenario , though , is you have the summary ,
Buw001.G.dialogueact394	748.09	748.37	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.A.dialogueact395	748.911	751.041	A	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and you want to ask questions to get more detail .
Buw001.G.dialogueact396	751.818	753.468	G	Grad	s	-1	0	th Yeah , I think it has to be a participant .
Buw001.G.dialogueact397	753.468	754.688	G	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , it doesn't have to be .
Buw001.G.dialogueact398	755.128	758.488	G	Grad	s	-1	0	OK . So that {disfmarker} that is another use of Meeting Recorder that we haven't really talked about ,
Buw001.G.dialogueact399	758.791	760.211	G	Grad	s	-1	0	which is for someone else ,
Buw001.G.dialogueact400	760.469	762.679	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	as opposed to as a {pause} remembrance agent ,
Buw001.G.dialogueact401	762.679	767.285	G	Grad	s	-1	0	which is what had been my primary thought in the information retrieval part of it would be .
Buw001.G.dialogueact402	768.632	769.312	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	But , uh ,
Buw001.G.dialogueact403	770.483	776.402	G	Grad	s	+1	0	I guess if you had a meeting participant , they could use the summary to refresh themselves about the meeting and then make up queries .
Buw001.G.dialogueact404	776.402	776.982	G	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	But it 's not {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact405	777.827	778.357	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.G.dialogueact406	778.83	780.93	G	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I don't know how to do it if {disfmarker} until you have a system .
Buw001.B.dialogueact407	781.543	783.753	B	PhD	s	-1	0	The summary is actually gonna drive the queries then .
Buw001.A.dialogueact409	782.356	782.646	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Buw001.E.dialogueact408	781.868	782.168	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.B.dialogueact410	783.753	786.113	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	I mean , your research is going to be very circular .
Buw001.A.dialogueact412	784.56	784.82	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.G.dialogueact411	784.112	785.152	G	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yeah , that {disfmarker} that 's what I was saying .
Buw001.E.dialogueact413	785.97	792.215	E	PhD	s	+1	0	But th there is this , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} There is this class of queries , which are the things that you didn't realize were important at the time
Buw001.E.dialogueact414	792.215	795.553	E	PhD	s^df^e:qy	+1	0	but some in retrospect you think " oh , hang on , didn't we talk about that ? "
Buw001.E.dialogueact415	796.01	798.07	E	PhD	s.%--	+1	0	And it 's something that didn't appear in the summary but you {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact416	797.082	797.422	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.E.dialogueact417	798.13	801.53	E	PhD	s	-1	0	And that 's kind of what this kind of , uh , complete data capture is kind of nicest for .
Buw001.A.dialogueact418	801.511	802.051	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.A.dialogueact421	802.201	802.541	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.B.dialogueact419	801.772	802.082	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.E.dialogueact420	801.944	805.774	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Cuz it 's the things that you wouldn't have bothered to make an effort to record but they get recorded .
Buw001.E.dialogueact422	807.14	811.44	E	PhD	s	-1	0	So , I mean {disfmarker} And th there 's no way of generating those , u u until we just {disfmarker} until they actually occur .
Buw001.B.dialogueact424	811.86	813.5	B	PhD	s^cs^df	-1	0	But you could always post - hoc label them .
Buw001.E.dialogueact423	811.44	812.07	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	You know , it 's like {disfmarker}
Buw001.E.dialogueact425	813.693	814.633	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right , right . Exactly .
Buw001.B.dialogueact426	814.273	814.493	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.B.dialogueact428	815.086	815.246	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Buw001.G.dialogueact430	821.128	822.368	G	Grad	s^df	-1	0	But at least it would get us started .
Buw001.E.dialogueact431	822.81	823.11	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Oh , yeah .
Buw001.E.dialogueact432	823.11	823.55	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , sure .
Buw001.H.dialogueact433	823.24	831.619	H	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	I also think that w if {disfmarker} if you can use the summaries as an indication of the important points of the {disfmarker} of the meeting , then you might get something like {disfmarker}
Buw001.H.dialogueact434	831.861	836.101	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	y So if th if the obscure item you want to know more about was some form of data collection ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact435	836.476	840.026	H	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	you know , maybe the summary would say , you know , " we discussed types of na data collection " .
Buw001.H.dialogueact436	840.323	843.133	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And , you know {disfmarker} And {disfmarker} and maybe you could get to it by that .
Buw001.H.dialogueact437	843.133	853.43	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	If you {disfmarker} if you had the {disfmarker} the larger structure of the {disfmarker} of the discourse , then if you can categorize what it is that you 're looking for with reference to those l those larger headings , then you can find it

Buw001.G.dialogueact441	857.392	861.749	G	Grad	s^ba^df^ng	-1	0	Although it seems like that 's , um , a high burden on the note - taker .
Buw001.H.dialogueact440	857.367	857.757	H	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	I think that {disfmarker}
Buw001.G.dialogueact442	862.089	865.079	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	That 's a pretty fine grain that the note - taker will have to take .

Buw001.G.dialogueact451	882.139	882.409	G	Grad	%-	-1	0	But they {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact452	886.119	891.199	B	PhD	s	-1	0	And that way that one student has , you know , a rough idea of what was going on ,
Buw001.B.dialogueact453	891.667	893.077	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and they can use it for their research .
Buw001.B.dialogueact454	893.077	896.447	B	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , this isn't really necessarily what you would do in a real system ,

Buw001.B.dialogueact456	897.09	898.48	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because that that 's a lot of trouble

Buw001.B.dialogueact458	898.55	900.04	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and maybe it 's not the best way to do it .
Buw001.B.dialogueact460	900.38	906.299	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	But if he has some students that want to study that then they should sort of get to know the people and attend those meetings ,

Buw001.B.dialogueact461	906.299	908.655	B	PhD	s^cs^e	-1	0	and get the notes from the note - taker or something .
Buw001.G.dialogueact462	907.09	907.31	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.D.dialogueact463	908.867	909.167	D	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Hmm .
Buw001.G.dialogueact464	908.905	910.685	G	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	Well , I think that 's a little bit of a problem .
Buw001.G.dialogueact465	910.685	914.145	G	Grad	s	-1	0	Their sort of note - taking application stuff
Buw001.G.dialogueact466	914.145	915.585	G	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	they 've been doing for the last couple of years ,
Buw001.G.dialogueact467	915.585	917.225	G	Grad	s	-1	0	and I don't think anyone is still working on it .
Buw001.D.dialogueact469	917.971	918.331	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.G.dialogueact468	917.761	918.461	G	Grad	s	-1	0	I think they 're done .
Buw001.G.dialogueact470	919.336	923.161	G	Grad	s	-1	0	Um , so I 'm not sure that they have anyone currently working on notes .
Buw001.G.dialogueact471	923.161	927.251	G	Grad	s	-1	0	So what we 'd have to interest someone in is the combination of note and speech .
Buw001.B.dialogueact472	927.852	928.142	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.G.dialogueact473	928.08	929.68	G	Grad	qh	-1	0	And so the question is " is there such a person ? "
Buw001.G.dialogueact474	929.68	931.7	G	Grad	s	-1	0	And I think right now , the answer is " no " .
Buw001.A.dialogueact476	932.367	933.037	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	Well
Buw001.D.dialogueact475	932.21	933.16	D	Professor	s	-1	0	I 've b been thinking {disfmarker}
Buw001.G.dialogueact477	932.463	933.143	G	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	We 'll just have to see .
Buw001.D.dialogueact478	933.48	936.93	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I 've been thinking about it a little bit here {disfmarker} about the {disfmarker} uh , th this , e um {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact479	937.392	938.262	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I think that the {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact480	939.557	946.037	D	Professor	s	+1	1	now I 'm thinking that the summary {disfmarker} a summary , uh , is actually a reasonable , uh , bootstrap into this {disfmarker} into what we 'd like to get at .
Buw001.D.dialogueact481	946.037	947.077	D	Professor	s^ba^bd	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} it 's not ideal ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact482	947.077	949.317	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but we {disfmarker} you know , we {disfmarker} we have to get started someplace .
Buw001.D.dialogueact483	949.696	953.467	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So I was {disfmarker} I was just thinking about , um , suppose we wanted to get {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact484	953.467	954.667	D	Professor	s	-1	0	w We have this collection of meeting .
Buw001.D.dialogueact485	954.667	955.757	D	Professor	s	-1	0	We have five hours of stuff .
Buw001.D.dialogueact486	956.291	957.531	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh , we get that transcribed .
Buw001.D.dialogueact487	957.531	959.051	D	Professor	s	+1	1	So now we have five hours of meetings
Buw001.D.dialogueact488	959.484	964.074	D	Professor	s:qw	+1	0	and , uh , you ask me , uh , uh , " Morgan , what d you know , what kind of questions do you want to ask ? "
Buw001.D.dialogueact489	964.871	966.871	D	Professor	s^no	+1	1	Uh , I wouldn't have any idea what kind of questions I want to ask .
Buw001.D.dialogueact490	966.871	968.001	D	Professor	s	-1	0	I 'd have to get started someplace .
Buw001.D.dialogueact491	968.001	971.901	D	Professor	s:s	+1	0	So in fact if I looked at summary of it , I 'd go " oh , yeah , I was in that meeting ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact492	972.498	973.338	D	Professor	s:s	-1	0	I remember that ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact493	973.901	975.801	D	Professor	s.%--:qw.%--	-1	0	um , what was the part that {disfmarker} "
Buw001.D.dialogueact494	975.943	985.515	D	Professor	s	+1	1	And {disfmarker} and th I think that might then help me to think of things {disfmarker} even things that aren't listed in the summary , but just as a {disfmarker} as a {disfmarker} as a refresh of what the general thing was going on in the meeting .
Buw001.G.dialogueact495	981.051	981.491	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.A.dialogueact496	986.174	988.244	A	Professor	s	-1	0	I think it serves two purpo purposes .
Buw001.A.dialogueact497	988.244	991.822	A	Professor	s	-1	0	One , as sort of a refresh to help bootstrap queries ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact498	990.4	990.8	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.D.dialogueact499	991.311	991.731	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.A.dialogueact500	991.822	995.602	A	Professor	s	-1	0	but also , I mean , maybe we do want to generate summaries .
Buw001.A.dialogueact502	995.652	998.708	A	Professor	s	-1	0	And then it 's {disfmarker} you know , it 's kind of a key .
Buw001.D.dialogueact501	995.263	996.133	D	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Well , yeah . That 's true too .
Buw001.E.dialogueact503	997.015	997.385	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Buw001.G.dialogueact504	997.063	998.723	G	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yeah , absolutely . Then you want to have it .
Buw001.A.dialogueact506	999.465	999.745	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact505	999.32	1000.94	B	PhD	qw	-1	0	So how does the summary get generated ?
Buw001.A.dialogueact508	1001.29	1002.14	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	Well , i i {disfmarker} ?
Buw001.B.dialogueact507	1000.94	1002.63	B	PhD	s^df^rt	-1	0	I 'm not against the idea of a summary ,
Buw001.G.dialogueact509	1001.38	1001.88	G	Grad	s	-1	0	By hand .
Buw001.B.dialogueact510	1002.63	1006.08	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	but I wanted to think carefully about who 's generating it
Buw001.A.dialogueact511	1004.49	1005.09	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	Or , d o
Buw001.B.dialogueact512	1006.08	1006.52	B	PhD	s^df^e.%--	-1	0	and how {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact513	1006.59	1009.45	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because the summary will drive the queries .
Buw001.A.dialogueact515	1009.93	1013.06	A	Professor	s	-1	0	What I {disfmarker} I think , you know , in most meetings ,
Buw001.B.dialogueact514	1009.79	1010.22	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact516	1013.34	1014.85	A	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	this one being {pause} different ,
Buw001.A.dialogueact517	1014.95	1021.89	A	Professor	s	+1	0	but in most meetings that I attend , there 's somebody t explicitly taking notes , frequently on a laptop {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact518	1022.57	1025.07	A	Professor	s	-1	0	Um , you can just make it be on a laptop ,
Buw001.B.dialogueact519	1022.72	1023.07	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.A.dialogueact520	1025.07	1026.68	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	so then yo you 're dealing with ASCII
Buw001.A.dialogueact521	1026.68	1027.25	A	Professor	s^df^e.%--	-1	0	and not somebody {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact522	1027.25	1029.68	A	Professor	s^df^e	-1	0	you don't have to go through handwriting recognition .
Buw001.A.dialogueact523	1030.49	1035.99	A	Professor	s	+1	0	Um , and then they post - edit it into , uh , a summary
Buw001.A.dialogueact524	1035.99	1037.4	A	Professor	s	+1	0	and they email it out for minutes .
Buw001.A.dialogueact525	1037.4	1038.87	A	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , that happens in most meetings .
Buw001.H.dialogueact526	1039.01	1042.59	H	Postdoc	s^df^rt	-1	0	I I {disfmarker} I think that , um , there 's {disfmarker} we 're using " summary " in two different ways .
Buw001.H.dialogueact527	1042.65	1045.21	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So what you just described I would describe as " minutes " .
Buw001.G.dialogueact528	1044.16	1044.5	G	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Minutes .
Buw001.A.dialogueact530	1045.53	1045.78	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.B.dialogueact532	1045.79	1046.43	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.E.dialogueact529	1045.43	1045.67	E	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.H.dialogueact531	1045.58	1049.72	H	Postdoc	s.%--:qw	-1	0	And what I originally thought was , um , if you asked someone " what was the meeting about ? "
Buw001.B.dialogueact533	1046.63	1047.01	B	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Buw001.A.dialogueact535	1050.47	1050.8	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Buw001.H.dialogueact534	1050.35	1052.4	H	Postdoc	s^e:s	-1	0	And then they would say " well , we talked about this
Buw001.H.dialogueact536	1052.4	1053.54	H	Postdoc	s^e:s	-1	0	and then we talked about that ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact537	1053.54	1054.6	H	Postdoc	s^e:s	-1	0	and so - and - so talked about {disfmarker} "
Buw001.H.dialogueact538	1054.88	1055.79	H	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And then you 'd have , like {disfmarker}
Buw001.H.dialogueact539	1056.11	1061.87	H	Postdoc	s	+1	2	I {disfmarker} e My thought was to have multiple people summarize it , on recording rather than writing
Buw001.H.dialogueact540	1061.87	1063.18	H	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because writing takes time
Buw001.H.dialogueact541	1063.18	1066.27	H	Postdoc	s^e.%--	-1	0	and you get irrelevant other things that u take time , that {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact542	1066.2	1066.56	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.H.dialogueact543	1066.65	1068.83	H	Postdoc	s.%--	+1	0	Whereas if you just say it immediately after the meeting ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact544	1069.5	1072.48	H	Postdoc	s	+1	2	you know , a two - minute summary of what the meeting was about , I think you would get ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact545	1072.89	1073.72	H	Postdoc	s^e.%--	-1	0	uh , with mult
Buw001.H.dialogueact546	1073.72	1075.7	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	See , I {disfmarker} I also worry about having a single note - taker
Buw001.H.dialogueact547	1075.7	1077.78	H	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because that 's just one person 's perception .
Buw001.H.dialogueact548	1078.21	1079.22	H	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	And , um ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact549	1079.63	1083.18	H	Postdoc	s^df^e	-1	0	you know , it {disfmarker} it 's releva it 's relative to what you 're focus was on that meeting ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact550	1080.64	1081.34	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.H.dialogueact551	1083.18	1086.72	H	Postdoc	s^df^e	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and people have different {comment} major topics that they 're interested in .
Buw001.D.dialogueact552	1087.04	1087.26	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	A
Buw001.H.dialogueact553	1087.04	1095.0	H	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	2	So , my proposal would be that it may be worth considering both of those types , you know , the note - taking and a spontaneous oral summary afterwards ,
Buw001.A.dialogueact554	1091.49	1091.86	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Buw001.E.dialogueact555	1091.93	1092.15	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.H.dialogueact556	1095.0	1096.12	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	no longer than two minutes ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact557	1096.46	1097.15	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	Adam , you can {disfmarker}
Buw001.H.dialogueact558	1096.75	1097.46	H	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	from multiple people .
Buw001.D.dialogueact560	1098.13	1098.92	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	you can correct me on this ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact559	1097.79	1097.88	H	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.D.dialogueact561	1098.92	1106.93	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but , uh , my impression was that , uh , pretty much , uh , true that the meetings here , nobody sits with a w uh , with a laptop
Buw001.G.dialogueact562	1106.12	1106.44	G	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Never .
Buw001.D.dialogueact563	1106.93	1107.1	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}

Buw001.G.dialogueact709	1302.71	1306.99	G	Grad	s^df^ng	+1	1	But that {disfmarker} it 's gonna be a lot of effort on our part to create it , and store it ,
Buw001.G.dialogueact710	1307.26	1310.9	G	Grad	s	+1	0	and get all the standards , and to do anything with it .
Buw001.D.dialogueact711	1307.91	1308.13	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.D.dialogueact712	1308.13	1308.63	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	So we 're gonna {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact713	1310.97	1312.35	D	Professor	s	-1	0	So we 're gonna do what we 're gonna do ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact714	1312.35	1313.56	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	whatever 's reasonable for us .
Buw001.G.dialogueact715	1312.39	1312.63	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.B.dialogueact716	1313.04	1314.92	B	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	I think even doing something very crude {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact717	1313.56	1314.2	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	But having {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact718	1314.92	1318.49	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	Like I know with ATIS , we just had a tape recorder running all the time .
Buw001.G.dialogueact719	1318.29	1318.62	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.B.dialogueact720	1318.86	1323.17	B	PhD	s	-1	0	And later on it turned out it was really good that you had a tape recorder of what was happening ,
Buw001.B.dialogueact721	1323.17	1325.59	B	PhD	s	-1	0	even though you w you just got the speech from the machine .
Buw001.B.dialogueact722	1326.02	1330.82	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So if you can find some really , you know , low , uh , perplexity ,
Buw001.G.dialogueact723	1330.23	1330.88	G	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Low fidelity .
Buw001.B.dialogueact725	1331.15	1335.31	B	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah , {comment} way of {disfmarker} of doing that , I think it would be worthwhile .
Buw001.G.dialogueact724	1330.94	1331.12	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.H.dialogueact726	1335.26	1335.59	H	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	I agree .
Buw001.H.dialogueact727	1335.59	1338.29	H	Postdoc	s^df.%-	-1	0	And if it 's simple as {disfmarker} I mean , as simple as just the digital {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact728	1337.08	1338.46	B	PhD	s	-1	0	Otherwise you 'd {disfmarker} you lose it .
Buw001.D.dialogueact730	1339.47	1346.3	D	Professor	s	+1	2	Well , minimally , I mean , what {disfmarker} what Dan is referring to at least having some representation of the p the spatial position of the people ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact729	1339.07	1339.23	H	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.D.dialogueact731	1346.3	1348.4	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	cuz we are interested in some spatial processing .
Buw001.H.dialogueact732	1346.57	1346.79	H	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.A.dialogueact735	1348.62	1349.06	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.D.dialogueact733	1348.4	1348.8	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	And so {disfmarker}
Buw001.G.dialogueact734	1348.5	1348.75	G	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.D.dialogueact736	1349.6	1350.36	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	so , um {disfmarker}
Buw001.G.dialogueact737	1351.25	1353.5	G	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Well , once the room is a little more fixed that 's a little easier
Buw001.D.dialogueact738	1353.31	1353.63	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.G.dialogueact739	1353.5	1353.93	G	Grad	s^df.%--	-1	0	cuz you 'll {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact741	1354.3	1354.7	D	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.G.dialogueact740	1354.26	1355.26	G	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , the wireless .
Buw001.D.dialogueact742	1355.8	1356.01	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.G.dialogueact743	1356.62	1356.89	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact744	1357.31	1359.19	B	PhD	s	+1	0	Also CMU has been doing this
Buw001.B.dialogueact745	1359.53	1361.28	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and they were the most vocal at this meeting ,
Buw001.B.dialogueact746	1361.51	1362.39	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	Alex Waibel 's group .
Buw001.B.dialogueact747	1362.92	1372.78	B	PhD	s	+1	0	And they have {pause} said , I talked to the student who had done this , {comment} that with two fairly inexpensive cameras they {disfmarker} they just recorded all the time
Buw001.D.dialogueact748	1371.38	1371.73	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.B.dialogueact749	1372.78	1376.97	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and were able to get all the information from {disfmarker} or maybe it was three {disfmarker} from all the parts of the room .
Buw001.B.dialogueact750	1378.55	1388.21	B	PhD	s^df	+1	0	So I think we would be {disfmarker} we might lose the chance to use this data for somebody later who wants to do some kind of processing on it if we don't collect it {comment} at all .
Buw001.G.dialogueact751	1385.01	1385.27	G	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.G.dialogueact752	1386.26	1387.57	G	Grad	s^na^rt	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't disagree .
Buw001.G.dialogueact753	1392.08	1397.55	G	Grad	s	+1	1	I think that if you have that , then people who are interested in vision can use this database . The problem with it is you 'll have more people who don't want to be filmed than who don't want to be recorded .
Buw001.C.dialogueact756	1398.16	1399.04	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Buw001.G.dialogueact755	1397.88	1401.53	G	Grad	s^df^e:s	-1	0	So that there 's going to be another group of people who are gonna say " I won't participate " .
Buw001.H.dialogueact754	1397.72	1398.65	H	Postdoc	s^df.%-	-1	0	Well , she 's not {pause} making {disfmarker}
Buw001.C.dialogueact757	1400.03	1400.74	C	Professor	s^na	-1	0	That 's true .
Buw001.A.dialogueact758	1402.2	1402.6	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.B.dialogueact759	1402.45	1405.1	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Or you could put a paper bag over everybody 's head
Buw001.G.dialogueact760	1402.55	1402.86	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact761	1405.1	1406.15	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and not look at each other
Buw001.B.dialogueact762	1406.15	1407.02	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and not look at boards ,
Buw001.B.dialogueact763	1407.02	1408.85	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and just all be sitting {vocalsound} talking .
Buw001.D.dialogueact764	1408.28	1408.66	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Buw001.B.dialogueact766	1408.85	1411.55	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	That would be an interes {vocalsound} Bu
Buw001.H.dialogueact765	1408.53	1408.73	H	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact768	1409.51	1410.04	D	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Great idea .
Buw001.H.dialogueact767	1409.43	1411.08	H	Postdoc	s|s^aa	-1	0	Well , there 's {disfmarker} that 'd be the {disfmarker} the parallel , yeah .
Buw001.H.dialogueact769	1411.39	1416.36	H	Postdoc	s^df.%-	+1	0	But I think y she 's {disfmarker} we 're just proposing {pause} a minimal preservation of things on boards ,
Buw001.B.dialogueact770	1415.32	1417.84	B	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yeah . I definitely won't participate if there 's a camera .

Buw001.G.dialogueact775	1422.31	1424.63	G	Grad	s^df^nd	+1	1	But , you know , that 's a lot of infrastructure and work .
Buw001.H.dialogueact774	1421.93	1423.08	H	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	We can talk about the {disfmarker}

Buw001.H.dialogueact798	1446.41	1447.15	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Well , it 's worth considering .
Buw001.H.dialogueact799	1447.15	1450.2	H	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	Maybe we don't want to {disfmarker} spend that much more time discussing it ,

Buw001.D.dialogueact811	1460.98	1462.17	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	we {disfmarker} we might try that some

Buw001.D.dialogueact822	1487.47	1487.83	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	There you go .
Buw001.B.dialogueact823	1488.08	1490.68	B	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	And so that could argue for us not doing it
Buw001.B.dialogueact824	1490.68	1492.63	B	PhD	s	-1	0	or it could argue for us doing it .
Buw001.B.dialogueact825	1492.84	1501.42	B	PhD	s	-1	0	The only place where it sort of overlaps is when some of the summarization issues are {disfmarker} actually could be , um , easier {disfmarker} made easier if you had {pause} the video .
Buw001.D.dialogueact827	1501.75	1510.45	D	Professor	s	+1	0	I think at the moment we should be determining this on the basis of our own , uh , interests and needs rather than hypothetical ones from a community thing .
Buw001.H.dialogueact826	1501.54	1501.78	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.D.dialogueact828	1510.45	1515.29	D	Professor	s	-1	0	As you say , if they {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if they decide it 's really critical then they will collect a lot more data than we can afford to ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact829	1515.45	1517.67	D	Professor	s	-1	0	uh , and {disfmarker} and will include all that .
Buw001.B.dialogueact830	1518.37	1518.59	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Buw001.D.dialogueact831	1518.44	1518.91	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um ,

Buw001.D.dialogueact834	1521.83	1524.34	D	Professor	s	-1	0	I 'm worried about the cost of people looking at it .
Buw001.D.dialogueact835	1524.59	1528.33	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	In other words , it 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it 'd be kind of silly to collect it all and not look at it at all .
Buw001.D.dialogueact836	1528.33	1534.43	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	And so I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think that we do have to do some picking and choosing of the stuff that we 're doing .
Buw001.D.dialogueact837	1534.88	1540.5	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	But I {disfmarker} I am int I do think that we m minimally want {disfmarker} something {disfmarker} we might want to look at {disfmarker} at some {disfmarker} some , uh , subsets of that .
Buw001.D.dialogueact838	1540.5	1545.89	D	Professor	s^cs^e	+1	2	Like for a meeting like this , at least , uh , take a Polaroid of the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of the {disfmarker} of the boards ,

Buw001.A.dialogueact865	1585.71	1588.3	A	Professor	s	-1	0	I 've written all of this down and it 's getting emailed to you .

Buw001.G.dialogueact867	1588.67	1590.81	G	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , uh , in that case we don't need to take pictures of it .
Buw001.B.dialogueact868	1591.67	1596.96	B	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	Right . That would be the other alternative , to make sure that anything that was on the board , um , is in the record .
Buw001.A.dialogueact869	1592.21	1592.56	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .

Buw001.H.dialogueact871	1592.86	1593.0	H	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact872	1595.73	1600.44	A	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , that 's why {disfmarker} that 's why I 'm saying that I think the note - taking would be {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact873	1600.5	1604.47	A	Professor	s	-1	0	I think in many {disfmarker} for many meetings there will be some sort of note - taking ,
Buw001.A.dialogueact874	1605.5	1609.22	A	Professor	s	-1	0	in which case , that 's a useful thing to have {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact875	1609.86	1611.98	A	Professor	s^bd^df	-1	0	Uh , I mean , we {disfmarker} uh , we don't need to require it .
Buw001.A.dialogueact877	1611.98	1612.72	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Just like the {disfmarker}
Buw001.G.dialogueact876	1611.94	1612.31	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.A.dialogueact878	1613.19	1616.34	A	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , I think it would be great if we try to get a picture with every meeting .
Buw001.A.dialogueact879	1617.15	1617.78	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact880	1617.17	1617.35	H	Postdoc	s^na.%	-1	0	I agree .
Buw001.A.dialogueact881	1618.71	1621.05	A	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	so {disfmarker} so we won't worry about requiring these things ,
Buw001.A.dialogueact882	1621.05	1626.89	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but the more things that we can get it for , the more useful it will be for various applications .
Buw001.A.dialogueact884	1627.45	1627.7	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Buw001.D.dialogueact883	1627.26	1627.5	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact885	1628.03	1633.41	D	Professor	s^t^tc	-1	0	So , I mean , departing for the moment from the data collection question but actually talking about , you know , this group and what we actually want to do ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact886	1634.05	1641.77	D	Professor	s^bu^rt	-1	0	uh , so I guess that 's th the way {disfmarker} what you were figuring on doing was {disfmarker} was {disfmarker} was , uh , putting together some notes and sending them to {disfmarker} to everybody
Buw001.D.dialogueact887	1642.52	1643.56	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	from {disfmarker} from today ?
Buw001.D.dialogueact888	1643.83	1644.15	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Buw001.D.dialogueact889	1645.73	1646.01	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Buw001.D.dialogueact890	1647.28	1647.67	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Buw001.H.dialogueact891	1647.28	1647.53	H	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	That 's great .
Buw001.D.dialogueact892	1650.73	1656.4	D	Professor	s^t	+1	2	So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so the question {comment} that {disfmarker} that we started with was whether there was anything else we should do during {disfmarker} during th during the collection .
Buw001.B.dialogueact893	1653.43	1653.51	B	PhD	s^ba^t1.%	-1	0	Ow .
Buw001.D.dialogueact894	1656.4	1658.51	D	Professor	s	+1	2	And I guess the CrossPads was certainly one idea ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact895	1659.4	1661.55	D	Professor	s	-1	0	uh , and we 'll get them from him and we 'll just do that .
Buw001.D.dialogueact896	1661.69	1661.98	D	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	Right ?
Buw001.D.dialogueact897	1662.05	1666.22	D	Professor	s	-1	0	And then the next thing we talked about was the {disfmarker} was the summaries
Buw001.D.dialogueact898	1667.01	1671.53	D	Professor	qh	-1	0	and are we gonna do anything about that .
Buw001.A.dialogueact899	1672.45	1676.08	A	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , before we leave the CrossPads and {disfmarker} and call it done .
Buw001.D.dialogueact900	1674.35	1674.81	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Buw001.A.dialogueact901	1676.64	1683.57	A	Professor	s.x	-1	0	So , if I 'm collecting data then there is this question of do I use CrossPads ?
Buw001.D.dialogueact902	1678.32	1678.62	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.A.dialogueact903	1684.39	1695.92	A	Professor	s	-1	0	So , I think that if we really seriously have me collect data and I can't use CrossPads , it 's probably less useful for you guys to go to the trouble of using it ,
Buw001.A.dialogueact904	1696.81	1700.16	A	Professor	fh|s^df.%--	-1	0	um , unless you think that the CrossPads are gonna {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact905	1700.38	1700.46	A	Professor	%--	-1	0	n
Buw001.A.dialogueact906	1701.58	1703.22	A	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I 'm not {disfmarker} I 'm not sure what they 're gonna do .
Buw001.A.dialogueact907	1703.22	1706.0	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but having a small percentage of the data with it ,
Buw001.A.dialogueact908	1706.0	1708.81	A	Professor	s	-1	0	I 'm not sure whether that 's useful or not .
Buw001.A.dialogueact910	1709.17	1710.36	A	Professor	s^bd^df^rt	-1	0	Maybe {disfmarker} maybe it 's no big deal .
Buw001.D.dialogueact909	1709.1	1709.42	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	What {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact911	1710.36	1711.97	A	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Maybe we just do it and see what happens .
Buw001.D.dialogueact912	1712.33	1718.94	D	Professor	s	+1	0	I guess the point was to try {disfmarker} again , to try to collect more information that could be useful later for {disfmarker} for the UI stuff .
Buw001.A.dialogueact913	1718.92	1719.34	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.D.dialogueact914	1719.55	1720.92	D	Professor	s	-1	0	So it 's sort of Landay supplying it
Buw001.D.dialogueact915	1720.92	1723.28	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so that Landay 's stuff can be easier to do .
Buw001.A.dialogueact916	1722.33	1722.62	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.D.dialogueact917	1723.28	1726.93	D	Professor	s	-1	0	So it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} Right now he 's g operating from zero ,
Buw001.A.dialogueact918	1726.07	1726.5	A	Professor	s^2	-1	0	Nothing .
Buw001.D.dialogueact919	1726.93	1731.93	D	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	and so even if we didn't get it done from UW , it seems like that would {disfmarker} could still {disfmarker} You shou
Buw001.A.dialogueact920	1731.68	1732.03	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Buw001.D.dialogueact921	1731.93	1732.79	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	I mean , at least try it .
Buw001.B.dialogueact922	1732.86	1736.39	B	PhD	s	+1	0	I think it 'd be useful to have a small amount of it just as a proof of concept .
Buw001.D.dialogueact923	1734.62	1734.94	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.B.dialogueact924	1736.39	1736.58	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	It will {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact925	1736.9	1737.37	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.A.dialogueact928	1737.45	1737.83	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Buw001.B.dialogueact927	1737.12	1738.5	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	You know , what you can do with things .
Buw001.G.dialogueact926	1736.96	1739.99	G	Grad	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and they seem to {pause} not be able to give enough of them away ,
Buw001.G.dialogueact929	1739.99	1741.8	G	Grad	s	-1	0	so we could probably get more as well .
Buw001.B.dialogueact930	1741.37	1745.29	B	PhD	s^aa|s^cs	-1	0	Yeah . But not {disfmarker} not to rely on them for {pause} basic modeling .
Buw001.A.dialogueact931	1741.96	1742.61	A	Professor	s^na	-1	0	That 's true .
Buw001.A.dialogueact932	1742.61	1747.79	A	Professor	s	-1	0	So if it {disfmarker} if it seems to be really useful to you guys , we could probably get a donation to me .
Buw001.G.dialogueact933	1747.9	1748.63	G	Grad	s^aa|s^no	-1	0	Yeah , I 'm not sure .
Buw001.G.dialogueact934	1748.63	1751.35	G	Grad	s	-1	0	I think it it {disfmarker} it will again depend on Landay ,
Buw001.G.dialogueact935	1751.35	1753.01	G	Grad	s	-1	0	and if he has a student who 's interested ,
Buw001.G.dialogueact936	1753.01	1754.38	G	Grad	s	-1	0	and how much infrastructure we 'll need .
Buw001.G.dialogueact937	1754.69	1756.19	G	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , if it 's easy , we can just do it .
Buw001.D.dialogueact938	1756.54	1756.81	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.G.dialogueact939	1756.96	1759.62	G	Grad	s	-1	0	Um , but if it requires a lot of our time , we probably won't do it .
Buw001.A.dialogueact940	1760.2	1760.46	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.D.dialogueact941	1760.22	1762.27	D	Professor	s	+1	1	I guess a lot of the stuff we 're doing now really is pilot
Buw001.D.dialogueact942	1762.36	1763.23	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	in one sense or another .
Buw001.G.dialogueact943	1762.53	1764.61	G	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yeah . Yeah , we have to sort of figure out what we 're gonna do .
Buw001.D.dialogueact944	1763.29	1765.13	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	And so we try it out and see how it works .
Buw001.G.dialogueact945	1764.61	1764.93	G	Grad	qy^d^g	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.A.dialogueact946	1765.33	1765.73	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.B.dialogueact947	1766.28	1768.72	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	I just wouldn't base any of the modeling on having those .
Buw001.A.dialogueact949	1769.17	1769.5	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.B.dialogueact950	1769.21	1769.48	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.G.dialogueact948	1768.95	1770.48	G	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Right . I ag I think I agree with that .
Buw001.B.dialogueact951	1769.89	1770.12	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	It 's just {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact952	1770.7	1771.03	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.A.dialogueact953	1771.63	1772.01	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Buw001.G.dialogueact954	1771.97	1774.67	G	Grad	s^ba	+1	0	I think , though , the importance marking is a {pause} good idea , though .
Buw001.G.dialogueact955	1775.62	1777.94	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	That if {disfmarker} if people have something in front of them {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact956	1776.2	1777.04	B	PhD	s^ba^na	-1	0	I 'd be sort of cool .
Buw001.B.dialogueact957	1777.28	1777.69	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , it would {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact958	1778.35	1778.79	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.B.dialogueact959	1779.24	1780.53	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	That w shouldn't be hard for {disfmarker}
Buw001.G.dialogueact960	1780.39	1780.62	G	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.G.dialogueact961	1781.31	1783.84	G	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	Do it on pilots or laptops or something .
Buw001.G.dialogueact962	1785.84	1787.58	G	Grad	s^j:s^cs	-1	0	OK , if something 's important everyone clap .
Buw001.A.dialogueact963	1790.39	1793.37	A	Professor	fg|s^t^tc	+1	1	OK . So CrossPads , we 're just gonna try it and see what happens .
Buw001.D.dialogueact964	1790.66	1791.01	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Buw001.G.dialogueact965	1793.06	1793.96	G	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yeah . Um , I think that 's right .
Buw001.A.dialogueact967	1794.36	1794.79	A	Professor	s^bk.%	-1	0	OK .
Buw001.D.dialogueact966	1794.27	1794.74	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Buw001.A.dialogueact968	1794.79	1796.17	A	Professor	s^t^tc.%--	-1	0	The note - taking {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact969	1796.72	1800.6	A	Professor	s	-1	0	So , I {disfmarker} I think that this is gonna be useful .
Buw001.A.dialogueact970	1800.66	1803.43	A	Professor	s	-1	0	So if we record data I will definitely ask for it .
Buw001.A.dialogueact971	1803.95	1813.48	A	Professor	s^cs:qy	+1	3	So , I j I think we should just say this is not {disfmarker} we don't want to put any extra burden on people , but if they happen to generate minutes , could {disfmarker} could they send it to us ?
Buw001.G.dialogueact972	1807.05	1807.26	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.G.dialogueact973	1811.46	1812.39	G	Grad	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	Oh , OK . That 's fine .
Buw001.G.dialogueact974	1813.41	1813.97	G	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Absolutely .
Buw001.C.dialogueact976	1813.93	1814.32	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.D.dialogueact975	1813.66	1814.07	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.A.dialogueact977	1814.93	1815.42	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	And then {disfmarker}
Buw001.G.dialogueact978	1815.26	1818.87	G	Grad	fg|s	+1	1	Yeah . What I was gonna say is that I don't want to ask people to do something they wouldn't normally do in a meeting .
Buw001.G.dialogueact979	1819.21	1821.71	G	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's ver I just want to keep away from the artificiality .
Buw001.D.dialogueact981	1822.03	1822.5	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.G.dialogueact980	1821.71	1823.96	G	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	But I think it {pause} definitely

Buw001.G.dialogueact1039	1902.05	1903.9	G	Grad	s	-1	0	and you have to hook them up to the recorder .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1040	1904.4	1906.37	G	Grad	s	-1	0	So , if they 're already here I think that 's good ,

Buw001.G.dialogueact1041	1906.37	1909.16	G	Grad	s	-1	0	but if they 're not already here for {disfmarker} I 'd rather do email .

Buw001.H.dialogueact1043	1909.62	1913.31	H	Postdoc	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , I 'd just try {disfmarker} Well , however the least intrusive and {disfmarker} and quickest way is ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact1045	1913.37	1915.29	H	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	and th and closest to the meeting time too ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact1046	1915.29	1917.78	H	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	cuz people will start to forget it as soon as they l leave .

Buw001.E.dialogueact1187	2091.93	2092.23	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	Sounds {disfmarker}
Buw001.E.dialogueact1188	2093.21	2093.49	E	PhD	s^bk^t3	-1	0	OK .
Buw001.E.dialogueact1189	2093.49	2094.69	E	PhD	s^ft^t3|s^t3	-1	0	h Thanks , bye .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1190	2097.5	2098.95	A	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's not a lot of time ,
Buw001.E.dialogueact1191	2098.32	2098.65	E	PhD	s	-1	0	That 's that .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1192	2098.95	2099.18	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact1193	2099.51	2099.81	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1194	2100.5	2102.55	G	Grad	s^t^tc	-1	0	Well , in answer to " is it Landay 's problem ? " ,
Buw001.G.dialogueact1195	2102.55	2106.16	G	Grad	s	-1	0	um , he doesn't have a student who 's interested right now in doing anything .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1196	2106.16	2107.82	G	Grad	s	-1	0	So he has very little manpower .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1197	2108.38	2111.25	G	Grad	s	-1	0	Um , there 's very little allocated for him
Buw001.G.dialogueact1198	2111.79	2114.02	G	Grad	s	-1	0	and also he 's pretty focused on user interface .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1199	2114.02	2116.53	G	Grad	s	-1	0	So I don't think he wants to do information retrieval ,
Buw001.G.dialogueact1200	2117.38	2118.21	G	Grad	s	-1	0	query generation , that sort of stuff .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1201	2119.19	2122.19	D	Professor	fg|s^arp	-1	0	Yeah , well there 's gonna be these student projects that can do some things
Buw001.D.dialogueact1202	2122.19	2123.39	D	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	but it can't be , yeah , very deep .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1203	2123.99	2141.88	D	Professor	s	+1	1	u I {disfmarker} I actually think that {disfmarker} that , uh , again , just as a bootstrap , {comment} if we do have something like summaries , then having the people who are involved in the meetings themselves , who are cooperative and willing to do yet more , come up with {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} with queries , uh , could at least give {disfmarker} give Landay an idea of the kind of things that people might want to know .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1204	2142.81	2143.26	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , ye
Buw001.D.dialogueact1205	2143.26	2143.43	D	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Right ?
Buw001.D.dialogueact1206	2143.43	2149.85	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	If he doesn't know anything about the area , and {disfmarker} the people are talking about and {disfmarker} and , uh {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact1207	2149.27	2154.32	B	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	But the people will just look at the summaries or the minutes and re and sort of back - generate the queries .
Buw001.B.dialogueact1208	2154.32	2155.32	B	PhD	s	-1	0	That 's what I 'm worried about .
Buw001.B.dialogueact1209	2155.32	2157.06	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	So you might as well just give him the summaries .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1210	2155.79	2156.19	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.B.dialogueact1211	2157.79	2158.17	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact1212	2158.06	2158.52	D	Professor	s^am	-1	0	Maybe .
Buw001.F.dialogueact1213	2159.06	2160.92	F	PhD	s^no	-1	0	Well , I 'm not sure {disfmarker} I 'm not sure that 's a solved problem .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1214	2159.15	2159.78	G	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	y Well , but I think {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact1216	2161.23	2161.83	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Buw001.F.dialogueact1215	2161.04	2161.23	F	PhD	qy^d^g	-1	0	Right ?
Buw001.F.dialogueact1217	2161.23	2163.45	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Of how to {disfmarker} how to generate queries from a {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact1218	2162.17	2162.63	B	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	How to do this
Buw001.B.dialogueact1221	2163.52	2164.12	B	PhD	s^2	-1	0	from the summary .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1220	2163.32	2163.67	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1219	2163.09	2163.48	G	Grad	%-	-1	0	I , uh {disfmarker}
Buw001.F.dialogueact1222	2164.06	2166.97	F	PhD	s	-1	0	That was sort of what my {pause} question was {pause} aimed towards .
Buw001.B.dialogueact1223	2165.22	2176.23	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So what you want to h to do is , people who were there , who later see , uh , minutes and s put in summary form , which is not gonna be at the same time as the meeting . There 's no way that can happen . Are we gonna later go over it
Buw001.A.dialogueact1224	2166.5	2166.79	A	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Hmm .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1226	2174.35	2174.59	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1225	2174.12	2174.35	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.B.dialogueact1227	2176.24	2179.81	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and , like , make up some stuff to which these notes would be an answer ,
Buw001.B.dialogueact1228	2180.24	2181.41	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	or {disfmarker} or a deeper {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact1229	2181.87	2182.2	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.B.dialogueact1231	2182.51	2182.75	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	I mean {disfmarker}
Buw001.G.dialogueact1230	2182.21	2184.81	G	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	Or {disfmarker} or just a memory refresher .
Buw001.B.dialogueact1232	2183.42	2185.66	B	PhD	s	-1	0	But that 's done off {disfmarker} they have to do that off - line .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1233	2185.73	2186.71	G	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yep . I agree .
Buw001.B.dialogueact1235	2187.59	2187.97	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	You
Buw001.H.dialogueact1234	2187.14	2190.51	H	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	1	I 'm also wondering if we could ask the {disfmarker} the people a {disfmarker} a question
Buw001.H.dialogueact1236	2190.51	2194.78	H	Postdoc	s^cs^e:qw	+1	1	which would be " what was the most interesting thing you got out of this meeting ? "
Buw001.H.dialogueact1237	2196.32	2197.97	H	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	Becau - in terms of like informativeness ,
Buw001.B.dialogueact1238	2196.82	2197.44	B	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That 's a good one .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1239	2197.97	2204.31	H	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	it might be , you know , that the summary would {disfmarker} would not in even include what the person thought was the most interesting fact .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1240	2203.5	2205.16	D	Professor	s	-1	0	I would think that would be the most likely thing .
Buw001.B.dialogueact1241	2204.39	2206.24	B	PhD	s^j	-1	0	Dan doesn't know what sex he is .
Buw001.E.dialogueact1242	2206.84	2207.41	E	PhD	s^j^na	-1	0	Yeah , really .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1243	2208.05	2214.13	A	Professor	s^na	-1	0	But actually I would say that 's a better thing to ask than have them summarize the meeting .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1244	2214.3	2215.93	H	Postdoc	s^df^na	-1	0	I think you get two different types of information .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1245	2215.44	2216.01	A	Professor	s^m.%--	-1	0	You get two {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact1246	2216.01	2216.82	A	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yeah , that 's true .
Buw001.E.dialogueact1247	2216.21	2216.41	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1248	2216.53	2220.83	H	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	Because you get , like , the general structure of important points and what the {disfmarker} what the meeting was about .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1249	2220.16	2220.35	D	Professor	s^t3	-1	0	Hey .
Buw001.B.dialogueact1250	2221.25	2221.82	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	Ah
Buw001.D.dialogueact1251	2221.53	2221.72	D	Professor	s^aa^t3	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1252	2221.55	2222.11	G	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	We 're still here .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1253	2223.24	2227.19	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So you get the general structure , the important points of what the meeting was about {pause} with the summary .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1254	2227.63	2229.89	H	Postdoc	qh	-1	0	But with the " what 's the most interesting thing you learned ? " {disfmarker}
Buw001.H.dialogueact1255	2230.21	2235.95	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Uh , so the fact that , uh , I know that Transcriber uses Snack is something that I thought was interesting
Buw001.B.dialogueact1256	2233.43	2234.35	B	PhD	s^t3	-1	0	Going to see the kids .
Buw001.E.dialogueact1257	2234.07	2234.93	E	PhD	s^t3	-1	0	You {disfmarker} you can keep it on .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1258	2235.95	2237.93	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and that {disfmarker} and that Dan worked on {disfmarker} on that .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1259	2238.24	2239.3	H	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	So I thought that was really {disfmarker}
Buw001.H.dialogueact1260	2239.77	2239.93	H	Postdoc	s^f	-1	0	you know .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1261	2239.93	2244.58	H	Postdoc	s	+1	0	So , I mean , you could ge pick up some of the micro items that wouldn't even occur as major headings
Buw001.A.dialogueact1262	2242.84	2243.38	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1263	2244.88	2246.38	H	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	but could be very informative .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1264	2250.81	2252.25	A	Professor	s^aa|s^ba^na	-1	0	Yeah , that 's actually a really good idea .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1265	2253.24	2255.47	H	Postdoc	s^df^e	+1	0	I think it wouldn't be too , uh , uh , cost - intensive either .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1266	2255.47	2258.6	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	You know , I mean , it 's like something someone can do pretty easily on the spur of the moment .
Buw001.C.dialogueact1267	2261.51	2264.12	C	Professor	qr	-1	0	Are you thinking about just asking one participant or all of them ?
Buw001.G.dialogueact1268	2264.8	2265.91	G	Grad	s	-1	0	As many are willing to do it .
Buw001.C.dialogueact1269	2267.57	2268.77	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Make it a voluntary thing ,
Buw001.E.dialogueact1270	2267.74	2267.97	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.E.dialogueact1271	2267.97	2270.49	E	PhD	s^df|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Cuz you 'll get {disfmarker} cuz you 'll get very different answers from everybody , right ?
Buw001.C.dialogueact1272	2268.77	2269.18	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	and then {disfmarker}
Buw001.C.dialogueact1273	2270.36	2271.94	C	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah . That 's why I was wondering .
Buw001.E.dialogueact1274	2270.81	2270.96	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Buw001.G.dialogueact1275	2271.68	2274.63	G	Grad	s^cs.%--	-1	0	Well , maybe one thing we could do is for the meetings we 've already done {disfmarker}
Buw001.G.dialogueact1276	2275.58	2277.77	G	Grad	s^bd	-1	0	I mean , I {disfmarker} we didn't take minutes and we don't have summaries .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1277	2277.77	2282.0	G	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	But , uh , people could , like , listen to them a little bit and {pause} generate some queries .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1278	2283.12	2283.29	H	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1279	2285.25	2286.21	G	Grad	s	-1	0	Of course Jane doesn't need to .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1280	2286.21	2288.29	G	Grad	s	-1	0	I 'm sure you have that meeting memorized by now .
Buw001.E.dialogueact1281	2287.84	2288.2	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1282	2290.83	2295.97	A	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	But actually it would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say {pause} what was the most interesting thing you learned ,
Buw001.G.dialogueact1283	2291.4	2291.8	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1284	2296.87	2296.96	H	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1285	2297.04	2297.1	H	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1286	2298.3	2299.92	A	Professor	s^e	-1	0	for those pe people willing to stay .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1287	2301.03	2303.14	H	Postdoc	s^na.%--	-1	0	And that {disfmarker} I think it would pick up the micro - structure , the {disfmarker}
Buw001.H.dialogueact1288	2303.99	2305.46	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	some {disfmarker} some of the little things that would be hidden .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1289	2304.65	2307.58	A	Professor	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and that might be something people are willing to stay for .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1290	2308.93	2310.53	D	Professor	s^no.%-	-1	0	Boy , I {disfmarker} I don't know how we get at this {disfmarker}
Buw001.H.dialogueact1291	2309.21	2309.91	H	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	That would be interesting .
Buw001.C.dialogueact1293	2309.99	2313.93	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , but when you go around the room you might just get the effect that somebody says something
Buw001.G.dialogueact1292	2309.71	2310.82	G	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	Or want to get up and leave .
Buw001.C.dialogueact1294	2313.93	2316.78	C	Professor	s:s^aa|s^na	-1	0	and then you go around the room and they say " yeah , me too , I agree . "
Buw001.G.dialogueact1295	2314.6	2315.61	G	Grad	s^2:s	-1	0	Me too , me too , me too .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1296	2317.0	2317.47	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1298	2317.58	2318.2	A	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	That 's fine .
Buw001.C.dialogueact1299	2317.82	2318.18	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Buw001.E.dialogueact1297	2317.43	2319.58	E	PhD	s|qy^d^g	-1	0	On the other hand people might try and come up with different ones , right ?
Buw001.D.dialogueact1300	2318.8	2319.1	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Buw001.E.dialogueact1301	2319.58	2320.77	E	PhD	s:s	-1	0	They might say " oh , I was gonna say that one
Buw001.E.dialogueact1303	2320.77	2321.66	E	PhD	s^e:s	-1	0	but now I have to think of something else " .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1302	2320.43	2320.72	G	Grad	%-	-1	0	Well ,
Buw001.G.dialogueact1304	2321.75	2324.21	G	Grad	s	-1	0	you have the other thing , that {disfmarker} that they know why we 're doing it .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1305	2325.07	2330.48	G	Grad	s^e	+1	1	We 'll {disfmarker} I mean , we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll be telling them that the reason we 're trying to do this is {disfmarker} is to d generate queries in the future ,
Buw001.G.dialogueact1306	2330.48	2332.95	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	so try to pick things that other people didn't say .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1307	2334.07	2334.76	D	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's gonna take some thought .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1308	2334.76	2335.08	D	Professor	%--	-1	0	I mean ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact1309	2336.26	2347.23	D	Professor	s	-1	0	It seemed {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The kind of , uh , interest that I had in this thing initially was , uh , that i basically the form that you 're doing something else {pause} later ,
Buw001.A.dialogueact1310	2347.92	2348.44	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1311	2348.22	2352.69	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and you want to pick up something from this meeting related to the something else .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1312	2353.11	2356.84	D	Professor	s	-1	0	So it 's really the imp the {disfmarker} the list of what 's important 's in the something else
Buw001.A.dialogueact1314	2357.24	2357.74	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1315	2357.33	2357.97	D	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	rather than the {disfmarker}
Buw001.E.dialogueact1313	2357.09	2357.33	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1316	2358.03	2360.99	D	Professor	s	+1	0	And it might be something minor {disfmarker} of minor importance to the meeting .
Buw001.C.dialogueact1318	2361.72	2361.91	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1317	2361.29	2361.54	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1319	2361.95	2368.62	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , in fact if {disfmarker} if it was really major , if it 's the thing that really stuck in your head , then you might not need to go back and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and check on it even .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1320	2369.45	2372.1	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So it 's {disfmarker} it 's that you 're trying to find {disfmarker} {comment} You 're {disfmarker} you 've now {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact1321	2372.18	2373.05	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	You weren't interested {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact1322	2373.05	2375.52	D	Professor	s:s	-1	0	Say I {disfmarker} I said " well , I wasn't that much interested in dialogue ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact1323	2375.52	2376.74	D	Professor	s^e:s	-1	0	I 'm more of an acoustics person " .
Buw001.E.dialogueact1324	2376.06	2376.35	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1325	2377.2	2384.39	D	Professor	s^e:qw	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but thr three months from now if for some reason I get really interested in dialogue , and I 'm " well what is {disfmarker} what was that part that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that , uh , Mari was saying ? "
Buw001.G.dialogueact1326	2383.07	2386.09	G	Grad	fg|s.%-:s.%-	-1	0	Yeah , like Jim Bass says " add a few lines on dialogue in your next perf "
Buw001.A.dialogueact1327	2383.99	2384.25	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact1328	2385.34	2385.66	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1329	2386.43	2386.71	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1330	2387.3	2387.59	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1331	2392.95	2395.4	D	Professor	s	+1	0	And then I 'm trying to fi I mean , that 's {disfmarker} that 's when I look {disfmarker} in general when I look things up most , is when it 's something that {vocalsound} didn't really stick in my head the first time around
Buw001.D.dialogueact1332	2395.4	2401.24	D	Professor	s	+1	1	and {disfmarker} but for some {comment} new reason I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm interested in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the old stuff .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1333	2401.77	2403.87	G	Grad	s	-1	0	But that {disfmarker} that 's gonna be very hard to generate .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1335	2402.35	2404.82	A	Professor	s^na	-1	0	Well , I {disfmarker} That 's hard to generate
Buw001.D.dialogueact1334	2402.12	2403.19	D	Professor	s^no	-1	0	So , I don't {disfmarker} I don't know .
Buw001.C.dialogueact1337	2403.92	2404.4	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.F.dialogueact1336	2403.65	2403.83	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	Do we {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact1338	2404.82	2408.95	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and I think that 's half of what i I would use it for .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1339	2408.95	2415.18	A	Professor	s:s	-1	0	But I also a lot of times um , make {disfmarker} you know , think to myself " this is interesting ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact1340	2411.07	2411.48	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1341	2415.18	2418.03	A	Professor	s^e:s	-1	0	I 've gotta come back and follow up on it " .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1342	2416.97	2417.47	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1343	2418.4	2418.8	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1344	2418.99	2426.74	A	Professor	s	-1	0	So , things that I think are interesting , um , I would be , uh , wanting to do a query about .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1345	2427.62	2430.47	A	Professor	s	-1	0	And also , I like the idea of going around the room ,
Buw001.A.dialogueact1346	2430.87	2435.11	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because if somebody else thought something was interesting , I 'd kind of want to know about it
Buw001.A.dialogueact1347	2435.11	2436.39	A	Professor	s^df^e	-1	0	and then I 'd want to follow up on it .
Buw001.E.dialogueact1348	2436.83	2437.14	E	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Hmm .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1349	2438.25	2440.3	D	Professor	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah . That {disfmarker} that might get at some of what I was {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact1350	2440.75	2449.16	D	Professor	s	-1	0	I was concerned about , uh , being interested in something later that w uh , I didn't consider to be important the first time ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact1351	2449.16	2451.15	D	Professor	s	-1	0	which for me is actually the dominant thing ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact1352	2451.15	2454.99	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because if I thought it was really important it tends to stick more than if I didn't ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact1353	2454.99	2458.08	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but some new {pause} task comes along that makes me want to look up .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1354	2456.17	2456.38	G	Grad	%-	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Buw001.G.dialogueact1355	2457.56	2460.11	G	Grad	s	-1	0	But what 's interesting to me may not b have been interesting to you .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1356	2459.95	2462.97	D	Professor	s^aa|s^cs	-1	0	Yeah . So having multiple people might get at some of that .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1357	2460.11	2461.29	G	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	By {disfmarker} so by going around {disfmarker}
Buw001.G.dialogueact1358	2461.29	2461.5	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1359	2462.97	2463.03	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1360	2463.14	2465.12	G	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , I {disfmarker} I think {pause} you can't get at all of it ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact1362	2465.57	2465.88	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1361	2465.12	2465.42	G	Grad	qy^d^g	-1	0	right ?
Buw001.G.dialogueact1363	2466.06	2467.52	G	Grad	s	-1	0	W we just need to start somewhere .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1364	2467.9	2469.12	D	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yeah , and this is a starting point .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1366	2468.0	2468.15	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Buw001.F.dialogueact1365	2468.0	2475.58	F	PhD	qh	-1	0	The question {disfmarker} the question then is h h how much bias do we introduce by {disfmarker} you know , introduce by saying , you know , this was important now
Buw001.F.dialogueact1367	2475.58	2477.75	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and , you know , maybe tha something else is important later ?
Buw001.D.dialogueact1368	2478.19	2478.52	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.F.dialogueact1369	2478.23	2480.89	F	PhD	qy	-1	0	I mean , does it {disfmarker} does the bias matter ?
Buw001.F.dialogueact1370	2481.37	2482.35	F	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I don't know .
Buw001.F.dialogueact1371	2482.77	2485.08	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , uh , that 's , I guess , a question for you guys .
Buw001.F.dialogueact1372	2485.24	2485.45	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Buw001.H.dialogueact1373	2485.7	2489.18	H	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	Well , and {disfmarker} and one thing , we {disfmarker} we 're saying " important " and we 're saying " interesting " .
Buw001.F.dialogueact1375	2489.91	2490.42	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Uh , yeah , yeah .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1374	2489.67	2491.42	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and those {disfmarker} those can be two different things .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1377	2491.7	2492.09	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.F.dialogueact1376	2491.38	2491.92	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Sure , sure .
Buw001.F.dialogueact1378	2492.1	2495.34	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I guess that 's the question , really , is that {disfmarker} I mean ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact1379	2494.26	2494.52	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1380	2496.69	2497.3	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	W
Buw001.F.dialogueact1381	2496.88	2505.06	F	PhD	qy	-1	0	does building queries based on what 's important now introduce an irreversible bias on being able to do what Morgan wants to do later ?
Buw001.D.dialogueact1383	2505.28	2506.28	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , irreversible .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1382	2505.16	2505.57	H	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK , good .
Buw001.F.dialogueact1384	2505.74	2506.3	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact1386	2506.28	2515.82	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean , I guess what I what I {disfmarker} I keep coming back to in my own mind is that , um , the soonest we can do it , we need to get up some kind of system
Buw001.H.dialogueact1385	2506.21	2506.35	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.F.dialogueact1387	2507.39	2507.72	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1388	2516.46	2520.61	D	Professor	s	+1	0	so that people who 've been involved in the meeting can go back later ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact1389	2521.03	2523.06	D	Professor	s^e	+1	0	even if it 's a poor system in some ways ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact1390	2523.14	2526.47	D	Professor	s	+1	0	and , uh {disfmarker} and ask the questions that they actually want to know .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1391	2527.43	2536.78	D	Professor	s	+1	1	If {disfmarker} you know , if {disfmarker} uh , as soon as we can get that going at any kind of level , then I think we 'll have a much better handle on what kind of questions people want to ask than in any {disfmarker} anything we do before that .
Buw001.D.dialogueact1392	2536.78	2539.27	D	Professor	s	-1	0	But obviously we have to bootstrap somehow ,

Buw001.B.dialogueact1960	3415.86	3416.16	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1959	3415.85	3417.53	G	Grad	s	-1	0	And I want to try to stay away from that .
Buw001.G.dialogueact1962	3417.57	3417.76	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact1963	3420.38	3420.79	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1964	3421.38	3422.75	A	Professor	s^ba|s	-1	0	Great . That solves that problem .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1965	3423.14	3424.09	A	Professor	s^t	-1	0	One less action item .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1966	3426.86	3427.56	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact1967	3429.52	3432.84	A	Professor	fg|s^t	-1	0	OK . I think that 's good enou that 's {disfmarker} that 's pretty much all I can think of .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1968	3432.83	3434.22	H	Postdoc	qy	-1	0	Can I ask , uh , one thing ?
Buw001.H.dialogueact1969	3434.22	3435.89	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It relates to data {disfmarker} data collection
Buw001.H.dialogueact1970	3435.89	3439.15	H	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and I {disfmarker} and I 'd {disfmarker} and we mentioned earlier today , this question of {disfmarker}
Buw001.H.dialogueact1971	3439.58	3440.22	H	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	um , so ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact1972	3440.86	3448.4	H	Postdoc	s	+1	0	um , I s I know that from {disfmarker} with the near - field mikes some of the problems that come with overlapping speech , uh , are lessened .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1973	3448.8	3463.47	H	Postdoc	qr^cs	-1	0	But I wonder if {disfmarker} Uh , is that sufficient or should we consider maybe getting some data gathered in such a way that , um , u w we would c uh , p have a meeting with less overlap than would otherwise be the case ?
Buw001.H.dialogueact1974	3463.47	3466.1	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So either by rules of participation , or whatever .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1975	3464.38	3465.27	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , yeah .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1976	3466.42	3467.91	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Now , I mean , you know , it 's true ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact1977	3467.91	3469.29	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean , we were discussing this earlier ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact1978	3469.35	3470.96	H	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	that depending on the task {disfmarker}
Buw001.H.dialogueact1979	3470.96	3474.06	H	Postdoc	s	+1	0	so if you 've got someone giving a report you 're not gonna have as much overlap .
Buw001.F.dialogueact1980	3472.0	3472.18	F	PhD	s^t1	-1	0	Adam !
Buw001.H.dialogueact1981	3474.11	3475.04	H	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	But , um ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact1982	3475.55	3479.47	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i i uh , so we 're gonna have s you know , non - overlapping samples anyway .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1983	3479.87	3489.31	H	Postdoc	qr	+1	0	But , um , in a meeting which would otherwise be highly overlapping , is the near - field mike enough or should we have some rules of participation for some of our samples to lessen the overlap ?
Buw001.D.dialogueact1984	3486.02	3486.15	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Buw001.E.dialogueact1985	3487.39	3487.54	E	PhD	s^t1.%	-1	0	turn off
Buw001.A.dialogueact1986	3490.04	3492.32	A	Professor	s	+1	1	I don't think we should have rules of participation ,
Buw001.A.dialogueact1987	3492.32	3496.44	A	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	but I think we should try to {pause} get a variety of meetings .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1988	3496.59	3504.48	A	Professor	s	+1	1	That 's something that if we get the {disfmarker} the meeting stuff going at UW , that I probably can do more than you guys ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact1989	3498.85	3499.05	H	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1990	3504.48	3507.72	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	cuz you guys are probably mostly going to get ICSI people here .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1992	3508.28	3513.39	A	Professor	s	-1	0	But we can get anybody in EE , uh , over {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact1991	3508.0	3508.31	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1993	3513.39	3518.11	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and possibly also some CS people , uh , over at UW .
Buw001.A.dialogueact1994	3518.11	3523.33	A	Professor	s	-1	0	So , I think that {disfmarker} that there 's a good chance we could get more variety .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1995	3518.61	3518.77	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Buw001.H.dialogueact1996	3521.57	3522.8	H	Postdoc	s^df.%-	-1	0	Just want to be sure there 's enough data to {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact1999	3523.92	3524.21	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Buw001.B.dialogueact1998	3523.7	3525.02	B	PhD	s	-1	0	They 're still gonna overlap ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact1997	3523.47	3523.97	H	Postdoc	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	OK , good .
Buw001.B.dialogueact2000	3525.02	3531.88	B	PhD	s	+1	0	but {disfmarker} Mark and others have said that there 's quite a lot of found data {comment} from the discourse community that has this characteristic
Buw001.B.dialogueact2001	3531.88	3533.2	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and also the political {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact2002	3534.15	3540.14	B	PhD	s	-1	0	Y you know , anything that was televised for a third party has the characteristic of not very much overlap .
Buw001.D.dialogueact2003	3534.98	3535.41	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.A.dialogueact2006	3541.13	3541.5	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.D.dialogueact2004	3540.85	3544.9	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Wasn - but w I think we were saying before also that the natural language group here had less overlap .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2005	3540.9	3541.16	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.B.dialogueact2007	3541.77	3542.31	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Buw001.D.dialogueact2008	3544.9	3547.35	D	Professor	s	+1	1	So it also depends on the style of the group of people .
Buw001.A.dialogueact2010	3546.64	3547.13	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Buw001.B.dialogueact2009	3546.46	3550.07	B	PhD	s	-1	0	Like the , um , dominance relations of the people in the meeting .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2011	3546.68	3546.82	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2012	3547.05	3548.11	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	On the task , and the task .
Buw001.G.dialogueact2015	3549.14	3549.69	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2013	3548.81	3549.09	H	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	It 's just {disfmarker}
Buw001.H.dialogueact2014	3549.09	3550.37	H	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	I just wanted to {disfmarker} uh ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact2016	3550.03	3550.36	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2017	3550.37	3555.37	H	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because you know , it is true people can modify the amount of overlap that they do if {disfmarker} if they 're asked to .
Buw001.D.dialogueact2018	3555.88	3556.16	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2019	3556.12	3557.67	H	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	Not {disfmarker} not entirely modify it ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact2020	3557.67	3559.61	H	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	but lessen it if {disfmarker} if it 's desired .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2021	3561.35	3562.9	H	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	But if {disfmarker} if that 's sufficient data {disfmarker}
Buw001.H.dialogueact2022	3562.9	3567.62	H	Postdoc	s	+1	1	I just wanted to be sure that we will not be having a lot of data which can't be processed .
Buw001.A.dialogueact2023	3573.07	3573.44	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Buw001.A.dialogueact2024	3573.44	3578.51	A	Professor	s	+1	1	So I 'm just writing here , we 're not gonna try to specify rules of interaction
Buw001.A.dialogueact2025	3578.51	3584.58	A	Professor	s	+1	1	but we 're gonna try to get more variety by i using different {pause} groups of people
Buw001.H.dialogueact2026	3581.77	3582.08	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Time .
Buw001.A.dialogueact2027	3587.91	3589.03	A	Professor	s^e^rt	+1	0	and different sizes .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2028	3589.69	3594.66	H	Postdoc	s^bk|s	-1	0	Fine . And I {disfmarker} you know , I {disfmarker} I know that the near f near - field mikes will take care of also the problems to s to a certain degree .
Buw001.A.dialogueact2029	3591.93	3592.24	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	e e
Buw001.A.dialogueact2030	3594.36	3594.49	A	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.A.dialogueact2032	3595.01	3603.85	A	Professor	s	-1	0	And then the other thing might be , um , uh , technical versus administrative .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2031	3594.66	3595.56	H	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	I just wanted to be sure .
Buw001.A.dialogueact2033	3606.17	3611.24	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Cuz if I recorded some administrative meetings then that may have less overlap ,
Buw001.A.dialogueact2034	3611.24	3615.37	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because you might have more overlap when you 're doing something technical and disagreeing or whatever .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2035	3613.14	3613.28	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2036	3614.98	3615.15	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2037	3616.46	3618.96	H	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	Well , I {disfmarker} just as {disfmarker} as {disfmarker} as a contributary {disfmarker}
Buw001.H.dialogueact2038	3619.16	3625.14	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	eh , so I {disfmarker} I know that in l in legal depositions people are pr are prevented from overlapping .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2039	3625.14	3628.39	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	They 'll just say , you know {disfmarker} you know , " wait till each person is finished before you say something " .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2040	3628.85	3630.5	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So it is possible to lessen if we wanted to .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2041	3630.5	3632.1	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but these other factors are fine .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2042	3632.35	3633.41	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I just wanted to raise the issue .
Buw001.A.dialogueact2043	3633.13	3643.75	A	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	Well , the reason why I didn't want to is be why I personally didn't want to {comment} is because I wanted it to be {pause} as , uh , unintrusive as possi
Buw001.H.dialogueact2044	3636.63	3636.85	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2045	3643.07	3643.23	H	Postdoc	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.A.dialogueact2046	3643.75	3645.57	A	Professor	s^e	-1	0	as you could be with these things hanging on you .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2047	3643.9	3644.09	H	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Oh , yeah .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2048	3646.05	3647.01	H	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	Yeah , I think that 's always desired .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2049	3647.01	3651.14	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I just want to be sure we don't {disfmarker} that we 're able to process , i u uh , you know , as much data as we can .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2050	3651.92	3651.99	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.D.dialogueact2051	3652.64	3652.74	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.D.dialogueact2052	3653.2	3656.52	D	Professor	qy	-1	0	Did they discuss any of that in the {disfmarker} the meeting they had with L Liberman ?
Buw001.B.dialogueact2054	3656.76	3657.06	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.D.dialogueact2053	3656.52	3656.7	D	Professor	qw.%-	-1	0	What {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact2056	3657.91	3659.06	B	PhD	s	-1	0	And there was a big division ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact2055	3657.47	3658.14	D	Professor	qw.%-	-1	0	What {disfmarker} what do they {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact2057	3659.06	3663.6	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so Liberman and others {pause} were interested in a lot of found data .
Buw001.D.dialogueact2058	3659.6	3659.88	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.B.dialogueact2059	3663.6	3665.16	B	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	So there 's lots of recordings that {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact2061	3665.38	3666.6	B	PhD	s	+1	1	They 're not close - talk mike ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact2060	3665.0	3665.34	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.B.dialogueact2062	3666.66	3666.86	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact2063	3667.55	3673.46	B	PhD	s	+1	0	And {disfmarker} and there 's lots of television , you know , stuff on , um , political debates and things like that ,
Buw001.B.dialogueact2064	3673.79	3675.44	B	PhD	s	+1	0	congre congressional hearings .
Buw001.B.dialogueact2065	3676.42	3677.38	B	PhD	s	-1	0	Boring stuff like that .
Buw001.B.dialogueact2066	3678.05	3678.51	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Buw001.B.dialogueact2067	3679.25	3681.86	B	PhD	s.%--	+1	0	and then the CMU folks and I were sort of on the other side in {disfmarker}
Buw001.B.dialogueact2068	3681.86	3685.33	B	PhD	s^df	+1	0	cuz they had collected a lot of meetings that were sort of like this
Buw001.B.dialogueact2069	3685.33	3687.26	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and said that those are nothing like these meetings .
Buw001.B.dialogueact2070	3687.86	3690.23	B	PhD	s	-1	0	Um , so there 're really two different kinds of data .
Buw001.B.dialogueact2071	3690.22	3700.04	B	PhD	s	+1	2	And , I guess we just left it as {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} that {pause} if there 's found data that can be transformed for use in speech recognition easily , then of course we would do it ,
Buw001.D.dialogueact2072	3698.09	3698.2	D	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.B.dialogueact2073	3700.77	3704.07	B	PhD	s	+1	0	but newly collected data would {disfmarker} would be natural meetings .
Buw001.B.dialogueact2075	3705.08	3705.19	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Buw001.D.dialogueact2074	3704.68	3707.38	D	Professor	s	+1	0	Actually , th @ @ {comment} the CMU folk have collected a lot of data .
Buw001.D.dialogueact2076	3707.38	3709.6	D	Professor	qy	-1	0	Is that {disfmarker} is that going to be publicly available ,
Buw001.B.dialogueact2077	3709.3	3711.5	B	PhD	s	-1	0	As far as I know , they h have not .
Buw001.D.dialogueact2078	3709.6	3709.71	D	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Buw001.B.dialogueact2080	3711.86	3712.65	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	Um , but e

Buw001.B.dialogueact2083	3718.15	3718.57	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Buw001.B.dialogueact2084	3719.52	3721.1	B	PhD	s	-1	0	if people were interested they could talk to them ,
Buw001.B.dialogueact2085	3721.16	3724.04	B	PhD	s	-1	0	but I {disfmarker} I got the feeling there was some politics involved .
Buw001.G.dialogueact2086	3722.87	3725.51	G	Grad	s	-1	0	I think @ @ gonna add that to one of my action items .

Buw001.H.dialogueact2148	3802.34	3802.95	H	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , OK .
Buw001.B.dialogueact2149	3803.82	3806.85	B	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , I mean , " found " has , uh , also the meaning that 's it very natural .
Buw001.B.dialogueact2150	3806.85	3808.58	B	PhD	s^e.%--	+1	0	It 's things occur without any {disfmarker}

Buw001.B.dialogueact2161	3823.45	3825.82	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because they found it {vocalsound} and it exists .
Buw001.G.dialogueact2159	3823.1	3823.28	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2160	3823.14	3823.64	H	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly .

Buw001.B.dialogueact2166	3827.18	3830.55	B	PhD	s	-1	0	Of course it 's not " found " in the sense that at the time it was collected for the purpose .
Buw001.G.dialogueact2165	3827.11	3828.27	G	Grad	s:qy	-1	0	" Psst . {comment} Want to buy a corpora ? "
Buw001.H.dialogueact2167	3830.05	3830.9	H	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah . OK , OK .
Buw001.B.dialogueact2168	3830.78	3839.9	B	PhD	s	-1	0	But what he means is that {disfmarker} You know , Mark was really a fan of getting as much data as possible from {disfmarker} you know , reams and reams of stuff , of broadcast stuff ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact2169	3830.9	3831.8	H	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	That 's interesting .

Buw001.B.dialogueact2174	3843.49	3847.0	B	PhD	s	-1	0	But he well understands that that 's very different than these {disfmarker} this type of meeting .
Buw001.G.dialogueact2175	3843.65	3844.53	G	Grad	s^na	-1	0	It 's not the same .
Buw001.B.dialogueact2176	3847.0	3848.53	B	PhD	qh^df	-1	0	But , so what ?
Buw001.B.dialogueact2177	3848.65	3850.29	B	PhD	s^df^e	-1	0	It 's still {disfmarker} it 's interesting for other reasons .

Buw001.A.dialogueact2183	3857.14	3857.56	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.D.dialogueact2182	3856.66	3856.86	D	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	Right ?
Buw001.D.dialogueact2184	3857.59	3858.57	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	Many {pause} ways .
Buw001.B.dialogueact2186	3859.73	3861.8	B	PhD	s^na	-1	0	You can {pause} tell {pause} by the {pause} prosody .
Buw001.E.dialogueact2185	3859.43	3860.83	E	PhD	s^cs.%-	-1	0	So we should go {disfmarker} go around and s
Buw001.A.dialogueact2187	3862.08	3862.38	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Buw001.E.dialogueact2188	3863.33	3865.1	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	+1	0	We should go around and say something interesting that happened at the meeting ?
Buw001.A.dialogueact2189	3866.78	3867.42	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Buw001.A.dialogueact2190	3867.42	3868.83	A	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yes , we should do that .

Buw001.G.dialogueact2192	3868.53	3870.25	G	Grad	s	-1	0	Now , I was already thinking about it ,
Buw001.G.dialogueact2193	3870.25	3870.41	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Buw001.D.dialogueact2194	3871.16	3872.5	D	Professor	s^bk^fe|s^ba	-1	0	Oh ! Good man .

Buw001.B.dialogueact2198	3874.02	3874.13	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	I {disfmarker}
Buw001.G.dialogueact2197	3873.67	3874.35	G	Grad	fg	-1	0	So , um ,
Buw001.G.dialogueact2199	3874.75	3876.3	G	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	I really liked the idea of {disfmarker}
Buw001.G.dialogueact2200	3876.3	3879.04	G	Grad	s	-1	0	what I thought was interesting was the combination of the CrossPad and the speech .
Buw001.G.dialogueact2201	3879.04	3882.9	G	Grad	s	-1	0	Especially , um , the interaction of them rather than just note - taking .
Buw001.G.dialogueact2202	3883.45	3886.97	G	Grad	qh	-1	0	So , can you {pause} determine the interesting points by who 's writing ?
Buw001.G.dialogueact2203	3887.24	3891.94	G	Grad	qh^e	-1	0	Can you do special gestures and so on that {disfmarker} that have , uh , special meaning to the corpora ?
Buw001.G.dialogueact2204	3892.04	3892.8	G	Grad	s	-1	0	I really liked that .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2205	3896.14	3899.28	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Well , I {disfmarker} I just realized there 's another category of interesting things
Buw001.H.dialogueact2206	3899.28	3900.56	H	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	which is that , um ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact2207	3901.16	3906.49	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I found this discussion very , uh , i this {disfmarker} this question of how you get at queries really interesting .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2208	3906.49	3914.07	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and the {disfmarker} and I {disfmarker} and the fact that it 's sort of , uh , nebulous , what {disfmarker} what that {disfmarker} what kind of query it would be
Buw001.H.dialogueact2209	3914.07	3915.62	H	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because it depends on what your purpose is .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2210	3915.62	3922.14	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So I actually found that whole process of {disfmarker} of trying to think of what that would involve to be interesting .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2211	3922.19	3924.24	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But that 's not really a specific fact .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2212	3924.52	3927.95	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I just sort of thought we {disfmarker} we went around a nice discussion of the factors involved there ,
Buw001.H.dialogueact2213	3927.95	3929.98	H	Postdoc	s	-1	0	which I thought was worthwhile .
Buw001.E.dialogueact2214	3930.53	3932.62	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I had a real revelation about taking pictures .
Buw001.E.dialogueact2215	3932.62	3933.34	E	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I don't know why
Buw001.E.dialogueact2216	3933.49	3934.87	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I didn't do this before and I regret it .
Buw001.E.dialogueact2217	3935.01	3936.08	E	PhD	s	-1	0	So that was very interesting for me .
Buw001.H.dialogueact2218	3936.21	3936.52	H	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Buw001.G.dialogueact2219	3936.83	3937.99	G	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Did you take pictures of the boards ?

Buw001.A.dialogueact2243	3964.6	3966.66	A	Professor	s	-1	0	I think {disfmarker} I think " pass " is socially acceptable .
Buw001.A.dialogueact2244	3966.66	3968.49	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But I will say {disfmarker} uh , I will actually {disfmarker}
Buw001.A.dialogueact2245	3969.07	3972.46	A	Professor	s	-1	0	uh , a spin on different {disfmarker} slightly different spin on what you said ,
Buw001.A.dialogueact2246	3972.53	3976.17	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	this issue of , uh , realizing that we could take minutes ,
Buw001.A.dialogueact2247	3976.69	3978.19	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and that actually may be a goal .
Buw001.A.dialogueact2248	3978.64	3982.52	A	Professor	s	-1	0	So that {disfmarker} that may be kind of the test {disfmarker} in a sense , test data ,
Buw001.A.dialogueact2249	3983.08	3988.0	A	Professor	s^e	-1	0	uh , the {disfmarker} the template of what we want to test against , generating a summary .
Buw001.A.dialogueact2250	3988.0	3990.91	A	Professor	s	-1	0	So that 's an interesting new twist on what we can do with this data .
Buw001.C.dialogueact2251	3992.74	3994.21	C	Professor	s^na	-1	0	I agree with Jane and Eric .
Buw001.C.dialogueact2252	3994.21	3998.8	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I think the question of how to generate queries automatically was the most interesting question that came up ,
Buw001.C.dialogueact2253	3998.8	4002.62	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and it 's something that , as you said , is a whole research topic in itself ,
Buw001.C.dialogueact2254	4002.62	4004.55	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so I don't think we 'll be able to do anything on it
Buw001.C.dialogueact2255	4004.55	4007.57	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because we don't have funding on it , uh , in this project .
Buw001.C.dialogueact2256	4007.65	4012.66	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	But , um , {vocalsound} it 's definitely something I would {pause} want to do something on .
Buw001.G.dialogueact2257	4012.01	4013.47	G	Grad	s	-1	0	I wonder if work 's already been done on it .

Buw001.D.dialogueact2263	4035.83	4036.89	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and not any of the facts .
Buw001.D.dialogueact2264	4036.89	4040.36	D	Professor	s	-1	0	That is , I {disfmarker} I really enjoyed hanging out with this group of people today .
