Further investigation into the lack of difference using MSG features makes should not be made while they are on their current short time scale for results.
Same goes for anything else that comes up and looks interesting , leave it for just now.
Really should pick which results are looking the best at this stage , and take only them further.
Someone should look closely at the non-TIMIT databases , their Viterbi alignments , and their phoneme strings to see is that is why TIMIT is better.
Need to get OGI's system from them , and get it running like they do , before integrating into it.
