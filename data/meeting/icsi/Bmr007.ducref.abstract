The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group focussed its discussion on overlapping speech segments.
Speaker fe008 presented raw counts and percentages for one transcribed meeting , revealing a large number of overlaps throughout the 40-plus-minute transcript.
Efforts by speakers fe008 and fe016 are in progress to categorize and subcategorize types of overlapping speech and evaluate the contribution of multiple speakers in an interaction to the amount and types of overlap observed.
Speaker me011 described his attempts to automatically identify speakers via the close-talking microphone channels using thresholding and filtering methods and an existing speaker-change detection algorithm.
The group also tentatively discussed the erection of visual barriers during meeting recordings , and speaker me013 presented a list of work performed by BMR over the previous three months to be included in a forthcoming report to IBM.
