Bmr010.B.dialogueact60	87.059	87.789	B	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact61	88.11	88.49	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bmr010.B.dialogueact62	88.92	93.35	B	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Since , uh {disfmarker} since I have to leave as usual at three - thirty , can we do the interesting stuff first ?
Bmr010.F.dialogueact63	93.646	94.766	F	Postdoc	s^br^j^rt	-1	0	I beg your pardon ?
Bmr010.G.dialogueact64	93.739	94.119	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bmr010.C.dialogueact65	94.428	94.968	C	PhD	qw.%-	-1	0	Which is {disfmarker} ?
Bmr010.A.dialogueact67	95.49	96.71	A	Grad	qw	-1	0	What 's the interesting stuff ?
Bmr010.F.dialogueact66	95.161	96.331	F	Postdoc	s^br^j^r^rt	-1	0	I beg your pardon ?
Bmr010.D.dialogueact69	96.89	96.97	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact68	96.41	98.5	G	Professor	s^aa|s^co	-1	0	Yeah . Th - now you get to tell us what 's the interesting part .
Bmr010.E.dialogueact70	97.74	98.54	E	PhD	s^co	-1	0	Please specify .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact71	98.5	98.72	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr010.B.dialogueact73	99.089	104.28	B	PhD	h|s^t	-1	0	Well , uh , I guess the work that 's been {pause} done on segmentation would be most {disfmarker}
Bmr010.C.dialogueact72	98.767	99.027	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact74	103.659	105.159	F	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	I think that would be a good thing to start with .
Bmr010.B.dialogueact75	104.63	104.82	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact76	105.482	105.792	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact77	106.431	109.651	G	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Um , and , um , {vocalsound} the other thing , uh ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact78	109.651	112.401	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	which I 'll just say very briefly that maybe relates to that a little bit ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact79	112.401	113.841	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	which is that , um ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact80	114.921	120.601	G	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh , one of the suggestions that came up in a brief meeting I had the other day when I was in Spain
Bmr010.G.dialogueact81	120.993	127.933	G	Professor	s^e	-1	0	with , uh , Manolo Pardo and {vocalsound} Javier , uh , Ferreiros , who was {pause} here before ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact82	128.552	139.166	G	Professor	s^e	-1	0	was , um , why not start with what they had before but add in the non - silence boundaries .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact83	139.666	143.756	G	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	So , in what Javier did before when they were doing , um {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact84	144.257	147.987	G	Professor	s	-1	0	h he was looking for , uh , speaker change {pause} points .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact85	148.061	148.421	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact86	148.922	149.432	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact87	150.429	160.946	G	Professor	s	-1	0	As a simplification , he originally did this only using {pause} silence as , uh , a {pause} putative , uh , speaker change point .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact88	161.28	161.47	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact89	161.603	168.703	G	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	And , uh , he did not , say , look at points where you were changing broad sp uh , phonetic class , for instance .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact90	169.507	172.237	G	Professor	s	-1	0	And for Broadcast News , that was fine .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact91	173.32	174.38	G	Professor	s	-1	0	Here obviously it 's not .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact92	175.137	175.407	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact93	175.382	181.562	G	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	And , um , so one of the things that they were pushing in d in discussing with me is , um ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact94	182.258	187.77	G	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	w why are you spending so much time , uh , on the , uh , feature issue ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact95	188.81	193.22	G	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh , when perhaps if you sort of deal with what you were using before
Bmr010.D.dialogueact96	193.502	193.782	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact97	193.824	198.814	G	Professor	s	-1	0	and then just broadened it a bit , instead of just ta using silence as putative change point also {disfmarker} ?
Bmr010.D.dialogueact99	199.311	199.811	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Nnn , yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact98	199.223	204.413	G	Professor	s	-1	0	So then you 've got {disfmarker} you already have the super - structure with Gaussians and H - you know , simple H M Ms and so forth .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact100	204.996	206.076	G	Professor	%--	-1	0	And you {disfmarker} you might {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact101	206.266	210.947	G	Professor	s	-1	0	So there was a {disfmarker} there was a little bit of a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a difference of opinion
Bmr010.G.dialogueact102	210.947	214.857	G	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because I {disfmarker} I thought that it was {disfmarker} it 's interesting to look at what features are useful .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact103	215.571	215.821	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact104	215.598	219.448	G	Professor	s	-1	0	But , uh , on the other hand I saw that the {disfmarker} they had a good point
Bmr010.G.dialogueact105	219.448	224.828	G	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	that , uh , if we had something that worked for many cases before , maybe starting from there a little bit {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact106	224.828	228.787	G	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Because ultimately we 're gonna end up {vocalsound} with some s su kind of structure like that ,
Bmr010.D.dialogueact107	226.93	227.15	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact108	228.787	230.317	G	Professor	s	-1	0	where you have some kind of simple HMM
Bmr010.G.dialogueact109	230.317	234.412	G	Professor	s	-1	0	and you 're testing the hypothesis that , {vocalsound} uh , there is a change .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact110	233.03	233.31	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact111	234.592	234.992	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact112	235.522	237.022	G	Professor	s	-1	0	so anyway , I just {disfmarker} reporting that .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact114	237.327	237.767	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact113	237.102	238.322	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	But , uh , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact115	239.155	242.095	G	Professor	qh^t^tc	-1	0	So . Yeah , why don't we do the speech - nonspeech discussion ?
Bmr010.F.dialogueact116	241.58	241.78	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact117	242.357	243.877	F	Postdoc	qy.%--	-1	0	Do {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I hear {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you didn't {disfmarker}
Bmr010.C.dialogueact118	243.059	243.979	C	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Speech - nonspeech ?
Bmr010.C.dialogueact120	244.129	244.369	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact119	244.097	244.297	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact121	244.297	244.467	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact122	245.001	255.361	C	PhD	h|s^rt	+1	2	Um , so , uh , what we basically did so far was using the mixed file to {disfmarker} to detect s speech or nonspeech {pause} portions in that .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact123	251.444	251.974	G	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact124	256.009	261.484	C	PhD	fh|s^rt	+1	0	And what I did so far is I just used our old Munich system ,
Bmr010.C.dialogueact125	261.484	266.794	C	PhD	s^e^rt	+1	1	which is an HMM - ba based system with Gaussian mixtures for s speech and nonspeech .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact126	267.526	273.146	C	PhD	s	+1	0	And it was a system which used only one Gaussian for silence and one Gaussian for speech .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact127	273.146	279.977	C	PhD	s	+1	0	And now I added , uh , multi - mixture possibility for {disfmarker} {vocalsound} for speech and nonspeech .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact128	273.551	273.831	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact129	276.77	277.12	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact130	279.977	286.99	C	PhD	s.%--	+1	0	And I did some training on {disfmarker} on one dialogue , which was transcribed by {disfmarker}
Bmr010.C.dialogueact131	287.589	290.909	C	PhD	s	+1	0	Yeah . We {disfmarker} we did a nons s speech - nonspeech transcription .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact132	287.634	288.224	D	PhD	s^2	-1	0	Jose .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact133	290.909	292.319	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	Adam , Dave , and I , we did ,
Bmr010.C.dialogueact134	292.831	293.761	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	for that dialogue
Bmr010.C.dialogueact135	293.761	294.791	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and I trained it on that .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact136	295.417	298.457	C	PhD	s	+1	1	And I did some pre - segmentations for {disfmarker} for Jane .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact137	298.457	302.187	C	PhD	s	+1	0	And I 'm not sure how good they are or what {disfmarker} what the transcribers say .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact138	302.277	303.737	C	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	They {disfmarker} they can use it
Bmr010.C.dialogueact139	303.737	304.087	C	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bmr010.F.dialogueact140	305.335	307.315	F	Postdoc	s^na	+1	1	Uh , they {disfmarker} they think it 's a terrific improvement .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact141	307.625	310.905	F	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	And , um , it real it just makes a {disfmarker} a world of difference .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact142	308.28	308.47	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact143	311.665	314.465	F	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	And , um , y you also did some something in addition
Bmr010.F.dialogueact144	314.465	318.655	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	which was , um , for those in which there {nonvocalsound} was , uh , quiet speakers in the mix .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact145	318.553	318.863	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact146	318.963	319.763	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Uh , yeah .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact147	319.763	321.203	C	PhD	s^na	-1	0	That {disfmarker} that was one {disfmarker} one {disfmarker} one thing ,
Bmr010.C.dialogueact148	321.848	325.739	C	PhD	h|s	-1	0	uh , why I added more mixtures for {disfmarker} for the speech .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact149	325.739	331.957	C	PhD	s	+1	0	So I saw that there were loud {disfmarker} loudly speaking speakers and quietly speaking speakers .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact150	326.366	326.906	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact151	331.957	336.617	C	PhD	s	+1	1	And so I did two mixtures , one for the loud speakers and one for the quiet speakers .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact152	336.139	338.729	A	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	And did you hand - label who was loud and who was quiet ,
Bmr010.A.dialogueact154	338.729	339.119	A	Grad	qrr.%-	-1	0	or did you just {disfmarker} ?
Bmr010.C.dialogueact153	338.59	341.26	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I did that for {disfmarker} for five minutes of one dialogue
Bmr010.A.dialogueact155	341.19	341.49	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact156	341.26	343.41	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and that was enough to {disfmarker} to train the system .
Bmr010.B.dialogueact158	342.413	343.816	B	PhD	qw.%-	-1	0	W What {disfmarker} ?
Bmr010.D.dialogueact157	342.254	342.614	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact159	343.41	346.581	C	PhD	s	-1	0	And so it {disfmarker} it adapts , uh , on {disfmarker} while running .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact160	346.581	346.851	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr010.B.dialogueact161	347.44	350.13	B	PhD	qw	-1	0	What kind of , uh , front - end processing did you do ?
Bmr010.C.dialogueact162	347.467	347.867	C	PhD	s^am	-1	0	Hopefully .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact163	347.671	348.081	D	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact164	350.905	356.055	C	PhD	s	+1	0	It 's just our {disfmarker} our old Munich , uh , loudness - based spectrum
Bmr010.C.dialogueact165	356.578	361.628	C	PhD	s	+1	0	on mel scale twenty {disfmarker} twenty critical bands and then loudness .
Bmr010.B.dialogueact166	362.123	362.553	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact167	362.268	367.498	C	PhD	s	+1	0	And four additional features , which is energy , loudness , modified loudness , and zero crossing rate .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact168	368.256	370.496	C	PhD	s	-1	0	So it 's twenty - four {disfmarker} twenty - four features .
Bmr010.B.dialogueact170	370.735	370.985	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact169	370.666	370.936	G	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact171	372.049	374.349	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And you also provided me with several different versions ,
Bmr010.C.dialogueact173	374.801	374.961	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact172	374.349	375.079	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	which I compared .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact174	375.311	375.571	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact175	375.478	376.868	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And so you change {nonvocalsound} parameters .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact176	376.868	377.018	F	Postdoc	qw.%-	-1	0	What {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact177	377.018	378.968	F	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	do you wanna say something about the parameters {nonvocalsound} that you change ?
Bmr010.C.dialogueact178	378.006	378.416	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact179	379.243	385.361	C	PhD	s^na	+1	1	You can specify {vocalsound} the minimum length of speech or {disfmarker} and silence portions which you want .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact180	385.511	388.741	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	And so I did some {disfmarker} some modifications in those parameters ,
Bmr010.C.dialogueact181	388.741	394.68	C	PhD	s^e	+1	1	basically changing the minimum {disfmarker} minimum {pause} length for s for silence
Bmr010.C.dialogueact182	395.235	396.385	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	to have , er
Bmr010.C.dialogueact183	396.925	397.975	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	to have , um {disfmarker}
Bmr010.C.dialogueact184	397.975	398.275	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah {disfmarker}
Bmr010.C.dialogueact185	399.775	403.455	C	PhD	s	+1	0	to have more or less , uh , silence portions in inserted .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact186	403.455	404.095	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact187	404.059	409.726	A	Grad	fg|s^bu	+1	1	Right . So this would work well for , uh , pauses and utterance boundaries and things like that .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact188	404.322	404.502	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact189	408.067	408.197	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact190	409.026	409.166	C	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact191	409.726	411.926	A	Grad	s	-1	0	But for overlap I imagine that doesn't work at all ,
Bmr010.C.dialogueact192	410.5	410.65	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact193	411.142	411.492	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact194	411.926	413.786	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	that you 'll have plenty of s sections that are {disfmarker}
Bmr010.C.dialogueact195	412.6	412.76	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact196	412.619	413.159	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact197	413.375	413.705	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	That 's it .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact199	413.995	414.135	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact198	413.552	414.252	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm , mm - hmm .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact200	414.346	414.646	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact204	415.001	415.201	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact201	414.522	414.922	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	That 's true .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact203	414.922	417.012	F	Postdoc	s^arp	+1	2	But {nonvocalsound} it {disfmarker} it saves so much time {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {nonvocalsound} transcribers
Bmr010.G.dialogueact202	414.87	415.17	G	Professor	fg	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bmr010.A.dialogueact205	416.33	416.55	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact206	417.012	418.682	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	just enormous , enormous savings .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact208	418.872	419.512	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	Fantastic .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact207	418.642	419.082	G	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	That 's great .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact209	419.803	422.113	G	Professor	fg|s^t	-1	0	Um , just qu one quickly , uh , still on the features .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact210	422.113	424.252	G	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	So {vocalsound} you have these twenty - four features .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact211	424.159	424.409	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact212	424.252	425.872	G	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , a lot of them are spectral features .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact213	425.872	429.662	G	Professor	qy	+1	0	Is there a {disfmarker} a transformation , uh , like principal components transformation or something ?
Bmr010.C.dialogueact214	429.003	429.153	C	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact216	429.835	430.915	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah . It was IS two .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact215	429.824	432.524	C	PhD	s^ar|s	+1	0	No . W w we {disfmarker} originally we did that
Bmr010.G.dialogueact217	429.842	430.132	G	Professor	%-	-1	0	Just {disfmarker}
Bmr010.C.dialogueact218	432.901	434.071	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but we saw , uh ,
Bmr010.C.dialogueact219	434.071	436.881	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	when we used it , uh , f for our close - talking microphone , which {disfmarker}
Bmr010.C.dialogueact220	437.221	438.651	C	PhD	s.%--	+1	0	yeah , for our {disfmarker} for our recognizer in Munich {disfmarker}
Bmr010.C.dialogueact221	438.895	441.265	C	PhD	s	+1	0	we saw that w it 's {disfmarker} it 's not {disfmarker} it 's not so necessary .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact222	441.265	445.785	C	PhD	s^df	+1	0	It {disfmarker} it works as well f with {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} without , uh , a LDA or something .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact223	442.912	443.182	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact224	445.873	447.523	G	Professor	s^bk|s	-1	0	OK . No , I was j {pause} curious .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact225	447.667	447.767	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact227	447.929	448.189	F	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact226	447.693	449.523	G	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah , I don't think it 's a big deal for this application ,
Bmr010.C.dialogueact229	449.733	449.883	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact230	449.799	450.059	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Right .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact228	449.523	450.643	G	Professor	%-	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} Yeah , it 's a {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact231	450.959	451.229	F	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact232	452.46	454.8	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	OK . But then there 's another thing that also Thilo 's involved with ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact233	454.8	455.44	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	which is , um {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact234	455.818	457.928	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	OK , and {disfmarker} and also Da - Dave Gelbart .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact235	457.928	459.438	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	So there 's this {disfmarker} this problem of {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact236	459.438	460.778	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and w and {disfmarker} so we had this meeting .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact237	460.778	464.698	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	Th - the {nonvocalsound} {disfmarker} also Adam , before the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} before you went away .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact238	465.008	467.798	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	Uh we , um {disfmarker} regarding the representation {nonvocalsound} of overlaps ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact239	467.798	472.7	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	because at present , {nonvocalsound} {vocalsound} um , because {nonvocalsound} of the limitations of {vocalsound} th the interface we 're using ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact240	472.98	482.086	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	overlaps are , uh , not being {nonvocalsound} encoded by {nonvocalsound} the transcribers in as complete {nonvocalsound} and , uh , detailed a way as it might be ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact241	482.146	485.566	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and as might be desired {disfmarker} I think would be desired in the corpus ultimately .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact242	485.176	485.536	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact243	485.847	488.607	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	So we don't have start and end points {nonvocalsound} at each point where there 's an overlap .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact244	488.607	491.947	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	We just have the {disfmarker} the {nonvocalsound} overlaps {nonvocalsound} encoded in a simple bin .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact245	492.471	505.977	F	Postdoc	fh|s^cs	+1	0	Well , OK . So {nonvocalsound} @ @ the limits of the {nonvocalsound} over of {disfmarker} of the interface are {vocalsound} such that we were {disfmarker} at this meeting we were entertaining how we might either expand {nonvocalsound} the {disfmarker} the {vocalsound} interface or find other tools which already {pause} do what would be useful .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact246	506.157	509.761	F	Postdoc	s.%--	+1	0	Because what would ultimately be , um , ideal in my {disfmarker} my view
Bmr010.F.dialogueact247	509.761	511.841	F	Postdoc	s.%--	+1	0	and I think {disfmarker} I mean , I had the sense that it was consensus ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact248	511.841	516.301	F	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	0	is that , um , a thorough - going musical score notation would be {nonvocalsound} the best way to go .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact249	516.788	518.908	F	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	Because {nonvocalsound} you can have multiple channels ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact250	518.908	520.078	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	there 's a single time - line ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact251	520.078	522.408	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	it 's very clear , flexible , and all those nice things .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact252	521.1	521.47	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact253	522.97	523.97	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	OK . So , um ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact254	524.562	533.62	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	um , I spoke {disfmarker} I had a meeting with Dave Gelbart on {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} and he had , uh , excellent ideas on how {pause} the interface could be {pause} modified to {disfmarker} to do this kind of representation .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact255	534.029	542.014	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But , um , he {disfmarker} in the meantime you were checking into the existence of already , um , existing interfaces which might already have these properties .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact256	542.124	543.324	F	Postdoc	fh|qy	-1	0	So , do you wanna say something about that ?
Bmr010.C.dialogueact257	543.58	544.26	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact258	544.26	554.057	C	PhD	fh|s^rt	-1	0	Um , I {vocalsound} talked with , uh , Munich guys from {disfmarker} from Ludwi - Ludwig Maximilians University , who do a lot of transcribing and transliterations .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact259	551.575	551.905	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact260	554.63	560.282	C	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	And they basically said they have {disfmarker} they have , uh , a tool they developed {pause} themselves
Bmr010.C.dialogueact261	560.598	563.168	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and they can't give away , uh , f it 's too error - prone ,
Bmr010.C.dialogueact262	563.168	565.458	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and had {disfmarker} it 's not supported ,
Bmr010.C.dialogueact263	565.458	566.228	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	a a a and {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact264	565.949	566.199	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact265	566.944	568.074	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	But , um ,
Bmr010.C.dialogueact266	568.967	576.507	C	PhD	s	+1	0	Susanne Bur - Burger , who is at se CMU , he wa who was formally at {disfmarker} in Munich and w and is now at {disfmarker} with CMU ,
Bmr010.C.dialogueact267	576.86	578.86	C	PhD	s^rt	+1	0	she said she has something
Bmr010.C.dialogueact268	579.285	584.015	C	PhD	s	+1	1	which she uses to do eight channels , uh , trans transliterations ,
Bmr010.C.dialogueact269	584.015	585.605	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	eight channels simultaneously ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact270	584.1	584.41	G	Professor	s^fa^t3.%	-1	0	Excuse me .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact271	586.027	587.667	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	but it 's running under Windows .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact272	587.521	588.031	F	Postdoc	s^m	-1	0	Under Windows .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact274	588.314	590.674	C	PhD	s	-1	0	So I 'm not sure if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if we can use it .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact273	588.231	588.611	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact276	590.884	592.204	C	PhD	s	-1	0	She said she would give it to us .

Bmr010.C.dialogueact277	592.204	593.324	C	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	It wouldn't be a problem .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact278	593.982	597.122	C	PhD	s	-1	0	And I 've got some {disfmarker} some kind of manual {pause} down in my office .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact279	596.965	597.945	A	Grad	s^cs	+1	1	Well , maybe we should get it
Bmr010.A.dialogueact280	598.125	602.631	A	Grad	s	+1	0	and if it 's good enough we 'll arrange Windows machines to be available .

Bmr010.F.dialogueact282	602.84	604.23	F	Postdoc	fg|s^am	-1	0	Mm - hmm . We could {disfmarker} uh , potentially {nonvocalsound} so .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact283	603.505	603.745	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact284	604.29	605.29	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	I also wanted to be sure {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact285	605.29	606.33	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , I 've {disfmarker} I 've seen the {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact286	606.33	610.64	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	this {disfmarker} this is called Praat , PRAAT , {nonvocalsound} which I guess means spee speech in Dutch or something .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact287	608.602	608.842	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact288	609.965	612.775	C	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	Yeah , but then I 'm not sure {pause} that 's the right thing for us .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact289	611.238	611.468	F	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact291	613.46	614.94	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	In terms {nonvocalsound} of it being {nonvocalsound} Windows {nonvocalsound} versus {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact290	613.3	613.52	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact293	615.354	617.564	A	Grad	s^ar|s	+1	0	No , no . Praat isn't {disfmarker} Praat 's multi - platform .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact292	614.94	615.74	F	Postdoc	qy.%--	-1	0	But I 'm just wondering , is {disfmarker} ?
Bmr010.C.dialogueact294	615.854	616.744	C	PhD	s^ar|s.%-	-1	0	No . No , Praat {disfmarker}
Bmr010.C.dialogueact295	617.337	618.017	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact296	617.99	618.88	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh ! I see .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact297	618.869	618.989	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact298	618.97	619.56	F	Postdoc	s^bk^r	-1	0	Oh , I see .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact299	619.56	620.62	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	So Praat may not be {disfmarker}
Bmr010.C.dialogueact300	620.337	620.967	C	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	That 's not Praat .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact301	620.967	623.677	C	PhD	s:s	-1	0	It 's called " trans transedit " {pause} I think .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact302	621.514	622.274	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It 's a different one .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact304	623.777	625.617	C	PhD	s	-1	0	The {disfmarker} the , uh {disfmarker} the tool from {disfmarker} from Susanne .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact303	623.376	623.936	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact305	623.966	624.716	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , I see .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact306	625.911	627.341	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK . OK . Alright .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact307	627.08	629.2	G	Professor	s^tc.%--	-1	0	The other thing , uh , to keep in mind ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact308	629.2	629.9	G	Professor	fh|%--	-1	0	uh {disfmarker} I mean ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact309	630.863	633.193	G	Professor	s	-1	0	we 've been very concerned to get all this rolling
Bmr010.G.dialogueact310	633.193	634.763	G	Professor	s	-1	0	so that we would actually have data ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact311	634.578	635.038	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mmm , yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact312	635.281	639.341	G	Professor	s	-1	0	but , um , I think our outside sponsor is actually gonna kick in
Bmr010.F.dialogueact313	639.246	639.486	F	Postdoc	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact314	639.421	641.861	G	Professor	s	-1	0	and ultimately that path will be smoothed out .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact315	641.861	647.652	G	Professor	s	-1	0	So I don't know if we have a long - term need to do lots and lots of transcribing .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact316	647.652	649.822	G	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	I think we had a very quick need to get something out
Bmr010.G.dialogueact317	650.554	652.154	G	Professor	s	-1	0	and we 'd like to be able to do some later
Bmr010.G.dialogueact318	652.154	654.034	G	Professor	s^ba^df	-1	0	because just it 's inter it 's interesting .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact319	654.641	659.571	G	Professor	s	-1	0	But as far a you know , uh , with {disfmarker} with any luck we 'll be able to wind down the larger project .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact320	658.757	658.937	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr010.B.dialogueact321	659.304	662.124	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	But you s
Bmr010.A.dialogueact322	659.925	666.275	A	Grad	s	+1	2	What our decision was is that {pause} we 'll go ahead with what we have with a not very fine time scale on the overlaps .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact323	663.337	663.497	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact324	663.449	663.719	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact325	666.369	666.669	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact326	667.02	670.98	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and do what we can later {pause} to clean that up if we need to .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact327	669.702	669.982	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact328	671.329	671.659	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact329	672.08	677.727	F	Postdoc	s^cs^tc.%--	+1	0	And {disfmarker} and I was just thinking that , um , {vocalsound} if it were possible to bring that in , like , {vocalsound} you know , this week ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact331	678.517	686.989	F	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	2	then {nonvocalsound} when they 're encoding the overlaps {nonvocalsound} it would be nice for them to be able to specify when {disfmarker} you know , the start points and end points of overlaps .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact330	678.338	678.748	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact333	687.369	689.239	F	Postdoc	s^ba	+1	1	uh Th - they 're {nonvocalsound} making really quick progress .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact332	687.138	687.368	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact334	689.701	690.151	G	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	That 's great .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact335	690.57	695.29	F	Postdoc	fg|s	-1	0	And , um , so my {disfmarker} my goal was {disfmarker} w m my charge was to get eleven hours by the end of the month .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact336	695.29	697.97	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And it 'll be {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm clear that we 'll be able to do that .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact337	698.155	698.565	G	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	That 's great .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact339	699.245	703.59	A	Grad	qy^rt^tc	-1	0	And did you , uh , forward Morgan Brian 's {pause} thing ?
Bmr010.G.dialogueact338	698.875	699.125	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact340	703.738	704.788	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	I sent {nonvocalsound} it to ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact341	704.848	705.158	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact342	705.238	706.068	F	Postdoc	qo^t1	-1	0	who did I send that to ?
Bmr010.F.dialogueact343	706.068	707.098	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I sent it to a list
Bmr010.F.dialogueact344	707.098	709.538	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and I thought {nonvocalsound} I sent it to {nonvocalsound} the {nonvocalsound} {disfmarker} e to the local list .
Bmr010.E.dialogueact345	708.711	709.451	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Meeting Recorder .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact346	709.653	710.043	A	Grad	qy^bh	-1	0	Oh , you did ?
Bmr010.A.dialogueact348	710.043	711.243	A	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	OK . So you probably did get that .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact347	709.678	710.358	F	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	You saw that ?
Bmr010.F.dialogueact349	710.716	715.016	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	So Brian did tell {nonvocalsound} me that {nonvocalsound} in fact what you said , that , {nonvocalsound} uh {disfmarker} that {nonvocalsound} our {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact350	715.665	717.475	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that they are {pause} making progress
Bmr010.F.dialogueact351	717.475	722.885	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and that he 's going {disfmarker} that {nonvocalsound} they 're {nonvocalsound} going {disfmarker} he 's gonna check the f the output of the first transcription
Bmr010.F.dialogueact352	722.885	723.125	F	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact354	723.688	724.048	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact353	723.646	726.076	G	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , basically it 's {disfmarker} it 's all the difference in the world .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact355	726.076	727.736	G	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , basically he 's {disfmarker} he 's on it now .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact356	727.84	728.07	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact357	728.318	729.138	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	Oh , that 's {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact359	729.138	730.158	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	this is a new development .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact358	728.673	732.003	G	Professor	s	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} so this is {disfmarker} so i it 'll happen .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact360	730.218	730.578	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact361	731.237	731.727	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Super .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact362	732.197	732.817	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Super .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact363	732.877	733.987	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK . Great .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact364	733.197	736.387	G	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Yeah . I mean , basically it 's just saying that one of our {disfmarker} one of our best people is on it ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact366	736.67	736.82	F	Postdoc	b^rt	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact365	736.557	738.117	G	Professor	s	-1	0	you know , who just doesn't happen to be here anymore .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact367	738.117	738.897	G	Professor	s	-1	0	Someone else pays him .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact368	738.897	739.117	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr010.B.dialogueact370	740.315	741.835	B	PhD	s	-1	0	But about the need for transcription ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact369	740.196	740.786	F	Postdoc	qy^bh	-1	0	Isn't that great ?
Bmr010.B.dialogueact371	741.835	750.272	B	PhD	qy^bu^df^rt	-1	0	I mean , don't we {disfmarker} didn't we previously {vocalsound} decide that the {pause} IBM {pause} transcripts would have to be {pause} checked anyway and possibly augmented ?
Bmr010.G.dialogueact372	742.355	742.575	G	Professor	b	-1	0	So . {vocalsound} Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact373	748.876	749.666	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yes . That 's true .
Bmr010.B.dialogueact374	750.272	753.552	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	So , I think having a good tool is worth something no matter what .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact375	750.425	750.765	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact376	752.538	752.718	G	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact377	752.848	754.708	G	Professor	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	S OK . That 's {disfmarker} that 's a good point .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact378	756.44	758.51	A	Grad	fg|s^tc	-1	0	Yeah , and Dave Gelbart did volunteer ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact379	756.608	756.798	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Good .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact380	758.51	760.29	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and since he 's not here , I 'll repeat it {disfmarker}
Bmr010.A.dialogueact381	760.731	762.481	A	Grad	s	-1	0	to at least modify Transcriber ,
Bmr010.A.dialogueact382	762.481	765.811	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	which , if we don't have something else that works , I think that 's a pretty good way of going .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact383	764.174	764.454	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact384	765.427	765.677	F	Postdoc	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact385	766.172	767.842	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And we discussed on some methods to do it .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact386	767.842	769.242	A	Grad	s^rt.%--	-1	0	My approach originally ,
Bmr010.A.dialogueact387	769.382	770.922	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and I 've already hacked on it a little bit {disfmarker}
Bmr010.A.dialogueact388	771.295	773.835	A	Grad	s	-1	0	it was too slow because I was trying to display all the waveforms .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact389	773.835	775.545	A	Grad	s	-1	0	But he pointed out that you don't really have to .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact392	775.975	776.825	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	I think that 's a good point .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact390	775.72	775.94	F	Postdoc	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact391	775.869	776.459	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact394	777.48	784.03	A	Grad	s	-1	0	That if you just display the mix waveform and then have a user interface for editing the different channels , that 's perfectly sufficient .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact393	777.107	777.447	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact395	784.36	785.03	F	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	Yeah , exactly .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact396	785.21	786.28	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And just keep those {nonvocalsound} things separate .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact397	786.28	793.255	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	And {disfmarker} and , um , Dan Ellis 's hack already allows them to be {nonvocalsound} able to display {vocalsound} different {nonvocalsound} waveforms to clarify overlaps and things ,
Bmr010.A.dialogueact399	793.416	794.816	A	Grad	s^ar|s	+1	0	No . They can only display one ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact398	793.255	793.915	F	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	so that 's already {disfmarker}
Bmr010.A.dialogueact400	794.866	796.206	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	but they can listen to different ones .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact401	794.93	795.91	F	Postdoc	s^bk|%-	-1	0	Oh , yes , but {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact402	796.316	803.256	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	Well , {vocalsound} uh , yes , but {nonvocalsound} what I mean is {pause} that , uh , from the transcriber 's {nonvocalsound} perspective , uh , those {nonvocalsound} two functions are separate .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact403	803.256	810.961	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	And Dan Ellis 's hack handles the , {vocalsound} um , choice {nonvocalsound} {disfmarker} the ability to choose different waveforms {vocalsound} from moment to moment .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact404	811.222	812.102	A	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	But only to listen to ,
Bmr010.A.dialogueact405	812.352	812.952	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	not to look at .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact406	813.638	813.848	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact407	813.898	814.338	F	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bmr010.A.dialogueact408	814.461	816.061	A	Grad	s	-1	0	The waveform you 're looking at doesn't change .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact409	815.368	815.538	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact410	816.0	816.42	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	That 's true .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact413	816.796	817.076	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact411	816.6	816.77	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact412	816.77	817.5	F	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	but {nonvocalsound} that 's {disfmarker} that 's OK ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact414	817.5	818.13	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	cuz they 're {disfmarker} they 're ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact415	818.567	820.007	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know , they 're focused on the ear anyway .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact416	819.441	819.681	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact418	820.387	821.477	F	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	And then {disfmarker} and then

Bmr010.F.dialogueact419	821.845	827.61	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	the hack to {vocalsound} preserve the overlaps {nonvocalsound} better would be one which creates different output files for each channel ,
Bmr010.A.dialogueact421	827.96	828.15	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact420	827.761	831.121	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	which then {nonvocalsound} would also serve Liz 's request {pause} of having ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact422	831.401	832.361	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know , a single channel ,

Bmr010.G.dialogueact427	840.754	843.744	G	Professor	qy	+1	0	Have , uh , folks from NIST been in contact with you ?
Bmr010.F.dialogueact428	844.57	845.43	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Not directly .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact429	845.43	847.69	F	Postdoc	s^rt	-1	0	I 'm trying to think if {disfmarker} if I could have gotten it over a list .

Bmr010.F.dialogueact431	847.79	848.7	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I don't {disfmarker} I don't think so .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact432	848.609	850.489	G	Professor	s^bk|s^cs	-1	0	OK . Well , holidays may have interrupted things ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact433	850.489	851.239	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	cuz in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact434	851.659	859.636	G	Professor	s	+1	0	They {vocalsound} seem to want to {pause} get absolutely clear on standards for {disfmarker} transcription standards and so forth with {disfmarker} with us .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact435	858.661	860.551	F	Postdoc	s^bk|s	-1	0	Oh ! This was from before December .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact437	860.631	861.021	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact436	860.59	864.54	G	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Right . Because they 're {disfmarker} they 're presumably going to start recording next month .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact438	865.211	866.441	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK . OK .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact440	867.02	868.39	A	Grad	fg|s	+1	1	Oh , we should definitely get with them then ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact439	866.994	867.354	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact441	868.88	869.19	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	and
Bmr010.A.dialogueact442	870.51	871.49	A	Grad	s	+1	1	agree upon a format .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact443	872.18	873.99	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Though I don't remember email on that .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact444	874.05	875.74	A	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	So was I not in the loop on that ?
Bmr010.G.dialogueact445	877.242	879.162	G	Professor	h|s^na	-1	0	Um . Yeah , I don't think I mailed anybody .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact446	879.162	882.262	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I just think I told them to contact Jane {disfmarker} that , uh , if they had a {disfmarker}
Bmr010.A.dialogueact447	881.239	881.559	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact448	882.142	882.672	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	That 's right .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact449	883.136	886.056	G	Professor	s	-1	0	if , uh {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that , uh , as the point person on it .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact451	886.473	887.233	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , I think that 's right .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact450	886.286	886.546	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr010.A.dialogueact452	887.613	888.093	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	Just , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact453	889.822	895.733	G	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	So , yeah . Maybe I 'll , uh , ping them a little bit about it to {vocalsound} get that straight .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact454	893.62	893.95	F	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact455	894.537	897.907	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	I 'm keeping the conventions {pause} absolutely {pause} as simple {nonvocalsound} as possible .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact456	897.925	903.875	G	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	Yeah . So is it {disfmarker} cuz with any luck there 'll actually be a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} there 'll be collections at Columbia ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact457	903.875	905.655	G	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	collections at {disfmarker} at UW {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact458	906.1	908.96	G	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean Dan {disfmarker} Dan is very interested in doing some other things ,
Bmr010.A.dialogueact459	907.918	908.168	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact460	908.428	909.628	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact461	909.335	913.865	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , I think it 's important both for the notation and the machine representation to be the same .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact462	909.478	910.618	G	Professor	s^2	-1	0	and collections at NIST .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact463	910.618	910.988	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact464	914.29	914.49	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact465	914.851	915.131	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact466	915.013	920.013	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	N there was also this , {nonvocalsound} uh , email from Dan regarding the {pause} speech - non nonspeech segmentation thing .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact467	919.172	919.432	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact469	919.816	919.976	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact468	919.569	919.769	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact470	920.263	920.803	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	I don't know if ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact471	920.803	920.993	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact472	921.971	922.921	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	uh , we wanna ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact473	923.021	923.181	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact474	923.411	931.95	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and Dan Gel - and Dave Gelbart is interested in pursuing the aspect {nonvocalsound} of using amplitude {nonvocalsound} as a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} as a basis for the separation .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact476	932.966	933.696	A	Grad	s	+1	1	Cross - correlation .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact475	932.658	934.698	G	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	Oh , yeah . He was talking {disfmarker} he was talking {disfmarker} I mean , uh , we {disfmarker} he had {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact477	933.868	934.458	F	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	Cross
Bmr010.G.dialogueact478	934.838	935.708	G	Professor	s^aa|s^m	-1	0	Yeah , cross - correlation .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact479	935.343	935.733	C	PhD	s^2.%--	-1	0	Cross
Bmr010.G.dialogueact480	935.708	942.325	G	Professor	s	+1	0	I had mentioned this a couple times before , the c the commercial devices that do , uh , {vocalsound} uh , voice , uh {disfmarker} you know , active miking ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact481	936.712	937.052	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact482	942.979	945.839	G	Professor	s	+1	0	basically look at the amp at the energy at each of the mikes .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact483	945.839	950.171	G	Professor	s	+1	0	And {disfmarker} and you basically compare the energy here to {vocalsound} some function of all of the mikes .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact484	950.314	950.484	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact487	950.675	950.995	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact486	950.39	950.76	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact485	950.361	950.861	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact488	951.278	958.418	G	Professor	s	+1	1	by doing that , you know , rather than setting any , uh , absolute threshold , you actually can do pretty good , uh , selection of who {disfmarker} who 's talking .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact489	958.894	959.164	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact490	959.28	959.68	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact491	960.5	962.97	G	Professor	s	-1	0	And those {disfmarker} those systems work very well , by the way ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact492	962.97	968.774	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , so people use them in {vocalsound} panel discussions and so forth with sound reinforcement differing in {disfmarker} in sort of ,
Bmr010.D.dialogueact493	968.46	968.82	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact494	968.914	969.114	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact495	969.585	972.255	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and , uh , those {disfmarker} if {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact496	973.19	976.47	G	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Boy , the guy I knew who built them , built them like twenty {disfmarker} twenty years ago ,
Bmr010.A.dialogueact498	976.792	976.982	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact497	976.47	980.08	G	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	so they 're {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the techniques work pretty well .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact499	980.101	980.621	F	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	Fantastic .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact501	980.892	985.704	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	Cuz there is one thing that we don't have right now and that is the automatic , um , channel identifier .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact500	980.832	981.112	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact503	986.249	989.729	F	Postdoc	s^rt	+1	1	That {disfmarker} that , you know , that would g help in terms of encoding of overlaps .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact502	985.899	986.199	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact504	990.119	995.122	F	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	The {disfmarker} the transcribers would have less , uh , disentangling to do {pause} if that were available .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact505	995.419	1001.09	G	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah . So I think , you know , basically you can look at some {disfmarker} p you have to play around a little bit , uh , to figure out what the right statistic is ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact506	996.284	996.454	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	But .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact507	997.42	997.87	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact509	1001.55	1001.86	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact508	1001.09	1005.2	G	Professor	s	-1	0	but you compare each microphone to some statistic based on the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} on the overall {disfmarker}
Bmr010.C.dialogueact510	1005.71	1005.86	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact511	1006.02	1006.33	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact512	1006.03	1006.32	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact513	1006.47	1009.7	G	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , and we also have these {disfmarker} we have the advantage of having {pause} distant mikes too .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact514	1009.7	1010.63	G	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	So that , you cou yo
Bmr010.A.dialogueact515	1010.28	1011.3	A	Grad	fg|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah , although the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker}
Bmr010.A.dialogueact516	1012.43	1014.43	A	Grad	s^ba^bu	-1	0	using the close - talking I think would be much better .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact517	1014.43	1014.83	A	Grad	qy^g	-1	0	Wouldn't it ?
Bmr010.F.dialogueact518	1016.7	1016.81	F	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact519	1016.71	1018.8	G	Professor	fh|s^no	-1	0	Um . I {disfmarker} I don't know .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact521	1019.18	1019.46	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact520	1018.8	1019.37	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I just {disfmarker} it 'd be {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact522	1019.75	1022.42	G	Professor	s	-1	0	If I was actually working on it , I 'd sit there and {disfmarker} and play around with it ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact523	1022.42	1023.62	G	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and get a feeling for it .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact524	1023.62	1024.82	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact525	1024.82	1025.03	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact526	1025.19	1025.35	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	But ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact527	1026.32	1030.08	G	Professor	s	-1	0	uh , you certainly wanna use the close - talking , as a {disfmarker} at least .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact528	1028.49	1028.69	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact529	1031.33	1034.35	G	Professor	s	-1	0	I don't know if the other would {disfmarker} would add some other helpful dimension or not .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact530	1034.64	1034.95	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact531	1035.16	1035.66	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact532	1037.98	1044.24	D	PhD	fg|qw^rt^t^tc	+1	0	OK . What {disfmarker} what are the different , uh , classes to {disfmarker} to code , uh , the {disfmarker} the overlap , you will use ?
Bmr010.F.dialogueact533	1044.67	1046.26	F	Postdoc	h|%--	-1	0	Um , to code d
Bmr010.D.dialogueact535	1046.51	1047.26	D	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	What you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact534	1046.26	1047.52	F	Postdoc	qy^bu^d^rt	+1	0	so types of overlap ?
Bmr010.D.dialogueact536	1047.5	1047.78	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact537	1048.37	1053.34	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Um , so {nonvocalsound} at a meeting that wasn't transcribed , we worked up a {disfmarker} a typology .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact538	1053.79	1054.0	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact539	1053.86	1054.67	F	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	And , um {disfmarker}
Bmr010.D.dialogueact540	1055.31	1058.3	D	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	Look like , uh , you t you explaining in the blackboard ?
Bmr010.D.dialogueact541	1058.3	1058.63	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	The {disfmarker} ?
Bmr010.D.dialogueact543	1058.63	1059.26	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah ? Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact542	1058.6	1059.29	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yes , exactly .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact544	1059.29	1060.14	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	That hasn't changed .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact545	1060.14	1060.39	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	So
Bmr010.F.dialogueact546	1060.39	1067.35	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	it {nonvocalsound} i the {disfmarker} it 's basically a two - tiered structure where the first one is whether {nonvocalsound} the person who 's interrupted continues or not .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact547	1067.62	1074.44	F	Postdoc	s:qy^rt	+1	0	And then below that there 're {nonvocalsound} subcategories , uh , that have more to do with , {nonvocalsound} you know , is it , {vocalsound} uh , simply {nonvocalsound} backchannel
Bmr010.D.dialogueact548	1071.4	1071.73	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact549	1074.5	1077.44	F	Postdoc	s:qrr	+1	0	or is {nonvocalsound} it , um , someone completing someone else 's thought ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact550	1077.5	1078.99	F	Postdoc	s:qrr	+1	0	or is it someone in introducing a new thought .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact551	1078.53	1078.74	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	Right .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact552	1079.74	1090.38	A	Grad	s	+1	1	And I hope that if we do a forced alignment with the close - talking mike , that will be enough to recover at least some of the time the time information of when the overlap occurred .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact553	1079.9	1079.98	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Huh .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact554	1085.55	1085.96	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr010.G.dialogueact614	1171.34	1171.87	G	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I don't know what .
Bmr010.B.dialogueact615	1171.95	1172.98	B	PhD	s^j	-1	0	He asked for more work .

Bmr010.G.dialogueact617	1172.07	1172.62	G	Professor	s	-1	0	But he 's on it now .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact618	1174.42	1175.71	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	That would be {nonvocalsound} like {disfmarker} that 'd be like him .

Bmr010.G.dialogueact620	1176.99	1177.28	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact621	1178.18	1179.34	G	Professor	fg	-1	0	So , uh ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact622	1181.45	1181.75	G	Professor	qw^t^tc	-1	0	where are we ?
Bmr010.G.dialogueact623	1181.95	1184.62	G	Professor	s^cs^rt.%--	-1	0	Maybe , uh , uh , brief {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact624	1185.73	1187.29	G	Professor	qo^cs	+1	1	Well , let 's {disfmarker} why don't we talk about microphone issues ?
Bmr010.F.dialogueact625	1187.47	1188.47	F	Postdoc	s^aa|s^ba	-1	0	Yeah . That 'd be great .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact626	1187.67	1188.44	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	That was {disfmarker} that was a {disfmarker}
Bmr010.A.dialogueact627	1188.89	1189.27	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	Um ,
Bmr010.A.dialogueact628	1190.14	1195.17	A	Grad	s	+1	0	so one thing is that I did look on Sony 's for a replacement for the mikes {disfmarker} {vocalsound} for the head m head - worn ones
Bmr010.A.dialogueact629	1195.17	1196.31	A	Grad	s^df	+1	0	cuz they 're so uncomfortable .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact630	1196.74	1198.97	A	Grad	s	-1	0	But I think I need someone who knows more about mikes than I do ,
Bmr010.A.dialogueact631	1198.97	1204.73	A	Grad	s	-1	0	because I couldn't find a single other model that seemed like it would fit the connector ,
Bmr010.A.dialogueact632	1205.05	1206.49	A	Grad	s	-1	0	which seems really unlikely to me .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact633	1207.02	1209.53	A	Grad	qy	-1	0	Does anyone , like , know stores
Bmr010.A.dialogueact634	1209.53	1213.39	A	Grad	qrr	-1	0	or {vocalsound} know about mikes who {disfmarker} who would know the right questions to ask ?
Bmr010.G.dialogueact635	1213.84	1214.8	G	Professor	s^na	-1	0	Oh , I probably would .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact636	1214.8	1216.86	G	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , my knowledge is twenty years out of date
Bmr010.G.dialogueact637	1216.86	1217.88	G	Professor	s	-1	0	but some of it 's still the same .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact639	1218.16	1218.53	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact638	1218.04	1218.24	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact640	1219.44	1221.63	G	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	Uh , so maybe we c we can take a look at that .
Bmr010.E.dialogueact641	1220.47	1222.97	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	You couldn't {disfmarker} you couldn't find the right connector to go into these things ?
Bmr010.A.dialogueact642	1222.59	1222.79	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact644	1223.56	1226.29	A	Grad	s	-1	0	When I looked , i they listed one microphone and that 's it
Bmr010.E.dialogueact643	1223.49	1223.61	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Huh !
Bmr010.A.dialogueact645	1226.79	1228.14	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	as having that type of connector .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact646	1228.14	1233.68	A	Grad	s	-1	0	But my guess is that Sony maybe uses a different number for their connector than everyone else does .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact647	1234.38	1235.36	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and so {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact648	1234.4	1234.82	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact649	1235.69	1236.77	G	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Well , let 's look at it together
Bmr010.A.dialogueact650	1236.41	1239.04	A	Grad	s	-1	0	it seems {disfmarker} it seems really unlikely to me that there 's only one .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact651	1236.77	1236.93	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact652	1239.34	1240.57	F	Postdoc	qy^d^rt	-1	0	And there 's no adaptor for it ?
Bmr010.C.dialogueact654	1241.3	1241.54	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact653	1240.89	1241.67	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	Seems like there 'd be a {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact655	1242.15	1242.39	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact656	1243.19	1243.94	A	Grad	s:qh^rt	-1	0	As I said , who knows ?
Bmr010.F.dialogueact657	1244.6	1244.88	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact658	1245.04	1246.44	G	Professor	qw^rt	-1	0	Who {disfmarker} who are we buying these from ?
Bmr010.A.dialogueact659	1246.74	1247.31	A	Grad	h	-1	0	Um ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact660	1246.83	1247.04	G	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	That 'd be
Bmr010.A.dialogueact661	1248.41	1249.16	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I have it downstairs .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact662	1249.16	1250.47	A	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I don't remember off the top of my head .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact663	1249.75	1249.92	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact664	1249.92	1250.24	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact665	1251.1	1252.73	G	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Yeah . We {disfmarker} we can try and look at that together .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact666	1253.92	1254.53	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	And then , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr010.A.dialogueact667	1256.2	1257.72	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	just in terms of how you wear them {disfmarker}
Bmr010.A.dialogueact668	1258.12	1259.49	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , I had thought about this before .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact669	1259.49	1265.57	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , when {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when you use a product like DragonDictate , they have a very extensive description about how to wear the microphone and so on .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact670	1265.33	1265.6	F	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact671	1265.99	1271.39	A	Grad	s	-1	0	But I felt that in a real situation we were very seldom gonna get people to really do it
Bmr010.A.dialogueact672	1271.39	1273.32	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	and maybe it wasn't worth concentrating on .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact673	1274.83	1275.07	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact674	1275.64	1278.41	G	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , I think that that 's {disfmarker} that 's a good back - off position .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact675	1278.41	1279.54	G	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's what I was saying {vocalsound} earlier ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact676	1279.54	1283.81	G	Professor	s	-1	0	th that , you know , we are gonna get some {vocalsound} recordings that are imperfect
Bmr010.G.dialogueact677	1283.81	1284.97	G	Professor	s:s	-1	0	and , hey , that 's life .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact678	1285.06	1296.19	G	Professor	s	+1	2	But I {disfmarker} I think that it {disfmarker} it doesn't hurt , uh , the naturalness of the situation to try to have people {pause} wear the microphones properly , if possible ,
Bmr010.A.dialogueact679	1296.19	1296.59	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact680	1296.19	1302.55	G	Professor	s	-1	0	because , {vocalsound} um , the natural situation is really what we have with the microphones on the table .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact682	1302.76	1303.36	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Oh . That 's true .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact681	1302.67	1307.62	G	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , I think , {vocalsound} you know , in the target applications that we 're talking about , people aren't gonna be wearing head - mounted mikes anyway .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact684	1304.25	1304.49	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact683	1303.94	1304.02	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact685	1307.62	1310.54	G	Professor	s	-1	0	So this is just for u these head - mounted mikes are just for use with research .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact686	1310.61	1310.9	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact688	1311.36	1311.6	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact687	1311.27	1312.66	G	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	And , uh , it 's gonna make {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact689	1313.3	1319.76	G	Professor	s	-1	0	You know , if {disfmarker} if An - Andreas plays around with language modeling , he 's not gonna be m wanna be messed up by people breathing into the microphone .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact690	1317.6	1317.91	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact691	1319.76	1322.26	G	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	So it 's {disfmarker} it 's , uh , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr010.A.dialogueact692	1322.0	1327.17	A	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	Well , I 'll dig through the documentation to DragonDictate and ste s see if they still have the little {pause} form .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact693	1326.38	1327.22	G	Professor	s	-1	0	But it does happen .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact696	1327.81	1328.25	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact694	1327.45	1327.76	G	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr010.G.dialogueact695	1327.76	1328.78	G	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , and any {disfmarker}
Bmr010.B.dialogueact697	1329.41	1330.2	B	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	It 's interesting ,
Bmr010.B.dialogueact698	1330.2	1330.52	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bmr010.B.dialogueact699	1331.74	1336.21	B	PhD	s	-1	0	I talked to some IBM guys , uh , last January , I think , I was there .
Bmr010.B.dialogueact700	1336.21	1336.35	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bmr010.B.dialogueact701	1337.56	1341.72	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	so people who were working on the {disfmarker} on their ViaVoice dictation product .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact702	1340.73	1340.93	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.B.dialogueact703	1342.28	1347.4	B	PhD	s	-1	0	And they said , uh , the breathing is really a {disfmarker} a terrible problem {pause} for them ,
Bmr010.B.dialogueact704	1347.58	1351.24	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	to {disfmarker} to not recognize breathing as speech .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact705	1351.86	1352.3	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Wow .
Bmr010.B.dialogueact706	1352.65	1357.86	B	PhD	s	+1	2	So , anything to reduce breathing is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is a good thing .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact707	1355.77	1356.07	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact708	1356.46	1357.09	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	Well , that 's the {disfmarker}
Bmr010.A.dialogueact709	1357.94	1363.56	A	Grad	s	+1	0	It seemed to me when I was using Dragon that it was really microphone placement helped an {disfmarker} in , uh {disfmarker} an enormous amount .
Bmr010.B.dialogueact710	1359.68	1360.17	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact711	1363.56	1368.57	A	Grad	s	+1	2	So you want it enough to the side so that when you exhale through your nose , it doesn't {disfmarker} the wind doesn't hit the mike .
Bmr010.B.dialogueact712	1363.69	1363.98	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr010.B.dialogueact713	1368.49	1369.01	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact714	1369.44	1370.18	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	And then , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr010.A.dialogueact715	1371.19	1373.15	A	Grad	s^j	-1	0	Everyone 's adjusting their microphones , of course .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact716	1373.62	1375.98	A	Grad	s	+1	0	And then just close enough so that you get good volume .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact717	1375.98	1379.57	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So you know , wearing it right about here seems to be about the right way to do it .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact718	1377.9	1378.22	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact719	1377.97	1378.16	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr010.F.dialogueact722	1379.99	1380.33	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact720	1379.59	1387.15	G	Professor	s	-1	0	I remember when I was {disfmarker} when I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I used , uh , um , {vocalsound} a prominent laboratory 's , uh , uh , speech recognizer
Bmr010.G.dialogueact723	1387.15	1389.79	G	Professor	s	-1	0	about , {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} This was , boy , this was a while ago ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact724	1389.79	1392.53	G	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	this was about twelve {disfmarker} twelve years ago or something .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact725	1393.06	1394.05	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	And , um ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact726	1394.68	1396.08	G	Professor	s	-1	0	they were {disfmarker} they were perturbed with me
Bmr010.G.dialogueact727	1396.09	1399.21	G	Professor	s	-1	0	because I was breathing in instead of breathing out .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact728	1399.21	1403.31	G	Professor	s	-1	0	And they had models for {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they had Markov models for br breathing out
Bmr010.G.dialogueact729	1403.36	1404.94	G	Professor	s	-1	0	but they didn't have them for breathing in .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact731	1406.22	1406.66	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact730	1405.8	1406.05	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker}

Bmr010.F.dialogueact733	1409.32	1413.89	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	Well , what I wondered is whether it 's possible to have {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to maybe use the display at the beginning
Bmr010.A.dialogueact735	1414.1	1414.44	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr010.F.dialogueact736	1416.18	1418.35	F	Postdoc	s^cs^e	-1	0	I mean , have someone do some routine whatever ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact737	1418.49	1421.22	F	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and then see if when they 're breathing it 's showing .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact739	1421.37	1422.9	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , when {disfmarker} when it 's on , you can see it .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact738	1421.32	1422.12	F	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	I don't know if the {disfmarker} if it 's {disfmarker}

Bmr010.G.dialogueact759	1441.52	1445.0	G	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	And you can do some , uh , you know , first - order thing about it ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact760	1445.0	1449.55	G	Professor	s^cs^e	-1	0	which is to have people move it , uh , uh , a away from being just directly in front of the middle

Bmr010.B.dialogueact842	1582.02	1589.93	B	PhD	s	-1	0	So as long as you can stick a {disfmarker} you know , a t a tag in there that {disfmarker} that indicates that there was laughter ,

Bmr010.F.dialogueact852	1596.11	1596.71	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	So , um ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact854	1596.91	1601.25	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	if they laugh between two words , you {disfmarker} you 'd get it in between the two words .

Bmr010.A.dialogueact868	1624.08	1630.85	A	Grad	qo	-1	0	So are {disfmarker} do you treat breath and laughter as phonetically , or as word models , or what ?
Bmr010.B.dialogueact867	1623.81	1624.31	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	so {disfmarker}

Bmr010.D.dialogueact872	1627.06	1629.83	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I think it 's frequent in {disfmarker} in the meeting .

Bmr010.B.dialogueact880	1645.67	1647.87	B	PhD	s	-1	0	And then laughter is a {disfmarker} is a special word .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact881	1648.18	1650.05	A	Grad	qw	-1	0	How would we do that with the hybrid system ?
Bmr010.G.dialogueact882	1651.81	1652.13	G	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	Same thing .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact884	1652.53	1654.64	A	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	So train a phone {pause} in the neural net ?
Bmr010.B.dialogueact883	1652.31	1652.94	B	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Same thing ?
Bmr010.B.dialogueact885	1653.78	1654.02	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.B.dialogueact886	1654.82	1658.06	B	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah . You ha Oh . And each of these words has a dedicated phone .

Bmr010.A.dialogueact888	1658.49	1658.96	A	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	Oh , it does ?
Bmr010.B.dialogueact889	1658.56	1663.59	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	So the {disfmarker} so the {disfmarker} the mouth noise , uh , word has just a single phone ,
Bmr010.B.dialogueact890	1664.33	1666.45	B	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um , that is for that .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact891	1665.13	1670.23	A	Grad	fg|s^cs	-1	0	Right . So in the hybrid system we could train the net with a laughter phone and a breath sound phone .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact892	1668.02	1668.27	G	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr010.G.dialogueact900	1673.84	1678.91	G	Professor	s	-1	0	we now think that laughter should have three sub sub {vocalsound} sub - units in the {disfmarker} the three states , uh {disfmarker} different states .

Bmr010.G.dialogueact902	1678.91	1679.68	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And then you would have three {disfmarker}

Bmr010.A.dialogueact1050	1966.04	1971.17	A	Grad	s	-1	0	We could get a very detailed overlap if they were willing to transcribe each meeting four or five times .

Bmr010.G.dialogueact1062	1985.24	1990.67	G	Professor	s	-1	0	which {vocalsound} we know from the {disfmarker} Steve 's experience with the Switchboard transcription is , you know , very , very time - consuming .

Bmr010.F.dialogueact1108	2067.13	2067.91	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	But what I mean is {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1109	2068.14	2069.03	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Oh , I shouldn't say it that way
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1110	2069.03	2070.61	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	because {nonvocalsound} that does sound like forty - hour weeks .

Bmr010.F.dialogueact1112	2070.94	2076.14	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I th I {disfmarker} I would say they 're probably {nonvocalsound} {disfmarker} they don't have o they don't have other things that are taking away their time .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1113	2075.53	2078.7	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I don't see how someone could do forty hours a week on transcription .

Bmr010.F.dialogueact1115	2076.61	2077.0	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	But {nonvocalsound} it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1116	2077.16	2077.74	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you can't .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1117	2078.09	2079.21	G	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1118	2078.62	2079.38	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	No . You 're right .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1119	2079.55	2080.84	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} i it would be too taxing .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1120	2080.84	2082.41	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	But , um , they 're putting {nonvocalsound} in a lot of {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1121	2081.37	2081.69	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1122	2083.31	2084.51	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and I checked them over .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1123	2083.45	2083.6	G	Professor	%-	-1	0	I {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1124	2084.66	2085.7	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I haven't checked them all ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1125	2085.7	2087.09	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but {pause} just spot - checking .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1126	2087.09	2087.95	F	Postdoc	s^ba^tc	-1	0	They 're fantastic .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1128	2087.94	2088.53	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	I think it would be {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1127	2087.77	2095.53	G	Professor	s	-1	0	I remember when we were transcribing BeRP , uh , uh , {vocalsound} uh , Ron Kay , uh , volunteered to {disfmarker} to do some of that .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1129	2095.53	2098.87	G	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	And , he was {disfmarker} the first {disfmarker} first stuff he did was transcribing Chuck .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1130	2099.25	2102.41	G	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	And he 's saying " You {disfmarker} you know , I always thought Chuck spoke really well . "
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1131	2104.93	2105.66	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1132	2107.09	2113.03	F	Postdoc	fg|s	+1	0	Well , you know , and I also thought , y Liz has this , eh , you know , and I do also , this {disfmarker} this interest in the types of overlaps that are involved .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1133	2113.03	2117.04	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	These people would be {nonvocalsound} great choices for doing coding of that type if we wanted ,
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1134	2114.52	2115.16	A	Grad	s	-1	0	We 'd have to mark them .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1135	2117.04	2117.31	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	or
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1137	2118.09	2119.55	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	whatever . So , um .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1136	2117.76	2118.12	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1138	2118.61	2118.72	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1140	2120.16	2125.41	A	Grad	s^cs^rt	+1	1	I think it would also be interesting to have , uh , a couple of the meetings have more than one transcriber do ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1139	2119.67	2119.87	G	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1142	2126.01	2128.16	A	Grad	s^df	+1	1	cuz I 'm curious about inter - annotator agreement .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1141	2125.87	2126.27	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1143	2128.64	2128.83	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1144	2128.93	2129.19	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1145	2131.28	2131.43	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1146	2131.54	2134.71	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Th - that 'd be {disfmarker} I think that 's a {disfmarker} a good idea .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1147	2131.83	2132.15	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1148	2134.83	2136.59	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	You know , there 's also , the e In my mind ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1149	2137.0	2139.76	F	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	I think A An - Andreas was {pause} leading to this topic ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1150	2139.82	2145.33	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	the idea that , um , {vocalsound} we haven't yet seen the {disfmarker} the type of transcript that we get from IBM ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1151	2145.33	2147.91	F	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	and it may just be , you know , pristine .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1152	2147.91	2150.73	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	But on the other hand , given the lesser interface {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1153	2150.73	2152.36	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Cuz this is , you know {disfmarker} we 've got a good interface ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1154	2152.36	2154.61	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	we 've got great headphones , m
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1155	2154.61	2154.93	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1156	2155.46	2160.25	G	Professor	s	-1	0	It could be that they will uh {disfmarker} theirs will end up being a kind of fir first pass or something .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1157	2160.27	2161.04	F	Postdoc	s^m^na	-1	0	Something like that .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1158	2160.88	2161.51	G	Professor	s	-1	0	Maybe an elaborate one ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1159	2161.51	2163.53	G	Professor	s	-1	0	cuz again they probably are gonna do these alignments ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1160	2163.53	2165.55	G	Professor	s	-1	0	which will also clear things up .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1161	2165.0	2166.3	F	Postdoc	s^aap^rt	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker} that 's true .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1162	2166.3	2173.42	F	Postdoc	qy^bu.%-	-1	0	Al - although you have to s Don't you have to start with a close enough approximation {nonvocalsound} of the {disfmarker} of the verbal part {nonvocalsound} to be able to {disfmarker} ?
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1163	2172.85	2174.56	G	Professor	s^am	-1	0	Well , tha that 's {disfmarker} that 's debatable .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1166	2175.04	2175.36	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1164	2174.56	2174.76	G	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1165	2174.76	2181.85	G	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , so the {disfmarker} so the argument is that if your statistical system is good {vocalsound} it will in fact , uh , clean things up .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1168	2182.14	2182.46	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1167	2182.0	2182.3	G	Professor	qy^d^f	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1169	2182.48	2184.82	G	Professor	s	-1	0	So it it 's got its own objective criterion .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1170	2183.19	2183.32	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1171	2185.62	2190.16	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And , uh , so in principle you could start up with something that was kind of rough {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1172	2190.79	2197.39	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , to give an example of , um , something we used to do , uh , at one point , uh , back {disfmarker} back when Chuck was here
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1173	2197.39	2197.87	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	in early times ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1174	2197.87	2198.6	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	is we would take ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1175	2200.29	2204.74	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	um , {vocalsound} da take a word and , uh , have a canonical pronunciation
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1176	2205.21	2212.43	G	Professor	s	-1	0	and , uh , if there was five phones in a word , {vocalsound} you 'd break up the word , {vocalsound} uh , into five equal - length pieces
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1177	2212.7	2213.94	G	Professor	s	-1	0	which is completely gross .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1178	2213.72	2214.01	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Wrong .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1180	2214.4	2214.65	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1179	2214.19	2214.47	G	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1181	2214.47	2218.03	G	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , th the timing is off {pause} all over the place in just about any word .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1182	2216.07	2217.19	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1183	2218.12	2218.39	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1184	2218.75	2219.4	G	Professor	s^ba^df^rt	-1	0	But it 's O K .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1185	2219.72	2221.7	G	Professor	s	-1	0	You start off with that and the statistical system
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1186	2221.7	2222.66	G	Professor	s	-1	0	then aligns things ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1187	2222.66	2224.95	G	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	and eventually you get something that doesn't really look too bad .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1188	2225.17	2225.67	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Oh , excellent .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1189	2225.67	2225.93	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1190	2225.75	2230.99	G	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so I think using a {disfmarker} a good {pause} aligner , um , actually can {disfmarker} can help a lot .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1191	2231.37	2233.63	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um . {vocalsound} But , uh ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1192	2233.7	2234.82	G	Professor	s	-1	0	you know , they both help each other .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1193	2234.82	2237.79	G	Professor	s	-1	0	If you have a {disfmarker} if you have a better starting point , then it helps the aligner .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1194	2238.4	2244.1	G	Professor	s	-1	0	If you have a good alignment , it helps the , uh , th the human in {disfmarker} in taking less time to correct things .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1196	2244.21	2244.5	F	Postdoc	x	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1195	2244.1	2245.51	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1197	2245.85	2246.13	F	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	Excellent .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1198	2246.89	2248.44	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I guess there 's another aspect , too ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1199	2248.44	2249.14	F	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	and I don't know {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1200	2249.48	2252.87	F	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	uh , this {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} very possibly a different , uh , topic .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1201	2253.27	2258.7	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But , {nonvocalsound} uh , just let me say {pause} with reference to this idea of , um , {vocalsound} higher - order organization within meetings .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1202	2258.7	2259.3	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	So like in a {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1203	2259.62	2265.96	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know , the topics that are covered during a meeting with reference to the other , uh , uses of the data ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1204	2262.06	2262.44	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1205	2266.04	2270.15	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so being able to {pause} find where so - and - so talked about such - and - such ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1206	2270.68	2273.22	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	then , um , um {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1207	2273.85	2284.09	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	e I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I did sort of a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a rough {pause} pass {nonvocalsound} on encoding , like , episode - like level things on the , uh , transcribed meeting {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1208	2280.45	2280.88	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1209	2284.38	2285.37	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	already transcribed meeting .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1211	2286.05	2288.25	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And I don't know if , um {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1210	2285.56	2286.16	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1212	2288.75	2291.24	F	Postdoc	s^rt	-1	0	where {nonvocalsound} that {disfmarker} i if that 's something that we wanna do with each meeting ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1213	2291.24	2292.31	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	sort of like a , um {disfmarker}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1214	2292.78	2295.2	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it 's like a manifest , when you get a box full of stuff ,
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1216	2296.11	2298.17	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} or if that 's , um {disfmarker}

Bmr010.F.dialogueact1217	2298.86	2304.95	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean , i I {disfmarker} I don't know what uh , level of detail would be most useful .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1218	2304.95	2310.24	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	I don't know i if that 's something that {pause} I should do when I look over it , or if we want someone else to do , or whatever .

Bmr010.A.dialogueact1227	2327.23	2329.0	A	Grad	s^cs^df.%--	-1	0	I mean , so if someone wants to use that data {disfmarker}

Bmr010.D.dialogueact1265	2391.62	2395.44	D	PhD	s	+1	0	we have problem to {disfmarker} with the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} with {disfmarker} with the parameter {disfmarker}

Bmr010.G.dialogueact1269	2404.61	2404.85	G	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1270	2406.07	2408.35	D	PhD	s	+1	0	And it was a problem , uh , with the scale .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1272	2409.53	2409.97	A	Grad	qw^rt	-1	0	With what ?
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1271	2409.38	2410.71	D	PhD	fh|s^r	-1	0	Eh , the scale .

Bmr010.D.dialogueact1275	2412.42	2418.51	D	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	Eh , and I {disfmarker} I change the scale and we can see the {disfmarker} the variance .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1276	2417.55	2417.89	G	Professor	fg	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1277	2418.26	2421.03	G	Professor	s	+1	1	But the bottom line is it 's still not , uh , separating out very well .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1278	2420.55	2420.65	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1280	2421.38	2421.44	D	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1279	2421.03	2421.28	G	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1282	2421.75	2424.25	D	PhD	s	-1	0	The distribution {disfmarker} the distribution is {disfmarker} is similar .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1281	2421.72	2422.08	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1283	2422.57	2423.1	G	Professor	%-	-1	0	So that 's {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1284	2423.57	2425.22	G	Professor	s^co^tc	-1	0	that 's {disfmarker} that 's enough then .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1285	2425.33	2425.64	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1286	2426.5	2426.61	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1287	2427.29	2429.95	G	Professor	s^df	-1	0	No , I mean , that there 's no point in going through all of that if that 's the bottom line , really .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1288	2428.85	2429.16	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1289	2429.24	2429.56	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1291	2430.27	2430.49	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1290	2429.95	2431.81	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So , I {disfmarker} I think we have to start {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1292	2432.47	2434.8	G	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , I mean , there there 's two suggestions , really ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1293	2434.8	2437.14	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	which is , uh {disfmarker} what we said before is that ,
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1294	2435.31	2435.48	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Mmm ,
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1295	2435.48	2435.71	D	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1296	2437.84	2438.41	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1297	2438.79	2439.42	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it looks like ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1298	2440.95	2443.58	G	Professor	s	-1	0	at least that you haven't found an obvious way to normalize
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1299	2443.58	2449.21	G	Professor	s	-1	0	so that the energy is anything like a reliable , uh , indicator of the overlap .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1300	2448.0	2448.31	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1302	2450.04	2450.43	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1301	2449.98	2455.47	G	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um , I {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm still {pause} a little f think that 's a little funny . These things l @ @ seems like there should be ,
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1303	2455.22	2455.43	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1304	2455.47	2461.42	G	Professor	s	+1	0	but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but you don't want to keep , uh {disfmarker} keep knocking at it if it 's {disfmarker} if you 're not getting any {disfmarker} any result with that .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1305	2461.96	2469.34	G	Professor	s	+1	2	But , I mean , the other things that we talked about is , uh , {vocalsound} pitch - related things and harmonicity - related things ,
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1306	2467.53	2467.75	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1307	2469.35	2472.67	G	Professor	s	-1	0	so {disfmarker} which we thought also should be some kind of a reasonable indicator .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1308	2473.45	2474.02	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1309	2475.49	2476.33	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	But , uh ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1310	2477.51	2483.28	G	Professor	s	+1	0	a completely different tack on it wou is the one that was suggested , uh , by your colleagues in Spain ,
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1311	2480.42	2480.79	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1312	2483.76	2487.19	G	Professor	s	+1	1	which is to say , don't worry so much about the , uh , features .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1313	2488.18	2488.34	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1314	2488.19	2493.02	G	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	That is to say , use , you know , as {disfmarker} as you 're doing with the speech , uh , nonspeech , use some very general features .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1315	2493.36	2493.52	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1317	2493.73	2494.11	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1316	2493.71	2498.27	G	Professor	s^cs^e	+1	0	And , uh , then , uh , look at it more from the aspect of modeling .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1319	2498.85	2499.09	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1318	2498.69	2500.75	G	Professor	s^e	+1	1	You know , have a {disfmarker} have a couple Markov models
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1320	2500.75	2500.89	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1321	2501.5	2507.26	G	Professor	s	+1	1	and , uh , try to indi try to determine , you know , w when is th when are you in an overlap , when are you not in an overlap .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1322	2502.44	2502.68	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1323	2507.81	2512.47	G	Professor	s	+1	1	And let the , uh , uh , statistical system {pause} determine what 's the right way to look at the data .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1325	2513.49	2513.66	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1324	2513.02	2514.35	G	Professor	%--	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I , um ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1326	2514.98	2518.45	G	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	I think it would be interesting to find individual features and put them together .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1327	2518.45	2520.79	G	Professor	s^df	-1	0	I think that you 'd end up with a better system overall .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1329	2521.41	2521.71	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1328	2521.21	2527.25	G	Professor	s	-1	0	But given the limitation in time {vocalsound} and given the fact that Javier 's system already exists {pause} doing this sort of thing ,
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1330	2523.49	2523.99	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1331	2527.85	2529.75	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh , but , uh ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1332	2530.83	2534.52	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	its main limitation is that , again , it 's only looking at silences which would {disfmarker}

Bmr010.G.dialogueact1365	2600.41	2610.85	G	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Cuz again the idea is there {disfmarker} the limitation there again was that he was {disfmarker} he was only using it to look at silence as a {disfmarker} as a {disfmarker} as a {disfmarker} as a p putative split point between speakers .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1366	2606.27	2606.56	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1367	2610.85	2617.11	G	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	But if you included , uh , broadened classes then {pause} in principle maybe you can {pause} cover the overlap cases .

Bmr010.G.dialogueact1411	2665.35	2665.63	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1413	2666.73	2666.94	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1412	2666.44	2667.77	D	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	You mean Ja - eh , eh , Javier program ?
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1414	2667.29	2667.69	A	Grad	s^aa^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1415	2668.06	2670.83	D	PhD	s	-1	0	No , Javier di doesn't worked with , uh , a Markov {disfmarker}
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1416	2671.06	2671.84	A	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Yeah , I didn't think so .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1417	2671.48	2672.57	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	He on only train {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1418	2671.51	2674.9	G	Professor	s^bu.%--	-1	0	Oh , OK . So he 's just {disfmarker} he just computes a Gaussian over potential {disfmarker}
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1419	2674.14	2674.4	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1420	2674.28	2675.63	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Yeah . It was only Gaussian .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1421	2674.9	2675.79	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , I see . I see .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1424	2676.43	2679.18	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And so I {disfmarker} I think it would work fine for detecting overlap .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1423	2676.22	2677.12	D	PhD	s	-1	0	This is the idea .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1422	2676.13	2676.55	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1425	2679.68	2681.98	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	It 's just , uh , that i it {disfmarker}
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1426	2682.09	2683.66	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	he has the two - pass issue that {disfmarker}
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1427	2684.47	2691.85	A	Grad	s^bs	-1	0	What he does is , as a first pass he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} p he does , um , a guess at where the divisions might be and he overestimates .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1428	2692.17	2693.92	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	And that 's just a data reduction step ,
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1429	2694.31	2696.15	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so that you 're not trying at every time interval .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1430	2696.18	2696.51	C	PhD	s^bk^rt	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1431	2696.72	2699.4	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And so those are the putative {pause} places where he tries .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1432	2696.82	2697.33	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1433	2698.35	2698.49	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1434	2698.77	2699.02	C	PhD	s^bk^rt	-1	0	OK .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1435	2699.65	2701.53	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And right now he 's doing that with silence
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1436	2701.74	2702.62	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and that doesn't work
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1437	2703.14	2704.25	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	with the Meeting Recorder .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1439	2704.95	2709.28	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	So if we used another method to get the first pass , I think it would probably work .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1438	2704.74	2704.88	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1440	2705.36	2705.9	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah . Sure .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1441	2706.58	2706.74	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1442	2706.85	2707.24	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah , OK .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1443	2709.28	2710.02	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	It 's a good method .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1444	2710.42	2712.41	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	As long as the len as long the segments are long enough .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1445	2712.09	2712.31	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1446	2712.78	2713.58	A	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's the other problem .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1448	2713.06	2713.42	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1447	2712.79	2715.65	G	Professor	s^co^t	-1	0	O - k OK . So let me go back to what you had , though .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1449	2715.71	2716.01	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1450	2715.75	2716.15	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1452	2716.66	2717.01	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1451	2716.56	2719.8	G	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	The other thing one could do is {disfmarker} Couldn't {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1453	2719.8	2721.91	G	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , it 's {disfmarker} So you have two categories
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1455	2722.51	2722.7	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1454	2722.46	2724.02	G	Professor	s	-1	0	and you have Markov models for each .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1456	2724.74	2725.9	G	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Couldn't you have a third category ?
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1457	2727.37	2732.55	G	Professor	qy^d^e^rt	+1	0	So you have , uh {disfmarker} you have , {vocalsound} uh , nonspeech , single - person speech , and multiple - person speech ?
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1458	2732.54	2733.8	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	He has this on his board actually .
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1459	2733.8	2737.23	F	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	Don't you have , like those {disfmarker} those several different {vocalsound} categories on the board ?
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1460	2736.2	2736.55	G	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1461	2737.15	2738.96	G	Professor	qy^d^rt	+1	0	And then you have a Markov model for each ?
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1462	2739.7	2740.29	C	PhD	h	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1463	2742.43	2742.94	C	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I 'm not sure .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1464	2743.16	2746.13	C	PhD	s	+1	0	I {disfmarker} I thought about , uh , adding , uh , uh , another class too .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1465	2746.13	2753.71	C	PhD	s	-1	0	But it 's not too easy , I think , the {disfmarker} the transition between the different class , to model them in {disfmarker} in the system I have now .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1466	2753.71	2756.69	C	PhD	s^am	-1	0	But it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it could be possible , I think ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1467	2754.35	2754.75	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1468	2756.77	2757.12	G	Professor	s^bk^r	-1	0	I see .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1469	2757.45	2757.98	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	in principle .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1470	2758.57	2759.23	G	Professor	%--	-1	0	Yeah , I mean , I {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1471	2759.79	2760.93	G	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	This is all pretty gross .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1473	2761.4	2761.63	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1472	2760.93	2767.16	G	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , the {disfmarker} th the reason why , uh , I was suggesting originally that we look at features is because I thought , well , we 're doing something we haven't done before ,
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1474	2767.13	2767.33	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1475	2767.56	2770.34	G	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	we should at least look at the space and understand {disfmarker}
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1477	2769.54	2769.73	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1476	2769.4	2769.7	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1478	2770.61	2774.56	G	Professor	s	-1	0	It seems like if two people {disfmarker} two or more people talk at once , it should get louder ,
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1479	2774.92	2775.13	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1480	2775.47	2779.99	G	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh , and , uh , uh , there should be some discontinuity in pitch contours ,
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1481	2776.84	2777.63	C	PhD	s^na	-1	0	I had the impression .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1482	2780.54	2780.88	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1484	2781.08	2781.24	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1483	2780.65	2791.95	G	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and , uh , there should overall be a , um , smaller proportion of the total energy that is explained by any particular harmonic {pause} sequence in the spectrum .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1486	2791.08	2791.31	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1485	2790.66	2790.88	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1487	2792.51	2794.67	G	Professor	s	-1	0	So those are all things that should be there .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1490	2795.14	2795.36	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1489	2795.04	2795.4	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1488	2794.67	2798.81	G	Professor	s.%--	+1	2	So far , um , uh , Jose has {disfmarker} has been {disfmarker}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1491	2799.42	2801.08	G	Professor	s^t3	-1	0	By the way , I was told I should be calling you Pepe ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1492	2801.13	2801.25	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1494	2803.27	2803.56	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1493	2803.1	2803.66	G	Professor	s^e	-1	0	by your friends ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1495	2803.66	2803.72	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	but
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1496	2804.32	2804.52	G	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	Anyway ,
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1498	2805.06	2805.5	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1497	2804.95	2805.48	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1499	2805.92	2812.1	G	Professor	s	+1	1	uh , the {disfmarker} has {disfmarker} has , uh , been exploring , uh , e largely the energy issue
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1500	2812.1	2812.41	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	and ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1501	2812.96	2813.57	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1502	2813.75	2816.89	G	Professor	s	+1	0	as with a lot of things , it is not {disfmarker} uh , like this , it 's not as simple as it sounds .
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1504	2817.08	2817.25	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1503	2816.89	2824.74	G	Professor	s:qy	+1	0	And then there 's , you know {disfmarker} Is it energy ? Is it log energy ? Is it LPC residual energy ? Is it {disfmarker} is it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} is it , uh , delta of those things ?
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1505	2824.74	2825.5	G	Professor	s.%--:qw.%--	-1	0	Uh , what is it no
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1506	2825.5	2829.27	G	Professor	s	-1	0	Obviously , just a simple number {disfmarker} {vocalsound} absolute number isn't gonna work .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1507	2829.28	2831.75	G	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	So {vocalsound} it should be with {disfmarker} compared to what ?
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1508	2831.75	2837.74	G	Professor	qy^rt	+1	0	Should there be a long window for the {vocalsound} normalizing factor and a short window for what you 're looking at ?
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1509	2835.64	2835.84	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1510	2837.74	2839.27	G	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	Or , you know , how b short should they be ?
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1511	2839.27	2839.54	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1513	2840.36	2840.72	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1512	2840.11	2842.25	G	Professor	s	-1	0	th he 's been playing around with a lot of these different things
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1514	2842.25	2847.56	G	Professor	s	+1	1	and {disfmarker} and so far at least has not come up with {vocalsound} any combination that really gave you an indicator .

Bmr010.G.dialogueact1517	2848.58	2851.77	G	Professor	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I still have a hunch that there 's {disfmarker} it 's in there some place ,
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1518	2851.77	2858.28	G	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	but it may be {disfmarker} given that you have a limited time here , it {disfmarker} it just may not be the best thing to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to {disfmarker} to focus on for the remaining of it .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1519	2856.32	2856.48	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr010.G.dialogueact1521	2858.28	2863.7	G	Professor	s	-1	0	So pitch - related and harmonic - related , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {pause} somewhat more hopeful for it .

Bmr010.G.dialogueact1529	2873.32	2876.46	G	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	uh , but in addition there 's an expansion of what Javier did .
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1530	2876.46	2879.47	G	Professor	s	+1	0	And one of those things , looking at the statistical component ,

Bmr010.D.dialogueact1537	2890.18	2894.98	D	PhD	qw	+1	1	But , eh , what did you think about the possibility of using the Javier software ?

Bmr010.A.dialogueact1551	2944.01	2944.39	A	Grad	qw	-1	0	What do you mean ?
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1552	2944.33	2953.96	D	PhD	qy	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I mean , that is {disfmarker} is enough {disfmarker} is enough , eh , to work well , eh , to , eh , separate or to distinguish , eh , between overlapping zone and , eh , speaker zone ?
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1553	2954.35	2966.24	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Because th {vocalsound} if {disfmarker} if we {disfmarker} if we , eh , nnn , develop an classifier {disfmarker} and the second step doesn't work {pause} well , eh , we have {pause} another problem .

Bmr010.A.dialogueact1555	2966.31	2969.76	A	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Yeah . I had tried doing it by hand at one point with a very short sample ,
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1556	2966.46	2967.06	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	N
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1557	2970.01	2971.01	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and it worked pretty well ,
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1558	2971.01	2972.84	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	but I haven't worked with it a lot .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1559	2973.52	2976.0	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So what I d I d I took a hand - segmented sample
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1560	2973.7	2974.12	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Nnn , yeah .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1561	2976.0	2979.37	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and I added ten times the amount of numbers at random ,
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1562	2977.43	2977.74	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1564	2979.85	2982.08	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and it did pick out pretty good boundaries .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1563	2979.61	2979.86	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1565	2981.02	2982.41	D	PhD	fg|%-	-1	0	Yeah . But is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} if {disfmarker}
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1566	2982.08	2984.44	A	Grad	s	-1	0	But this was just very anecdotal sort of thing .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1567	2984.13	2989.81	D	PhD	s	+1	0	But it 's possible with my segmentation by hand {pause} that we have information about the {disfmarker} the overlapping ,
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1568	2989.76	2996.1	A	Grad	fg|s^cs	+1	1	Right . So if we {disfmarker} if we fed the hand - segmentation to Javier 's and it doesn't work , then we know something 's wrong .
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1569	2989.81	2990.53	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker} Yeah .

Bmr010.A.dialogueact1574	2997.41	2998.91	A	Grad	s^na	+1	1	Yeah . I think that 's probably worthwhile doing .
