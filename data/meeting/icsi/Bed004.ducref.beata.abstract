In this meeting of the Berkeley Even Deeper Understanding group speaker mn015 presented the results of an experiment of the dialogue system Wizard , created for the tourist domain.
The experiment consisted of leading a subject to believe she were talking to a computer , then having the "computer" break down and be replaced with a human.
The group then discussed improvements to the program's user interface , personnel issues regarding further data collection , as well as conceptual and architectural issues regarding the Wizard.
