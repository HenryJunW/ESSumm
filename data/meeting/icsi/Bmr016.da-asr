Bmr016.D.dialogueact10	14.139	15.699	D	Grad	fg	-1	0	okay so um you collecting and gender huh 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact9	13.748	14.438	F	Professor	fg	-1	0	okay so okay you 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact11	14.908	16.148	F	Professor	s^bu|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	okay so um i did collecting agenda you collecting and gender huh 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact12	16.2	17.29	D	Grad	s^na^rt	-1	0	i did collecting agenda 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact13	18.22	19.37	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so i'm going to go first 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact14	20.063	20.763	D	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	hot it 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact15	20.993	21.783	D	Grad	s	-1	0	hot it shouldn't take too long uhhuh 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact16	21.002	21.072	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	shouldn't take too long uhhuh 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact17	22.186	24.636	D	Grad	s	+1	1	um so we're pretty much out of digits we've gone 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact18	24.806	26.136	D	Grad	s	-1	0	we've gone once it that um so 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact19	26.678	28.048	D	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	um so the only thing i have to do it's right 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact20	27.46	28.06	F	Professor	s^ar|s	-1	0	the only thing i have to do it's right 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact21	28.76	29.16	D	Grad	s^na	-1	0	it's right 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact22	31.13	32.74	D	Grad	s	+1	0	so i i just have to go through them and 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact23	31.351	31.781	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	so i i just have to go 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact24	32.74	36.54	D	Grad	fh|s	+1	0	through them and uh pick out the ones that have problems 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact25	37.12	39.42	D	Grad	s	+1	0	and either correct them or have them re read so we probably 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact26	39.42	44.29	D	Grad	s	-1	0	read so we probably have like four or five more forms to be read to be wants to this that i've also 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact27	44.841	47.101	D	Grad	s	-1	0	that i've also extracted out about an hours worth we have about two hours 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact28	47.101	48.541	D	Grad	s	+1	2	we have about two hours worth 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact29	49.158	50.608	D	Grad	s	-1	0	i started about an hour's worth which are 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact30	50.608	56.09	D	Grad	s	-1	0	hour's worth which are the the digits would pour which is do speak or have speaker for have filled out speaker forms 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact31	56.09	57.18	D	Grad	s^e	-1	0	have filled out speaker forms not everyone's filled out a 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact32	57.18	58.58	D	Grad	s	-1	0	not everyone's filled out a speaker for extracted 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact33	58.58	61.505	D	Grad	s	-1	0	speaker for extracted one procedures you have speaker forms and 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact34	61.93	66.44	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and for meetings in which the key file and uh transfer files reversible 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact35	67.14	69.76	D	Grad	s	-1	0	some of the early keep files it looks like we're done by hand 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact36	70.07	71.57	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and so they're not automatically percival and have to go back 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact37	71.57	73.13	D	Grad	s	-1	0	percival and have to go back and fix those so 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact38	73.96	78.02	D	Grad	s	+1	2	so what that means we have about an hour uh transcribed it just that we can play with 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact39	79.15	79.71	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr016.D.dialogueact41	82.72	83.5	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	it is she's do you think two hours 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact40	82.51	85.64	F	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	it is she's do you think two hours is the is the total that we have 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact42	85.5	85.71	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	that we have 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact43	86.4	86.53	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact44	87.39	88.59	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and you think what it was uh i didn't 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact45	88.59	91.13	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	was uh i didn't quite catch all these different things that are not quite right that you think will be able to 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact46	91.13	93.86	F	Professor	qy^bu^d	+1	0	yes absolutely that you think will be able to retrieve the other or something 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact47	93.27	93.99	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yes absolutely something 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact48	94.13	94.41	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	so it's okay 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact49	94.81	97.27	D	Grad	s	+1	0	so it's just a question of little hand editing of some files and then waiting for more okay 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact50	97.27	99.71	D	Grad	s	+1	0	and then waiting for more people to turn in their speaker forms 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact51	100.121	101.851	D	Grad	s	-1	0	i have this web based speaker form and i 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact52	101.851	105.221	D	Grad	s	+1	0	speaker form and i sent an email to everyone who hadn't feel that speaker form and they're slowly 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact53	105.401	106.801	D	Grad	s	+1	1	and they're slowly trickling in so 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact54	107.086	109.986	F	Professor	s^bu.%-	+1	0	still labeling the relevance of the speaker form here 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact55	109.52	112.02	D	Grad	s	+1	0	still labeling the extracted audio files oh okay 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact56	112.48	113.22	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	by oh okay 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact57	113.88	116.05	D	Grad	s^e	+1	0	by speaker id and microphone type wasn't like whether they were giving us permission to use their digits 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact58	114.77	117.77	F	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	speaker id and microphone type no i spoke wasn't like whether they were giving us permission to use their digits or something 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact59	117.691	119.021	D	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	no i spoke with jane about that and we sort of decided that or something 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact60	119.021	122.498	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and we sort of decided that it's probably not an issue that we headed 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact61	122.798	125.63	D	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	that we headed out any of the errors anyway right so the 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact63	125.63	127.51	D	Grad	s	-1	0	right so the there are no errors in the digits you always read 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact62	125.38	125.61	F	Professor	b	-1	0	right so the 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact64	127.51	128.96	D	Grad	s	-1	0	the digits you always read the string correctly 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact65	130.068	131.908	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so i can't imagine why anyone would care 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact66	133.42	136.66	D	Grad	s^t^tc.%--	+1	1	so the other topic was digits is uh 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact67	138.72	141.57	D	Grad	s	+1	1	liz would like to elicit different on x. and 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact68	141.85	146.33	D	Grad	s	+1	1	x. and so we tried last week with them right now in english and it just didn't 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact69	146.608	147.718	D	Grad	s	+1	1	and it just didn't work at all because 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact70	147.838	149.628	D	Grad	s^df	+1	1	work at all because no one group them together so it just 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact71	149.688	153.265	D	Grad	s	-1	0	them together so it just sounded like many many more lines instead of anything else so 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact72	153.84	164.615	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so in conversations with liz and uh jane we decide that if you wrote them out as numbers instead of words it would it listed more phone number or social security number like readings 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact73	165.15	168.01	D	Grad	s	-1	0	the problem with that is it becomes numbers instead of digits when i look at 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact74	168.561	172.451	D	Grad	s	-1	0	when i look at this that first line is sixty one sixty two eighteen eighty six ten 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact75	173.3	175.52	D	Grad	qh	-1	0	um and so the question is does anyone care i'm 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact76	175.88	182.14	D	Grad	s	-1	0	care i'm a very spoken with liz and she feels that correct me if i'm wrong that for for connected numbers is fine as opposed to connected 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact77	176.637	176.967	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	a very spoken with liz 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact78	182.41	183.85	D	Grad	s^e	-1	0	as opposed to connected digits 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact79	184.39	188.63	D	Grad	s	-1	0	um i think two hours is probably fine for cats that 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact80	189.1	193.09	D	Grad	s	-1	0	but maybe a little short if we actually want to do training in that station and all that other stuff 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact81	193.332	193.532	F	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr016.F.dialogueact82	194.31	196.2	F	Professor	fg	-1	0	do you um you want 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact83	196.863	198.233	F	Professor	s	-1	0	you want different preside like so if you always had 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact84	198.233	200.703	F	Professor	qy^bu^d	-1	0	like so if you always had the same grouping you wouldn't like that is that 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact85	200.833	201.533	F	Professor	qy	-1	0	like that is that correct 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact86	202.32	204.28	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	you have to be well we actually figured out a way to the 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact87	204.717	205.367	D	Grad	fg|%-	-1	0	you have to be to the groupings are randomly 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact88	204.83	206.83	G	PhD	s	-1	0	you have to be no but to the groupings are randomly generated 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact89	206.78	210.51	F	Professor	s^ar|s	-1	0	no but i was asking if that was something you really care about because of it wasn't generated 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact90	210.51	220.192	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	care about because of it wasn't it seems to me if you made it really specifically telephone groupings that maybe people wouldn't uh agree with the number so much 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact91	221.467	222.647	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	you know if it if it's i think they may still 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact93	222.014	222.344	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	it's they may still 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact92	221.912	223.572	G	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	you know if it if it's i think they may still do it um 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact94	223.762	224.322	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	these um do it um 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact95	224.59	226.42	F	Professor	s^aap^am|s^ng	-1	0	what about putting a hyphen between these um but i probably not so much 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact96	225.454	227.974	B	PhD	qh^cs	-1	0	what about putting a hyphen between the numbers in the group but i probably not so much 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact97	225.614	225.904	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	what about but i probably not so 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact98	228.46	228.66	F	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right so if you 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact99	228.66	230.55	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	six dash one you mean right so if you if if you have uh 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact100	230.07	231.23	D	Grad	qy^bu^d	-1	0	six dash one you mean uh if you go six 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact101	231.66	234.76	F	Professor	s	-1	0	if you go six six six uh dashed uh two nine three one 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact102	237.317	239.347	G	PhD	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	i well okay i it might help i would like to 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact103	239.347	243.671	G	PhD	s^am	-1	0	that's what i was help i would like to get away from having only one specific grouping um 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact104	243.579	244.629	F	Professor	s|s^bk	-1	0	that's what i was asking yeah grouping um so if 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact105	243.831	245.871	G	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	that's what i was asking yeah grouping um so if that's your question 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact106	246.207	246.457	F	Professor	b	-1	0	but 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact107	246.581	252.311	G	PhD	s^df	+1	0	yeah but i mean it seems to me that at least for us we can learn to read the maths digits if that's what people 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact109	252.46	252.74	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yeah if that's what people 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact108	252.311	253.321	G	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah if that's what people want i i don't 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact110	253.321	253.751	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	want i i don't 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact111	253.965	254.205	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	want i i don't think i'd be that 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact112	254.01	257.02	G	PhD	s	+1	0	i agree think i'd be that hard three them as single digits um 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact113	255.44	255.75	E	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	i agree hard three them 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact114	257.15	257.65	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact115	258.29	261.69	G	PhD	s	-1	0	it seems like that might be better for you guys since then 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact116	261.69	263.46	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	right you guys since then you'll have just more digit date uh 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact117	263.73	263.93	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right date uh 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact118	264.06	265.7	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and that's always a good thing 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact120	266.637	266.867	D	Grad	b	-1	0	it's a little bit 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact119	266.528	267.918	G	PhD	s	-1	0	it's a little bit better for me too because 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact121	267.918	269.988	G	PhD	s^df	+1	0	better for me too because the digits are easier to recognize the 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact122	269.988	272.118	G	PhD	s^df^e	+1	0	so we could just uh put easier to recognize the better trained than uh numbers 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact124	271.73	277.18	D	Grad	s^cs:s	-1	0	so we could just uh put in thee instructions read them as digits uh numbers right right be the missing that 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact123	271.564	271.944	F	Professor	b	-1	0	so we could uh numbers 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact125	275.84	278.48	G	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	instructions read them as digits right right be the missing that just so 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact126	278.48	280.84	G	PhD	s:s	-1	0	just so sixty one was red as six one and if 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact127	279.777	280.347	E	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	sixty one was red as six one and if 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact128	280.84	282.29	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	how about over so zero as six one and if people make mistakes we 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact129	281.86	283.08	D	Grad	qw	-1	0	how about over so zero people make mistakes we 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact130	284.25	286.46	F	Professor	s^cs^ng	-1	0	i mean the other thing is we could just bag it because it's 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact131	286.46	287.89	F	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	bag it because it's it's it's and 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact132	287.89	288.85	F	Professor	s	-1	0	it's it's and worrying about it i mean 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact133	288.85	293.2	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	worrying about it i mean because we do have digits training data that we have from uh from oh gee i i started to just 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact134	293.24	293.65	F	Professor	s^fa	-1	0	i started to just 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact135	293.65	295.96	F	Professor	s^bsc	-1	0	i started to just numbers train data that we have our g. i. we've 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact136	295.96	298.08	F	Professor	s	-1	0	that we have our g. i. we've done lots and lots of studies with that and um 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact137	298.32	299.37	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	and um but it's 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact138	299.86	302.8	G	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	but it's nice to get it in this room with uh because i mean 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact139	302.119	302.469	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	because i mean 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact140	302.8	304.71	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	no i guess what i'm saying is that because i mean 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact141	303.47	305.03	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	just let them read no i guess what i'm saying is that to some extent 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact142	305.45	306.77	D	Grad	s^2	+1	0	just let them read it how they read it to some extent may we could just reading 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact143	305.5	309.0	F	Professor	s	-1	0	just let them read it how they read it to some extent may we could just reading and have them read how how they read it and just means we have 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact144	309.06	314.07	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and just means we have to expand our our vocabulary out to stuff that we already have yeah well that's fine with me as long as it's just that 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact145	309.544	309.994	G	PhD	b	-1	0	and just means we have 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact146	312.82	322.24	G	PhD	s^na	-1	0	out to stuff that we already have yeah we can go back to well that's fine with me as long as it's just that i didn't want to cause the people who would have been collecting digits the other day to not have the digit 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact147	314.23	314.55	F	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah long as it's just that 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact149	322.43	324.26	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	we can go back to the other thing later i mean we we 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact148	322.24	323.32	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	we can go back to the other thing later 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact150	324.26	327.761	F	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean we we we've it we can do this for awhile and then go 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact151	325.32	325.69	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	we've it 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact152	327.761	329.501	F	Professor	s	-1	0	do this for awhile and then go back to digits for awhile or 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact153	329.501	330.836	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	or 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact154	331.196	336.78	F	Professor	qy	-1	0	you i mean you want you want this do you need training day there adaptation is out of this how much 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact155	331.734	332.014	G	PhD	b	-1	0	you i mean you want you want this 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact156	336.78	337.73	F	Professor	qw	-1	0	is out of this how much of this duty with 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact157	337.88	338.8	F	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	of this duty with uh uh 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact158	341.07	343.07	G	PhD	s^no	-1	0	it's actually unclear right now i just thought well we're 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact159	343.07	351.086	G	PhD	s	+1	0	i just thought well we're differ collette collecting digits an adamant said we were running out of t. i. forms i thought it would be nice to have them in groups and probably 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact160	351.086	355.836	G	PhD	s^rt	+1	0	and probably all else being equal would be better for me to just have single digits since 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact162	356.067	356.437	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay it's 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact161	355.836	360.158	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	okay single digits since it's you know i recognize is going to do better on uh anyway um 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact163	360.99	362.37	G	PhD	s^df^e	-1	0	um and it's more predictable so we can know from 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact164	362.37	366.39	G	PhD	s	-1	0	okay well if you so we can know from the trance or what the person said in the transcriber in general but if they make 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact165	363.66	364.33	F	Professor	s^bk|s.%-	-1	0	okay well if you the trance or what the person said in the transcriber 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact166	366.39	368.34	G	PhD	s	-1	0	but if they make mistakes it's no big deal if people 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact167	368.34	371.47	G	PhD	s^e:s	-1	0	if people say a hundred instead of one oh oh and 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact168	372.051	376.911	G	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	also we maybe can just let them choose zero versus so as they as they like because 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact169	376.911	381.811	G	PhD	s^df:s	-1	0	as they like because even the same person sometimes says oh and sometimes so zero in different context and that 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact170	381.415	381.775	F	Professor	b	-1	0	different context and that 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact171	381.811	382.801	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	different context and that sort of interesting 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact172	383.78	386.49	G	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	so i don't have uh specific need because if i did 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact173	386.49	391.65	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	need because if i did i'd probably try to collect it you know without bothering this group but 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact174	391.74	393.99	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	okay so so i can just this group but if we can try it 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact175	393.11	396.42	D	Grad	fg|s^cs	+1	1	okay so so i can just add to the instructions treated as digits not as connected we can try it right and 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact176	396.42	397.91	D	Grad	s	-1	0	not as connected numbers right and you can give an example 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact178	396.792	397.152	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	not as connected numbers right and you can give an example 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact177	396.442	398.312	G	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	not as connected numbers right and you can give an example like 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact179	398.312	402.87	G	PhD	s:s	-1	0	right like you know six sixty one would be read as six one 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact180	402.89	403.1	D	Grad	b	-1	0	right six one and think 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact182	403.343	403.493	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	and think 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact183	403.563	406.793	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and it actually it's no more official than what we've been doing with words i'm sure and think people okay 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact181	403.24	404.94	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and it actually it's no more and think people okay 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact184	406.793	408.163	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	doing with words i'm sure people can adapt to this are single right right 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact186	408.418	409.018	E	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	are single the spaces already right right it's just easier to read 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact185	408.113	408.923	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	are single right right 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact188	409.168	411.848	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	the spaces already biased toward being separated it's just easier to read 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact187	408.923	410.413	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	are single the spaces already biased toward right right it's just easier to read 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact190	412.526	414.176	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	oh yeah absolutely i know i'm going to find it's easier than words 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact189	412.34	412.74	G	PhD	b	-1	0	i know i'm going to 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact191	414.4	415.18	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	oh yeah absolutely cognitive li it's much 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact193	415.18	416.9	D	Grad	s^e	-1	0	cognitive li it's much easier i also had 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact192	414.935	415.415	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	oh yeah absolutely cognitive li it's much 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact194	416.574	418.394	G	PhD	s	-1	0	easier i also had a hard time with the words but then we went back 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact196	418.494	418.844	F	Professor	b	-1	0	but then we went back 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact195	418.394	419.554	G	PhD	s	-1	0	but then we went back and forth and okay so let's 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact197	419.614	421.024	G	PhD	s	-1	0	okay and as the spacing all right and forth and okay so let's give that a try and 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact198	420.66	425.02	D	Grad	s^bk|qr	-1	0	okay and as the spacing all right do you think there should be more space between digits in groups give that a try and 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact199	420.934	421.244	F	Professor	b	-1	0	okay and as the spacing all right give that a try and 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact200	421.024	421.234	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	and as the spacing all right and 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact202	426.72	427.35	D	Grad	qrr	-1	0	is that right i mean what do other people think is you 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact201	426.522	427.672	G	PhD	qw	-1	0	is that right i mean what do other people think is you 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact203	427.672	428.962	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	right i people think is you reading them 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact204	428.972	430.192	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	i think that it's fine it's to me reading them 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact206	430.327	430.557	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	it's to me 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact205	430.262	434.742	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it's to me it looks like you've got the phone the idea grouping you have great the idea of separation and 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact207	430.609	431.039	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	it's to me it looks like you've got the phone 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact208	434.742	438.272	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	of separation and it's just a matter if the instructions so okay 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact209	438.086	439.136	G	PhD	s^ba|s^bk	-1	0	and i think they're about ten so that's right okay let's give it a try 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact211	439.28	441.32	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and i think they're about ten different grouping patterns and that right liz that's right let's give it a try 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact212	439.437	439.957	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and i think they're about ten that's right let's give it a try 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact210	439.136	440.136	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and i think they're about ten different grouping patterns that's right let's give it a try 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact213	441.32	442.4	D	Grad	qy	-1	0	and that right liz 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact215	443.37	443.75	D	Grad	s^e	-1	0	yeah we did right right and 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact214	443.17	447.9	G	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah we did right right and just the randomly generated and randomly assigned to dishes 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact216	448.344	448.524	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	i did so we have 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact218	448.834	449.104	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	i did so we have sorry i 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact217	448.36	448.87	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	i did so we have 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact220	449.444	449.664	E	Postdoc	s^co	-1	0	sorry i 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact219	449.36	449.69	F	Professor	s^fa	-1	0	sorry i 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact221	449.69	455.445	F	Professor	s	+1	0	sorry i just say so we have this any forty hours uh of recordings now and 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact222	455.97	458.49	F	Professor	s^bu	+1	2	now and you're saying two hours uh is digits so that's for for 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact223	458.49	459.79	F	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	digits so that's for for the racial and something 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact225	459.965	460.175	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	the racial and something like twenty twenty 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact224	459.79	461.5	F	Professor	s	+1	0	the racial and something like twenty twenty to one certain snakes 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact226	461.64	463.746	F	Professor	s	-1	0	to one certain snakes makes sense so if we 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact227	463.746	468.106	F	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	right makes sense so if we did another forty hours recordings going to get another couple hours of this 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact228	467.64	467.92	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right hours of this 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact229	469.003	473.643	F	Professor	s	+1	0	um yeah like you say i think a couple hours for a for a for a test test that's okay to 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact230	473.986	476.016	F	Professor	s	-1	0	that's okay to be nice to get you know more later because well menus 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact231	476.016	479.796	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	well menus uses up in some sense but 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact232	479.542	479.912	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	some sense but 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact234	480.181	480.371	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact233	479.796	480.926	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah some sense but 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact235	480.974	482.284	E	Postdoc	fg|s^na	-1	0	yeah i also would like to are you for that because it it seems to 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact236	482.284	487.614	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	for that because it it seems to me that um there's a real strength and having the same test replicating a whole bunch of times and adding to 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact237	487.614	489.834	E	Postdoc	s^df^e	-1	0	bunch of times and adding to that basic test bank 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact238	489.82	490.08	D	Grad	b	-1	0	test bank because then you have 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact239	489.914	490.024	E	Postdoc	s^bk.%	-1	0	test bank because then you have 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact240	490.344	495.681	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because then you have no more and more chances to get away from random errors and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact241	496.001	502.041	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i think um the other thing too is that right now we have service try to fight sample with reference to dialect groups and it might 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact242	502.201	508.407	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and it might be there might be an argument to be made for having a for for replicating all of the digits that we've done which were done 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact243	508.407	510.397	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	done which were done by non native speakers so the we have a core 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact244	510.397	513.637	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so the we have a core that totally replicate c. original data set which 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact245	514.054	515.684	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	is totally american speakers and we have 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact246	515.684	520.254	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i speakers and we have these try to fight additional language groups overlapping certain aspects of the database 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact247	517.52	517.73	D	Grad	b	-1	0	additional language groups 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact248	520.88	529.26	D	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	i think that uh trying to duplicate spending too much effort trying to duplicate the existing t. i. digits probably's into worthwhile because the recording 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact249	529.26	531.94	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because the recording situation is so different it's 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact250	531.18	531.4	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	is so different it's 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact251	531.94	533.78	D	Grad	s^df^e	-1	0	is so different it's going to be very hard to be parable 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact252	534.181	541.651	E	Postdoc	s^df^nd	-1	0	except that if you have the stimuli comparable then it said something about t. b. contribution of setting and no it's it's not the same little bit but the other 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact253	537.4	538.68	F	Professor	s^ar|s^nd	-1	0	then it said something about t. no it's it's not the same 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact255	541.651	541.921	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	setting and little bit but the other 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact254	541.155	541.615	F	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	setting and little bit but the other 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact256	541.705	543.355	F	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	setting and okay little bit but the other differences are so major 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact259	544.13	545.54	D	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	yeah i mean red versus naught such major sources of variance that it's 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact257	543.73	544.0	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	yeah i mean red versus okay such major sources 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact258	544.101	547.321	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	yeah i mean red versus naught what's an example such major sources of variance that it's it's it's uh 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact260	547.69	550.2	E	Postdoc	qw	-1	0	what's an example of uh of the other difference any uh 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact261	550.38	552.04	E	Postdoc	qo^e	-1	0	any different well the individual 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact262	551.84	556.39	F	Professor	s	-1	0	different well the individual human a lot of maybe different free trial you know it's just 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact263	555.938	556.168	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	maybe different free trial you know it's just 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact264	556.39	558.26	F	Professor	s	-1	0	well and not just trial you know it's just there's so many things it's it's and 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact267	558.52	559.39	D	Grad	s^na	-1	0	well and not just that i mean the uh it's it's and and the notation 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact265	558.317	558.637	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	well and not just it's it's and 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact266	558.42	560.14	F	Professor	s	-1	0	well and not just that i mean the uh it's it's and and the notation 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact268	559.39	562.39	D	Grad	s	-1	0	that i mean the uh the corpus itself we're collecting and the notation 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact269	562.53	566.11	D	Grad	s	-1	0	we're collecting it in a red digit you know take care of list and i'm sure that they're 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact270	566.3	569.35	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and i'm sure that they're doing more specific stuff i mean if i remember correctly 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact271	569.35	573.2	D	Grad	s	-1	0	stuff i mean if i remember correctly it was like postman reading zip codes and things like that i it is it's what i 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact272	573.144	573.984	F	Professor	qy^bu^d	-1	0	i it is it's what i 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact274	574.0	574.65	D	Grad	s^na	-1	0	thought so thought i thought it was red 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact273	573.984	575.264	F	Professor	s^df^ng	-1	0	i thought so whether it's it is it's what i thought i thought it was red 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact275	575.67	576.05	D	Grad	qy	-1	0	whether it's yeah i think the readings 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact276	576.29	578.47	F	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	oh i may yeah i think the readings it because if you think you know g. i. 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact277	578.74	579.47	D	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	oh i may well be g. i. yeah not i did 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact278	579.46	582.38	F	Professor	s	-1	0	well be i have never listened to yeah not i did just as red in the red in the studio i believe 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact279	581.95	583.77	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	i have never listened to t. i. digits so red in the studio i believe 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact281	584.04	585.68	D	Grad	s	-1	0	i don't really know how it compares 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact280	583.807	584.167	F	Professor	b	-1	0	t. i. digits so i don't really know how 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact282	585.62	586.02	F	Professor	b	-1	0	it compares but regardless but it but 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact284	586.69	589.61	D	Grad	s	-1	0	but regardless it's going to it's hard to compare cross corpus but it but it it's different 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact283	586.55	587.1	F	Professor	%-	-1	0	but regardless it's going to it's but it but 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact285	589.52	591.75	F	Professor	s	-1	0	corpus it it's different people this is the core thing and 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact286	591.15	591.39	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	the core thing and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact288	592.296	592.526	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	they're different circumstances 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact287	591.93	594.94	F	Professor	s	-1	0	the core thing and they're different circumstances a different recording environment so forth so 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact289	594.94	596.53	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so forth so it's it's it's really pretty different but i think 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact290	596.53	600.83	F	Professor	s	-1	0	pretty different but i think the idea of using a set thing was just to give you some sort of framework so 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact291	600.83	608.9	F	Professor	s	-1	0	sort of framework so that even though you couldn't do exact in paris and wouldn't be valid scientifically at least give you some kind of uh frame of reference 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact292	609.08	610.32	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	yeah is what um you know it's not 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact294	609.766	612.306	B	PhD	fg|qw	-1	0	yeah is what what they groupings everything you said there's like ten um you know it's not 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact293	609.614	609.844	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	yeah is um you know it's 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact295	612.306	613.766	B	PhD	s^e	+1	0	you said there's like ten different groupings 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact296	614.18	618.689	G	PhD	s^aa|s^rt	+1	0	right just groupings in terms of number of groups in a line 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact297	619.159	620.849	G	PhD	s^e	+1	0	and number of digits in a group and 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact298	620.849	623.049	G	PhD	s	+1	0	i'd the patterns like are they in a group and the pattern of grouping 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact299	621.349	621.639	B	PhD	b	-1	0	the pattern of 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact300	622.928	625.588	B	PhD	qo.%--	-1	0	i'd the patterns like are they based on anything grouping 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact301	626.87	630.92	G	PhD	h|s	+1	0	um i i just roughly look at what kinds of digit strings are out there and 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact302	630.92	635.159	G	PhD	s	+1	0	strings are out there and they're usually grouped into either two three or four four digits at a time and they can have 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact303	633.509	634.139	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	four digits at a time 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact304	635.159	635.959	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and they can have 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact305	637.12	639.92	G	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean actually things are getting longer and longer 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact306	640.64	646.24	G	PhD	s	-1	0	neil daisy probably only had three sequences and telephone numbers were less cohort so 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact307	647.01	649.02	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	there's between um well if 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact308	649.9	652.7	G	PhD	s	-1	0	well if you look at it there between like three and five groups and each one 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact309	652.7	655.853	G	PhD	s	-1	0	groups and each one has between two and four groupings and 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact310	655.853	656.073	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	groupings and i purposely 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact311	656.508	660.718	G	PhD	s	+1	0	i purposely didn't want them to look like they're in any kind of pattern 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact312	661.011	661.451	B	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr016.G.dialogueact313	661.438	661.648	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr016.D.dialogueact314	662.33	666.71	D	Grad	s	+1	0	and which group of peers is pick randomly and what the numbers are picked randomly okay 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact315	666.717	667.347	B	PhD	b	-1	0	randomly so i'm like okay 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact317	667.228	672.468	D	Grad	s	+1	0	oh so i'm like the previous one which i simply replicated t. i. digits this is generated randomly 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact316	667.068	667.288	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	so i'm like 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact319	672.803	673.253	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact318	672.422	673.302	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact320	675.158	678.538	G	PhD	s	-1	0	i think it'll be graded to be able to compare digits whether it's these 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact321	678.538	684.059	G	PhD	s	-1	0	digits whether it's these digits or t. i. digits to speakers um and compare that to their spontaneous speech and then we do need 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact322	684.059	688.004	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and then we do need you know a fair amount of of did you did uh because you might be 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact323	688.384	690.344	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because you might be wearing a different microphone and i mean 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact325	690.706	691.046	D	Grad	b	-1	0	and i mean it's it's it's 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact324	690.344	696.54	G	PhD	s	+1	0	and i mean it's it's it's nice to have the digits you know replicated many times 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact326	697.279	700.039	G	PhD	s	+1	1	especially for speakers that don't talk a lot so 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact328	700.274	700.494	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	so 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact327	700.119	701.799	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact329	702.119	702.909	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	for adaptation no 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact330	702.909	703.509	G	PhD	s^ar|s^df	-1	0	yeah all for adaptation no i'm serious so we have 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact334	704.22	704.55	A	PhD	b	-1	0	we have for some people a problem with acoustic 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact333	703.84	705.75	D	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	yeah all we have for some people is digits i'm serious so we have a problem with acoustic adaptation 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact332	703.724	704.124	F	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah all we have for some people i'm serious so we have a problem with acoustic 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact331	703.509	706.249	G	PhD	s	+1	1	yeah all we have for some people is digits i'm serious so we have a problem with acoustic adaptation and we're 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact335	706.249	708.559	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and we're not using the did dictated now but you 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact336	708.559	709.299	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	so you're not now but you know 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact337	709.11	709.62	D	Grad	s^bk|s^bu	-1	0	so you're not know 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact338	710.14	711.43	G	PhD	s^na|s^aa	-1	0	not presentation no we're 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact339	711.59	715.788	G	PhD	s	-1	0	no we're not we were running adaptation only on the data that we ran recognition on 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact340	716.13	719.73	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and i as soon as someone surgery transcript number that thread speech and i thought 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact341	719.73	721.43	G	PhD	s:s	-1	0	oh i see thread speech and i thought well we're going to do better on that that's not 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact342	721.59	722.06	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	oh i see oh that that's not fair to use 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact343	721.782	722.982	G	PhD	s	-1	0	oh i see oh that that's not fair to use 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact344	722.9	724.1	D	Grad	s^a|s^na	-1	0	oh yeah that's true fair to use but it might be fair 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact346	723.89	724.2	A	PhD	s^bk.%	-1	0	yeah that's true but it might be fair 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact345	723.692	726.462	G	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah that's true but it might be fair to use the different stations so 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact347	726.682	727.022	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	stations so so those 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact348	727.74	730.98	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	that'd be interesting to see whether that helps so those speakers who are very quiet shy 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact349	728.27	730.03	D	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	that'd be interesting to see whether that helps speakers who are very quiet shy 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact350	730.98	731.78	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	like do you think that would help shy right 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact352	731.859	732.329	B	PhD	qy^bu^d^j	-1	0	like adam do you think that would help adapting on yeah right

Bmr016.D.dialogueact353	732.907	733.197	D	Grad	s^aa^j	-1	0	adam adapting on yeah yeah a real problem well actually i mean 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact355	733.307	734.537	D	Grad	s^aa^j|s^j^na	-1	0	yeah a real problem with that well actually i mean it's the same microphone 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact354	733.207	733.447	F	Professor	s^aa^j	-1	0	yeah a real problem well actually i mean 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact356	733.422	735.312	G	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	yeah a real problem with that well actually i mean it's the same microphone foot see the nice thing 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact357	735.312	738.102	G	PhD	s	-1	0	right same foot see the nice thing is we have that in the same meeting and 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact358	738.22	738.51	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right same and 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact361	738.72	739.86	D	Grad	s	-1	0	right same same acoustics a microphone and so 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact359	738.681	739.261	F	Professor	b.%	-1	0	right same same acoustics a microphone and so 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact360	738.69	740.57	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	right same same acoustics a microphone same channel and so you don't get 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact362	739.86	740.48	D	Grad	s	-1	0	same acoustics a microphone same channel so you don't get 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact364	740.53	740.72	A	PhD	b	-1	0	same channel you don't get 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact363	740.48	741.23	D	Grad	s	-1	0	same channel you don't get right and so 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact365	741.077	746.644	G	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah i mean for the city um right and so i still like the idea of having some kind of 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact366	743.887	744.117	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	of having some kind of 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact367	745.024	745.174	D	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	yeah i mean for 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact368	745.76	749.006	F	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	yeah i mean for the city um acoustic research for the signal 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact369	749.006	755.21	F	Professor	s	-1	0	the signal processing far afield stuff i see it as as as the place that we start but 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact370	755.994	759.004	F	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	but that may be nice to have twenty hours of digits state that but but uh 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact371	759.074	774.102	F	Professor	s	+1	0	but but uh the truth is i'm hoping that we we to do the stuff that that you guys have been doing to continue that we get uh the best we can do on the spontaneous stuff uh near field and then 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact372	774.612	780.112	F	Professor	s	+1	0	and then um we do a lot of the testing of the algorithms on the digits for the far field at some point 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact373	780.112	787.472	F	Professor	s	+1	0	at some point when we feel it's but surely understand what's going on with it then we we have to move on to the spontaneous dating with the fire field

Bmr016.G.dialogueact377	790.93	793.15	G	PhD	s^bd^df	-1	0	don't have i know this sounds weird i maybe it's completely

Bmr016.A.dialogueact383	801.71	802.42	A	PhD	s	-1	0	that the problem i see 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact384	802.07	805.98	D	Grad	s	-1	0	the problem i see with trying to do over laughing digits is the cognitive load 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact385	806.1	807.11	G	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	doing and everybody's laughing okay

Bmr016.G.dialogueact406	827.556	833.15	G	PhD	s	-1	0	well what i mean is actually not not the overlaps that are well govern linguistically but the actual 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact407	833.15	836.07	G	PhD	s	-1	0	but the actual fact that there's speech coming from two people and being forming stalled

Bmr016.G.dialogueact561	1090.21	1096.48	G	PhD	s	-1	0	well i was actually going to skip the is our results part in favor of getting the transcription stuff talked about since i think 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact562	1092.92	1093.23	D	Grad	b	-1	0	our results part in favor of 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact563	1096.48	1100.15	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	about since i think that's more important to moving forward but i mean morgan 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact564	1100.15	1103.04	G	PhD	s	-1	0	but i mean morgan has this paper copy and if people have questions 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact565	1103.04	1104.61	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and if people have questions 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact566	1105.27	1108.02	G	PhD	s	+1	1	um it's pretty preliminary in terms of this our results because we didn't 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact567	1108.02	1110.77	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because we didn't do anything fancy but i 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact568	1110.77	1114.51	G	PhD	s	-1	0	fancy but i think and just having the results there and pointing 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact569	1114.51	1118.71	G	PhD	s	-1	0	there and pointing out main conclusions like it's 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact570	1118.71	1121.5	G	PhD	s	+1	0	like it's not the speaking style that differs it's the fact 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact571	1121.5	1124.64	G	PhD	s	+1	1	it's the fact that there's overlap that causes recognition errors 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact572	1125.33	1129.24	G	PhD	s	+1	0	and and the fact that it's almost all in search and there is which you would expect 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact573	1129.24	1130.47	G	PhD	s	-1	0	which you would expect but you might also 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact574	1130.53	1135.37	G	PhD	s	+1	0	but you might also think that any overlap reasons you would get substitute shins and so forth 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact575	1136.14	1156.13	G	PhD	fh|s	+1	2	so these are you leads us to believe that doing a better segment patient like you're channel they segment patience or some kind of uh echo cancellation to get basically back down to the individual speaker i'd wrenches would be probably all that we would need to be able to do good recognition on the on the close talking mike so 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact577	1155.77	1156.42	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	so these are you on the close talking mike so 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact576	1155.51	1160.88	D	Grad	qh	-1	0	so these are you if you have a hard copy what're you email it the list on the close talking mike so that's about the summary 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact578	1157.0	1158.42	G	PhD	s	-1	0	if you have a hard copy what're you that's about the summary 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact579	1161.12	1163.65	G	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah but this is morgan has this paper i mean 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact580	1161.9	1163.23	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah but this is morgan has this paper i mean

Bmr016.D.dialogueact589	1167.84	1168.98	D	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	but it's been of been mail where was well basically 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact588	1167.36	1171.51	G	PhD	s	-1	0	but it's been of been mail where was well basically um did a lot of work on that and it's 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact590	1167.9	1168.0	F	Professor	b.%	-1	0	but it's been of been mail where was well basically 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact591	1171.51	1171.96	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	on that and it's 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact592	1173.15	1173.63	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr016.G.dialogueact593	1174.29	1181.55	G	PhD	s	+1	1	i guess the other any thing is it shows for sure that the look how you know within speak air is bad and it's bad 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact594	1181.02	1181.27	D	Grad	qy^2^bu^d	-1	0	bad and it's bad 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact595	1181.55	1184.6	G	PhD	s	+1	1	so bad and it's bad because it picks up the overlapping speech 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact596	1184.91	1189.98	A	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	so you're you're raise our results for on on the all synchronized speech yes 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact597	1190.02	1193.07	G	PhD	s^aa|s^df^rt	-1	0	okay i think because that's all that had been transcribed at the time um 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact598	1190.69	1191.0	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay i think because that's all that had been transcribed 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact599	1191.85	1192.05	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i think that had been transcribed at the time 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact600	1192.57	1192.81	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	at the time 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact601	1193.14	1193.65	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact602	1194.44	1198.03	G	PhD	s	-1	0	but as the i mean i wanted to hear more about the transcription if we can get 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact603	1198.03	1202.4	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	if we can get channel a synchronized for the the closer 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact604	1202.39	1202.57	A	PhD	b	-1	0	the the closer 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact605	1202.85	1203.5	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	the the closer to that would be 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact606	1203.5	1205.21	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so it's that to that would be very interesting for us because we 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact608	1205.44	1205.94	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	so it's that because we 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact607	1205.21	1205.89	G	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	so it's that because we 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact609	1205.99	1209.14	F	Professor	fg|s^df	-1	0	so it's that that's that's why i only used apart from these that you had uh about because we right 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact610	1207.95	1208.1	A	PhD	b	-1	0	used apart from these

Bmr016.G.dialogueact637	1235.52	1237.98	G	PhD	s	-1	0	once and for me it'll call was okay i 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact638	1237.98	1238.73	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	okay i mean i still 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact639	1239.14	1240.04	G	PhD	s^no	-1	0	and i don't know why i'm but 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact640	1240.04	1240.34	G	PhD	%--	-1	0	i'm but 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact641	1240.53	1242.02	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	right how you i'm but um for you it 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact643	1242.67	1244.53	D	Grad	s^am	-1	0	right how you where were i would guess for you it was or who was next to 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact642	1242.47	1243.35	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	right how you where were i would for you it was or 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact644	1243.97	1246.59	G	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah where you were sitting probably affected where were i would guess was or who was next to me or something like that 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact645	1245.6	1247.41	C	Grad	fg|s^na	-1	0	yeah where you were sitting probably affected that me or something like that right 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact646	1247.21	1247.42	A	PhD	b	-1	0	that right 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact647	1247.29	1252.65	G	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	that right but when chuck were little tell ann morgan was talking there a couple really long outer and says where chuck 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact648	1252.65	1255.45	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	outer and says where chuck is saying a few things inside and it's picking 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact649	1255.45	1257.88	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and it's picking up all the morgan words pretty well 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact650	1258.4	1260.39	G	PhD	s.%--	+1	0	and so the wreck you know they're error rates because of an assertion 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact651	1260.39	1261.52	G	PhD	s.%--	+1	0	because of an assertion 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact652	1262.35	1263.51	G	PhD	s	+1	0	answers and aren't bounded so with a 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact653	1263.51	1267.62	G	PhD	s	+1	1	so with a one word better and some tenants or since you know you got huge aerate 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact654	1267.68	1268.02	D	Grad	b	-1	0	aerate and that's that's where the proms 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact655	1268.2	1268.48	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and that's that's where the proms 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact656	1268.21	1269.54	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and that's that's where the proms pumpkin and so i just is 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact657	1269.54	1271.16	G	PhD	s^bd	+1	0	pumpkin and so i just is sort of what we expected but it's nice to be able to 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact658	1271.16	1273.27	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	but it's nice to be able to to show it and also 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact659	1272.85	1273.02	D	Grad	b	-1	0	to show it and also 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact660	1273.75	1281.12	G	PhD	s^tc	+1	0	it and also i just want to mention briefly that um uh and various and i all that ghana alice is still stuck in switzerland and we were 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact661	1281.12	1288.03	G	PhD	s	+1	0	and we were going to ask him if if they're you know what's out there in terms of like okay inflation and things like that not that we were going to do it 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact662	1288.03	1289.06	G	PhD	s	-1	0	not that we were going to do it but we wanted to know 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact663	1289.06	1292.27	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and he said flown flown flew but we wanted to know what would need to be done and 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact664	1290.31	1292.23	D	Grad	s:s	-1	0	and he said flown flown flew what would need to be done and 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact665	1292.27	1295.83	G	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	and he we've given him the data we have so far so these 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact666	1295.83	1298.42	G	PhD	s	-1	0	have so far so these synchronized cases where there overlapped and 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact667	1297.21	1297.35	A	PhD	b	-1	0	cases where there overlapped 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact668	1298.9	1303.19	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and he's going to look into trying to run some things that are out there and 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact669	1303.19	1305.31	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so and see how well i can do because right 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact671	1305.75	1306.05	B	PhD	fg	-1	0	so because right now we're not able to 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact670	1305.66	1309.89	G	PhD	s^df	+1	0	so because right now we're not able to actually report on recognition in a real paper like 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact672	1309.89	1311.0	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	so in a real paper like a years pay for because it would look 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact673	1311.0	1313.54	G	PhD	s^df	+1	0	so so the it would look for premature 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact674	1311.71	1312.02	B	PhD	fg	-1	0	so it would look for premature 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact675	1313.87	1319.3	B	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	so the idea is that you would take this big hunk where somebody is only speaking a small amount in it and then 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact676	1319.3	1325.91	B	PhD	s^bu^e.%-	-1	0	it and then try to figure out where they're speaking based on the other people right or who's at any point in 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact677	1324.39	1327.53	G	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	the other people right or who's at any point in time who's the foreground speaker who's the background 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact678	1327.53	1328.66	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	so i thought we were just speaker who's the background seeker 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact680	1328.87	1329.33	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	so yeah i thought we were just going to move the boundaries and seeker 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact679	1328.38	1330.09	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so yeah yeah but i thought we were just going to move the boundaries and well that's the hand seeker

Bmr016.G.dialogueact681	1329.76	1330.21	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah yeah but going to move the boundaries and well that's the hand

Bmr016.G.dialogueact688	1334.6	1335.34	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	uh i've actually done well there there's 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact687	1334.6	1338.01	A	PhD	s	-1	0	uh i've actually done some experiment sloth across correlation it seems to well there there's

Bmr016.A.dialogueact689	1338.01	1343.06	A	PhD	s	-1	0	it seems to work pretty well too got rid of those so up yeah and that that's the sort of thing that you would do yeah exactly so it's it's 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact691	1341.19	1342.83	D	Grad	s	-1	0	got rid of those so up and that that's the sort of thing that you would do yeah

Bmr016.G.dialogueact693	1342.89	1344.4	G	PhD	s^aa|s.%-	-1	0	so up yeah so why do of thing that you would do yeah exactly so it's it's uh 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact696	1344.63	1346.23	B	PhD	qw	-1	0	so why do you want to do x. accomplished uh 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact697	1347.72	1351.77	G	PhD	s	-1	0	um it would be techniques used from adaptive adaptive echo cancellation which i 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact698	1351.77	1353.87	G	PhD	s^bd^no	-1	0	it just it just cancellation which i don't know enough about to talk about 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact699	1353.19	1353.5	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	it just it just talk about 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact700	1353.55	1355.41	F	Professor	s	+1	0	it just it just or to remove cross time yeah talk about um but right 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact701	1354.23	1354.56	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	or to remove cross um 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact703	1355.37	1355.86	C	Grad	b	-1	0	time yeah but right 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact704	1355.62	1355.8	F	Professor	b	-1	0	time yeah but right 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact702	1355.35	1355.63	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	time yeah but right 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact705	1355.69	1360.04	G	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	time yeah but right um and that would be similar to what you're also trying to do but using 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact706	1360.22	1363.72	G	PhD	s	-1	0	but using um you know more than energy i i 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact708	1364.03	1364.45	A	PhD	b	-1	0	don't know what 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact707	1363.76	1366.19	G	PhD	s^no	-1	0	yeah for so it would be i i don't know what exactly would go into it so it the idea is 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact709	1365.36	1365.87	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah for exactly would go into 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact711	1366.26	1366.97	B	PhD	s^bu.%-	-1	0	so it would be it so it the idea is 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact710	1366.19	1368.78	G	PhD	s	+1	0	so it would be it so it the idea is to basically run this on the whole meeting 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact712	1369.43	1374.14	G	PhD	s.%-	+1	0	okay to do sort of what he's already what he's trying and get the locations which gives you also the time boundaries of individual state 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact713	1372.28	1372.66	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay to boundaries 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact714	1373.02	1375.27	B	PhD	s	-1	0	do sort of what he's already what he's trying to do of individual state right 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact715	1375.77	1381.98	G	PhD	s^aa|s	+1	0	yeah not a great yeah to do okay i i see yeah i right it's said that there are many techniques for the kinds of cues um that you can use to do that 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact717	1376.49	1377.28	A	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	yeah not a great yeah okay i i see it's said that there are many techniques 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact716	1376.22	1377.43	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah not a great yeah okay i i see it's said that there are many techniques 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact718	1377.28	1377.54	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	great yeah i see techniques 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact719	1378.7	1379.0	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah for the kinds of cues 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact720	1378.76	1379.07	B	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah for the kinds of cues 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact721	1382.06	1382.42	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	see yeah 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact722	1382.81	1390.5	F	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	see yeah they've they've uh is um also going to be it primarily echo cancellation further your field far afield stuff so 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact723	1383.26	1383.55	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	they've they've uh 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact724	1390.58	1391.81	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	stuff so and i guess 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact725	1391.67	1392.8	G	PhD	s^bu^rt	-1	0	and i guess past um this 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact726	1392.98	1394.72	G	PhD	qy	-1	0	past um this is is here two males 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact728	1394.79	1395.08	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	two males we were so 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact727	1394.72	1395.48	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	two males we were so 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact729	1395.71	1396.85	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	we were so it would just be very that's 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact730	1396.85	1397.91	G	PhD	s	+1	1	it would just be very that's really the next step 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact731	1398.26	1404.57	G	PhD	s^df	+1	0	because we can't do too much you know and terms in terms of wrecking assures olds knowing that this is a big problem 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact732	1404.73	1405.37	B	PhD	b	-1	0	problem um until 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact733	1405.44	1407.43	G	PhD	s^e	+1	0	um until we can do that kind of processing 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact734	1408.26	1412.2	G	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah i'm working like and so once we have some some of yours and then 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact735	1409.0	1409.29	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	once we 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact736	1411.38	1412.24	A	PhD	s^bk|s^cc	-1	0	yeah i'm working like some of yours and then 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact737	1412.2	1413.78	G	PhD	s	-1	0	i and then we'll move on 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact738	1413.98	1417.96	B	PhD	s	-1	0	i think this also ties into one of the things that jane is going to talk about too we'll move on 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact739	1414.08	1414.37	D	Grad	fg	-1	0	think this also ties into 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact740	1417.97	1418.39	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	going to talk about too i know someone 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact742	1418.84	1422.89	D	Grad	s	-1	0	i know someone said i have done all this jumping up of digits

Bmr016.C.dialogueact759	1438.06	1441.46	C	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	compiled a list of uh speaker names that's that's it for that speakers in okay 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact758	1437.94	1439.04	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	you've compiled a list of uh great so that's that's it for that 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact761	1441.19	1441.46	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	in okay 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact760	1440.75	1441.66	G	PhD	s^2.%-	-1	0	speaker names speakers in okay 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact762	1441.72	1442.19	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	uhhuh names but in okay 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact763	1442.25	1442.68	C	Grad	s^bsc	-1	0	uhhuh names but 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact764	1442.68	1444.06	C	Grad	s^bsc	-1	0	uhhuh names but i. d.'s yep yeah names names and names to 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact765	1443.16	1443.4	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	i. d.'s yep yeah names 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact766	1443.56	1445.58	D	Grad	s^na	-1	0	i. d.'s yep yeah names names and names to i. d.'s so 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact768	1446.0	1446.3	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay and it does all 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact767	1445.71	1446.05	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	okay i. d.'s so and it does all 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact769	1446.04	1446.43	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	okay and it does all 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact770	1446.63	1447.99	D	Grad	s	-1	0	okay and it does all sorts of matches because 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact771	1447.99	1451.31	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	sorts of matches because the way people feel about names is different on every single file so it does a very 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact772	1451.31	1453.15	D	Grad	s	-1	0	cool so it does a very fuzzy sort of match so at this 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact773	1451.39	1451.69	G	PhD	b	-1	0	so it does a very 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact774	1452.47	1452.81	C	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	cool fuzzy sort of match 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact775	1453.62	1456.78	G	PhD	s	+1	1	yep so at this point we can sort of finalized the naming and so forth and we're 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact778	1456.94	1457.22	C	Grad	b	-1	0	yep and so forth and we're going to basically read

Bmr016.G.dialogueact777	1456.78	1461.25	G	PhD	s	+1	0	yep and so forth and we're going to basically read rewrite out these way forms that we did because as you notice 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact779	1461.25	1464.02	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	did because as you notice in the paper your animal foreign one meaning in m. and another meeting

Bmr016.C.dialogueact811	1502.43	1505.36	C	Grad	qy.%--	-1	0	talk to so the losses compression when you compress so

Bmr016.D.dialogueact847	1543.37	1546.08	D	Grad	fg|qh.%--	-1	0	i didn't know that um so the the only question is how much of that distinction even scratch 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact848	1546.08	1549.5	D	Grad	s	-1	0	right distinction even scratch and on scratches whether it's backed up or not so

Bmr016.D.dialogueact851	1549.96	1552.66	D	Grad	s	-1	0	right okay up or not so what you want to do is use the scratch for stuff you can regenerate 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact852	1552.9	1553.09	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay so 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact853	1553.39	1553.65	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact854	1554.89	1556.81	D	Grad	s	-1	0	stuff that isn't backed up it's not a big deal because 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact855	1556.81	1558.76	D	Grad	s	-1	0	right a big deal because discs don't crash very frequently as long

Bmr016.G.dialogueact871	1571.75	1575.48	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	yeah i guess right be backed up but all the way form sound files should not be backed up the ones that 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact872	1573.66	1574.26	C	Grad	fg|%-	-1	0	yeah i guess sound files should not be backed

Bmr016.G.dialogueact874	1575.65	1576.66	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	right okay up the ones that you're right out 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact875	1576.7	1576.95	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay you're right out 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact876	1577.18	1582.45	C	Grad	qh	-1	0	so i mean i guess they get the question was then she we shorten them down sample them or keep them in their original form um 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact877	1583.07	1583.52	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	it just depends 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact878	1583.48	1584.72	D	Grad	s	-1	0	it just depends on your tools 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact879	1585.39	1591.2	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	right i mean because it's not backed up and it's just on scratch occurs tools can't take shorten format i would leave them expanded so you don't have to 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact880	1589.82	1590.12	C	Grad	b	-1	0	right shorten format i would leave them expanded 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact881	1591.52	1594.16	D	Grad	s	-1	0	okay so you don't have to on shorten them every single time you want to do anything 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact882	1594.49	1594.84	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact883	1595.8	1596.97	G	PhD	s	-1	0	weekend down ensemble um 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact884	1597.25	1598.46	C	Grad	qy	-1	0	do you think that would be okay 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact885	1598.16	1598.57	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	be okay 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact887	1599.47	1600.13	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	on something them yeah yeah we get the same

Bmr016.G.dialogueact888	1600.13	1601.77	G	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	okay yeah we get the same performance 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact889	1602.02	1602.32	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	i mean the the front 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact890	1602.06	1605.83	G	PhD	s^df	+1	0	yeah i guess the only i mean the the front and on after i can they're just down samples and on the flies so 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact891	1605.52	1611.76	C	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	yeah i guess the only argument against that sampling is to just just the original father kids want to experiment with different filtering techniques i i'm sorry and on the flies so yeah if

Bmr016.G.dialogueact893	1607.29	1607.58	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	is to just

Bmr016.F.dialogueact905	1629.62	1630.13	F	Professor	b.%	-1	0	and the reason is that we conceded

Bmr016.G.dialogueact913	1638.96	1639.18	G	PhD	b	-1	0	a bull what i would do is take yeah 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact914	1642.86	1647.12	D	Grad	s^cs^e	-1	0	and compress it however your the answer i recognize or wants to take it in so we can't shortening 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact915	1645.25	1645.66	G	PhD	b	-1	0	the answer i recognize 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact917	1647.47	1647.68	F	Professor	fg.%	-1	0	so we can't shortening

Bmr016.E.dialogueact1100	1909.72	1917.68	E	Postdoc	fg|s	+1	2	all right so first of all um there was uh an interest and be transcribed transcription uh checking procedures and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1101	1917.68	1922.09	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and and i can tell you first uh to go through the steps although you've probably seen 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1102	1922.16	1923.2	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	although you've probably seen them um as 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1103	1923.57	1932.28	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	them um as you might imagine when you're dealing with um really a fair number of words and uh natural speech which means 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1104	1932.28	1940.35	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	which means suffer pairs and all these other factors that there are lots of things to be um standardized and streamlined and checked on and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1105	1940.96	1943.06	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	on and um so i 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1106	1943.91	1946.79	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i did a bunch of checks and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1107	1946.79	1949.58	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	checks and the first thing i did was obviously a spell check and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1108	1949.87	1952.27	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	check and at that point i discovered certain things like 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1109	1952.27	1954.89	E	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	like um accommodate with one down that 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1110	1954.89	1955.5	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	with one down that kind of thing 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1111	1956.09	1960.66	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and then in addition to that i didn't exhaustive listing of the forms in the data file which included 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1112	1960.66	1964.71	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	i'm i'm sorry data file which included detecting things like faulty punctuation things yeah

Bmr016.E.dialogueact1126	1980.24	1980.65	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	sandies exactly i do these 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1127	1980.73	1981.39	E	Postdoc	s^2^na	-1	0	sandies quality checks exactly i do these checks uhhuh 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact1129	1982.28	1982.64	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay okay exactly 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1128	1981.94	1982.24	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	quality checks okay okay checks uhhuh exactly 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact1131	1982.78	1983.05	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay okay exactly 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1130	1982.38	1982.81	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	okay okay exactly 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1132	1984.11	1984.24	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	thank you 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1133	1984.33	1984.66	E	Postdoc	s^ft	-1	0	thank you 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1134	1985.24	1988.38	E	Postdoc	s^rt.%--	-1	0	and so uh do it as an exhaustive listing of the actually will go 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1135	1988.53	1989.93	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	the actually will go through this in in order so 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1136	1989.93	1992.96	E	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	through this in in order so if if we could maybe wait and stick keep that for second because 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1137	1992.96	1993.91	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	so on keep that for second because they're not ready for that 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1138	1993.84	1995.66	D	Grad	s^j.%--	-1	0	so on the fifth age seven that they're not ready for that yeah exactly 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1139	1995.07	1996.86	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	seven that yeah exactly exactly 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1140	1998.22	2000.39	E	Postdoc	fg|s	-1	0	all right so uh spelling check first then an exhaustive 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1141	2000.39	2004.89	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	first then an exhaustive listing of the uh all the forms the day that with the punctuation attached and at 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1142	2004.89	2009.03	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	attached and at that point i pick up things like oh you know a word fella by two commas and and then 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1143	2009.03	2015.01	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and and then uh going to check involves uh being sure that every other and hasn't done a viable speaker and if 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1144	2015.55	2017.19	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and if not then i gets checked then there's 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1145	2017.61	2021.15	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	then there's this issue of gloss things so called spoken form so they're most 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1146	2021.15	2021.51	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	so they're most 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1147	2022.04	2026.27	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	for the most part we're keeping it standard we're we're level transcription that there's 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1148	2026.52	2026.97	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	that there's 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1149	2027.36	2031.29	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	what and that that's done would do some shown that pronunciation parents can be handled so for things like 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1150	2031.29	2037.34	E	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	so for things like and the fact that someone doesn't say the d. uh that's not important enough to capture the transcription because it's 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1151	2037.34	2042.05	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because it's a good pronunciation uh you know model would be able to handle that however things like cause 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1152	2042.05	2046.39	E	Postdoc	s:s	+1	0	however things like cause where you're lacking entire very prone it for so little and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1153	2046.88	2050.08	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	little and for the more it's a form that specific just spoken language those are the reasons 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1154	2050.5	2053.91	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	those are the reasons for for those reasons like i can't that's separate and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1155	2053.91	2056.91	E	Postdoc	s:s	+1	0	that's separate and use the convention abusing c. u. z. for that form 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1156	2057.42	2058.5	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	however glossing it so that it's possible 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1157	2058.5	2062.35	E	Postdoc	s^df	+1	1	it so that it's possible with a script to plug in the fall or the graphic form for that one and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1158	2062.78	2063.78	E	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	that one and a couple of others not many 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1159	2063.78	2064.26	E	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	a couple of others not many so one is another 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1160	2064.26	2065.51	E	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	so one is another one going 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1161	2065.51	2067.25	E	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	one going that go a is another one with just 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1162	2067.71	2074.36	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	one with just the assumption again that this the easy things which is not really fair that consider expected of pronunciation mall to handle and checking 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1163	2074.89	2080.06	E	Postdoc	s^bu|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	and checking that you indicated that causes is one of those it's handled in a different way also did she did i 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1164	2080.06	2080.35	E	Postdoc	qy.%--	-1	0	did i 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact1165	2081.16	2081.81	B	PhD	s^no	-1	0	i don't remember okay 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1166	2081.99	2082.31	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	i don't remember okay so so i 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1167	2082.39	2084.66	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so so i might have been my husband you but someone 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact1168	2084.62	2085.27	B	PhD	b	-1	0	my husband you but someone told me that in fact 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1169	2084.66	2090.34	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	my husband you but someone told me that in fact cousins treated differently and um it in this context because of that 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1170	2090.34	2094.4	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because of that reason that uh it's a little bit farther than the pronunciation variant 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1171	2095.14	2096.15	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	okay so after that let's see 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1172	2096.15	2096.65	E	Postdoc	s^t1	-1	0	let's see 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact1174	2097.91	2100.64	B	PhD	qr	-1	0	so that was part of the spell checker that that was after the stuff um well 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1173	2097.42	2097.74	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	so that um 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1175	2100.8	2102.22	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	the stuff well so when i get the exhaust so the spell check 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1176	2102.3	2104.46	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so the spell check picks up those words because they're not 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1177	2104.46	2105.72	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	words because they're not in the dictionary gets 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact1178	2105.69	2106.02	B	PhD	b	-1	0	in the dictionary gets cousin one and that 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1179	2105.72	2107.13	E	Postdoc	s.%-:s.%-	-1	0	and then you go awesome in the dictionary gets cousin one and that 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1180	2107.43	2108.18	D	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	and then you go awesome yeah i'm 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1181	2108.76	2109.1	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yeah i'm brunch out i said you 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1182	2109.1	2109.51	E	Postdoc	s^na.%--	-1	0	brunch out i said you 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1183	2109.51	2117.83	E	Postdoc	s^df:s	-1	0	brunch out i said you know so like decide script saying whenever you see going to yeah converted to going to you know glossy equals quote going to quote 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1184	2118.56	2118.7	E	Postdoc	s^f	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1185	2119.35	2121.57	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and with all these things being in curly brackets there was just 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1187	2121.66	2121.88	D	Grad	b	-1	0	brackets there was just 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1186	2121.57	2122.4	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	brackets there was just thinking okay i 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1188	2122.79	2131.58	E	Postdoc	fg|s	-1	0	thinking okay i also wrote a script which will um retrieve anything in curly brackets or anything which i've classifies an acronym 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1189	2132.2	2133.82	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and pronounced acronym 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1190	2134.12	2139.54	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and the way tech act pronounced acronym is that i have underscores between they compliment so if it's 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1191	2139.54	2143.67	E	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	so if it's a. c. l. and it's a underscore see underscore l. 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1193	2144.31	2147.88	D	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	and so so your list here are these ones that actually occurred in the meetings and it's yes 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1192	2144.28	2144.73	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	and so so your and it's 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1194	2147.84	2148.53	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	in the meetings yes uhhuh yeah 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1195	2148.39	2148.75	D	Grad	s^ba^fe	-1	0	uhhuh yeah 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1196	2149.07	2150.64	E	Postdoc	fg|%-	-1	0	we are acronym okay so now uh and um 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1197	2150.39	2151.84	D	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	we are acronym loaded and um test the question about 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1198	2150.83	2154.5	G	PhD	qy	-1	0	we are acronym loaded and yeah um test the question about uh glossing uh before god so 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1199	2153.84	2153.98	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yeah uh before 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1200	2154.5	2160.67	G	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	god so for a word like because is it that it's always predictably because 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1201	2161.2	2164.63	G	PhD	qy^e^rt	-1	0	yes but not i mean it's c. u. z. always meaning because 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1202	2164.67	2165.65	E	Postdoc	s^aa|s^nd	-1	0	yes but not the reverse so sometimes 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1203	2165.71	2167.81	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	the reverse so sometimes people will say because in the meeting and if 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1204	2167.81	2172.13	E	Postdoc	s^df.%--:s	-1	0	in the meeting and if if they actually said because then it's written is because with no cause doesn't even 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1205	2172.38	2173.97	E	Postdoc	s^df:s	-1	0	cause doesn't even figure into the equation 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact1207	2174.72	2177.55	F	Professor	s^j:qw	-1	0	but but our meetings people don't say hey because id on because because right 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1206	2174.64	2175.58	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	but but our meetings people because because 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1208	2177.12	2178.54	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	except separate there yeah id on right right 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1209	2178.44	2179.14	D	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	except separate there yeah yeah right um 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1210	2178.77	2178.99	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	except separate there yeah right 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact1211	2179.43	2179.72	F	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah um 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1212	2179.74	2183.69	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah um i guess so from the point of view of 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1213	2183.51	2184.07	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	of view of 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1214	2185.06	2190.51	G	PhD	s:s	-1	0	well the the only problem is that with for the recognition we we map it to be cause and so if we know 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1216	2190.74	2190.89	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	well cause and so if we know 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1215	2190.51	2191.9	G	PhD	s.%-:s	-1	0	well but that's funny well done has cause and so if we know that's easy 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1217	2191.1	2191.43	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	but that's funny well done has that's easy 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1219	2191.95	2192.79	D	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah but they have the gloss that's funny well done has a script that's easy but 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1218	2191.5	2192.51	E	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	yeah but they have the gloss that's funny well done has a script that's easy but

Bmr016.G.dialogueact1237	2207.35	2207.82	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	right because 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1238	2208.55	2210.78	E	Postdoc	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	yes and that's why they're different tags on like losses okay 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1239	2210.64	2212.01	G	PhD	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	on like losses on the different on the different types of comments which okay so then it's fine 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1240	2211.31	2212.85	E	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	on the different on the different types of comments which so then it's fine 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1241	2212.86	2214.56	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	types of comments which which will see and just a second 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact1242	2213.92	2214.18	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	which will see and just a second 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1243	2213.99	2214.47	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	which will see and just a second 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1244	2215.38	2217.48	E	Postdoc	s^rt	-1	0	so the pronounce black fans get underscores these 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1245	2217.84	2220.28	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	these things in curly brackets are viewed as comments or comments four 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1246	2220.28	2221.39	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	or comments four types is good to introduce 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1247	2221.39	2222.46	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	types is good to introduce that four times 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1248	2222.63	2223.14	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that four times and maybe 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1249	2223.14	2224.92	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and maybe we'll expand that but 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1250	2223.96	2224.19	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	and maybe we'll expand that but 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1251	2224.92	2228.91	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	we'll expand that but they but the comments or um four types mainly right now one 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1252	2228.91	2232.78	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	mainly right now one of them is um the gloss type we just mentioned 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1253	2231.35	2231.75	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	the gloss type 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1254	2233.4	2235.24	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	so are another type is um 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1255	2235.66	2236.91	D	Grad	fg|qy	-1	0	so are we done with acronym 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1256	2236.91	2238.9	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	we done with acronym a question on what what this meant i'm still doing 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1257	2238.51	2239.47	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	what this meant i'm i'm still doing the overview haven't actually gotten 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1258	2239.47	2240.58	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i'm sorry the overview haven't actually gotten here yet 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1259	2239.97	2240.39	D	Grad	s^fa	-1	0	i'm sorry the overview haven't actually gotten here yet 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1260	2242.45	2250.07	E	Postdoc	fg|s	-1	0	okay so losses things like replacing the full form with the um more reviewed once the left and then you have 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1261	2250.57	2256.96	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and then you have it it's uh there's a couple different types of elements that can happen that aren't really properly words 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1262	2257.09	2259.72	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and what some of them are laughing breeze so we have 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1263	2259.72	2263.05	E	Postdoc	s^rt:s^rt	-1	0	breeze so we have that that's pretended with of uh tag a v. o. c. and the non vocal 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact1264	2262.4	2262.98	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	tag a v. o. c. 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact1265	2263.25	2264.58	A	PhD	%	-1	0	and the non vocal and so i like 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1266	2263.35	2266.33	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and the non vocal and so i like door slams and typing and that's prepared with 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1267	2266.33	2269.29	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so then it just the ending hurley brace theirs and that's prepared with uh not non vocal station 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact1268	2267.98	2269.91	B	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	so then it just the ending hurley brace theirs uh not non vocal station 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact1269	2269.91	2270.8	B	PhD	qrr	-1	0	hurley brace theirs or something else and oh yeah 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1270	2270.61	2272.22	E	Postdoc	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	or something else and the comet oh yeah so you yeah this would let's just take 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1272	2272.67	2273.74	D	Grad	s	-1	0	oh oh the comet basically let's just take one example 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1271	2272.66	2273.94	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	oh oh the comet basically let's just take one example 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact1273	2273.54	2274.28	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh oh oh basically one example and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1274	2275.0	2278.21	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	then the not non local station would be something like a door slam 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1275	2279.16	2279.77	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	they always and so it's 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1276	2279.77	2282.0	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	they always and so it's like they're paired curly brackets and then the third 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1277	2282.43	2289.09	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and then the third type right now uh is things that fall in the category of comments about what's happening so it could be something 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1278	2289.09	2292.16	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so it could be something like you know referring to so-and-so talking about 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1279	2292.16	2293.89	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	talking about such and such 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1280	2294.34	2296.49	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so on them on the middle uh you know looking at so and so yeah 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact1281	2295.24	2295.86	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	so on them looking at so 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1283	2296.55	2296.75	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	on the middle and so yeah 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact1282	2296.55	2300.43	B	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	on the middle to so in the first case that gloss applies to the word to the left but in the and so yeah yeah and this gets 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact1285	2300.75	2304.0	B	PhD	s^bu^e|qy^d^g	-1	0	but in the middle to that's not applying anything right okay they're impulsive yeah and this gets up to here uhuh no they're events 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1284	2300.42	2301.75	E	Postdoc	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	but in the middle to yeah and this gets up to here 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1286	2302.52	2303.69	D	Grad	s	-1	0	that's not applying anything right they're impulsive uhuh 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact1288	2304.27	2304.62	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay no they're events 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1287	2303.96	2304.15	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	anything right okay impulsive uhuh no they're events 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1289	2304.34	2305.12	E	Postdoc	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	okay okay well the call no they're events they're actually 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact1291	2305.4	2305.61	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay well the call they're actually 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1292	2305.5	2308.47	D	Grad	s	-1	0	okay well the call can be the qualities applied to the last they're actually had the status of 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1290	2305.22	2307.29	E	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	okay well the call can be the qualities applied to the they're actually had the status of 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact1293	2309.37	2310.6	B	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	right i just meant the middle two one two yep 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact1295	2310.6	2310.74	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	two one two yep 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1294	2310.33	2310.58	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	two one two yep 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1296	2311.2	2316.49	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	well and actually um it is true that with respect to laugh there's another one which 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1297	2316.86	2318.8	E	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	while laughing one which is why laughing and 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1298	2317.78	2318.69	D	Grad	s^2	-1	0	while laughing is why laughing and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1299	2318.92	2325.21	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	laughing laughing and that is uh it big an argument could be made for this turn turning that into a qualitative statement because it's talking 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1300	2325.21	2327.49	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because it's talking about the thing that preceded it but 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1301	2327.49	2333.49	E	Postdoc	s|s^f	-1	0	it but at present we haven't been um uh coding of the exact scope of laughing you know and so 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1302	2333.79	2336.52	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know and so to have well laughing you know that it happened somewhere in there which 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1303	2336.81	2340.31	E	Postdoc	s^rt	-1	0	in there which could well mean that it occurred separately and following or you know 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1304	2340.45	2342.86	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	or you know including some of the better insists the last 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1305	2343.15	2344.6	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	haven't been awfully precise about that but i have here 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1306	2344.6	2345.22	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	about that but i have here now we're about to 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1307	2345.53	2346.92	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	now we're about to get to this to this now 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1308	2347.25	2348.18	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	i have frequencies so you'll see how 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1309	2348.18	2350.29	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	so you'll see how often these different things occur but 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1310	2350.98	2357.59	E	Postdoc	fh|s	+1	0	but um uh the very front page deals with this uh final pay uh aspect of standardization which has to do 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1311	2357.59	2364.7	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	which has to do with spoken forms like uhhuh and huh and huh and uh all these different types 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1312	2365.11	2367.94	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and um uh someone pointed out to me 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1313	2368.56	2380.39	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	this might been talk about um about how recognize your if it's looking for uhhuh with three m.'s and it's transcribed was two am that it might have it might increase the error rate which is which 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1314	2380.39	2381.8	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	rate which is which would really be a shame because 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1315	2381.8	2388.12	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	would really be a shame because uh i i personally would not be able to make a claim that those are dramatically different items so right 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1316	2388.66	2393.09	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	it so smallest so right now i've standardized across all existing data with these spoken forms i i should say 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1317	2393.03	2393.45	D	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	it so smallest i i should say 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1318	2393.19	2393.94	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	it so smallest i i should say 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1319	2393.8	2394.69	D	Grad	s	-1	0	it so smallest i i should say all existing 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1320	2394.53	2397.12	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	all existing data except thirty minutes which got found today so 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1321	2397.31	2399.36	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	that that's in the sound dated so i got a check 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1322	2398.4	2399.6	D	Grad	s^bu^j^rt	-1	0	that that's in the sound dated i got a check 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1323	2399.95	2400.48	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	dated check 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1324	2400.48	2401.65	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	actually i guess it 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1325	2401.65	2403.67	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	because was a prude or film actually i guess it was in a place i didn't expect 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact1326	2402.31	2403.63	C	Grad	s^j	-1	0	because was a prude or film was in a place i didn't expect 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1327	2404.14	2405.16	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	so and and um we we 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1328	2405.47	2408.73	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yeah it's we we uh she yeah reconstructed have that happened and work with lost data 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact1329	2407.06	2408.19	F	Professor	s^j	-1	0	yeah it's reconstructed have that happened and work with lost data 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1330	2408.24	2409.86	D	Grad	s^aa|s^ba	-1	0	yeah it's much easier have that happened 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1331	2410.63	2411.99	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and this is this would be great so 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1332	2411.99	2413.58	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	is this would be great so i'll be able to get through that tonight and then every 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1333	2413.58	2415.68	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	tonight and then every it will actually later today going 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1334	2414.73	2415.04	D	Grad	b	-1	0	it will actually later today going 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1335	2416.08	2417.81	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and so they'll have everything follies commission but not 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1336	2417.81	2421.2	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	follies commission but not it's really rather small set of these kinds of things and i

Bmr016.E.dialogueact1338	2421.62	2427.5	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and i made it so that these are um with a couple exceptions but things that you wouldn't find in the spell checker so that they'll show 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1339	2427.5	2429.06	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	checker so that they'll show up really easily and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1340	2429.81	2430.46	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and um

Bmr016.E.dialogueact1675	2810.15	2811.69	E	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	was that somewhere where i i'm not exactly sure about that

Bmr016.E.dialogueact1679	2817.34	2818.19	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and maybe i i can't explain 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1680	2818.25	2819.22	E	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	that's right i i can't explain it

Bmr016.G.dialogueact1787	2944.03	2947.12	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	so how would that be a problem for doing the language there's actually a bunch of cases like this with people's names and 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact1788	2945.65	2949.63	B	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	so how would that be a problem for doing the language modeling than with our transcripts here like this with people's names and yes 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1789	2949.79	2950.41	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	here yes yeah 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1790	2950.51	2950.78	G	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1791	2951.43	2962.47	G	PhD	s	-1	0	yes is there there's a few cases like that where the the word needs to be spelled out in in a consistent way as it would appear in the language but there's not very 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1792	2962.47	2963.9	G	PhD	s	-1	0	language but there's not very many of these tickles 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1793	2963.9	2964.95	G	PhD	s	-1	0	many of these tickles one of them 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1794	2965.2	2967.03	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and and you know you'll have to think earnestly right see yeah

Bmr016.G.dialogueact1796	2966.81	2968.3	G	PhD	b	-1	0	to think earnestly right see so whoever's yeah 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1797	2967.47	2974.9	D	Grad	s^f|s	-1	0	disturbing right see so whoever's creating the new models will have to also go through the transfers and change them thinking it's like yeah right 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact1798	2971.39	2972.28	C	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	disturbing models will have to also go through the transfers 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1799	2973.59	2974.07	G	PhD	b	-1	0	and change them thinking it's like right 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact1802	2975.97	2976.25	B	PhD	b	-1	0	right we have this there is this 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1800	2975.51	2975.89	G	PhD	b	-1	0	right we 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1801	2975.89	2984.47	G	PhD	qh	+1	0	right we have this there is this thing i was going to talk to at some point about you know what do we do with the dictionary as rep updating the dictionary these changes have 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1803	2984.47	2989.41	G	PhD	s	-1	0	these changes have to be consistent with what's in the like spelling people's names and so forth if 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1804	2989.94	2992.92	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	if we make a spelling correction to their name like 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1805	2992.91	2995.02	G	PhD	s	-1	0	name like someone had debra cannons name and since you know what that is 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1806	2995.01	2997.25	G	PhD	s	-1	0	you can correct it since you know what that is you know we could correct it but 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1807	2996.58	2997.3	D	Grad	s^2	-1	0	you can correct it you know we could correct it but 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1809	2997.42	2997.61	D	Grad	b	-1	0	it it but 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1808	2997.24	2997.5	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	it it but 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1810	2998.28	3000.49	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	that we need to make sure we have the misspell if it doesn't 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1811	3000.49	3004.26	G	PhD	s	-1	0	misspell if it doesn't get correct we have to other pronunciation as a misspelled word in the dictionary things like that 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1813	3004.65	3004.97	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	things like that 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1812	3004.39	3004.91	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	things like that 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1814	3005.67	3006.81	D	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	it's so funny well of course now that 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1815	3006.16	3008.96	E	Postdoc	s^rt.%--	-1	0	funny well of course now that the ten correct the spelling check 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1816	3006.52	3006.83	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	funny well of course now that 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1817	3009.09	3011.85	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i that's what gets like pick those up and the frequency check 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1818	3012.25	3012.84	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	right right so 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1819	3012.84	3016.56	G	PhD	s	-1	0	right right so if there's things that get corrected before we get them it's it's not an issue if there's 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1821	3016.8	3017.07	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	an issue if there's things that 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1820	3016.56	3024.19	G	PhD	s	+1	1	an issue if there's things that um we changed later then we always have to keep are the dictionary up to date and then yeah 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact1822	3024.57	3029.16	G	PhD	s.%--:s	-1	0	that and then yeah in the case of tickle i guess we would just have a word p. c. l. which which

Bmr016.E.dialogueact1911	3133.54	3134.31	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so qualify yeah 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1912	3136.31	3138.46	D	Grad	s^rt.%--	+1	0	on the gloss is for numbers 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1913	3139.21	3139.39	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	it yeah 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1914	3139.91	3143.38	D	Grad	s	+1	0	it seems like there are lots of different ways it's being done there's uh yeah okay interesting question yes 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1915	3140.5	3140.72	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	seems like there okay 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1916	3141.07	3141.78	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	are lots of different interesting question 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1917	3143.7	3144.09	D	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	done there's uh yes okay now first of all 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1918	3143.71	3144.02	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	done there's uh yes okay now first of all 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1919	3144.02	3145.1	E	Postdoc	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	okay now first of all cool very important 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1920	3145.1	3145.48	E	Postdoc	s^fe	-1	0	cool very important 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1921	3145.55	3146.15	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	cool very important uh check check 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1922	3146.06	3146.28	D	Grad	s^m	-1	0	uh check check 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1923	3146.21	3148.71	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	uh check check led to uh refinement here which is 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1924	3148.71	3152.04	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	here which is to add numbs fifties or parts of the red number so you already know that 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1925	3152.04	3159.04	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so you already know that i had um places where they had transcribe numbers put numbers in place of any kind of numbers but there are places where they 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1926	3159.04	3160.26	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	but there are places where they um 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1927	3160.77	3163.25	E	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	um it did this convention came later and and it the very 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1928	3163.25	3167.39	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and and it the very first digit asking some transcripts actually transcribed numbers and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1929	3167.95	3168.62	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1930	3169.05	3169.17	E	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	check point out that 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1931	3169.42	3171.06	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	check point out that this is read speech and it's nice to have 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1932	3171.12	3176.12	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and it's nice to have the option of ignoring it for certain other pop up uh things and that's why there's this 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1933	3176.12	3180.62	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and that's why there's this other tag here which occurs a hundred and five or ten and five times right now which is just 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1934	3180.62	3183.34	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	mom's yeah times right now which is just well and numbs by itself which means 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1935	3181.7	3181.99	D	Grad	s^2	+1	0	mom's well and 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1936	3181.99	3182.2	D	Grad	b	-1	0	mom's yeah well and numbs by itself 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1937	3183.62	3184.92	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	which means is for the numbers test i 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1938	3184.92	3186.0	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	is for the numbers test i may change it to digits i mean it was i said command 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1939	3186.0	3188.76	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	mean it was i said command you can really just change it however you want because 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1940	3188.95	3190.7	E	Postdoc	s^df|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	yep however you want because it systematically and coated you know have to 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1941	3190.45	3190.72	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yep coated you know have to 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1942	3190.83	3194.15	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yep coated you know have to think about what's the best for is for the overall purposes but in any case 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1943	3194.15	3199.23	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but in any case um numbers in um is are part of this digits testing um 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1944	3199.79	3203.71	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	um now that then i have these numbers that have quotation marks around him 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1945	3204.37	3206.5	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	um i didn't want to put them as gloss comments because 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1946	3206.5	3208.37	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	comments because then you could substitute shannon actually 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1947	3208.37	3214.14	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	shannon actually um the reason i did this was because i usually start out with the other persian you have the numbers and you have 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1948	3214.14	3216.07	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you have the numbers and you have the full form an apprentice however sometimes people 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1949	3216.13	3218.82	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	however sometimes people stumble over these numbers are saying see 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1950	3218.82	3222.44	E	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	numbers are saying see six seven seventy eight point two or whatever and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1951	3222.92	3225.85	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	whatever and there's no way of capturing that if you're putting the numbers off to the side you can't 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1952	3225.85	3227.37	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	so what's the last disease off to the side you can't have the seven and 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1953	3226.52	3227.88	D	Grad	qw	-1	0	so what's the last disease have the seven and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1954	3228.3	3229.35	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	the left is in so example the 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1955	3229.35	3230.72	E	Postdoc	s^rt.%--	-1	0	in so example the very first one 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1957	3231.11	3231.36	D	Grad	b	-1	0	it would be spelled 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1956	3231.07	3235.42	E	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	okay that's i was asking right it would be spelled out in words point five 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1958	3233.35	3234.23	D	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	okay that's i was asking point five 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1959	3235.61	3235.83	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1960	3237.39	3238.47	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	point only it's spelling words so 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1962	3238.9	3240.06	D	Grad	s:s|s^bk	-1	0	point f. i. p. yeah words so this is also spelled out and antlers 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1961	3238.78	3240.71	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	point f. i. p. yeah words so this is also spelled out and antlers

Bmr016.E.dialogueact1965	3243.16	3244.94	E	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	and then in here now i'm so 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1966	3244.94	3246.86	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	now i'm so it's not going to be mistaken as a gloss 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact1967	3248.12	3251.44	E	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	okay now the it comes out as numbs quote dot five 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact1968	3251.63	3254.71	D	Grad	fg|s.%--	-1	0	okay now the other day ample is in the gloss as right there five

Bmr016.E.dialogueact2017	3331.74	3339.38	E	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	you know they so in the data column five has you know one point five compared to seventy nine point six is like 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2018	3339.38	3342.42	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	six is like when you see the words it's really hard to follow the argument and this 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2019	3342.79	3349.61	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	label it and this is just really a a way of someone who would handle it the data in a more discourse he way to be able to follow it stings sets this is i see 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact2021	3348.45	3348.89	D	Grad	s^2	-1	0	label it be able to follow it 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2020	3348.0	3348.58	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	label it be able to follow it 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2023	3349.61	3353.63	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	stings sets this is word checks um overall architecture comes and where i see 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2022	3349.29	3349.75	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	stings sets this is i see 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2024	3353.63	3357.29	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	comes and where we're going to have a master file of the channel i stayed at um 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2025	3357.7	3362.22	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	at um there will be scripts that are written two converted into these these main to use is and it some 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2026	3362.52	3368.38	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	is and it some scripts will take it down to into a uh for take take it to a format this useful for the recognize or on 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2027	3368.86	3374.12	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	or on other ships will take it to a form is useful for the for linguistics and and discourse analysis and um 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2028	3374.5	3379.43	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and um thee in patient that i have is that that the master copy will stand change these will just be 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2029	3379.43	3381.38	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	right change these will just be things that are generated and 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact2030	3380.17	3380.38	D	Grad	b	-1	0	right things that are generated 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2031	3381.61	3381.92	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2033	3382.2	3383.11	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	master copies of super by using scripts when things change 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2032	3382.18	3382.62	G	PhD	b	-1	0	by using scripts 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact2034	3382.99	3384.56	D	Grad	s	-1	0	master copies of super set by using scripts when things change then there's this cripple change 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2035	3383.16	3385.64	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	master copies of super set when things change then there's this cripple change change but be 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2036	3385.64	3388.78	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	change but be but they won't be stored copies of and different versions of things 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact2037	3389.18	3389.29	D	Grad	b	-1	0	so i guess 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2038	3389.61	3391.36	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so i guess i have one request here which is just 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2039	3391.36	3394.12	G	PhD	s	-1	0	here which is just um maybe to make it more robust 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2040	3394.44	3403.18	G	PhD	s	-1	0	that would argue for changing that uh tag whatever you would choose for this type of where the inside the spontaneous speech is different than the tag that use for the red speech um 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2041	3401.44	3401.78	B	PhD	b	-1	0	than the tag that use 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2042	3402.44	3405.68	B	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	that would argue for changing the other ones to be digits or something for the red speech um that way we if we make a distinct 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2043	3403.83	3408.45	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	that would argue for changing the other ones to be digits or something um that way we if we make a distinct parts thing or something we don't see the point five or or it's not 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2044	3408.45	3409.77	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	five or or it's not there then we 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2045	3409.79	3410.31	B	PhD	b	-1	0	there then we it just 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2046	3410.4	3414.44	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	it just and and actually for things like seven eight serve people do fractions 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2047	3414.44	3416.05	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	serve people do fractions too i guess you maybe want 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2048	3416.36	3420.97	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	except you maybe want one overall tag for sort of that would be similar to that or 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2049	3419.77	3420.11	E	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	except that would be similar to that or 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2050	3420.97	3421.14	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	similar to that or as long as they're 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2051	3421.49	3427.38	G	PhD	s	-1	0	as long as they're stuck as they're different strings that we that'll make earp sort of processing more robust because we really 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2052	3423.91	3424.11	E	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	strings that we that'll make 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2053	3427.38	3431.45	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	i suppose oh because we really will get rid of everything that has been um string in it 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2054	3431.68	3436.76	B	PhD	s:s	-1	0	i suppose what you could do is just make sure that you get rid of everything that has curly brace numbs curly brace oh ex in it 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2055	3431.8	3431.93	E	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	i suppose oh in it 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2056	3436.6	3437.71	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	curly brace ex exactly exactly 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2058	3438.12	3439.06	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	i mean that would be uh that was that was my motivation 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2057	3438.01	3438.49	E	Postdoc	s^aa^r	-1	0	i mean that would be uh that was 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2059	3438.8	3440.1	E	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	i mean that would be uh that was that was my motivation and it these yeah 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2061	3440.47	3442.17	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and it these can be changed like i said you know i mean as i said yeah 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2060	3440.25	3440.93	G	PhD	b	-1	0	and it these yeah 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2062	3442.17	3444.5	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know i mean as i said i was considering changing it to just and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2063	3444.97	3449.42	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	to just and it just you know it's just a matter of deciding on whatever it is they for the script so 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2064	3449.67	3450.16	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so it'll probably be safer 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2065	3450.27	3453.07	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	it'll probably be safer if you're willing to have a separate tag just because 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2066	3453.07	3455.72	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	just because um then we know for sure and we can 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2067	3455.72	3458.67	G	PhD	s^df^e	-1	0	know for sure and we can also do count on them without having to do the processing but you're right 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2068	3458.67	3459.09	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	the processing but you're right we could do it this way 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2069	3459.09	3460.08	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	we could do it this way it it should 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2070	3460.08	3461.44	G	PhD	s^ba^e	-1	0	it it should work um 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2071	3461.51	3461.89	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	work um 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2072	3462.12	3464.03	B	PhD	fg|s.%-	-1	0	yeah it makes it i guess the thing about but it it's probably not hard for a person to tell 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2073	3462.63	3465.7	G	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah it makes it i guess the thing about but it it's probably not hard for a person to tell the difference because 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2075	3465.73	3465.97	B	PhD	b	-1	0	the difference because 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2074	3465.7	3470.02	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	things you can get really the difference because one's in the context of uh you know it transcribed word string 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2076	3469.18	3469.42	B	PhD	b	-1	0	things word string 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2077	3469.62	3472.68	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	things you can get really so my new with these things and increase word string 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2078	3470.02	3470.15	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	you can get really 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2079	3471.01	3471.59	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	so my new with 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2080	3472.68	3479.08	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	these things and increase the size of files and degrees and decrease every abilities such an extent by simply something like percent not i i could have a 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2081	3479.26	3481.48	E	Postdoc	s^ba^bd	-1	0	not i i could have a doctor's doctor summer a person but somehow 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2082	3481.48	3483.96	E	Postdoc	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	but somehow percent it's not so hard you know 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact2083	3483.71	3483.98	D	Grad	b	-1	0	so hard you know 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2084	3483.96	3487.46	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so hard you know it's just when you have these points and you're trying to fear with a decimal definitely something like i was 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2085	3487.52	3488.48	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	definitely something like i was at a later percent easy 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2086	3488.48	3489.6	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	at a later percent easy to detect point however 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2087	3489.6	3493.31	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	to detect point however is is uh uh we're that has couple different meanings and you'll find both 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2088	3493.31	3495.39	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and you'll find both of those in one of these meetings cursing 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2089	3495.76	3497.67	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	meetings cursing the first point i want to make is so and so and goes 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2090	3497.67	3498.74	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	is so and so and goes through four points and also 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2091	3498.74	3499.78	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so through four points and also has always decimals 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2092	3500.06	3502.22	B	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	is what this the recognize or do uh 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2093	3500.65	3500.9	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	is what this

Bmr016.B.dialogueact2097	3506.54	3507.29	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	like that seven point five does it up with the word seven point 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2098	3507.29	3508.17	B	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	five does it up with the word right the well seven point five

Bmr016.F.dialogueact2108	3513.07	3515.36	F	Professor	s	-1	0	so i'd like i'd like to talk about twenty five yeah and and actually you know the language it's the same point 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2109	3513.11	3514.44	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so i'd like i'd like to talk about twenty five and and actually you know the language 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact2111	3515.52	3515.77	F	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah it's the same point 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2110	3515.09	3516.38	G	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah it's the same point actually the the 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2112	3516.38	3521.67	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	actually the the you know the words too and the word it that going too and to go to those are two 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2113	3521.67	3522.95	G	PhD	s:s	-1	0	go to those are two different to send 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2114	3522.95	3525.33	G	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	different to send so there's no distinction there 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2115	3523.47	3523.89	B	PhD	b	-1	0	so there's 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2116	3525.88	3528.42	G	PhD	s.%--:s.%--	-1	0	there just a word point yeah every 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2117	3528.64	3533.18	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah every word has only one one version even if 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2118	3533.18	3535.54	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	even if even if it's 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2119	3537.24	3539.2	G	PhD	s:s	-1	0	uh actually even like the word read and read those are two different words 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2120	3539.26	3540.2	G	PhD	s	-1	0	those are two different words are spelled the same way 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2121	3540.2	3541.4	G	PhD	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	are spelled the same way right and they're still going to 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2122	3541.34	3541.72	B	PhD	b	-1	0	right and they're still going to 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2123	3541.4	3543.69	G	PhD	s:s	-1	0	right and they're still going to be transcribed is e. d. 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2125	3544.22	3544.62	B	PhD	b	-1	0	so 
Bmr016.F.dialogueact2124	3544.11	3544.31	F	Professor	b	-1	0	so 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2126	3544.93	3545.2	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	so yeah i i like 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2127	3545.37	3547.42	G	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	yeah i i like the idea of having this in there i just i 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2128	3547.42	3552.56	G	PhD	s	-1	0	in there i just i was a little bit worried that um the tag for removing the red speech because it what 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2129	3552.56	3555.37	G	PhD	qh^df	-1	0	we speech because it what if we have like red letters or i don't know 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2130	3555.37	3556.24	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	we might want to just separate or i don't know like read something 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact2131	3555.91	3558.56	D	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	we might want to just separate tag that says it's red or i don't know like read something like red yeah 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2132	3556.31	3557.4	G	PhD	s	-1	0	might want to just separate tag that says like read something like 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2133	3557.65	3558.77	G	PhD	s^2	-1	0	tag that says it's red like red yeah 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2135	3558.95	3559.31	C	Grad	b	-1	0	it's red red yeah basically 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2134	3558.77	3560.16	G	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	it's red red yeah basically but 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2136	3561.04	3562.53	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	other than that sounds great 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact2137	3562.3	3562.49	D	Grad	b	-1	0	great

Bmr016.E.dialogueact2147	3589.99	3591.25	E	Postdoc	s^e^rt	-1	0	we did that for held for that one is for the longer outer insists and 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact2148	3591.6	3592.91	D	Grad	s^bu|qy^d^g	-1	0	we did that for one meeting right so and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2149	3591.62	3591.92	E	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	we did that for and 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact2150	3592.91	3594.03	D	Grad	s^bu|qy^d^g	+1	0	yeah that's trying to one meeting right so you have that data done yeah 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact2151	3594.2	3595.13	A	PhD	s^aa|s^na	+1	0	yeah that's trying to 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2152	3596.2	3603.78	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and he requested that there be uh somewhere uh samples done for five minutes stretches involving a variety speakers in overlapping section section 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact2154	3604.45	3604.6	A	PhD	b	-1	0	gave me he did 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2153	3604.38	3607.68	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	gave me he did that very nice he he did some shopping through the day then found 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2155	3607.68	3609.4	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	through the day then found segments it would be useful and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2156	3609.82	3612.7	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and at this point all four of the ones you specify depend on addition 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2157	3612.7	3617.56	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	depend on addition be i i have the transcribers expanding the amount that they're doing actually so 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact2158	3617.48	3617.89	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	actually so 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2159	3617.56	3622.68	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	actually so right now um i know that as of today we got an extra fifteen minutes of that type and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2160	3622.84	3627.1	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	of that type and i'm having them expand the realm on either side of these places where they've already started 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact2161	3627.41	3627.74	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr016.A.dialogueact2162	3628.36	3628.62	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	but if 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2163	3628.45	3633.13	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but if yeah and i and he's going to give me some more sections that that he thinks would be useful for this purpose because it's 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact2164	3630.01	3630.19	A	PhD	b	-1	0	going to give me some more sections 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact2165	3631.31	3631.48	A	PhD	b	-1	0	that that he thinks would 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2166	3633.59	3634.41	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because it's true i mean if we could do 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2167	3634.41	3641.74	E	Postdoc	s^e	+1	0	true i mean if we could do the be more fine grain tuning of this uh using an algorithm that would be so much more efficient and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2168	3641.8	3642.51	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	more efficient and um 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2169	3643.36	3645.54	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i i thought we we each so it's going to be 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact2170	3644.11	3650.67	A	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	i i thought we we each prefer pepsi for tried to to stop with those two homeless persons just be 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact2171	3650.67	3651.95	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	persons just just tried to give 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact2172	3651.95	3658.95	A	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	just tried to give it give one sense subscriber to tell us to burn off off my speech must be should take from and 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact2173	3658.95	3662.32	A	PhD	s	+1	1	must be should take from and look if if that's helpful for them or just 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact2174	3662.32	3664.76	A	PhD	s	-1	0	them or just let them try if if that's better off 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact2175	3664.76	3666.8	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	if that's better off if they if they come yeah you mean to start from scratch 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2176	3665.99	3667.96	E	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	if they if they come yeah you mean to start from scratch and brenda tragic 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact2177	3666.8	3667.35	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	they if they come yeah mean to start from scratch and brenda tragic 
Bmr016.A.dialogueact2178	3668.02	3668.18	A	PhD	b	-1	0	that if yeah that'd 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2179	3668.08	3668.66	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	that if yeah that'd 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2180	3668.66	3669.52	E	Postdoc	s^aa|s^ba	-1	0	that if yeah that'd be really great as 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2181	3670.01	3673.81	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it stands were still in the face is sort of um cleaning up the listing data getting 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2182	3673.81	3677.99	E	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	listing data getting things uh in more tight tightly time but like i 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2183	3677.99	3684.21	E	Postdoc	s^rt	-1	0	but like i just want to tell uh also under racy issues that okay so there's this idea we're going to have this master copy transcript is going to be modified 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2184	3684.45	3687.23	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	is going to be modified by scripts into these two different functions and actually 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2185	3687.5	3688.66	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	two or more two and actually the master 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2186	3688.17	3688.62	B	PhD	s^aap^bc	-1	0	two or more two the master 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2187	3688.95	3689.84	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	two or more two or more different than the master two two or more 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2188	3689.11	3689.85	E	Postdoc	s^m	-1	0	or more different than two two or more 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2189	3690.18	3692.39	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and the the masters going to be the channel it's version so 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2190	3692.72	3692.96	B	PhD	b	-1	0	version so 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2191	3692.99	3697.31	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	version so right now we've taken this uh initial one was a single channel basically the way it was input and now 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2192	3697.61	3703.42	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and now uh thanks to these dances the interface weakened from now on usage analyze part and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2193	3703.85	3707.03	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	part and uh any changes to make it me and challenged version i think but i wanted to get 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2194	3707.5	3709.49	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and so that has implications for your yeah but i wanted to get all the finish all the checks 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2195	3708.63	3710.64	B	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	and so that has implications for your script yeah so all the finish all the checks 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2196	3709.92	3710.32	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	implications for your script yeah so the checks 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2197	3710.79	3716.61	C	Grad	qy	+1	0	script so uh have those uh that the ten hours that have been transcribed already have those and analyzed yes 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2199	3717.31	3719.92	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and i know i've seen it i've seen they've been channel eyes but all ten hours have except for 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2198	3717.0	3717.43	E	Postdoc	s^na	+1	0	and i all have 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact2200	3717.87	3718.7	D	Grad	qy^bu^d	-1	0	and i know i've seen it i've seen all ten hours have 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2202	3719.92	3720.3	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	they've been channel eyes but except for the missing thirty minutes 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2201	3719.66	3721.13	E	Postdoc	s^aap	-1	0	they've been channel eyes but have they except for the missing thirty minutes 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2204	3721.53	3727.2	C	Grad	qy.%-	-1	0	have they uh have they been has the time of the time he's been adjusted up on the perch and all uh for for a total of like twenty 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact2203	3721.43	3721.66	D	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	have they 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2205	3725.91	3728.19	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	up on the perch and all uh for for a total of like twenty for 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2206	3728.77	3729.57	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	for a total of c. 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2207	3729.57	3730.21	E	Postdoc	s^t1.%--	-1	0	a total of c. told 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2208	3730.71	3733.22	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	told about it thirty minutes that's 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2209	3733.71	3734.81	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so that's that's been the case 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2210	3734.98	3735.47	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	so that's been the case and plus the training 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2211	3735.12	3736.67	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i guess i mean i don't and plus the training you 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2212	3736.24	3738.65	C	Grad	s^no	-1	0	i guess i mean i don't know if we should talk about this now or not but i but since you 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2213	3738.65	3739.27	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	or not but i but since we're 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact2214	3738.8	3740.63	D	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	or not but i yeah i but since we're think he 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2215	3740.74	3741.36	C	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	yeah i know i know but i mean my think he 
Bmr016.D.dialogueact2216	3740.82	3740.88	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	yeah i think he 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2217	3741.36	3746.28	C	Grad	s^ar|qy	-1	0	know i know but i mean my question is like should i wait until all of those are processed and generalize like that i markings 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2218	3746.28	3748.87	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	like that i markings are just it before i do all the processing we 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2219	3748.87	3754.42	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	all the processing we start like branching off into though it's uh our layer of uh transcripts well you know the problem the problem is that 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2220	3753.23	3763.07	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	transcripts well you know the problem the problem is that some some adjustments that they're making our to bring to our to combine bins that were time vince which were previously separate and the reason i do that sometimes 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2221	3763.07	3765.55	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and the reason i do that sometimes there's a word it's cut off 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2222	3765.51	3765.71	C	Grad	b	-1	0	cut off 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2223	3766.32	3771.24	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and so it's true that it's likely to be adjusted and the way that the words are more complete and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2224	3771.96	3772.38	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	okay and 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2225	3772.53	3772.82	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2227	3773.44	3776.39	C	Grad	s	+1	0	no i know i know that adjusting those things are going to is going to make it better i mean i'm sure so i it's to be a more reliable thing and i'm not sure yeah 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2226	3773.24	3774.98	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	no i know i know that adjusting those things so i it's to be a more reliable thing and 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2228	3774.98	3775.72	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	that adjusting those things are going to is going to make it better be a more reliable thing and i'm not sure 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2230	3776.64	3777.42	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i mean i'm sure about that but do you have like a timeframe yeah 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2229	3776.53	3776.88	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	i mean i'm sure yeah 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2231	3777.42	3780.53	C	Grad	qy	+1	0	about that but do you have like a timeframe when you can expect like all of it to be done or when you expect 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2232	3780.53	3782.22	C	Grad	qo.%--	-1	0	be done or when you expect them to finish it or probably depends 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2233	3782.37	3788.05	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yeah probably depends on how um oh how effective it will be two applying algorithms because 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2234	3788.05	3790.36	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	yeah yeah because it just takes time you know takes couple 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2235	3789.04	3789.21	C	Grad	b	-1	0	it just takes time 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2237	3790.61	3790.92	C	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah you know takes couple 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2236	3790.43	3794.03	E	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	yeah yeah i don't doubt it you know takes couple hours to to do uh ten minutes 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2238	3793.99	3794.78	C	Grad	s^aa|s^ba	-1	0	yeah i don't doubt it ten minutes 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2239	3795.08	3797.71	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um so 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2240	3798.16	3803.42	B	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	so right now thee what you're doing is you're taking of the uh the report original version then you're sort of channel 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2241	3803.42	3805.61	B	PhD	s^bu|qy^d^g	-1	0	version then you're sort of channel icing yourself right yeah i'm doing it myself 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2242	3804.86	3806.43	C	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	icing yourself right yeah i'm doing it myself i mean if if 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2243	3806.43	3809.57	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i mean if if the time likings are different across channels like the 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2244	3809.87	3812.55	C	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	like the channel is version really doesn't have any more information 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2245	3812.7	3813.23	B	PhD	b	-1	0	so 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2246	3813.29	3817.74	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so i was just i mean originally i had done it before like a challenge versions are coming out 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2247	3815.63	3816.0	B	PhD	b	-1	0	i had done it before like a challenge versions 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2248	3817.92	3818.14	B	PhD	b	-1	0	are coming out um 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2249	3818.43	3819.13	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2251	3820.23	3837.6	B	PhD	s	+1	0	so i i i think probably the way it'll though is that you know when we make this first general version and then start working on the script that script do that movie made you know primarily come from what you've done um will need to work on a channel eyes version of those originals and so it's a question of like what 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2250	3820.09	3821.24	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	so i i i think probably the and so it's a question of like what 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2252	3828.75	3829.05	C	Grad	b	-1	0	on the script that script 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2254	3837.48	3837.78	C	Grad	b.%	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2253	3837.01	3837.57	E	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2255	3838.09	3840.96	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and so it should be pretty much identical to what you have 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2257	3841.15	3844.28	B	PhD	s	-1	0	to except for the one that they've already tightened the boundaries are um right 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2256	3840.86	3840.98	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	to what you have 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2258	3841.67	3842.0	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	to except for the one that they've already 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2259	3844.1	3844.38	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	are um 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2260	3845.04	3845.4	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2262	3846.34	3846.85	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	so yeah 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2261	3846.33	3846.76	E	Postdoc	fg|%-	-1	0	so yeah 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2264	3847.54	3854.77	B	PhD	s	+1	0	uh and then probably will happen is has the transcribers finished tightening more and more you know that original version will get updated normal 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2263	3847.25	3847.38	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	uh and then 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2265	3854.77	3858.31	B	PhD	s	+1	0	will get updated normal rerun the script and produce better uh versions but i guess the okay 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2266	3857.27	3857.51	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	uh versions okay 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2267	3858.31	3867.09	B	PhD	s	+1	1	but i guess the if the effect for you guys because you're pulling out the little wave forms into separate ones that would mean these boundaries are constantly changing you have to constantly rerun 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2268	3867.09	3868.57	B	PhD	s	+1	0	you have to constantly rerun that so 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2269	3867.28	3867.56	C	Grad	s^na	-1	0	you have to constantly rerun 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2270	3868.57	3870.03	B	PhD	s^cs.%-	-1	0	that so maybe but that's that's not hard 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2271	3868.9	3869.11	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	that so maybe but that's that's 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2273	3869.57	3869.85	E	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	maybe but that's that's 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2272	3869.54	3870.8	G	PhD	s^ba^bd	-1	0	maybe but that's that's not hard 
Bmr016.E.dialogueact2274	3870.07	3870.33	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	not hard 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2275	3871.18	3871.44	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah i i think the harder 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2276	3871.23	3875.42	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah i i think the harder part is making sure that the trans the transcription 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2277	3871.73	3872.11	B	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah i i think the harder part is making sure 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2278	3876.13	3879.49	G	PhD	s	+1	0	so if you were merged two things then you know that's a some of the transcripts but if you split 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2279	3879.49	3884.35	G	PhD	s	+1	1	uhhuh but if you split inside something you don't know where the word which words and that's 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2280	3881.81	3882.3	B	PhD	b	-1	0	something you don't know where the word 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2281	3884.7	3885.14	B	PhD	b	-1	0	uhhuh and that's that's where it becomes a little 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2282	3884.75	3888.98	G	PhD	s	-1	0	uhhuh and that's that's where it becomes a little bit uh having to rerun the processing 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2283	3889.28	3889.71	B	PhD	b	-1	0	the cutting 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2284	3889.61	3892.22	G	PhD	s^ba	+1	0	yeah i mean as long as it can all the cutting of away from is pretty trivial 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2285	3891.39	3891.67	C	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah pretty trivial 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2286	3891.67	3896.27	C	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah i mean as long as it can all be done automatically i mean then it's not a concern you know if i just pretty trivial 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2289	3896.32	3896.82	B	PhD	b	-1	0	you know if i just 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2287	3896.27	3904.96	C	Grad	s	-1	0	you know if i just have to run three scripts to extract don't let it run of my computer for an hour and a half or however long it takes to parse and create all the reference files it's not a problem 
Bmr016.G.dialogueact2288	3896.28	3896.62	G	PhD	b	-1	0	you know if i just 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2290	3898.45	3898.85	B	PhD	b	-1	0	to extract don't 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2291	3900.27	3900.61	B	PhD	b	-1	0	for an hour 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2292	3904.51	3904.91	B	PhD	b	-1	0	files it's not a problem 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2293	3905.64	3906.03	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2294	3907.83	3908.37	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	so yeah as long as we're at that point 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2295	3908.37	3909.33	C	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah as long as we're at that point and i know exactly 
Bmr016.C.dialogueact2296	3909.45	3913.35	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and i know exactly what the steps work what's going on in the editing process 
Bmr016.B.dialogueact2297	3911.59	3911.86	B	PhD	b	-1	0	what's going on

Bmr016.E.dialogueact2301	3920.45	3924.32	E	Postdoc	s^t	-1	0	i can't think of any that i did but it's i think that we unless you think there's anything else i think that that covered it
