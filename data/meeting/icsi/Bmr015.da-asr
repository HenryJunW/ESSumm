Bmr015.B.dialogueact50	55.724	58.164	B	Grad	s	-1	0	uh other than me i actually have one more also just talk about the digits 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact51	58.642	63.472	A	Professor	h|s^na	+1	1	uh right so so i i'm just going to talk briefly about the n. s. f. i t. r. oh 
Bmr015.C.dialogueact52	59.186	59.796	C	PhD	b	-1	0	right so so 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact53	63.982	64.392	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	r. oh great 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact54	64.61	65.29	A	Professor	h	-1	0	great 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact55	66.064	66.894	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and then you have 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact56	66.128	66.358	F	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	and then you have 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact57	67.074	67.874	A	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	i mean one too much but 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact58	67.874	70.513	A	Professor	qy^bu^d	-1	0	i mean one too much but the then uh you said one time but digits i have a 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact59	70.761	72.121	B	Grad	s^na	+1	1	i have a short thing about the jets and then uh i want 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact60	72.121	74.731	B	Grad	s	+1	2	and then uh i want to talk a little bit about naming conventions although it's 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact61	74.731	77.531	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	conventions although it's unclear whether this is the right place to talk about it 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact62	78.43	80.34	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	so maybe just talk about it very briefly and take the details 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact63	80.34	83.18	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and take the details to the people who for mozzarella 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact64	83.487	83.697	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr015.C.dialogueact65	84.219	84.349	C	PhD	b	-1	0	i 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact66	85.013	86.873	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	could always say something about transcription i've been 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact67	86.933	88.703	F	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	well if we about transcription i've been but but uh well 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact68	88.611	91.565	A	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	well if we you know we shouldn't at things and just add things and i actually uh well 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact69	91.565	92.855	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	things and i actually pretty busy day suffolk 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact70	91.909	92.189	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	things and i actually pretty busy day suffolk 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact71	92.855	94.07	A	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	pretty busy day suffolk we starting to define yeah okay the sound 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact72	93.503	93.953	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	we yeah okay 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact73	94.07	94.99	A	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	starting to define the sound 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact74	94.231	95.661	F	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	starting to define the sound like we're doing 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact75	95.661	95.781	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	like we're doing 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact76	96.031	96.981	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr015.B.dialogueact77	97.06	101.65	B	Grad	s^t^tc	+1	2	so the only thing i would say about digits is we are pretty much done with the first test that there are probably 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact78	101.65	106.902	B	Grad	s	-1	0	test that there are probably forms here and there that are marked as having been read that weren't really read so 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact79	106.962	110.272	B	Grad	s	-1	0	weren't really read so i won't really know until i go through all transcriber forms an extract out 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact80	110.272	112.202	B	Grad	s	-1	0	forms an extract out pieces that are in air so 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact81	112.728	114.148	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so uh two things the first is 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact82	114.148	117.282	B	Grad	qw	+1	0	the first is what should we do about digits that were mis read 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact83	118.211	122.481	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	my opinion is um we just throw them out completely and 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact84	123.012	124.952	B	Grad	s^cs^e	-1	0	have them read again by someone else 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact85	125.412	126.952	B	Grad	s	-1	0	you know the grouping is completely random so 
Bmr015.C.dialogueact86	125.496	125.866	C	PhD	b	-1	0	you know the grouping 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact87	126.952	130.062	B	Grad	s	-1	0	is completely random so it's perfectly fine to put in a group together again of errors and have 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact88	130.426	130.906	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	of errors and have 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact89	130.906	131.816	B	Grad	s^cs.%--	-1	0	of errors and have them re read 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact90	132.139	133.469	B	Grad	s	-1	0	just to finish out the test that 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact91	134.442	136.252	F	Postdoc	s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	um the other thing you could do is oh by so i'm not completely 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact92	135.28	140.236	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	um the other thing you could do is change the transcript and that's what they really sad so i'm not completely 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact93	141.381	142.981	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but there's often so those are those are the two options 
Bmr015.C.dialogueact95	141.618	141.808	C	PhD	b	-1	0	so those are those 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact94	141.394	141.634	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	so those are those 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact96	142.614	144.854	A	Professor	s	-1	0	but there's often things that people do fall starts i know are the two options 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact97	144.854	147.114	A	Professor	s^df.%-	-1	0	fall starts i know i've done it where i say say uh what the transcribers did with 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact98	146.703	153.412	B	Grad	s	+1	0	say uh what the transcribers did with that is if they did a correction and they eventually did read the right string you extract the right to strike are you talking about where they completely 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact99	152.995	155.565	G	PhD	s^bu	+1	0	you extract the right to strike yeah i didn't notice are you talking about where they completely read the wrong thing and didn't correct it 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact100	154.13	154.38	E	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah read the wrong thing and didn't 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact101	154.647	156.134	B	Grad	s^aa|s^e	-1	0	yeah i didn't notice which happens read the wrong thing and didn't correct it uh 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact104	156.659	157.879	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	which happens in a few places uh 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact103	156.226	156.436	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	which happens uh 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact102	156.135	156.565	G	PhD	s^bk^fe	-1	0	which happens uh 
Bmr015.C.dialogueact105	156.988	157.198	C	PhD	b	-1	0	which happens in a few places uh 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact107	159.488	160.088	B	Grad	fg	-1	0	so so well continue talking string watching and 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact106	159.296	160.816	F	Postdoc	fg|s	-1	0	so so well continue talking string watching and 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact108	160.816	162.206	F	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	correct yeah talking string watching and talking about the entire page 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact110	162.309	162.739	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	correct 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact109	161.908	162.128	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	correct yeah talking about the entire page 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact111	162.813	163.003	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	correct 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact112	164.75	168.71	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and so that the two options are changed the transcript to match what they really sad but then 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact113	168.71	173.007	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	really sad but then but then the transcript isn't to run test that anymore i don't think that 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact114	173.514	174.724	B	Grad	s	-1	0	i don't think that really matters because the 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact115	174.724	176.104	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	really matters because the conditions are so different 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact116	177.509	178.709	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	and that would be a little easier well how many are 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact117	178.525	180.445	G	PhD	qw	-1	0	little easier five well how many are how my how often does that happen 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact118	180.68	181.77	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	five or six times happen 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact119	182.252	183.632	G	PhD	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	no it's not much in oh so it's not very much 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact120	183.37	184.26	B	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	no it's not much in much physical 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact121	184.809	186.409	G	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	physical should just change the transcript

Bmr015.A.dialogueact142	206.051	209.526	A	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	the speakers who we had just this these interesting see 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact143	209.744	212.968	G	PhD	fg|qw	+1	1	interesting see um how many did just have been transcribed 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact144	213.247	214.217	B	Grad	s	+1	1	four thousand lines in each line 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact145	214.487	217.667	B	Grad	s	+1	1	in each line is between one and about ten digits i didn't on online

Bmr015.B.dialogueact164	239.778	245.371	B	Grad	s	+1	1	and then the other thing is that uh the forms in front of us here that we're going to read later were suggested by liz because she wanted 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact163	239.431	239.961	F	Postdoc	s^ar|s^na	-1	0	and then the 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact165	245.371	248.681	B	Grad	s^df	+1	1	liz because she wanted to elicit some differences ought x. from digits 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact168	249.162	252.495	B	Grad	s^co	-1	0	and so uh i just want people to take a quick look at the instructions and the way 
Bmr015.C.dialogueact166	249.008	249.342	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and so uh i just 
Bmr015.C.dialogueact167	249.048	249.298	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and so uh i just 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact169	249.35	250.06	E	PhD	s.%	-1	0	and so uh i just want people to 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact170	252.495	254.885	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and the way it was worked and see if it makes sense and 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact171	254.885	256.665	B	Grad	s	-1	0	makes sense and if anyone has any comments on it 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact172	260.802	261.242	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact173	264.302	272.49	A	Professor	s^bu	+1	0	and the decision here uh west to continue with the the words rathers and uh the new americans 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact174	273.514	274.364	B	Grad	h|s^aa^rt	-1	0	uh yes although 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact175	274.814	276.214	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	although we could switch it back the problem was oh one 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact176	276.214	277.544	B	Grad	s	+1	0	the problem was oh one zero 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact177	279.198	283.178	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	or not either although we could switch it back and tell them always to say easier or always to say oh 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact178	279.225	279.415	F	Postdoc	s^bk.%	-1	0	although we could switch 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact179	283.234	284.144	A	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	or not either but it's just 
Bmr015.C.dialogueact180	283.531	283.781	C	PhD	b	-1	0	or not either 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact181	284.585	286.835	A	Professor	s^bu	+1	0	but it's just too thing ways that you can say 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact182	286.352	286.742	B	Grad	b	-1	0	that you can say 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact183	287.5	287.85	A	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr015.B.dialogueact185	288.832	289.012	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	sure yeah 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact184	288.797	289.377	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	sure yeah 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact187	289.512	292.132	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	um that's the only thought i have yeah 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact186	289.391	289.611	E	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact188	292.132	293.182	A	Professor	s	-1	0	that's the only thought i have because if you start 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact189	293.182	295.642	A	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	because if you start talking about these you 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact190	296.341	298.241	A	Professor	s	+1	0	she's trying to get it natural groupings but it's 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact192	298.752	303.218	A	Professor	s	+1	0	but it's there's there's nothing natural about reading numbers this way i mean if you saw 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact191	298.712	298.982	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	but it's 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact193	303.388	306.318	A	Professor	s^df^e	-1	0	i mean if you saw a telephone number you would never see it this way but the problem also 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact194	306.162	308.582	B	Grad	s	-1	0	way but the problem also she didn't want to stick with digits and i'm speaking 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact195	308.582	310.582	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	digits and i'm speaking for her so she's not here but 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact196	309.919	310.169	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	for her so she's not here but 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact197	311.018	317.84	B	Grad	s	+1	1	um the other problems we were thinking about is if you just put the new rules they might say forty three instead of four three uhhuh 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact198	314.992	315.182	E	PhD	b	-1	0	put the new rules they might uhhuh 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact199	315.22	315.76	G	PhD	s^bk^fe	-1	0	they might uhhuh 
Bmr015.C.dialogueact200	315.736	316.036	C	PhD	b	-1	0	they might say forty three instead uhhuh 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact201	316.881	317.061	E	PhD	b	-1	0	say forty three instead of four three 
Bmr015.C.dialogueact202	318.863	319.103	C	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact203	320.066	321.456	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	office space so between them i mean you can 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact204	321.546	322.056	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	them i mean you can with twenty space them out 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact205	322.176	325.158	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	well she with twenty space them out they don't look like forty three anymore 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact206	324.388	324.538	E	PhD	b	-1	0	forty three anymore 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact207	325.635	327.235	B	Grad	s	-1	0	well she and i were talking about it and she felt 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact208	327.011	327.491	A	Professor	b	-1	0	and she felt 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact209	327.235	332.971	B	Grad	s	-1	0	she's right it's it's and she felt that it's very very natural to do that sort of chung can't 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact210	332.164	334.054	A	Professor	s^na|s^ba	-1	0	she's right it's it's it's a different problem i mean it's it's chung can't 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact211	334.465	336.295	A	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean it's it's it's an interesting problem i mean 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact212	336.295	338.805	A	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean we've done stuff with numbers before and yeah 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact213	338.805	339.915	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	before and yeah sometimes people say 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact214	339.915	344.291	A	Professor	s	-1	0	sometimes people say seen ninety one sometimes people will say certain anyone or theater 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact215	344.291	346.231	A	Professor	s	-1	0	or theater any nine one i don't think they do 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact217	346.231	347.331	A	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	i don't think they do that but no not very frequently 
Bmr015.C.dialogueact216	345.819	345.969	C	PhD	b	-1	0	any nine one 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact218	347.371	347.501	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	that but no not very frequently 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact220	347.691	347.961	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	that but no not very frequently 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact219	347.447	348.257	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	that but no not very frequently but it certainly 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact221	347.961	348.261	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	that but no not very frequently but it certainly 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact222	348.257	349.527	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	but it certainly

Bmr015.A.dialogueact459	738.961	741.301	A	Professor	s	-1	0	but um so it's all it's all stuff that none of us are doing right now on a suspended 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact460	741.598	742.598	A	Professor	s	-1	0	now on a suspended for so it's 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact461	742.598	744.268	A	Professor	s	-1	0	for so it's so it's it would be new so assuming everybody's 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact462	744.219	750.55	G	PhD	qo^rt	-1	0	new brothers so assuming everybody's completely busy now means we're going to have to hire more students or something 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact463	750.72	752.76	A	Professor	s^j	-1	0	brothers evenings in this weekend something 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact464	752.76	755.039	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah that

Bmr015.B.dialogueact480	774.932	777.705	B	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	posted you in here are there any students in your class who are expressing interest 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact481	779.177	781.347	A	Professor	h|s^no	-1	0	um not 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact483	782.329	783.009	A	Professor	s^r	-1	0	period i mean we got other than the ones already here 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact482	782.095	783.205	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	period i mean we got other than the ones already here 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact484	783.099	784.519	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i mean we got we have 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact485	785.169	788.179	A	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	yet to it to it like they're doing across already here and then and and 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact486	788.179	788.459	A	Professor	%--	-1	0	and then and and 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact487	788.599	790.983	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	and then and and uh uh then 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact488	790.983	793.343	A	Professor	s	-1	0	uh then there's a third is doing a project here who uh 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact490	793.641	796.321	A	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	who uh but he he he won't be in country 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact489	793.241	793.511	B	Grad	b	-1	0	who uh 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact491	796.321	796.441	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact492	797.692	799.245	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and uh actually there is 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact493	798.788	798.948	B	Grad	b	-1	0	and 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact494	799.502	801.832	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh actually there is one of the guys looking that that 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact495	802.176	802.716	A	Professor	%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact496	802.926	803.916	A	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr015.C.dialogueact497	804.945	805.327	C	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr015.C.dialogueact498	805.025	805.285	C	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr015.A.dialogueact499	806.738	809.978	A	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	anyway yeah that's that's i was going to say is that but that's you know that's nice and 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact500	809.978	811.428	A	Professor	s	-1	0	you know that's nice and we sort of person eats next up and it'll 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact501	811.428	815.721	A	Professor	s	+1	0	up and it'll mean some more work uh you know in in march and getting proposal often and 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact502	815.721	819.275	A	Professor	s	-1	0	often and it's uh you know see what happens 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact503	821.309	824.259	A	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt^t^tc	+1	2	uh the last one was that you know there was about naming yep 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact504	824.51	824.81	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yep 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact505	825.253	831.15	B	Grad	s	-1	0	it just uh we've been cutting up sound files in for but with digits and for uh doing recognition and liz 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact506	831.713	833.483	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and liz had some suggestions on naming it just brought 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact507	833.483	837.54	B	Grad	s	-1	0	naming it just brought up the whole issue that hasn't really been resolved about naming so 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact508	838.005	842.595	B	Grad	s	+1	1	uh one thing she would like to have is for all the names to be the same length 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact509	843.128	844.308	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	so that's sorting is easier 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact511	845.733	846.223	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr015.C.dialogueact510	845.386	845.596	C	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr015.B.dialogueact512	847.366	848.316	B	Grad	s^e	+1	1	same number of characters so that when you're sort 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact513	848.316	852.132	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	so that when you're sort of file names you can easily extract outfits and he's the one that's easy enough to do 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact514	852.132	853.222	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	one that's easy enough to do and i don't think 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact515	853.554	856.924	B	Grad	s	+1	0	and i don't think we have so many meetings about the big deal just to change the names 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact516	857.24	863.116	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so that means i instead of calling it m. r. one and mark too you'd call it m. r. m. zero zero one m. r. m. zero zero two 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact517	863.116	864.996	B	Grad	s	-1	0	m. r. m. zero zero two things like that 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact518	865.928	867.668	B	Grad	s	-1	0	just so the they're all the same way 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact519	868.092	871.5	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	but you know when you do things like that you can always as long 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact520	871.855	872.495	F	Postdoc	s^df.%--	-1	0	always as long as you have uh 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact521	872.981	875.611	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	the problem as you have uh you can always search from the beginning or the end of the string you know so's 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact523	875.906	877.646	B	Grad	s	-1	0	the problem is that there are a lot of fields of the string you know so's yours are too 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact522	875.701	877.061	F	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	the problem is that there are a lot of fields of the string you know so's yours are too 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact525	878.855	879.065	B	Grad	s^f	-1	0	right so we we have 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact524	878.454	878.674	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	right 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact526	879.065	881.585	B	Grad	s^df^e	-1	0	so we we have we're going to have to speak grade d. this 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact527	881.938	882.558	B	Grad	s	-1	0	d. this session 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact528	883.118	885.095	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	uh information on the microphones yeah well your example was really 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact530	885.245	886.785	B	Grad	s	-1	0	information on the microphones infringing your example was really 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact529	884.907	886.217	F	Postdoc	s^bk|s^ba.%-	-1	0	uh information on the microphones infringing yeah well your example was really 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact533	886.785	889.685	B	Grad	s	-1	0	infringing on the speak on the channels and all that 
Bmr015.C.dialogueact532	886.772	887.162	C	PhD	b	-1	0	infringing on the speak 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact531	886.681	886.901	F	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	infringing 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact535	890.044	893.344	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	and so each one of those as a six blanks sorting becomes a lot easier 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact534	889.867	890.147	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	and all that and so each one of those as 
Bmr015.D.dialogueact536	894.014	897.398	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	you want to keep him same like across different meetings also so like 
Bmr015.D.dialogueact537	897.458	901.783	D	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	yep so like there was a meeting lengths of fathers are going the same like this uh recording it 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact538	901.045	901.255	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yep recording it 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact539	902.655	906.236	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	and said that we just don't have that many that that's a big deal and cause of digits 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact540	902.667	903.527	G	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	and said that we just cause of digits 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact541	906.879	911.651	B	Grad	s^cs.%--	-1	0	and so um at some point we have to sort of take a few days off 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact542	912.224	913.854	B	Grad	s^cs^e	-1	0	but the transcribers every few days off make 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact543	913.854	915.064	B	Grad	s^cs^e	-1	0	every few days off make sure no one's touching the data and reorganize the file 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact544	915.064	916.744	B	Grad	s^cs^e	-1	0	and reorganize the file structures and 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact545	917.038	919.488	B	Grad	s	-1	0	when we do that can also rationalize some of the naming 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact546	920.209	925.379	F	Postdoc	s^ng	-1	0	i i would think so that the transcribe the transcripts themselves wouldn't need to have such lengthy names 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact548	926.34	926.53	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right so i mean you're dealing 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact547	926.241	930.061	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	right so i mean you're dealing with a different domain there and would start and and times and all channels 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact549	930.061	931.516	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	right channels and stuff so 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact551	931.814	934.314	B	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	right so the only thing would change if that's just the directory name who i would change them and stuff so it's a different set 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact550	931.516	933.39	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	right so the only thing would change if that's just the directory name and stuff so it's a different set 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact552	934.314	935.474	B	Grad	s	-1	0	who i would change them to maps instead being 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact553	935.474	938.134	B	Grad	s	-1	0	to maps instead being m. r. one it would be m. r. zero or one i don't 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact554	938.324	939.344	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	i don't you 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact555	938.895	939.778	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	i don't you 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact556	940.304	943.434	B	Grad	s	+1	0	so for for the meetings and everything about three letters and three numbers from 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact557	944.002	944.942	B	Grad	s	-1	0	eating i. d.'s 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact558	945.418	948.498	B	Grad	s	+1	0	uh for speakers and more ass and then three numbers 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact559	949.71	951.5	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	for uh and uh that also 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact560	951.67	956.4	B	Grad	s^cs	+1	1	uh that also brings up the point that we have to start assembling speaker database so that we get those links back and forth and 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact561	956.88	957.93	B	Grad	s	+1	1	forth and keep it consistent 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact562	958.823	959.423	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact563	961.344	963.344	B	Grad	s	+1	0	and then uh the microphone issues we want some weights 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact564	963.344	975.033	B	Grad	s	+1	2	we want some weights testifying more than looking into keys file what channel and what mike what channel what mike and what broadcaster or i don't know how to 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact565	975.033	976.393	B	Grad	s^df^no	-1	0	or i don't know how to say it so anyway this 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact566	976.393	982.29	B	Grad	s	-1	0	say it so anyway this one it's this particular headset with this particular transmitter as a wireless and you know that 
Bmr015.C.dialogueact567	981.725	981.945	C	PhD	b	-1	0	as a wireless 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact568	982.129	982.309	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and you know that 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact569	982.73	985.14	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and you know that one is it different headset and different channel and 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact570	985.978	987.948	B	Grad	s	+1	0	and so we just need to naming conventions on that 
Bmr015.C.dialogueact571	987.444	987.604	C	PhD	b	-1	0	on that

Bmr015.B.dialogueact575	995.296	997.826	B	Grad	s	-1	0	we have some new microphone so i'd like to start trying out um 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact576	997.996	998.476	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	trying out um once i cast 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact577	998.636	999.446	B	Grad	s	-1	0	once i cast them and 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact578	999.932	1002.27	B	Grad	s	-1	0	them and then we'll we'll need to specify that somewhere so i was just going 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact579	1002.43	1007.22	B	Grad	s	+1	0	so i was just going to do it fixed list of uh microphones and types

Bmr015.B.dialogueact582	1008.39	1009.42	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	so that was that that sounds good 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact581	1008.04	1008.27	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so that was that sounds 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact583	1008.77	1009.48	G	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	so that was that that sounds good

Bmr015.A.dialogueact585	1012.12	1016.63	A	Professor	fh|qw^t^tc	+1	1	it's just such a shortage gentlest i guess i will ask how are the transcription 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact586	1017.59	1017.79	A	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah but 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact587	1017.77	1019.39	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	yeah but the news is that i i uh so and 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact588	1019.39	1020.86	F	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	i uh so and um 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact589	1021.13	1022.23	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	so i switched to start 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact590	1022.83	1023.65	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	start my sense 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact591	1024.48	1033.18	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	i i switched to doing be channel by channel transcriptionist to provide uh the tighter time bins for partly for you since he was working also it's 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact592	1033.18	1035.41	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	also it's irrelevant to the people on the project and 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact593	1036.1	1041.28	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	um i discovered in the process couple of of interesting things which um 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact594	1041.28	1041.91	F	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	which um 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact595	1042.67	1048.44	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	one of them is that um it seems that there are time likes involved in doing this 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact596	1048.75	1050.3	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	this using 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact597	1050.93	1053.89	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	using an interface that has so much more complexity to it 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact598	1054.35	1058.83	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	and i and i watch maybe ask uh check to help me with some of the questions of efficiency maybe 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact599	1058.83	1064.15	F	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	1	of efficiency maybe i was thinking maybe the best way to do this in the long run maybe to give them single channel parts and then piecing together 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact600	1064.33	1065.49	F	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	1	and then piecing together later and i i have 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact601	1065.61	1066.45	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	later and i i have a script i can piecing together 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact602	1066.45	1067.32	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	a script i can piecing together i mean so it's like 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact603	1067.32	1071.49	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i mean so it's like i i know that i can take apart put them together in on to put the representation which is where the 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact604	1071.49	1073.39	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	which is where the real power in their faces and maybe 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact606	1073.96	1074.35	A	Professor	b	-1	0	and maybe that it's faster to 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact605	1073.71	1083.23	F	Postdoc	s^am^ba	+1	0	i'm a little and maybe that it's faster to transcribe the channel at a time with only one uh sound file and one either insist to check through 
Bmr015.C.dialogueact607	1081.03	1081.17	C	PhD	b	-1	0	either insist 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact608	1083.7	1084.55	A	Professor	s	-1	0	i'm a little confused i thought that 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact609	1084.55	1097.05	A	Professor	s	-1	0	confused i thought that that one of the reasons we thought we were so much faster than and uh the the other transcription uh thing was that that we were using the next oh yes okay but 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact610	1096.64	1097.52	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	oh yes okay but 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact611	1097.52	1105.97	F	Postdoc	s^ng	+1	1	okay but um with the next when you have an overlap you only have a a choice of one start and and time for that entire overlap 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact612	1106.07	1111.72	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	which means that you're not tightly uh tuning the individual parts of it overlap by different speakers to someone 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact613	1109.22	1109.5	A	Professor	b	-1	0	individual parts 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact615	1112.02	1112.41	A	Professor	b	-1	0	may have only said 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact614	1111.72	1115.31	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	speakers to someone may have only said two words an entire big chunk of over a lot and for 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact616	1115.41	1115.81	A	Professor	b	-1	0	a lot and for 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact617	1115.77	1118.56	F	Postdoc	s.%--	+1	0	a lot and for purposes of uh of uh things like 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact618	1119.58	1123.62	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	well some things like training the station on c. segment patient thing it's 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact619	1121.49	1121.68	E	PhD	b	-1	0	the station 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact620	1123.62	1126.12	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	thing it's necessary to have it more tightly tuned in that and 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact621	1124.34	1124.65	A	Professor	b	-1	0	necessary to have it 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact622	1126.53	1134.8	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	and and and you know it's it would be wonderful if it's possible then to use a however much more type the time all the channels after that 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact623	1135.34	1137.74	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	did do so 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact624	1137.74	1138.15	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	did do so i don't 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact625	1138.15	1140.71	F	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	i don't know exactly where that's going at this point 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact626	1141.19	1144.2	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but mm but i was experimenting with doing this by hand and 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact627	1144.2	1144.55	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact628	1145.1	1148.05	F	Postdoc	s^ba	+1	0	i really do think that it's wise that we've had them start the way we have with uh 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact629	1148.05	1150.68	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	with uh working up the mixed signal 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact630	1151.08	1151.46	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	having 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact631	1151.88	1160.43	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	having b. interface that doesn't require them to do the type that time means for every single channel through the entire interaction 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact632	1158.18	1158.48	A	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr015.F.dialogueact633	1161.17	1163.37	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	um i did discover a couple of things by doing this on one of them is 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact634	1163.37	1164.3	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	this on one of them is that um 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact635	1164.37	1165.89	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	that um uh 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact636	1166.17	1169.53	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	once in a while a back channel will be overlooked by the transcriber as you might 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact638	1170.06	1170.34	A	Professor	b	-1	0	expect because when 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact637	1169.65	1170.53	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	as you might expect because when 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact640	1170.87	1171.13	A	Professor	b	-1	0	expect because when it's bad back 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact639	1170.53	1171.35	F	Postdoc	s^df.%--	-1	0	expect because when it's bad back 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact641	1171.71	1175.13	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it's bad back channel could well happen in a very densely populated overlap and 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact642	1175.54	1177.44	F	Postdoc	s.%--	+1	0	and if we're going to study type so we're lots which is what i want 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact643	1177.44	1178.34	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	we're lots which is what i want to do analysis of that 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact644	1178.34	1179.14	F	Postdoc	s^e.%--	-1	0	to do analysis of that than that really sets 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact645	1179.41	1184.85	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	than that really sets require listening to every single channel all the way through the entire length for all the different speakers 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact646	1185.08	1187.75	F	Postdoc	s^ba^bd	-1	0	now firmly four speakers that's not going to be too much time but if it's 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact647	1187.75	1191.05	F	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	too much time but if it's nine speakers then that is that is more times it's like you know kind of 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact648	1191.05	1192.33	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	it's like you know kind of wondering and i think again 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact649	1192.48	1197.33	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	wondering and i think again it's like this it's it's really valuable that he was working on the speech sounds speech segment asian because maybe 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact650	1197.33	1205.34	F	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	yeah asian because maybe we can close and a with without having to actually go to the time that would take to listen to every single channel from start to finish there every single me 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact651	1205.63	1208.49	E	PhD	s^bk|s^ba^ng	+1	1	yeah but those specs also see a problem i think especially me 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact652	1208.63	1211.2	E	PhD	s	+1	1	i think especially if they're really sure what and still not 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact653	1211.2	1212.8	E	PhD	s^e^rt	+1	1	what and still not very tall and 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact654	1212.9	1219.28	E	PhD	s	+1	1	very tall and so it can can it and all this happened that also the medic detection system is the most them so okay well 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact655	1219.28	1219.57	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	them so okay well 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact656	1219.33	1219.59	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	them so okay well 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact657	1220.21	1226.3	F	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	1	sometimes then maybe the answer is too uh listen especially densely in places of overlap just so that they're 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact659	1226.56	1226.7	E	PhD	b	-1	0	just so that they're 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact658	1226.45	1229.19	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	just so that they're not being overlooked because of that and count on accuracy 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact660	1229.19	1231.88	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and count on accuracy during the sparse your face faces because 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact661	1229.8	1229.97	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and count on accuracy 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact662	1231.88	1233.36	F	Postdoc	s^df.%--	-1	0	sparse your face faces because they're a large basis of it that's a good point 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact663	1233.48	1234.08	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	of it that's a good point guard large spaces 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact664	1234.29	1236.18	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	guard large spaces where there's no overlap at all some is giving a presentation 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact665	1236.18	1237.43	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	all some is giving a presentation whatever 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact666	1237.36	1237.49	E	PhD	b	-1	0	whatever 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact667	1237.43	1238.35	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	whatever that's that's 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact668	1238.68	1239.88	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	that's that's a good 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact669	1240.57	1242.72	F	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	and um let's see there was one thing i was going to say 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact670	1243.42	1245.46	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	i think it's really interesting data to work with i have to say it's 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact671	1245.46	1246.94	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	work with i have to say it's very enjoyable 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact672	1247.21	1249.54	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	really not not a problem spending time with these two really interesting 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact673	1249.81	1250.34	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	with these two really interesting 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact674	1251.16	1252.15	F	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	not just because i'm in there 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact675	1255.17	1255.9	F	Postdoc	s^ba^r	-1	0	that's really interesting

Bmr015.A.dialogueact746	1476.53	1479.2	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	about it it's it's it's i haven't worked of that either so i'm not sure the 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact747	1479.2	1479.95	A	Professor	s^no	-1	0	so i'm not sure the 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact748	1479.95	1485.4	A	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so i'm not sure the way the simple minded way i suggested was talk was just things that you can make a sieve 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact750	1486.28	1488.56	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	actually say that yours

Bmr015.A.dialogueact751	1489.49	1493.26	A	Professor	s^e	-1	0	let's let's hypothesize that it's this frequency arafat frequency and 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact752	1493.26	1494.74	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	and and uh maybe 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact754	1494.74	1501.79	A	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and uh maybe maybe could use some other keep methods to uh shortcut it by by uh making some guesses but 
Bmr015.C.dialogueact753	1494.36	1494.61	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and uh maybe 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact755	1501.79	1505.76	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	some guesses but but uh 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact756	1507.5	1508.36	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i would uh i mean you could 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact757	1508.65	1512.97	A	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	i mean you could make some guesses from uh from not a correlation or something but 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact758	1512.97	1515.89	A	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	or something but but then given those gases try

Bmr015.G.dialogueact784	1557.28	1561.72	G	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	they're going to be dampened by be uh vocal tracks right

Bmr015.G.dialogueact786	1563.14	1564.35	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	respond to the vocal track and

Bmr015.G.dialogueact789	1564.97	1570.73	G	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	and so just looking at the energy in those that the harmonic is that going to 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact790	1571.52	1573.36	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	well so the thing is that the 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact791	1574.4	1575.36	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	this is for uh a 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact792	1575.36	1577.94	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh a 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact793	1578.09	1581.75	G	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	and we what you'd like to do is get rid of the effect of the vocal tract right 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact794	1581.75	1581.99	G	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	vocal tract right 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact795	1582.61	1583.11	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and just look at uh 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact796	1582.61	1588.66	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	yeah uh well and just look at uh at the signal coming out of that a lot of 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact797	1586.49	1587.0	A	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah uh at the signal coming out of that 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact798	1587.41	1589.15	A	Professor	h	-1	0	uh well yeah because the signal coming out of that a lot of 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact799	1589.33	1590.05	A	Professor	s^aa|s^ba	-1	0	yeah because 
Bmr015.C.dialogueact800	1589.41	1589.72	C	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah because 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact801	1591.05	1593.28	A	Professor	s^arp^df	-1	0	but but but but i don't know you need to open why 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact802	1592.82	1593.65	B	Grad	s^co^fe^j	-1	0	but i don't know you need to open why 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact803	1594.52	1596.21	A	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	but i don't they did duffy to get rid of it i mean that that be nice 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact804	1596.21	1597.1	A	Professor	s^ba^bd	-1	0	of it i mean that that be nice enough so that it's 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact805	1597.1	1598.77	A	Professor	s^no	-1	0	enough so that it's essential um 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact806	1598.82	1604.26	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	essential um i mean because i think the main thing is that uh you're trying what are you doing 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact807	1598.89	1599.16	G	PhD	b	-1	0	essential um i mean because i think 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact808	1604.26	1605.46	A	Professor	qw^t1	-1	0	what are you doing this for trying 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact809	1605.75	1614.36	A	Professor	s	+1	2	this for trying to distinguish between the case where there is uh where the where there are more um where there's more than one speaker 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact810	1616.39	1618.14	A	Professor	s	+1	2	and the case where there's only one speaker so 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact811	1616.41	1616.76	B	Grad	s^fa^t3	-1	0	and the case where there's 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact812	1618.94	1620.66	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so if there's more than one speaker or 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact813	1621.74	1622.4	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact814	1624.04	1625.19	A	Professor	s^aa|s^am.%--	-1	0	i guess you could i guess you know you're saying 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact815	1625.48	1627.59	A	Professor	s	-1	0	you know you're saying not distinguishing voice an envoy so so 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact816	1627.59	1630.9	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	an envoy so so if if you don't you don't care about that 
Bmr015.C.dialogueact817	1628.35	1628.54	C	PhD	b	-1	0	if if you don't 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact818	1631.02	1638.48	A	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	see if you're also want to just determined feel sort of germ whether it's on voiced then i think you want to look at high frequencies also because 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact819	1638.48	1645.29	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	also because the the fact that there's more energy and high frequencies is going to be you know sort of obvious to it's enforced 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact820	1642.32	1642.62	G	PhD	b	-1	0	is going to be 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact821	1646.28	1648.03	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but uh i mean it but um 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact822	1648.35	1649.33	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	but um other 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact823	1650.0	1657.52	A	Professor	s	+1	0	than that i guess as far as the one person versus two persons it would be primarily low frequency phenomenon 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact824	1658.26	1662.9	A	Professor	s	+1	0	and if you look at the low frequencies yes the higher frequencies are kind of there's going to be a spectrum slope 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact825	1663.58	1665.45	A	Professor	s	+1	0	higher frequencies will be lower energy

Bmr015.A.dialogueact827	1669.0	1671.68	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	that's that's i would too good for

Bmr015.A.dialogueact839	1705.62	1708.94	A	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	well but yeah i don't think you can i mean not going to be able to look at every frame so 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact840	1708.94	1709.37	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	to look at every frame so i mean i 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact841	1709.86	1714.62	A	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean i i mean i i really i really thought that the best way to do it and i'm speaking 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact842	1714.62	1717.24	A	Professor	s^bd^df	-1	0	way to do it and i'm speaking with no experience in this particular point but 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact843	1717.47	1728.71	A	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	point but my impression was the best way to do it was however you you fuses teams frequency whatever however you coffee up with your candidates you want to see how much of the energy is in that 
Bmr015.C.dialogueact844	1723.15	1723.44	C	PhD	b	-1	0	you coffee up with your candidates

Bmr015.A.dialogueact1060	2155.67	2161.11	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and uh this is it's this is actual stuff that we want to work with well this is it 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1061	2161.44	2162.73	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	well this is it very interesting because 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1062	2161.99	2162.12	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	well this is it very interesting because 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1063	2162.73	2169.99	F	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	very interesting because it basically has a it shows very clearly the contrast between uh speech recognition research and just course research because 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1064	2169.99	2174.55	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and just course research because and and discourse linguistic research what counts is what's community communicative 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1065	2170.37	2170.92	G	PhD	b	-1	0	and and discourse 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1066	2175.06	2176.02	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and press you know everyone breezy breed 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1067	2176.02	2176.86	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	know everyone breezy breed 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1068	2176.86	2177.7	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	know everyone breezy breed all the time in once in 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1069	2177.7	2179.32	F	Postdoc	s^bd^df	-1	0	all the time in once in a while breath is communicative but very 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1070	2179.32	2180.8	F	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	but very very rarely 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1071	2181.04	2183.5	F	Postdoc	fg|s	+1	0	okay so now i had a discussion with talk about the data structure and the 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1072	2183.29	2183.64	A	Professor	b	-1	0	structure and the 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1073	2183.5	2187.23	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	structure and the idea is that transfers well that gets tortoise a semester be a master transcript 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1074	2187.3	2188.5	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	be a master transcript which has in 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1075	2188.5	2191.21	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	which has in it everything that's needed for both of these pieces and 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1076	2191.54	2191.95	A	Professor	b	-1	0	and 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1077	2191.57	2195.42	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and the one that sees for speech recognition will be processed by scripts you know like 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1078	2195.47	2197.16	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know like don been writing scripts and and uh 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1080	2197.64	2197.96	A	Professor	b	-1	0	and and uh 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1079	2197.16	2197.71	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and and uh 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1081	2198.02	2200.36	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	to process it for the speech recognition side discourse side 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1082	2200.58	2201.9	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	side discourse side will have this 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1083	2201.9	2204.41	F	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	will have this this side over he the we'll we'll have this sorry nothing 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1084	2204.58	2205.68	F	Postdoc	s^fa|s	-1	0	sorry nothing personal here but 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1085	2205.82	2206.56	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	personal here but um just 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1086	2206.72	2211.51	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	um just they discourse side will have a script which will strip strip away the things which are non communicative okay 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1087	2212.01	2218.58	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so then it then let's let's think about the practicality of how we get that master copy with reference to breath so 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1088	2218.72	2224.78	F	Postdoc	qy	+1	0	to breath so what i would what i would wonder is would it be possible to in code those automatically could we 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1089	2224.78	2226.47	F	Postdoc	qy	+1	0	automatically could we get a breath detector 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact1090	2227.9	2230.64	B	Grad	s^bk|s^bu	-1	0	but just to say the transcribers well i mean 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1091	2230.72	2231.87	F	Postdoc	s^df^na	-1	0	well i mean you just have no idea i mean 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1092	2231.87	2234.41	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you just have no idea i mean if you're getting a breath several times every minute and 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact1093	2234.56	2234.93	B	Grad	b	-1	0	minute and 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1094	2234.92	2242.27	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	what minute and just simply the key strokes it takes to negotiate to but the boundaries and to to type it in it's just a huge amount of time any wannabe shirts 
Bmr015.B.dialogueact1095	2239.95	2240.44	B	Grad	b	-1	0	to type it in it's just 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1096	2240.54	2240.77	E	PhD	s^t1.%	-1	0	it's just 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1098	2242.26	2242.76	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	what any wannabe shirts 
Bmr015.C.dialogueact1097	2242.24	2242.49	C	PhD	z	-1	0	what any wannabe shirts 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1099	2242.33	2243.59	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	what any wannabe shirts use and you want to be 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1100	2243.59	2245.37	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	use and you want to be sure it's done is officially spas it's done automatically 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1101	2245.37	2247.32	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	what if spas it's done automatically that would be ideal 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1102	2247.82	2250.33	A	Professor	qh	+1	0	what if you put it in but it and put the boundaries 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1103	2252.09	2252.86	F	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	but 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1104	2254.42	2256.19	A	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	so you just know it's between these other things right well okay so now there's there's another another possibility 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1105	2254.43	2257.05	F	Postdoc	fg|s	-1	0	so you just know it's between these other things right well okay so now there's there's another another possibility which is uh 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1106	2256.19	2256.43	A	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right another possibility 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1107	2257.05	2262.06	F	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	which is uh the time boundaries could mark off words from non words and that 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1108	2262.87	2265.43	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and that would be extremely time effective if that's sufficient 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1109	2266.15	2272.17	A	Professor	fg|s	+1	0	yeah i'm in thing if it's too if it's too hard first annotate the best per se we are going to be building up models for these things and these things are somewhat 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1110	2272.17	2274.07	A	Professor	s	+1	0	and these things are somewhat self aligning so if so 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1111	2274.11	2282.23	A	Professor	s	+1	0	so if so we if we say there is some kind of a thing which we call a brass her breath in a breath out models will learn that sort of thing uh soap 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1112	2282.37	2288.03	A	Professor	s	+1	0	thing uh soap but you but you do want him the point in that some region where with the rest really are okay 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1114	2288.85	2289.27	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	okay but that would maybe included there's an there's 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1113	2288.37	2290.98	F	Postdoc	s^bk|s	-1	0	okay but that would maybe included pauses well and there's an there's 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1115	2289.13	2289.82	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	but that would maybe included there's an there's 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1116	2290.98	2296.39	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yeah i you know there's there's just i never tension between between pauses well and that wouldn't be a problem to have it uh pause plus press plus laugh plus 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1117	2292.55	2292.92	A	Professor	fg|%-	-1	0	yeah i have it uh pause plus 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1118	2294.11	2299.27	A	Professor	s	-1	0	you know there's there's just i never tension between between marking absolutely everything is you know and and and laugh plus 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1119	2299.27	2300.35	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	know and and and marking just 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1120	2300.46	2303.02	A	Professor	s	-1	0	marking just a little bit in telling on this disco methods basically the more 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1121	2303.5	2305.15	A	Professor	s	-1	0	basically the more we can mark the better but if there seems 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1122	2305.58	2309.04	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but if there seems to be a lot of effort for small amount of reward in some area and this might be on like 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1123	2309.04	2310.45	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and this might be on like this well 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1124	2310.79	2314.62	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	this well i i i'd be interested in it get get input from this and this and this to see if they because they

Bmr015.A.dialogueact1130	2321.97	2323.84	A	Professor	s	-1	0	yes they do but we we can handle that without it here but 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1131	2323.84	2325.2	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	that without it here but but but uh you you're going to say something

Bmr015.G.dialogueact1135	2332.25	2337.12	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	you know as the transcribers are going through if they get a hunk of speech that they're going to transcribe 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1136	2338.47	2341.1	G	PhD	s	-1	0	they're going to transcribe it because there's words in there whatnot if there's a breath 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1137	2341.5	2345.12	G	PhD	s	-1	0	that's what they've been doing if there's a breath in there they could transcribe that 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1138	2343.33	2343.56	E	PhD	b	-1	0	they 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1140	2345.91	2346.08	E	PhD	b	-1	0	that's what they've been doing so within right

Bmr015.F.dialogueact1142	2346.69	2349.14	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so within an overlap segment they they do this right but right but if there's a big 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1141	2346.31	2346.49	G	PhD	b	-1	0	so within right 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1143	2347.11	2347.3	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	an overlap segment but 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1144	2348.4	2356.22	G	PhD	fg|s^cs	-1	0	they they do this right but if there's a big hunk of speech let's say on morgan mike where he's not talking at all um don't don't worry about that so what we're saying 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1145	2354.11	2354.25	E	PhD	b	-1	0	um 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1146	2356.22	2360.43	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	that so what we're saying is there's no guarantee that um so 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1147	2361.05	2363.83	G	PhD	s	-1	0	for the chunks that are transcribed everything's transcribed 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1148	2364.25	2367.55	G	PhD	s	-1	0	but outside of those boundaries there could have been stuff that wasn't transcribe so 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1149	2367.99	2372.07	G	PhD	s	-1	0	transcribe so you just somebody can't rely on that date and say that's perfectly clean data i 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1150	2373.04	2374.31	G	PhD	qy	-1	0	yeah he sings you see what i'm saying so i would say don't 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1151	2374.38	2376.33	F	Postdoc	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	yeah he sings uncharted territory so i would say don't tell them to transcribe anything that's outside 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1152	2374.42	2379.61	G	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	that sounds like a reasonable reasonable yeah he sings uncharted territory so i would say don't tell them to transcribe anything that's outside of a grouping of words 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1153	2378.03	2381.1	A	Professor	s^na	-1	0	sounds like a reasonable reasonable compromise a grouping of words 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1154	2382.1	2387.98	E	PhD	fg|s	+1	0	and that it took quite some co sponsor the way i i try to train the speech unstitched care 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1155	2387.98	2392.06	E	PhD	s	-1	0	unstitched care of a really tried too not just to detect those spread which um 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1156	2392.26	2398.28	E	PhD	s	-1	0	which um not listen to speech shrunk but with what but uh and if i don't return and 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1157	2398.69	2398.94	A	Professor	b	-1	0	and 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1158	2398.91	2403.85	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and they so they hopefully won't be mounted in industrial specific files 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1161	2405.42	2409.85	A	Professor	s	-1	0	i wanted to comment little more just for clarification about this business about the different purposes uh 
Bmr015.E.dialogueact1160	2405.12	2405.29	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	i wanted uh 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1159	2405.08	2405.5	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	i wanted uh 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1162	2407.87	2408.21	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	just for clarification about this business about the 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1163	2410.41	2412.84	A	Professor	s	-1	0	he in a in a way this is a really key point that 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1164	2412.96	2415.54	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	key point that for speech recognition uh research 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1165	2416.63	2417.81	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh um 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1166	2418.92	2420.52	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and it's not just a minor part affect the 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1167	2420.52	2433.39	A	Professor	s	+1	0	part affect the i think let's see the core thing that we're trying to do is to recognize the actual meaning full components in the midst of other things that are not meaningful so it's 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1168	2433.82	2434.67	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so it's critical 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1169	2435.01	2435.97	A	Professor	s^e	-1	0	it's not just incidental it's 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1170	2435.97	2440.98	A	Professor	s	+1	0	it's not just incidental it's critical for us to get these other opponents that are not meaningful 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1171	2441.25	2443.57	A	Professor	s^df	+1	0	because that's what we're trying to pull the other out that's our problem 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1172	2443.57	2444.24	A	Professor	s	-1	0	the other out that's our problem if we 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1173	2444.76	2445.83	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	if we had nothing 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1174	2444.8	2445.02	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	if we had nothing 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1175	2446.29	2448.53	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	if we had only linguistically relevant things if if we 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1176	2448.54	2454.31	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	things if if we only had changes in the spectrum that were associated with words with different specter oh components and 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1177	2454.85	2457.14	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and uh we we didn't have noisy didn't have 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1178	2457.14	2458.64	A	Professor	s	-1	0	didn't have no errors we didn't 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1179	2458.64	2461.62	A	Professor	s	-1	0	no errors we didn't have extraneous uh behaviors and so forth and 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1180	2461.62	2462.86	A	Professor	s	-1	0	so forth and moving your head and all 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1181	2462.86	2463.99	A	Professor	s	-1	0	moving your head and all these sorts of things 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1182	2464.51	2468.88	A	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	then actually speech recognition isn't that bad right now i mean 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1183	2468.88	2469.41	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	right now i mean you could you 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1185	2469.82	2472.96	A	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	you could you know it's it's a technologies come along pretty well the 
Bmr015.C.dialogueact1184	2469.79	2470.2	C	PhD	z	-1	0	you could you know it's it's 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1186	2472.96	2479.09	A	Professor	s	-1	0	along pretty well the the the reason we still complain about it just because when when you have more realistic conditions than and things fall apart okay fair enough i 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1187	2479.49	2479.99	F	Postdoc	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	okay fair enough i 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1188	2479.99	2486.42	F	Postdoc	qw	-1	0	okay fair enough i guess i'm like i what i was wondering is what what at what level does the breathing aspect enter into the problem because if it 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1189	2486.52	2495.59	F	Postdoc	s^df.%--	-1	0	problem because if it were likely that a p. d. a. would be able to be built which would get rid of the breathing say would even have to be processed at this at this computational up i 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1190	2495.59	2497.97	F	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	up i have to be competition across to get rid of it but 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1191	2497.97	2502.35	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	across to get rid of it but if they were uh like likely on the front here uh good breath extract or 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1192	2503.42	2505.21	F	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	but it's a research question you know then um and then you have to 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1193	2504.19	2505.48	A	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	but it's a research question you know and then you have to 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1194	2505.77	2505.95	A	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	question you know 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1195	2506.21	2506.5	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	that so yeah well see that's what i 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1196	2506.31	2507.55	F	Postdoc	s^bk|s^df	-1	0	that so it yeah well see that's what i wouldn't know 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1197	2507.64	2507.79	A	Professor	%-	-1	0	it wouldn't know 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1198	2508.22	2508.9	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and we don't either i mean 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1199	2508.9	2510.36	A	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and we don't either i mean so so the thing is it's it's right now it's just 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1200	2510.36	2512.61	A	Professor	s	-1	0	it's right now it's just raw did you stated that were collecting and so 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1201	2512.61	2517.73	A	Professor	s	-1	0	collecting and so we don't a priest bows the people will be able to get rid of particular degradation is because 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1202	2517.73	2519.82	A	Professor	s^df	-1	0	degradation is because that's actually the research that we're trying to feed 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1204	2520.45	2524.33	A	Professor	s	-1	0	so you know it and maybe maybe in five years it'll work really well and and it'll 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1203	2520.27	2520.42	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	so 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1205	2524.33	2526.94	A	Professor	s	-1	0	and and it'll only mess up ten percent of the time but 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1206	2526.94	2529.0	A	Professor	s	-1	0	ten percent of the time but then we would still want to come for the ten percent i guess there's another aspect which 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1208	2529.0	2529.19	A	Professor	fh	-1	0	guess there's another aspect which 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1207	2528.96	2529.98	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	for the ten percent i guess there's another aspect which 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1209	2529.98	2536.23	F	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	guess there's another aspect which is that has we've improved a microphone technique we have a lot less breath and and more recent according so it's in a 
Bmr015.F.dialogueact1210	2536.41	2539.82	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	so it's in a way it's an artifact that there's so much on the on the earlier ones 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1211	2537.1	2537.7	A	Professor	b	-1	0	way it's an artifact 
Bmr015.A.dialogueact1212	2540.38	2540.77	A	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	one 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1213	2540.94	2541.61	G	PhD	%--	-1	0	one of the um 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1214	2541.71	2542.93	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	of the um just to add to this one 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1215	2542.93	2547.09	G	PhD	s	-1	0	just to add to this one of the ways that we will be able to get rid of breath is by having models for them i mean that's what a lot of people 
Bmr015.G.dialogueact1216	2547.21	2548.64	G	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean that's what a lot of people do nowadays in
