Bed014.C.dialogueact309	670.67	681.03	C	Professor	fh|s.%-	+1	1	yeah uh which is mental spaces and um and the war 
Bed014.A.dialogueact310	679.611	679.991	A	Grad	b	-1	0	um 
Bed014.B.dialogueact311	680.767	681.197	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	yeah and the war 
Bed014.B.dialogueact313	682.0	682.47	B	Grad	s^r	-1	0	yeah it's hard aren't 
Bed014.C.dialogueact312	681.57	681.8	C	Professor	qw^br	-1	0	yeah 
Bed014.A.dialogueact316	682.707	683.037	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah it's hard thought aren't but 
Bed014.B.dialogueact315	682.62	682.96	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah it's hard aren't 
Bed014.C.dialogueact314	682.332	682.992	C	Professor	s^na	-1	0	yeah it's hard aren't 
Bed014.C.dialogueact317	683.462	692.372	C	Professor	s	+1	1	thought but the other part of it is the way they connected to these um published it relational models so 
Bed014.C.dialogueact318	692.762	699.142	C	Professor	s	+1	0	so there's a lot of problems that the linguists know about about mental spaces and the cognitive linguist know about but then there's this problem 
Bed014.C.dialogueact319	699.142	711.05	C	Professor	s	+1	0	but then there's this problem um the believe that people have only done a moderately good job of dealing with pepperell police that's uh which 
Bed014.C.dialogueact320	711.44	712.82	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh which they call dynamic 
Bed014.C.dialogueact321	713.61	715.98	C	Professor	s	-1	0	they in correctly called dynamic police that so 
Bed014.B.dialogueact322	714.689	714.939	B	Grad	b	-1	0	in correctly called dynamic 
Bed014.C.dialogueact323	715.98	718.27	C	Professor	s	-1	0	police that so there's a term dynamic place that doesn't mean that it means 
Bed014.C.dialogueact324	718.68	719.93	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it means time slices 
Bed014.C.dialogueact325	720.69	723.39	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and so many years those people use them 
Bed014.C.dialogueact326	724.255	726.624	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh but 
Bed014.C.dialogueact327	727.65	740.713	C	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	one of the things i would like to do over the next it uh month of make take more is just understand to what extent we can not only figure out the construction for them for multiple world 
Bed014.C.dialogueact328	741.228	742.228	C	Professor	fh	+1	0	and 
Bed014.C.dialogueact329	743.187	753.147	C	Professor	s	+1	1	sort of put the formal as him look like in where swanson forcibly also what that would translate into in terms of belief that and in the story 
Bed014.C.dialogueact330	753.652	762.432	C	Professor	s	-1	0	the story is that if you have these problems relational models they're set up in principle so that you can make new instances in instances 
Bed014.C.dialogueact331	762.432	765.562	C	Professor	s	-1	0	in instances connect to each other and all that sort of stuff so 
Bed014.C.dialogueact332	765.952	782.4	C	Professor	s	-1	0	of stuff so it should be feasible to set them up in such a way that if you've got the past tense in the present tense in each of those as a separate uh belief structure that they do their inferences it was just a couple things that are appropriate 
Bed014.C.dialogueact333	783.671	787.211	C	Professor	s	+1	0	but that's but that's as far as i can tell is putting it was too real hard problems one is 
Bed014.C.dialogueact334	787.211	792.58	C	Professor	s	+1	1	one is the linguistic part of what are coupling and and when 
Bed014.C.dialogueact335	792.58	797.24	C	Professor	s	+1	1	and and when you have a certain uh construction that imply certain coupling is another coupling she'll be teams within 
Bed014.C.dialogueact336	797.24	799.17	C	Professor	s^f|s	-1	0	she'll be teams within the past and the present or any other 
Bed014.C.dialogueact337	799.17	801.44	C	Professor	s	-1	0	or any other one of these things and 
Bed014.C.dialogueact338	801.945	807.915	C	Professor	s	+1	1	things and then we have this inference problem of exactly technically how does the police network 
Bed014.C.dialogueact339	809.34	814.27	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yes it's gone um let's say one in you know different answers or my 
Bed014.C.dialogueact340	814.27	816.26	C	Professor	s	-1	0	or my police and your beliefs or any of these other 
Bed014.C.dialogueact341	816.26	819.73	C	Professor	s	-1	0	or any of these other ones of of multiple models 
Bed014.C.dialogueact342	820.48	823.29	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bed014.C.dialogueact343	824.28	826.39	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you know in the long run we need to solve both of those and my suggestion 
Bed014.C.dialogueact344	826.39	836.73	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and my suggestion is that we start digging in ooh them both uh the way we think you know hopefully 
Bed014.C.dialogueact345	836.73	838.25	C	Professor	s	-1	0	we think you know hopefully turns out to be consistent 
Bed014.C.dialogueact346	838.89	839.34	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed014.C.dialogueact347	840.31	841.17	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed014.C.dialogueact348	842.181	846.44	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah and sometimes it's actually easier to heart our problems in one 
Bed014.A.dialogueact349	846.617	846.917	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah one 
Bed014.C.dialogueact350	847.27	848.78	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because they can strain each other i mean it's 
Bed014.C.dialogueact351	848.78	853.22	C	Professor	s^df^e.%--	-1	0	strain each other i mean it's got huge ricky huge range of possible choices 
Bed014.C.dialogueact352	854.37	855.39	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed014.C.dialogueact353	855.86	856.16	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but so that's 
Bed014.C.dialogueact354	856.4	858.17	C	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	oh yeah like uh but so that's 
Bed014.A.dialogueact355	858.36	863.68	A	Grad	fg|s.%--	-1	0	oh yeah like uh i solved it the the problem of um you were talking about how do you 
Bed014.A.dialogueact356	864.379	868.629	A	Grad	s	-1	0	various issues uh how calm up floral now and gets to quote count as a noun phrase you know an 
Bed014.A.dialogueact357	868.629	873.639	A	Grad	s	-1	0	phrase you know an argument of a higher construction but uh bearer singular stand doesn't get to act that way right 
Bed014.C.dialogueact358	869.74	869.98	C	Professor	b	-1	0	argument of a higher construction right 
Bed014.A.dialogueact359	874.099	874.659	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	um and 
Bed014.A.dialogueact360	875.04	877.3	A	Grad	s	-1	0	they would take a really long time to explain now but i'm about to write 
Bed014.A.dialogueact361	877.3	878.81	A	Grad	s	-1	0	now but i'm about to write it up this evening 
Bed014.A.dialogueact362	879.07	890.22	A	Grad	s:s	-1	0	i saw that at the same time has how do we keep educators from floating to the left of determine or and how do we keep all of that from floating outside the noun phrase to get something like i've thought kicked dog um 
Bed014.A.dialogueact363	890.73	891.33	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed014.A.dialogueact365	892.436	893.416	A	Grad	s	-1	0	did it did it once so maybe that's great 
Bed014.C.dialogueact364	892.266	892.616	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	did it did it that's great 
Bed014.A.dialogueact366	893.416	895.276	A	Grad	s	-1	0	once so maybe maybe it'll be a similar thing cool no i know i i i 
Bed014.B.dialogueact368	894.312	894.512	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	maybe it'll be a similar cool no i 
Bed014.C.dialogueact367	893.957	894.077	C	Professor	b	-1	0	once so maybe maybe it'll be a similar cool no i 
Bed014.C.dialogueact369	894.81	904.77	C	Professor	s	+1	1	maybe it'll be a similar thing cool no i know i i i think that is going to be sort of the key to this to the the the big project of the summer it's up to the getting instructions right 
Bed014.C.dialogueact370	905.11	909.513	C	Professor	s	+1	1	is that people to manage to do this so there probably 
Bed014.C.dialogueact371	909.513	914.523	C	Professor	s	+1	1	to do this so there probably are some uh well the flea clean rules they're just not 
Bed014.C.dialogueact372	914.523	916.413	C	Professor	s	-1	0	right rules they're just not context retreat and 
Bed014.A.dialogueact373	916.504	916.744	A	Grad	b	-1	0	right and 
Bed014.C.dialogueact374	916.818	926.34	C	Professor	s	-1	0	right and if we is the foremost him is is good then we should be able to have you know sort of martyr skill think that by the 
Bed014.C.dialogueact375	926.59	931.61	C	Professor	s	-1	0	think that by the waist is keep cute i curse george to be talking with you but not the formal 
Bed014.C.dialogueact376	931.61	932.84	C	Professor	s	-1	0	with you but not the formal isn't yet 
Bed014.A.dialogueact377	932.946	933.256	A	Grad	b	-1	0	isn't yet but the 
Bed014.C.dialogueact378	933.68	934.68	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but the phenomena

Bed014.C.dialogueact391	956.936	966.062	C	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	anyway uh that we that we're going to try to get a uh the first cut at the formulas formal by the end of next week 
Bed014.A.dialogueact393	967.579	967.819	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay probably 
Bed014.C.dialogueact392	967.08	967.48	C	Professor	s^f	-1	0	okay probably 
Bed014.C.dialogueact394	967.75	969.56	C	Professor	s	-1	0	right right okay probably skipping a mental spaces part 
Bed014.B.dialogueact395	968.712	968.902	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	skipping a mental spaces 
Bed014.A.dialogueact396	969.705	970.275	A	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	right right part uh 
Bed014.C.dialogueact397	970.79	978.61	C	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	uh just trying to write up essentially what what you guys have worked out so that everybody has something to look at we've talked 
Bed014.C.dialogueact398	978.61	984.38	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	no to look at we've talked about it but only the innermost inner group currently uh knows 
Bed014.A.dialogueact399	982.676	983.156	A	Grad	b	-1	0	no currently uh 
Bed014.A.dialogueact400	984.011	984.361	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	knows

Bed014.A.dialogueact410	995.48	995.75	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah right is is 
Bed014.C.dialogueact411	995.523	998.832	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	yeah right is is that it actually transfers from had had 
Bed014.B.dialogueact412	996.061	996.271	B	Grad	b	-1	0	that it 
Bed014.A.dialogueact414	999.073	999.313	A	Grad	b	-1	0	okay so

Bed014.B.dialogueact430	1018.48	1021.13	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i never actually got i said beginning but but but the two of us will probably talk to well before that i mean of next week 
Bed014.A.dialogueact432	1019.36	1020.23	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	actually got i said beginning but the two of us will probably talk to well before that 
Bed014.A.dialogueact434	1021.5	1021.85	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	i mean 
Bed014.B.dialogueact433	1021.13	1021.34	B	Grad	%--	-1	0	i mean 
Bed014.B.dialogueact435	1022.3	1024.33	B	Grad	s^cs.%-	-1	0	yeah i have a busy weekend about after that anyway let's talk separately about 
Bed014.A.dialogueact436	1023.16	1024.1	A	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah i have a busy weekend about after that separately about 
Bed014.A.dialogueact437	1024.1	1025.85	A	Grad	s	-1	0	about after that yeah gung 
Bed014.A.dialogueact438	1025.93	1026.43	A	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah gung ho okay yeah 
Bed014.C.dialogueact439	1026.42	1028.79	C	Professor	s^bk|s^cs	-1	0	ho okay yeah so so sometime sometime next week 
Bed014.A.dialogueact440	1029.02	1029.22	A	Grad	s^ba^bk	-1	0	now it turns out 
Bed014.C.dialogueact441	1029.1	1034.83	C	Professor	s	-1	0	now it turns out that that effort leads us into some big hole that's why 
Bed014.A.dialogueact442	1034.28	1034.53	A	Grad	b	-1	0	that's why 
Bed014.A.dialogueact443	1035.28	1035.5	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	you know just 
Bed014.C.dialogueact444	1035.72	1037.08	C	Professor	s^e:s	-1	0	you know just where where my symptoms 
Bed014.C.dialogueact445	1038.05	1039.17	C	Professor	s^e:s	-1	0	here's a really hard problem we have insulted that 
Bed014.C.dialogueact446	1039.17	1039.77	C	Professor	s^e:s	-1	0	we have insulted that 
Bed014.C.dialogueact447	1039.77	1040.91	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	okay we have insulted that that's just fine 
Bed014.A.dialogueact448	1040.76	1041.08	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay but that's just fine 
Bed014.B.dialogueact449	1041.13	1041.46	B	Grad	b	-1	0	but 
Bed014.A.dialogueact450	1042.04	1045.53	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and and we sort of try and work out what the state of the art is right now right it's it

Bed014.C.dialogueact453	1049.63	1052.12	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	okay and the extent we don't let's find out 
Bed014.A.dialogueact454	1051.57	1051.8	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bed014.C.dialogueact455	1054.06	1055.47	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	can be 
Bed014.E.dialogueact456	1055.64	1068.68	E	Grad	qy	-1	0	i think it is but can be it's the birth thinking of an except on a bar tourism thing mm domain that involves uh uh decent men so space shift or setting up 
Bed014.C.dialogueact457	1068.16	1068.97	C	Professor	s^na	-1	0	i think it is but or setting up

Bed014.A.dialogueact481	1119.38	1124.96	A	Grad	s	+1	1	the question is whether the construction is semantic or like ambiguous between asking for location and asking for past so you might be and asking for directions uh

Bed014.A.dialogueact488	1131.93	1134.72	A	Grad	s:s	+1	0	asking for location but pragmatically that's construed as meaning tell me how to get there yeah 
Bed014.C.dialogueact489	1134.03	1134.32	C	Professor	b	-1	0	me how to get there yeah 
Bed014.C.dialogueact491	1134.99	1135.15	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	me how to get there yeah assume these up to

Bed014.E.dialogueact495	1141.55	1143.86	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and stuff it's just too fall it's 
Bed014.E.dialogueact496	1144.28	1150.5	E	Grad	qy:qw	-1	0	if we encounter phrase such as where sex should that said this to too and it's so true and the base

Bed014.E.dialogueact499	1161.85	1165.0	E	Grad	s^e.%-	-1	0	oh i like off and the base it figures out whether that this actually no means 
Bed014.C.dialogueact500	1165.49	1166.46	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	oh i like okay so that's 
Bed014.B.dialogueact502	1166.78	1167.47	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	okay so that's a that's a separate 
Bed014.C.dialogueact501	1166.46	1168.71	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	okay so that's a that's a separate issue so 
Bed014.A.dialogueact503	1168.87	1169.13	A	Grad	b	-1	0	issue so i i i i 
Bed014.C.dialogueact504	1169.02	1182.46	C	Professor	s	+1	1	i i i i i agree with you that um it's a disaster to try to make separate construction for every uh pragmatic reading although

Bed014.A.dialogueact509	1187.71	1188.01	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right i mean 
Bed014.B.dialogueact510	1188.29	1188.55	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	i mean 
Bed014.C.dialogueact511	1188.89	1189.76	C	Professor	s^e.%-	-1	0	or have i mean there there's some that 
Bed014.B.dialogueact512	1189.74	1194.33	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	or have every construction list all the possible pragmatic implications of the same on right yeah there there's some that you can't do that either yeah but you know 
Bed014.C.dialogueact513	1193.42	1194.28	C	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	of the same on right yeah you can't do that either yeah but you know 
Bed014.B.dialogueact515	1194.33	1194.53	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	on right yeah yeah but you know 
Bed014.B.dialogueact516	1194.65	1194.84	B	Grad	b	-1	0	on right yeah yeah but you know 
Bed014.C.dialogueact514	1194.28	1194.45	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	on right yeah yeah but you know 
Bed014.C.dialogueact517	1194.74	1204.57	C	Professor	s.%-:s.%-	-1	0	so on right yeah request yeah but you know uh um almost certainly can you pass the salt is a construction worth noting that there is this this this this uh 
Bed014.A.dialogueact518	1198.89	1199.42	A	Grad	b	-1	0	is a construction worth 
Bed014.B.dialogueact519	1201.54	1202.09	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	request that there is this this this 
Bed014.A.dialogueact520	1202.27	1203.92	A	Grad	b	-1	0	this this this uh

Bed014.A.dialogueact522	1204.78	1206.74	A	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	so right this one is maybe in the gray area it what 
Bed014.A.dialogueact523	1206.74	1215.76	A	Grad	qrr	-1	0	the gray area it what is it like that or is it just sort of obvious from world knowledge that no one you wouldn't want another location without wanting to know how to get there 
Bed014.B.dialogueact525	1208.87	1209.21	B	Grad	b	-1	0	is it just sort of 
Bed014.C.dialogueact524	1208.62	1208.81	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	is it just sort of

Bed014.E.dialogueact527	1209.68	1211.31	E	Grad	%	-1	0	obvious from world knowledge that 
Bed014.E.dialogueact528	1216.15	1218.5	E	Grad	s	-1	0	in some cases it's it's quite the fifties so that 
Bed014.C.dialogueact529	1218.25	1218.76	C	Professor	b	-1	0	the fifties so that 
Bed014.E.dialogueact530	1218.5	1221.71	E	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah well the question is basically the fifties so that just don't want to know 
Bed014.A.dialogueact531	1220.44	1220.74	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	yeah know 
Bed014.A.dialogueact532	1221.26	1224.68	A	Grad	s	+1	3	well the question is basically is this conventional or conversational inspector exactly 
Bed014.C.dialogueact533	1224.17	1225.15	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	inspector exactly 
Bed014.B.dialogueact534	1226.44	1226.9	B	Grad	s^am	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed014.C.dialogueact535	1226.57	1233.24	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i guess the more important thing at this stage is that we should be able to know how we would handle it needs 
Bed014.C.dialogueact536	1234.03	1246.45	C	Professor	s	+1	0	okay right which is that is yeah okay which one is right there there'll be other can in the short run it's more important to know how we would treat technically what we do if we decided hey and what we do we decided be than it is to to decide air beaver right now 
Bed014.A.dialogueact538	1242.45	1243.09	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay right we decided be than it is to 
Bed014.B.dialogueact537	1242.36	1242.67	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay right we decided be 
Bed014.B.dialogueact539	1243.16	1243.37	B	Grad	b	-1	0	than it is to 
Bed014.A.dialogueact541	1244.9	1245.98	A	Grad	s^2|s^bk	-1	0	which is that is yeah okay which one is right to decide air beaver right 
Bed014.B.dialogueact540	1244.66	1245.31	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	which is that is yeah okay which one is right to decide air beaver right 
Bed014.E.dialogueact542	1245.59	1245.76	E	Grad	b	-1	0	is that is yeah okay right right 
Bed014.B.dialogueact543	1246.13	1249.05	B	Grad	s|s^bk	-1	0	there there'll be other can examples that are one way or the other now we we know for sure 
Bed014.C.dialogueact544	1247.93	1251.19	C	Professor	s^df	+1	2	examples that are one way or the other we we know for sure that we have to be able to do both i guess 
Bed014.A.dialogueact545	1248.84	1249.11	A	Grad	b	-1	0	way or the other we we know for sure 
Bed014.C.dialogueact546	1251.19	1258.12	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	okay i guess in the short run what's which you clear to run what the two alternatives would be 
Bed014.A.dialogueact547	1258.28	1258.64	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bed014.E.dialogueact548	1259.74	1265.91	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and then they read another idea floating around um which we wanted through or uh get your input on then 
Bed014.E.dialogueact549	1265.91	1267.67	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	your input on then that concerns the 
Bed014.E.dialogueact550	1269.31	1273.02	E	Grad	s	+1	0	the nice thing is we would have repressed that would back to work on it and that's you you reno

Bed014.E.dialogueact571	1354.7	1358.16	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and then this is we go via a thesaurus 
Bed014.E.dialogueact572	1359.54	1364.36	E	Grad	s	+1	0	and look cop certain degree stick surface structures that are related to these concepts and feed

Bed014.D.dialogueact594	1429.39	1433.27	D	Grad	s	-1	0	i mean because they the the third would know what nodes like needed to be activated so you just keep track 
Bed014.D.dialogueact595	1433.27	1439.06	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so you just keep track of how long it's been since something's been mentioned in automatically loaded and

Bed014.C.dialogueact597	1440.63	1441.59	C	Professor	s^am	-1	0	you could do that um

Bed014.C.dialogueact599	1445.46	1447.57	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	here's here's the way in 
Bed014.C.dialogueact600	1447.81	1464.62	C	Professor	s	+1	0	the way in the in the black base that you could you could think about it this way that um at the time and missions see was mentioned you could increase the probability that someone wanted to answer

Bed014.C.dialogueact604	1470.23	1470.86	C	Professor	s^ba|s^bk	-1	0	turned out okay but 
Bed014.C.dialogueact605	1470.86	1473.56	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	turned out okay but but in terms of cook the colonel imitation right 
Bed014.C.dialogueact606	1473.56	1473.82	C	Professor	s^f	-1	0	right 
Bed014.C.dialogueact607	1474.27	1475.17	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so that um

Bed014.B.dialogueact609	1477.11	1479.55	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	it was hard to be higher in uh context that that they they they

Bed014.C.dialogueact611	1482.23	1483.81	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so at the time you mentioned it 
Bed014.C.dialogueact612	1484.25	1489.07	C	Professor	s	-1	0	this is this is especially the base inadequate ones of the spreading activation is 
Bed014.A.dialogueact613	1486.94	1487.35	A	Grad	b	-1	0	ones of the spreading 
Bed014.A.dialogueact614	1489.06	1489.27	A	Grad	b	-1	0	is 
Bed014.C.dialogueact615	1489.07	1491.36	C	Professor	s	-1	0	is in some ways it's not as good but this 
Bed014.C.dialogueact616	1491.36	1493.15	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	yeah sure know as good but this in place we got we don't have a connection

Bed014.C.dialogueact620	1495.24	1505.65	C	Professor	s	-1	0	@reject@ relevant gosh yeah now now my guess is that it's not a question of time but he is he is a question of whether another intervening object has been mentioned 
Bed014.B.dialogueact621	1504.45	1505.45	B	Grad	fg|s^2	-1	0	relevant gosh yeah object has been mentioned 
Bed014.A.dialogueact624	1506.11	1506.37	A	Grad	b	-1	0	i mean you look at dial 
Bed014.B.dialogueact622	1505.81	1506.05	B	Grad	b	-1	0	gosh yeah mentioned i mean you look at dial 
Bed014.C.dialogueact623	1506.04	1507.05	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i mean you look at dial this is of course 
Bed014.C.dialogueact625	1507.05	1507.52	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	this is of course 
Bed014.C.dialogueact626	1507.84	1510.5	C	Professor	s	-1	0	this is of course the other thing we had we do is is we have the data coming which 
Bed014.A.dialogueact627	1511.09	1511.31	A	Grad	b	-1	0	probably will 
Bed014.C.dialogueact628	1511.14	1513.2	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah right probably will blow all our theories 
Bed014.A.dialogueact630	1513.3	1513.94	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah right 
Bed014.C.dialogueact629	1513.2	1514.77	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah right skipping that 
Bed014.C.dialogueact631	1515.12	1531.5	C	Professor	s	+1	0	up sell but my guess is what what will probably happen here's here's a to sign is that there are certain constructions which uh for our purposes do change the probabilities of you could decisions and various other kinds 
Bed014.C.dialogueact632	1532.07	1533.17	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	and 
Bed014.C.dialogueact633	1533.99	1541.22	C	Professor	s	+1	0	of that the standard waited that there's these context work is sort of stacked like or whatever but that sort of the 
Bed014.C.dialogueact634	1541.22	1543.65	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but that sort of the most recent thing 
Bed014.C.dialogueact635	1544.47	1552.21	C	Professor	s.%-	+1	0	new and so it could be that way and another uh and tourist entity gets mentioned you b.

Bed014.E.dialogueact660	1603.51	1622.84	E	Grad	fg|s:qw	-1	0	yeah i mean if if you're ask for much of the train ride and and some of them uh round the when you're it's costs and then so many times it's sixty daughters and then you say okay how much is uh i would like to is it the whatever something competed different and i go to your part trace 
Bed014.C.dialogueact661	1621.31	1621.55	C	Professor	b	-1	0	and i go to your 
Bed014.E.dialogueact662	1623.2	1626.07	E	Grad	s	-1	0	it it's not more like you that you want to enter anything but as of fact 
Bed014.E.dialogueact663	1626.07	1630.4	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so when you but as of fact complete compete rejection off entering 
Bed014.C.dialogueact664	1627.11	1627.28	C	Professor	b	-1	0	complete compete rejection

Bed014.B.dialogueact669	1635.81	1637.14	B	Grad	s^bu^e	-1	0	relational right is for that particular object yeah i did that yeah well i did a simple

Bed014.C.dialogueact671	1636.85	1637.07	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	that particular object i did that yeah well i did a simple 
Bed014.C.dialogueact672	1637.33	1644.46	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	well i did a simple idea is it's only it's only for them occurrence uh torso entity of instance interest

Bed014.E.dialogueact677	1646.64	1648.08	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i mean this this function so 
Bed014.E.dialogueact678	1648.89	1655.47	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	you know it's it's because the other day it just so has the current object being mentioned in in with a question about concerning it 
Bed014.C.dialogueact679	1653.89	1656.68	C	Professor	s^ar|s	-1	0	you know it's it's because the other day it just in that direction is with a question about concerning it

Bed014.D.dialogueact686	1671.36	1678.23	D	Grad	s^cs:s	-1	0	no i but i think what robertson you get is that i just basically that that observed and heard it's that's the uh noted for in turn true or something discourse enter

Bed014.C.dialogueact689	1677.7	1686.77	C	Professor	fg|s	+1	0	no i but i think what robertson right that to determine that okay you may well want to go through is the stars and and in turn true or something discourse enter 
Bed014.D.dialogueact690	1678.41	1679.29	D	Grad	s^e	-1	0	i but i think what robertson right discourse enter 
Bed014.C.dialogueact691	1686.77	1687.28	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	the stars and and so if 
Bed014.C.dialogueact692	1687.53	1702.27	C	Professor	fg|s:qy	+1	0	so so if the issue is if saddam just because this construction been matched you say okay does this actually have any implications for our decisions then there's another piece of code that presumably does that competition 
Bed014.B.dialogueact693	1702.94	1706.22	B	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	so sort of for retaining in a way rather than back yeah

Bed014.E.dialogueact705	1734.42	1734.72	E	Grad	b	-1	0	do it

Bed014.B.dialogueact1150	2516.66	2517.02	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah it's good for you in uh or for 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1151	2518.19	2522.08	C	Professor	fg|s^cs	-1	0	anyway i so let's let's for the moment call it that it we think of something better and yeah 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1152	2521.84	2522.04	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	we think of something better and yeah 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1153	2522.51	2525.25	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and yeah we absolutely need to find part of what was missing 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1154	2525.33	2529.36	C	Professor	s	+1	0	part of what was missing were markings of all sorts that weren't in there including including 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1155	2529.52	2530.97	C	Professor	s^e	+1	1	in there including including the questions we 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1157	2531.45	2531.72	A	Grad	b	-1	0	didn't we never did forgot 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1156	2530.97	2538.39	C	Professor	s	+1	1	yeah we've talked a little bit about the questions we didn't we never did forgot how we're going to do emphasis and and uh the sam's speck 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1158	2534.04	2534.21	A	Grad	b	-1	0	and 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1159	2537.67	2540.17	B	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	yeah we've talked a little bit about that too which i the sam's speck 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1160	2540.17	2540.47	B	Grad	%--	-1	0	which i 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1161	2540.98	2546.72	B	Grad	s	-1	0	which i it's hard for me to figure out that's our general linguistic issues how they map onto this particular one but 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1163	2547.17	2547.47	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	okay 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1162	2546.72	2546.92	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	particular one but 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1164	2547.85	2548.95	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay but that's 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1165	2548.77	2550.14	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but that's part of the formal as it's got to be 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1166	2550.14	2553.94	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it's got to be um how things like that get mark 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1167	2554.18	2554.46	A	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed014.B.dialogueact1168	2555.19	2559.31	B	Grad	qy	-1	0	do you have data like that uh you have preliminary data because i know you know we've 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1169	2559.31	2561.84	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	data because i know you know we've been using this one easy sentence 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1170	2562.29	2565.9	B	Grad	s	-1	0	um i and i'm sure you guys have a maybe you're the one you've been looking at the rest of it be 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1171	2565.18	2566.04	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	um i the rest of it be unusual for me if we 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1172	2565.9	2570.26	B	Grad	s	-1	0	um i to tell you the truth of what i've been looking at has not been the data so far the rest of it be unusual for me if we want to have a little bit more 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1173	2568.18	2571.14	A	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	to tell you the truth of what i've been looking at has not been the data so far has sort of set sorry let's see if a little bit more 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1174	2573.22	2573.5	B	Grad	b	-1	0	and 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1175	2576.45	2577.38	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uh constructions out of the way first 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1176	2578.21	2580.05	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and i have not gotten away yet surprise so um yeah 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1177	2578.33	2578.51	B	Grad	b	-1	0	and i have not gotten 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1178	2580.05	2580.54	A	Grad	s^j	-1	0	surprise so um yeah 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1179	2580.54	2581.36	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	surprise so um so yeah 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1180	2580.6	2580.79	B	Grad	b	-1	0	surprise so um yeah 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1181	2582.01	2584.56	A	Grad	s	-1	0	i have not really approach a lot of the data but i mean 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1182	2584.56	2587.38	A	Grad	s	-1	0	of the data but i mean obviously like these be the question ones since we have this 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1183	2587.38	2594.92	A	Grad	s	+1	1	ones since we have this idea about the indefinite pronouns thing and all that you know i can can try and um run with that you 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1184	2594.92	2596.95	A	Grad	s	+1	0	with that you know try and do some of the question constructions now can 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1186	2596.95	2597.78	A	Grad	s	-1	0	constructions now would make sense can you run around the indefinite 
Bed014.E.dialogueact1185	2596.92	2599.79	E	Grad	fg|qy^cs^rt	+1	0	constructions now would make sense can you run around the indefinite putting on idea past scary 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1187	2597.53	2597.93	B	Grad	b	-1	0	would make sense you run around the indefinite 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1188	2600.36	2602.0	A	Grad	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	oh yeah the basic idea is that um 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1189	2602.0	2604.51	A	Grad	fh|%--	-1	0	um uh you know uh see 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1190	2604.67	2606.85	A	Grad	s	-1	0	know uh see if i can afford it like this so we're married fixed the car 
Bed014.E.dialogueact1191	2605.47	2607.92	E	Grad	s:s	-1	0	if i can afford it like this so we're married fixed the car with a wrench 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1192	2607.85	2608.14	A	Grad	b	-1	0	with a wrench so you 
Bed014.E.dialogueact1193	2608.67	2610.1	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so you fundamentals and then you 
Bed014.E.dialogueact1194	2610.5	2612.56	E	Grad	s:qw	+1	0	and then you fix the car with a wrench 
Bed014.E.dialogueact1195	2613.14	2615.87	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	you basically are told to to do this 
Bed014.E.dialogueact1196	2617.14	2621.88	E	Grad	s^e	+1	0	and and i guess the two the way you would do with someone picks the car with a wrench 
Bed014.E.dialogueact1197	2622.37	2624.45	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and then you hand it back to your hip campus and find 
Bed014.E.dialogueact1198	2624.45	2626.92	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and find out what that 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1199	2627.14	2627.52	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	means means 
Bed014.E.dialogueact1200	2627.69	2628.02	E	Grad	s^aa^m	-1	0	means means and then come up 
Bed014.E.dialogueact1201	2628.02	2630.51	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	the w. h. and then come up with that somewhere that someone was 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1202	2630.47	2635.55	A	Grad	s:s	+1	1	the w. h. question has this sort of extra thing which has and when you're done tell me who feels that slaughter way you know so someone was 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1203	2635.03	2635.46	C	Professor	b	-1	0	way you know so 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1204	2635.66	2636.37	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	way you know so um 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1205	2637.44	2639.69	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and you know this is sort of a a nice way to do it the idea 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1206	2639.69	2648.09	A	Grad	s	+1	1	nice way to do it the idea sort of saying that you could read from the simulation point of view or whatever you could read uh w. h. construction similarly to uh and indefinite pronouns like someone or like the cars 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1207	2648.09	2649.18	A	Grad	s:s	-1	0	like someone or like the cars in because

Bed014.C.dialogueact1230	2672.8	2676.41	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	right now of course that's right it it that that the locations of of 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1231	2676.63	2677.05	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	that's right it makes sense come up with that 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1233	2677.62	2679.69	A	Grad	s	-1	0	it makes sense from that point of view too which is actually better so yeah come up with that 
Bed014.E.dialogueact1232	2677.21	2678.0	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	it makes sense from that point of view too which come up with that 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1234	2679.69	2680.84	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	is actually better so yeah um 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1235	2681.75	2683.04	A	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	anyway but just that kind of thing and will figure out exactly how 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1236	2683.04	2685.23	A	Grad	s^cc	+1	1	and will figure out exactly how to write that up and so on but 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1237	2685.23	2685.43	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	on but 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1238	2685.23	2685.42	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	on but 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1239	2692.27	2693.63	A	Grad	s	+1	1	i know all the focus stuff of 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1240	2693.86	2695.08	A	Grad	s	-1	0	stuff of just dropped that because it was too weird 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1241	2695.08	2696.14	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because it was too weird and we didn't even know like 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1242	2696.14	2698.57	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and we didn't even know like what we were talking about exactly what topic 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1243	2698.57	2699.64	A	Grad	s	-1	0	exactly what topic just anyways yeah 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1244	2698.71	2699.11	B	Grad	b	-1	0	exactly what topic just anyways yeah 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1245	2699.64	2699.75	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	just anyways yeah 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1246	2699.8	2707.6	C	Professor	s:qw	+1	1	just anyways yeah well it it's it i mean it part of of what the exercise is to buy yet like actually say what are the things that we just don't have answers for yet 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1247	2706.12	2706.36	A	Grad	b	-1	0	that we just don't have answers 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1249	2708.71	2708.9	A	Grad	b	-1	0	that's fine i mean 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1248	2708.39	2708.75	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	that's fine i mean 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1250	2708.75	2708.96	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	that's fine i mean

Bed014.E.dialogueact1252	2709.96	2718.19	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	well if you if you want to discuss focus background and then get me into that because i know i've 
Bed014.E.dialogueact1253	2718.24	2722.77	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	yeah okay because i know i've sent it to be worked on that for for almost two years 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1254	2721.05	2721.45	A	Grad	b	-1	0	for for 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1255	2722.87	2724.49	A	Grad	s^bk|s^na	-1	0	okay and certainly well good yeah you should definitely almost two years

Bed014.B.dialogueact1256	2724.31	2727.02	B	Grad	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	well good yeah you should definitely um you know not maybe maybe but after 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1258	2727.02	2731.39	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	yeah we we should figure out what our questions maybe maybe but after monday well you could see what things we aren't aren't 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1259	2730.6	2733.98	A	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	yeah we we should figure out what our questions are for example to ask you we aren't aren't yeah 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1260	2732.37	2733.41	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	are for example to ask you yeah

Bed014.B.dialogueact1277	2760.52	2765.79	B	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah like it didn't mean i mean he sort of i think the last name had i think we are all very much part of it 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1278	2764.27	2764.68	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah very much 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1279	2766.27	2767.32	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	sometimes hans has been sort of coming but 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1280	2766.94	2771.65	A	Grad	s^rt	+1	1	sometimes hans has been sort of coming in there is sort of like a devil's advocate type role or something like but different person yeah 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1281	2769.29	2770.58	B	Grad	s.%-	+1	1	like a devil's advocate type different person yeah

Bed014.A.dialogueact1283	2771.71	2775.02	A	Grad	s^rt:s^rt	-1	0	role or something like this make you know i'm going to pretend i'm a linguist has nothing to do with this this makes no sense 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1284	2775.14	2776.08	A	Grad	s:s^ba	-1	0	this makes no sense in i'll just go off on parts 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1285	2776.08	2778.98	A	Grad	s	+1	0	in i'll just go off on parts of it which definitely need fixing but 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1286	2776.98	2777.39	B	Grad	b	-1	0	in i'll just go off on parts of it which definitely 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1287	2778.98	2780.32	A	Grad	s	-1	0	need fixing but our where we're at right now so it's like like what you call 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1289	2780.32	2780.69	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	now so it's like like what you call 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1288	2780.21	2781.83	B	Grad	s	-1	0	now so it's like like what you call certain things which 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1291	2782.22	2782.48	A	Grad	b	-1	0	read aside longer 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1290	2781.83	2784.63	B	Grad	s	-1	0	certain things which read aside longer we don't care that much right now but right okay 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1292	2783.85	2784.07	C	Professor	b	-1	0	we don't care that much right now but right okay 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1294	2784.9	2787.84	B	Grad	s^ba^bd.%--	-1	0	right now but in a sense is good to know that he of all people you know okay 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1293	2784.84	2785.07	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	right now but in a sense is good to know okay 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1295	2787.84	2790.35	B	Grad	s^ba^bd^e	-1	0	of all people you know like maybe la people wouldn't um much must stronger reaction so you 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1296	2790.35	2792.91	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	so you know he's like uh real sweet family linguist and 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1297	2790.97	2791.2	A	Grad	b	-1	0	so you know he's like uh real sweet 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1299	2793.19	2793.44	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yet 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1298	2792.91	2796.03	B	Grad	s	-1	0	family linguist and yet word like constraints cause a lot probably okay 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1300	2796.72	2798.03	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	okay this is consistent 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1301	2796.98	2808.07	C	Professor	s^bk|s	+1	0	okay this is consistent with um the role i had suggested that he he play okay 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1302	2807.02	2807.27	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	play 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1303	2808.07	2808.49	A	Grad	b	-1	0	okay 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1304	2808.64	2821.02	C	Professor	s^f|s	+1	0	okay which wise one of the things i would like to see happen he is a paper that was tentatively called towards a formal cognitive semantics which was 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1305	2821.69	2830.39	C	Professor	s	+1	0	which was addressed to these linguist uh who haven't been falling stuff at all so 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1306	2830.63	2830.84	A	Grad	b	-1	0	all so 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1307	2830.83	2838.11	C	Professor	s	+1	0	all so it could be that he's actually at some level thinking about how am i going to communicate this story 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1308	2833.6	2833.85	A	Grad	b	-1	0	at some level 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1309	2838.14	2838.49	A	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed014.C.dialogueact1310	2839.06	2842.94	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so intimately we should just do whatever works 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1311	2841.96	2842.25	A	Grad	b	-1	0	whatever works 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1312	2842.94	2843.87	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	whatever works is hard enough 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1313	2843.9	2844.18	A	Grad	b	-1	0	is hard enough but 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1314	2844.58	2869.31	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uhhuh but if he get he turn is really going to turn around and help to write this version that does connected with as many as possible of the other linguists in the world then it becomes important too use terminology that doesn't it make it hard it's going to be 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1316	2849.89	2850.17	A	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh this version that does 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1315	2849.49	2849.96	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh this version that 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1317	2856.17	2856.31	A	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed014.A.dialogueact1318	2866.3	2866.54	A	Grad	b	-1	0	doesn't 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1319	2866.3	2867.29	B	Grad	b	-1	0	doesn't it 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1320	2869.31	2873.53	C	Professor	s^bd^df	-1	0	it's going to be plenty hard for for people to understand it is it is but 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1322	2873.86	2874.1	A	Grad	b	-1	0	it is it is but you don't want 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1321	2873.53	2875.64	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah it is it is but you don't want to make it worse 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1323	2875.85	2876.16	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah no right i to make it worse 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1325	2876.59	2879.94	A	Grad	s^aa|s^ba	-1	0	no right i mean that that role is is uh indispensable but 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1324	2876.52	2876.76	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	no right i 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1326	2879.94	2883.34	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	indispensable but that's not where serve for our heads were at in these meetings is a little strange right yeah yeah no that's fine 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1327	2881.92	2882.12	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	serve for our heads were at in these meetings right 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1329	2883.34	2884.08	A	Grad	s	-1	0	is a little strange yeah yeah no that's fine i just wanted to do 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1328	2883.3	2884.04	C	Professor	fg|s^ba	-1	0	is a little strange yeah yeah no that's fine i just wanted to do 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1330	2884.04	2885.11	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i just wanted to do 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1331	2886.61	2889.77	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i have to catch up with him and i wanted to to get a feeling for that okay 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1332	2888.12	2888.46	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	to to get a feeling for 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1333	2888.61	2889.04	B	Grad	b	-1	0	to to get a feeling for that okay 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1334	2890.41	2893.49	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so i don't know what his take will be on these meetings exactly you know okay 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1335	2893.32	2895.97	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	you know um sometimes okay 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1336	2895.9	2898.92	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	sometimes it sort of sounds like we're talking about travel to cook from his point of view i think it's going to wear when we're into 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1337	2896.17	2897.2	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	it sort of sounds like we're talking about travel to cook i think it's going to wear 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1338	2898.38	2906.05	B	Grad	s	+1	0	from his point of view when we're into date and looking at the some specific linguistic phenomena and in english one german particular differs that's great in bed and and hans 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1339	2901.81	2901.94	C	Professor	b	-1	0	linguistic phenomena 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1340	2904.18	2904.46	A	Grad	b	-1	0	particular differs 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1341	2906.05	2911.69	B	Grad	s	-1	0	in bed and and hans are if if anything more you know they have more say than i'd say i would about some of these things but 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1342	2911.12	2911.31	C	Professor	b	-1	0	some of these things but 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1343	2912.1	2919.18	B	Grad	s.%-:qh	+1	0	when it's like well how do we capture these things you know i think it's definitely been keep an eye movement and you know what we're talking about the sufficiently well that's good that's that i i think that should 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1345	2917.82	2918.28	A	Grad	b	-1	0	and you know what we're talking about the well that's good that's that i 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1344	2917.72	2922.48	C	Professor	s^ba|s	-1	0	and you know what we're talking about the sufficiently well that's good that's that i i think that should be the the core group and 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1346	2919.73	2920.44	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	sufficiently i think that should be the 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1347	2920.91	2921.2	A	Grad	b	-1	0	be the the core

Bed014.C.dialogueact1350	2925.1	2931.78	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah yes that we actually you know i think very close the maximum number of people working together they can get something done 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1351	2930.37	2930.59	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah yes working together they can 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1352	2930.42	2930.65	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah yes working together they can 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1353	2931.42	2933.65	B	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	that we actually have i think we have been making progress and @reject@ get something done i

Bed014.B.dialogueact1357	2935.03	2935.63	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	got the impression yeah 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1359	2936.3	2936.61	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	that's great

Bed014.C.dialogueact1363	2942.46	2946.21	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it well but well that that that would then we could come back to the bigger 
Bed014.A.dialogueact1365	2946.94	2947.21	A	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed014.B.dialogueact1364	2946.8	2946.99	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed014.C.dialogueact1366	2947.25	2949.93	C	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	right and then we're we're going to because 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1367	2950.0	2954.12	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	this other big thing we talked about is actually implementing this stuff 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1368	2955.36	2957.37	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah we could talk tomorrow i was just so i guess the three of us are connected more but 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1369	2956.57	2957.48	B	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah we could talk tomorrow i was just us are connected more but 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1370	2957.76	2967.87	B	Grad	s:qh	+1	0	tomorrow i was just going to say that for instance there was you know out of a meeting which i know came the suggestion though could it be that uh meaning constraints really aren't you for selection but you but 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1371	2967.87	2971.12	B	Grad	s	+1	0	you for selection but you sort of been implicit in the parking tried to talk about in which case 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1372	2970.49	2970.72	C	Professor	b	-1	0	tried to talk about 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1373	2971.42	2974.54	B	Grad	s	-1	0	in which case we we could just say that they're the effects or the findings which 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1374	2974.93	2987.23	B	Grad	s	+1	1	findings which so far in terms of like in putting up all the constraints as you know pushing image type constraint the when i use pro then froze it's a linguist who have and you give me you know we haven't yet thought of reading like that wouldn't work right 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1375	2987.78	2991.15	B	Grad	s^f|s^e	+1	1	right as long as we allow our taken seems to be reasonably complex so well it 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1376	2990.89	2991.36	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	complex so well it 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1377	2991.87	2993.93	B	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	so anyway to talk about later it yeah it has to in the sense 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1378	2992.6	2998.38	C	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	anyway to talk about later yeah it has to in the sense that you're going to use them eventually to you know 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1379	2998.38	3003.21	C	Professor	s	-1	0	to you know it's sort of a uh um generating test kind of thing and if you over 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1380	3002.51	3003.37	B	Grad	b	-1	0	kind of thing and if you over 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1381	3003.21	3006.16	C	Professor	s	+1	0	and if you over generate then you have to do more and if it's 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1382	3006.16	3015.01	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uhhuh actually and if it's time constraints that you pulled back and don't use uh in your initial matching annual you and things i mean 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1383	3012.17	3013.17	B	Grad	b	-1	0	actually matching annual 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1384	3015.49	3018.65	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean i i don't think there's any way that he could completely failed it could 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1385	3018.65	3021.9	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	failed it could be that uh you wine got married 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1386	3021.9	3022.18	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	you wine got married 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1387	3023.46	3031.41	C	Professor	s	-1	0	do still bad idea of purely context free grammar is dieting be because it just vastly too many parts is 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1388	3032.1	3034.58	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	you know exponentially numb them many purses 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1389	3035.07	3039.85	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	that and so that the concern might be the and that would totally feel that that 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1390	3036.8	3037.07	B	Grad	b	-1	0	might be the and that would totally 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1391	3038.53	3038.85	B	Grad	b	-1	0	feel 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1392	3039.97	3041.74	B	Grad	s^2|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	that would still generate too many rights so by that that it was okay 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1394	3041.74	3048.45	B	Grad	s|qy^d^g	-1	0	many rights so by just having samantha even bring semantics in for matching chest uniform if semantic types right like can it was okay 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1393	3041.31	3042.09	C	Professor	s^m^na.%-	-1	0	many rights so by just having it was okay 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1395	3048.45	3053.76	B	Grad	s	-1	0	right like can actually be you have to be construed as this is and this might still give this quite a few possibilities we don't 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1396	3051.27	3051.49	C	Professor	b	-1	0	this might still 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1398	3054.14	3056.74	B	Grad	s	-1	0	that you know and and and it certainly helps a lot know but 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1397	3053.77	3054.24	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	that you know and and and we don't know but 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1399	3054.24	3054.75	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	that you know and and and know but 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1400	3056.74	3057.84	B	Grad	s	-1	0	helps a lot that way soon no question yeah 
Bed014.B.dialogueact1402	3057.84	3058.08	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	that way soon no question yeah i think it's a it's 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1401	3057.36	3058.13	C	Professor	s^na|s^aa	-1	0	that way soon no question yeah i think it's a it's 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1403	3058.13	3061.0	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i think it's a it's a perfectly fine place to start you know and say 
Bed014.C.dialogueact1404	3061.6	3064.68	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you know and say let let's see how far we can go this way

Bed014.C.dialogueact1406	3066.23	3067.84	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	what
