Bed004.D.dialogueact44	314.773	320.643	D	Grad	z	-1	0	and so we decided to have a contest where those people who claim to make good tiramisu make them ,
Bed004.A.dialogueact45	316.32	316.69	A	Grad	z	-1	0	Ah .
Bed004.D.dialogueact46	320.643	327.83	D	Grad	z	-1	0	and then we got a panel of impartial judges that will taste {disfmarker} do a blind taste {vocalsound} and then vote .

Bed004.A.dialogueact50	338.57	343.62	A	Grad	z	-1	0	Seems like you could put a s magic special ingredient in , so that everyone know which one was yours .
Bed004.A.dialogueact51	344.19	347.06	A	Grad	z	-1	0	Then , if you were to bribe them , you could uh {disfmarker}

Bed004.D.dialogueact88	497.825	507.864	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	so I asked uh Litonya . just on the spur of the moment , and she was uh kind enough to uh serve as the first subject .
Bed004.B.dialogueact89	501.488	501.848	B	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.D.dialogueact90	508.314	513.074	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	So , this is what she saw as part of {disfmarker} as uh for instr introduction ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact91	513.644	515.804	D	Grad	s	+1	1	this is what she had to read {pause} aloud .

Bed004.D.dialogueact97	537.327	542.383	D	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and um then of course the system broke down ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact98	542.383	546.327	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and those were the l uh uh
Bed004.D.dialogueact99	546.327	553.057	D	Grad	s^rt	+1	1	I should say the system was supposed to break down and then um these were the remaining three tasks that she was going to solve , with a human {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact100	554.283	554.803	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um .

Bed004.D.dialogueact132	631.253	637.463	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Because she was actually {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} there was some uh lapse in the um wireless ,

Bed004.C.dialogueact156	923.278	924.068	C	Grad	s	-1	0	Oh , it 's surprising .
Bed004.D.dialogueact155	923.196	925.316	D	Grad	s^rt	+1	0	She {disfmarker} she jumped around quite a bit .
Bed004.B.dialogueact157	925.15	927.29	B	Professor	s^bu.%--	+1	2	S so if you just number them " one " , " two " , " three " it 's
Bed004.D.dialogueact158	928.852	931.052	D	Grad	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah , and make it sort of clear in the uh {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact159	929.39	929.63	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed004.B.dialogueact160	931.432	931.642	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.D.dialogueact161	931.653	933.623	D	Grad	fh|s^rt	-1	0	Um . We need to {disfmarker} So that 's one thing .
Bed004.D.dialogueact162	934.083	936.543	D	Grad	fh|s^cs^rt	-1	0	And we need a better introduction for the wizard .
Bed004.D.dialogueact163	936.543	943.023	D	Grad	s	+1	0	That is something that Fey actually thought of a {disfmarker} in the last second that sh the system should introduce itself , when it 's called .
Bed004.B.dialogueact164	941.958	942.308	B	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.B.dialogueact165	943.02	943.26	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	True .
Bed004.D.dialogueact166	944.24	954.14	D	Grad	fg|s^cs	+1	0	And um , um , another suggestion , by Liz , was that we uh , through subjects , switch the tasks .
Bed004.D.dialogueact167	954.14	960.88	D	Grad	s^e^rt	+1	0	So when {disfmarker} when they have task - one with the computer , the next person should have task - one with a human , and so forth .
Bed004.B.dialogueact168	961.086	961.526	B	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.D.dialogueact169	961.35	963.66	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	So we get nice um data for that .
Bed004.D.dialogueact170	964.36	972.51	D	Grad	fh|s^cs	+1	1	Um , we have to refine the tasks more and more , which of course we haven't done at all , so far , in order to avoid this rephrasing ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact171	972.51	977.5	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so where , even though w we don't tell the person " ask {pause} blah - blah - blah - blah - blah "
Bed004.D.dialogueact172	978.04	984.32	D	Grad	s	-1	0	they still try , or at least Litonya tried to um repeat as much of that text as possible .
Bed004.C.dialogueact173	981.12	982.18	C	Grad	qy^2^rt	-1	0	Say exactly what 's on there ?
Bed004.C.dialogueact174	982.18	982.62	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.D.dialogueact175	986.06	991.27	D	Grad	s^cs^rt	+1	2	And uh my suggestion is of course we {disfmarker} we keep the wizard , because I think she did a wonderful job ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact176	991.424	991.614	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Great .
Bed004.D.dialogueact177	991.7	997.1	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	in the sense that she responded quite nicely to things that were not asked for ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact178	997.1	999.51	D	Grad	qw	-1	0	" How much is a t a bus ticket and a transfer "
Bed004.D.dialogueact179	999.68	1003.24	D	Grad	fh|s^rt	-1	0	so this is gonna happen all the time , we d you can never be sure .
Bed004.B.dialogueact180	1002.36	1002.9	B	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.D.dialogueact181	1003.78	1008.58	D	Grad	fh|s^rt	-1	0	Um . Johno pointed out that uh we have maybe a grammatical gender problem there with wizard .
Bed004.A.dialogueact183	1009.58	1009.97	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bed004.D.dialogueact182	1009.49	1011.04	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	So um .
Bed004.A.dialogueact184	1010.24	1015.15	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I wasn't {disfmarker} wasn't sure whether wizard was the correct term for {pause} uh " not a man " .
Bed004.C.dialogueact186	1018.15	1019.69	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	There 's no female equivalent of {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact185	1018.0	1018.71	D	Grad	fg	-1	0	But uh {disfmarker}
Bed004.A.dialogueact187	1021.08	1021.52	A	Grad	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	Are you sure ?
Bed004.C.dialogueact188	1022.04	1023.09	C	Grad	s^no	-1	0	No , I don't know .
Bed004.B.dialogueact190	1023.45	1023.66	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.C.dialogueact189	1023.28	1024.1	C	Grad	s^no	-1	0	Not that I know of .
Bed004.D.dialogueact191	1023.89	1025.35	D	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , there is witch and warlock ,
Bed004.A.dialogueact194	1025.45	1025.97	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	Yeah , that 's so @ @ .
Bed004.B.dialogueact195	1025.75	1026.09	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.C.dialogueact193	1025.39	1026.68	C	Grad	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah , that 's what I was thinking , but {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact192	1025.35	1026.11	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	and uh {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact196	1026.98	1027.21	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.B.dialogueact198	1028.56	1029.0	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Uh .
Bed004.D.dialogueact197	1028.52	1028.85	D	Grad	fg	-1	0	OK .
Bed004.D.dialogueact199	1030.32	1031.54	D	Grad	fg	-1	0	And um {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact200	1032.84	1036.57	D	Grad	fh|s.%--	-1	0	So , some {disfmarker} some work needs to be done , but I think we can uh {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact201	1036.85	1050.87	D	Grad	s	-1	0	And this , and {disfmarker} in case no {disfmarker} you hadn't seen it , this is what Litonya looked at during the uh {disfmarker} um while taking the {disfmarker} while partaking in the data collection .
Bed004.C.dialogueact202	1043.11	1043.54	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Ah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact203	1052.32	1052.64	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	OK ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact204	1052.64	1052.95	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	great .
Bed004.B.dialogueact205	1054.15	1063.63	B	Professor	fh|s^t	-1	0	So {pause} first of all , I agree that um we should hire Fey , and start paying her .
Bed004.B.dialogueact206	1063.62	1065.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Probably pay for the time she 's put in as well .
Bed004.B.dialogueact207	1066.44	1069.82	B	Professor	fh|qy	-1	0	Um , do you know exactly how to do that ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact208	1069.83	1071.44	B	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	or is uh Lila {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact209	1071.43	1075.79	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	I mean , you know what exactly do we do to {disfmarker} to put her on the payroll in some way ?
Bed004.D.dialogueact210	1076.59	1079.26	D	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	I 'm completely clueless , but I 'm willing to learn .
Bed004.B.dialogueact211	1077.81	1078.1	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed004.B.dialogueact212	1078.86	1079.51	B	Professor	s^co.%--	-1	0	Well , you 'll have to .
Bed004.B.dialogueact213	1079.51	1079.75	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.B.dialogueact214	1080.07	1080.45	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So anyway ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact216	1080.76	1081.46	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um
Bed004.D.dialogueact215	1080.6	1080.9	D	Grad	%	-1	0	N
Bed004.B.dialogueact217	1082.45	1084.71	B	Professor	qh^co	-1	0	So why don't you uh ask Lila
Bed004.B.dialogueact218	1085.62	1090.56	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	and see what she says about you know exactly what we do for someone in
Bed004.B.dialogueact220	1092.98	1093.36	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	th
Bed004.D.dialogueact219	1092.83	1094.02	D	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Student - type worker ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact222	1094.16	1096.63	B	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	Well , yeah she 's un she 's not a {disfmarker} a student ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact221	1094.02	1094.05	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bed004.B.dialogueact223	1096.63	1097.85	B	Professor	s	-1	0	she just graduated
Bed004.B.dialogueact224	1097.85	1099.28	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but anyway .
Bed004.D.dialogueact225	1099.56	1100.18	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bed004.B.dialogueact226	1100.3	1101.04	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	So i if {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact227	1101.14	1101.66	B	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	Yeah , I agree ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact228	1101.66	1102.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	she sounded fine ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact229	1102.51	1113.07	B	Professor	s	-1	0	she a actually was {pause} uh , more uh , present and stuff than {disfmarker} than she was in conversation ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact230	1113.07	1117.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so she did a better job than I would have guessed from just talking to her .
Bed004.D.dialogueact231	1116.31	1116.52	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact232	1117.51	1118.2	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	So I think that 's great .
Bed004.D.dialogueact233	1118.24	1123.06	D	Grad	s	-1	0	This is sort of what I gave her , so this is for example h how to get to the student prison ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact234	1123.23	1123.45	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.D.dialogueact235	1123.68	1125.61	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and I didn't even spell it out here
Bed004.D.dialogueact236	1125.88	1131.11	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and in some cases I {disfmarker} I spelled it out a little bit um more thoroughly ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact237	1129.41	1129.61	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.D.dialogueact238	1131.11	1136.53	D	Grad	s	-1	0	this is the information on {disfmarker} on the low sunken castle , and the amphitheater that never came up ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact239	1137.09	1145.91	D	Grad	fh|s^cs	-1	0	and um , so i if we give her even more um , instruments to work with I think the results are gonna be even better .
Bed004.B.dialogueact240	1145.47	1145.72	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Oh , yeah ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact241	1145.72	1147.48	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then of course as she does it she 'll {disfmarker} she 'll learn @ @ .
Bed004.B.dialogueact242	1147.47	1147.9	B	Professor	%	-1	0	
Bed004.B.dialogueact243	1147.87	1148.35	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	So that 's great .
Bed004.B.dialogueact244	1149.44	1160.67	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	Um {pause} And also if she 's willing to take on the job of organizing all those subjects and stuff that would be wonderful .
Bed004.D.dialogueact245	1161.01	1161.27	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed004.B.dialogueact246	1161.69	1167.45	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	And , uh she 's {disfmarker} actually she 's going to graduate school in a kind of an experimental paradigm ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact247	1167.45	1175.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so I think this is all just fine in terms of h her learning things she 's gonna need to know uh , to do her career .
Bed004.D.dialogueact248	1171.32	1171.79	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed004.B.dialogueact249	1176.85	1181.72	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So , I {disfmarker} my guess is she 'll be r r quite happy to take on that job .
Bed004.B.dialogueact250	1182.61	1183.26	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	And , so {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact251	1182.93	1183.14	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bed004.D.dialogueact252	1183.43	1186.7	D	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah she {disfmarker} she didn't explicitly state that
Bed004.D.dialogueact253	1186.7	1186.96	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	so .
Bed004.B.dialogueact254	1187.31	1187.44	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Great .
Bed004.D.dialogueact255	1187.33	1197.82	D	Grad	fh|s	+1	0	And um I told her that we gonna um figure out a meeting time in the near future to refine the tasks and s look for the potential sources to find people .
Bed004.D.dialogueact256	1198.43	1204.11	D	Grad	s	+1	1	She also agrees that you know if it 's all just gonna be students the data is gonna be less valuable because of that
Bed004.D.dialogueact257	1204.11	1204.32	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	so .
Bed004.B.dialogueact258	1205.07	1207.85	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	Well , as I say there is this s set of people next door , it 's not hard to
Bed004.D.dialogueact259	1205.15	1205.54	D	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	We 're already {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact260	1208.12	1208.34	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact261	1209.17	1209.43	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact262	1209.18	1211.73	D	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	However , we may run into a problem with a reading task there .
Bed004.D.dialogueact263	1213.57	1214.91	D	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	And um , we 'll see .
Bed004.B.dialogueact264	1215.19	1215.44	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact265	1215.44	1228.57	B	Professor	s^cs^rt	+1	0	We could talk to the people who run it and um see if they have a way that they could easily uh tell people that there 's a task , pays ten bucks or something ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact266	1218.96	1219.9	D	Grad	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.D.dialogueact267	1219.9	1220.04	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact268	1228.57	1234.48	B	Professor	fh|s^e	+1	0	but um you have to be comfortable reading relatively complicated stuff .
Bed004.B.dialogueact269	1234.48	1237.28	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and there 'll probably be self - selection to some extent .
Bed004.D.dialogueact270	1234.77	1235.39	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed004.D.dialogueact271	1237.48	1237.58	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bed004.B.dialogueact272	1240.57	1242.95	B	Professor	fh|s^ba^tc	-1	0	Uh , so that 's good .
Bed004.B.dialogueact273	1243.45	1252.34	B	Professor	fh|s^cs^t	+1	0	Um . Now , {pause} I signed us up for the Wednesday slot , and part of what we should do is this .
Bed004.D.dialogueact274	1243.59	1244.58	D	Grad	b^rt	-1	0	OK .
Bed004.B.dialogueact275	1252.34	1252.59	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact276	1253.19	1258.64	B	Professor	s	+1	1	my idea on that was {pause} uh , partly we 'll talk about system stuff for the computer scientists ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact277	1258.64	1271.51	B	Professor	s	+1	1	but partly I did want it to get the linguists involved in some of this issue about what the task is and all {disfmarker} um you know , what the dialogue is , and what 's going on linguistically ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact278	1272.11	1275.41	B	Professor	s	+1	0	because to the extent that we can get them contributing ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact279	1276.94	1277.44	B	Professor	s^ba	+1	0	that will be good .
Bed004.B.dialogueact281	1277.86	1280.89	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So this issue about you know re - formulating things ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact280	1277.62	1277.79	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bed004.B.dialogueact282	1280.89	1284.67	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	maybe we can get some of the linguists sufficiently interested that they 'll help us with it ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact283	1286.14	1287.84	B	Professor	fh|s^bc	-1	0	uh , other linguists , if you 're a linguist ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact284	1287.84	1288.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but in any case ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact285	1288.59	1288.82	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bed004.B.dialogueact286	1289.13	1291.71	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um , the linguistics students and stuff .
Bed004.B.dialogueact287	1291.99	1296.94	B	Professor	s^t.%--	-1	0	So my idea on {disfmarker} on Wednesday is partly to uh {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact288	1296.94	1299.23	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you {disfmarker} I mean , what you did today would {disfmarker} i is just fine .
Bed004.B.dialogueact289	1299.23	1306.14	B	Professor	s	+1	1	You just uh do " this is what we did , and here 's the {pause} thing , and here 's s some of the dialogue and {disfmarker} and so forth . "
Bed004.B.dialogueact290	1306.49	1314.58	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	But then , the other thing of course is we should um give the computer scientists some idea of {disfmarker} of what 's going on with the system design ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact291	1314.58	1317.22	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and where we think the belief - nets fit in
Bed004.B.dialogueact292	1317.22	1319.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and where the pieces are and stuff like that .
Bed004.B.dialogueact294	1321.06	1322.62	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Is {disfmarker} is this {pause} make sense to everybody ?
Bed004.D.dialogueact293	1320.67	1320.77	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bed004.B.dialogueact295	1322.62	1322.74	B	Professor	fh.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact296	1325.42	1331.15	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	So , I don't {disfmarker} I don't think it 's worth a lot of work , particularly on your part , to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to make a big presentation .
Bed004.B.dialogueact297	1331.15	1331.81	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I don't think you should {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact298	1332.47	1336.02	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you don't have to make any new {pause} uh PowerPoint or anything .
Bed004.B.dialogueact299	1336.02	1339.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I think we got plenty of stuff to talk about .
Bed004.B.dialogueact300	1340.19	1344.85	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	And , then um just see how a discussion goes .
Bed004.D.dialogueact301	1345.03	1345.38	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.D.dialogueact302	1347.07	1347.47	D	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Sounds good .
Bed004.D.dialogueact303	1348.31	1352.73	D	Grad	s^t.%--	-1	0	The uh other two things is um
Bed004.D.dialogueact304	1354.41	1359.5	D	Grad	s^cs^rt^t	-1	0	we 've {disfmarker} can have Johno tell us a little about this
Bed004.B.dialogueact305	1359.59	1359.82	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Great .
Bed004.D.dialogueact306	1360.22	1363.32	D	Grad	s^rt^t	-1	0	and we also have a l little bit on the interface ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact307	1363.39	1364.64	D	Grad	s^e^rt^t	-1	0	M - three - L enhancement ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact308	1365.3	1369.86	D	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and then um that was it , I think .
Bed004.A.dialogueact309	1371.78	1378.05	A	Grad	s	+1	3	So , what I did for this {disfmarker} this is {disfmarker} uh , a pedagogical belief - net
Bed004.A.dialogueact310	1378.05	1385.33	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because I was {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I took {disfmarker} I tried to conceptually do what you were talking about with the nodes that you could expand out {disfmarker}
Bed004.A.dialogueact311	1385.33	1386.25	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so what I did was I took {disfmarker}
Bed004.A.dialogueact312	1386.74	1392.23	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I made these dummy nodes called Trajector - In and Trajector - Out that would isolate the things related to the trajector .
Bed004.B.dialogueact313	1389.72	1389.94	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bed004.A.dialogueact314	1392.23	1394.34	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And then there were the things with the source and the path and the goal .
Bed004.B.dialogueact315	1394.52	1394.72	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bed004.A.dialogueact316	1395.45	1396.7	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And I separated them out .
Bed004.A.dialogueact317	1396.7	1403.63	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And then I um did similar things for our {disfmarker} our net to {disfmarker} uh with the context and the discourse and whatnot ,
Bed004.A.dialogueact318	1404.95	1412.45	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um , so we could sort of isolate them or whatever in terms of the {disfmarker} the top layer .
Bed004.B.dialogueact319	1409.28	1409.63	B	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.A.dialogueact320	1412.45	1415.3	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And then the bottom layer is just the Mode .
Bed004.A.dialogueact321	1416.22	1416.55	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bed004.B.dialogueact322	1416.24	1416.85	B	Professor	s^co.%--	-1	0	So , let 's {disfmarker} let 's {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact323	1417.37	1418.33	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	Yeah , I don't understand it .
Bed004.B.dialogueact324	1418.33	1418.75	B	Professor	s^co.%--	-1	0	Let 's go {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact325	1419.07	1421.82	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	Slide all the way up so we see what the p the p very bottom looks like ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact326	1421.82	1422.22	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	or is that it ?
Bed004.A.dialogueact327	1422.63	1426.18	A	Grad	s^aa|s.%-	-1	0	Yeah , there 's just one more node and it says " Mode " which is the decision between the {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact328	1424.87	1425.01	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact329	1426.78	1427.38	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK , great .
Bed004.B.dialogueact330	1427.38	1427.67	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Alright .
Bed004.A.dialogueact332	1428.57	1431.65	A	Grad	s^rt	+1	0	So basically all I did was I took the last {pause} belief - net
Bed004.B.dialogueact331	1428.09	1429.16	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact333	1431.82	1432.14	B	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.A.dialogueact334	1432.4	1439.7	A	Grad	s	+1	2	and I grouped things according to what {disfmarker} how I thought they would fit in to uh image schemas that would be related .
Bed004.A.dialogueact335	1439.78	1445.22	A	Grad	s	+1	1	And the two that I came up with were Trajector - landmark and then Source - path - goal as initial ones .
Bed004.B.dialogueact336	1439.85	1440.11	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bed004.B.dialogueact337	1444.1	1444.5	B	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.A.dialogueact338	1445.92	1450.02	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And then I said well , uh the trajector would be the person in this case probably .
Bed004.B.dialogueact339	1449.7	1449.87	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact340	1450.15	1450.32	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yep .
Bed004.A.dialogueact341	1450.89	1456.01	A	Grad	h|s	+1	1	Um , you know , we have {disfmarker} we have the concept of what their intention was , whether they were trying to tour or do business or whatever ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact342	1455.38	1455.62	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.A.dialogueact343	1456.36	1456.96	A	Grad	s	+1	1	or they were hurried .
Bed004.A.dialogueact344	1456.96	1458.03	A	Grad	s	+1	1	That 's kind of related to that .
Bed004.A.dialogueact345	1458.63	1464.81	A	Grad	fh|s.%--	-1	0	And then um in terms of the source , the things {disfmarker} uh the only things that we had on there I believe were whether {disfmarker}
Bed004.A.dialogueact346	1465.67	1468.86	A	Grad	s^bc	-1	0	Oh actually , I kind of , {disfmarker} I might have added these cuz I don't think we talked too much about the source in the old one
Bed004.A.dialogueact347	1468.86	1472.83	A	Grad	fh|s.%--	-1	0	but uh whether the {disfmarker} where I 'm currently at is a landmark might have a bearing on whether {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact348	1469.32	1469.88	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.A.dialogueact349	1473.36	1475.05	A	Grad	s^bc	-1	0	or the " landmark - iness " of where I 'm currently at .
Bed004.A.dialogueact350	1475.05	1483.91	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And " usefulness " is basi basically means is that an institutional facility like a town hall or something like that that 's not {disfmarker} something that you 'd visit for tourist 's {disfmarker} tourism 's sake or whatever .
Bed004.A.dialogueact351	1485.05	1490.56	A	Grad	s	-1	0	" Travel constraints " would be something like you know , maybe they said they can {disfmarker} they only wanna take a bus or something like that ,
Bed004.A.dialogueact352	1490.56	1490.95	A	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bed004.A.dialogueact353	1490.95	1492.48	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And then those are somewhat related to the path ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact354	1491.02	1491.36	B	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.A.dialogueact355	1492.48	1498.11	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	so that would determine whether we 'd {disfmarker} could take {disfmarker} we would be telling them to go to the bus stop or versus walking there directly .
Bed004.A.dialogueact356	1498.95	1500.77	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	Um , " Goal " .
Bed004.A.dialogueact357	1501.28	1505.15	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Similar things as the source except they also added whether the entity was closed
Bed004.A.dialogueact358	1505.15	1508.21	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and whether they have somehow marked that is was the final destination .
Bed004.A.dialogueact359	1509.24	1512.55	A	Grad	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Um , and then if you go up ,
Bed004.A.dialogueact360	1513.49	1513.82	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Robert ,
Bed004.A.dialogueact361	1518.41	1528.91	A	Grad	fh|s	+1	2	Yeah , so {disfmarker} um , in terms of Context , what we had currently said was whether they were a businessman or a tourist of some other person .
Bed004.A.dialogueact362	1530.25	1534.78	A	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	Um , Discourse was related to whether they had asked about open hours
Bed004.A.dialogueact363	1534.78	1538.23	A	Grad	s	-1	0	or whether they asked about where the entrance was or the admission fee , or something along those lines .
Bed004.B.dialogueact364	1537.05	1537.47	B	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.A.dialogueact365	1539.15	1543.6	A	Grad	fh|s^rt	+1	1	Uh , Prosody I don't really {disfmarker} I 'm not really sure what prosody means , in this context ,
Bed004.A.dialogueact366	1544.12	1550.97	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so I just made up you know whether {disfmarker} whether what they say is {disfmarker} or h how they say it is {disfmarker} is that .
Bed004.B.dialogueact367	1545.96	1546.43	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right , OK .
Bed004.A.dialogueact368	1551.33	1554.06	A	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	Um , the Parse would be what verb they chose ,
Bed004.A.dialogueact369	1554.06	1558.21	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and then maybe how they modified it , in the sense of whether they said " I need to get there quickly " or whatever .
Bed004.B.dialogueact370	1557.93	1558.34	B	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.A.dialogueact371	1558.96	1566.17	A	Grad	fh|s	+1	2	And um , in terms of World Knowledge , this would just basically be like opening and closing times of things , the time of day it is , and whatnot .
Bed004.D.dialogueact372	1567.71	1568.33	D	Grad	qw	-1	0	What 's " tourbook " ?
Bed004.A.dialogueact373	1569.19	1569.62	A	Grad	s^m.%--	-1	0	Tourbook ?
Bed004.A.dialogueact374	1569.62	1572.09	A	Grad	s	-1	0	That would be , I don't know , the " landmark - iness " of things ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact375	1572.22	1572.72	D	Grad	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.A.dialogueact376	1574.2	1575.48	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	whether it 's in the tourbook or not .
Bed004.B.dialogueact377	1576.89	1577.15	B	Professor	h	-1	0	Ch - ch - ch - ch .
Bed004.B.dialogueact378	1578.43	1578.99	B	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	Now .
Bed004.B.dialogueact379	1580.11	1584.12	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Alright , so I understand what 's {disfmarker} what you got .
Bed004.B.dialogueact380	1584.96	1591.14	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I don't yet understand {pause} how you would use it .
Bed004.B.dialogueact381	1591.14	1592.24	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So let me see if I can ask
Bed004.A.dialogueact383	1593.43	1595.61	A	Grad	s	+1	3	Well , this is not a working Bayes - net .
Bed004.B.dialogueact382	1593.36	1593.84	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	a s
Bed004.B.dialogueact384	1595.22	1595.73	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.B.dialogueact385	1596.71	1597.82	B	Professor	s^arp	-1	0	No , I understand that ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact386	1597.82	1599.54	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but um
Bed004.B.dialogueact387	1601.05	1601.73	B	Professor	qw.%--	-1	0	So , what {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact388	1602.89	1604.39	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	Let 's slide back up again
Bed004.B.dialogueact389	1604.39	1604.73	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	and see {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact390	1604.73	1606.28	B	Professor	s	-1	0	start at the {disfmarker} at the bottom
Bed004.B.dialogueact391	1606.28	1606.47	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	and
Bed004.B.dialogueact392	1607.2	1607.72	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Oop - bo - doop - boop - boop .
Bed004.B.dialogueact393	1608.35	1608.58	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact394	1609.14	1611.85	B	Professor	fg|s^cs.%--	-1	0	So , you could imagine
Bed004.B.dialogueact395	1613.76	1617.37	B	Professor	fh|s^co	-1	0	w Uh , go ahead , you were about to go up there and point to something .
Bed004.A.dialogueact396	1617.28	1618.25	A	Grad	s^nd.%--	-1	0	Well I {disfmarker} OK , I just {disfmarker}
Bed004.A.dialogueact397	1618.33	1619.24	A	Grad	s^co	-1	0	Say what you were gonna say .
Bed004.B.dialogueact398	1618.49	1618.91	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	Good , do it !
Bed004.A.dialogueact400	1619.46	1619.74	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	OK .
Bed004.B.dialogueact399	1619.4	1619.72	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	No no ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact401	1619.72	1620.14	B	Professor	s^co^r	-1	0	go do it .
Bed004.A.dialogueact402	1625.53	1627.32	A	Grad	s^nd.%-	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'd {disfmarker} No , I was gonna wait until {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact403	1627.04	1627.48	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bed004.B.dialogueact404	1627.67	1632.37	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	So , so if you {disfmarker} if we made {disfmarker} if we wanted to make it into a {disfmarker} a real uh Bayes - net ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact405	1633.02	1633.94	B	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	that is , you know , with fill {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact406	1633.94	1638.4	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	you know , actually f uh , fill it @ @ in , then uh {disfmarker}
Bed004.A.dialogueact407	1638.11	1641.49	A	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	So we 'd have to get rid of this and connect these things directly to the Mode .
Bed004.B.dialogueact408	1642.0	1642.66	B	Professor	s^ng.%--	-1	0	Well , I don't {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact409	1642.66	1643.42	B	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's an issue .
Bed004.B.dialogueact410	1643.42	1644.92	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So , um {disfmarker}
Bed004.A.dialogueact411	1645.23	1647.53	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Cuz I don't understand how it would work otherwise .
Bed004.B.dialogueact412	1647.78	1649.7	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , here 's the problem .
Bed004.B.dialogueact413	1650.78	1654.16	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and uh {disfmarker} Bhaskara and I was talking about this a little earlier today {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact414	1654.55	1663.84	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	2	is , if we just do this , we could wind up with a huge uh , combinatoric input to the Mode thing .
Bed004.B.dialogueact415	1664.65	1666.5	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	And uh {disfmarker}
Bed004.A.dialogueact416	1666.29	1668.27	A	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Well I {disfmarker} oh yeah , I unders I understand that ,
Bed004.A.dialogueact417	1668.27	1670.76	A	Grad	s	+1	0	I just {disfmarker} uh it 's hard for me to imagine how he could get around that .
Bed004.B.dialogueact418	1670.64	1671.67	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , i But that 's what we have to do .
Bed004.A.dialogueact419	1671.88	1672.16	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed004.B.dialogueact420	1672.32	1673.27	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	OK , so , so ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact421	1674.19	1675.45	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh .
Bed004.B.dialogueact422	1679.56	1681.47	B	Professor	s	-1	0	There {disfmarker} there are a variety of ways of doing it .
Bed004.B.dialogueact423	1681.88	1684.53	B	Professor	fh|s^co^t	-1	0	Uh . Let me just mention something that I don't want to pursue today
Bed004.B.dialogueact424	1684.53	1687.09	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	which is there are technical ways of doing it ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact425	1687.09	1692.97	B	Professor	s	+1	0	uh I I slipped a paper to Bhaskara and {disfmarker} about Noisy - OR 's and Noisy - MAXes
Bed004.B.dialogueact426	1692.97	1693.26	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and
Bed004.B.dialogueact427	1693.49	1698.87	B	Professor	s	-1	0	there 're ways to uh sort of back off on the purity of your Bayes - net - edness .
Bed004.A.dialogueact428	1698.38	1698.89	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed004.B.dialogueact429	1699.5	1702.48	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Uh , so . If you co you could ima and I
Bed004.B.dialogueact430	1702.48	1706.55	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	now I don't know that any of those actually apply in this case ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact431	1706.83	1708.9	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but there is some technology you could try to apply .
Bed004.A.dialogueact432	1709.06	1712.55	A	Grad	s^bu.%-	-1	0	So it 's possible that we could do something like a summary node of some sort that {disfmarker}
Bed004.A.dialogueact434	1712.81	1713.08	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed004.B.dialogueact433	1712.34	1712.59	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact435	1713.38	1713.58	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact436	1714.24	1715.91	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	And , um
Bed004.B.dialogueact437	1718.17	1718.92	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bed004.A.dialogueact438	1720.38	1721.63	A	Grad	s^bu.%--	-1	0	So in that case , the sum we 'd have {disfmarker} we {disfmarker}
Bed004.A.dialogueact439	1721.63	1722.78	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , these wouldn't be the summary nodes .
Bed004.A.dialogueact440	1722.78	1723.84	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	We 'd have the summary nodes like
Bed004.A.dialogueact441	1724.41	1729.76	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	where the things were {disfmarker} I guess maybe if thi if things were related to business or some other {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact442	1729.16	1729.34	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.A.dialogueact444	1729.97	1730.34	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact443	1729.52	1737.17	B	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	So what I was gonna say is {disfmarker} is maybe a good at this point is to try to informally {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact445	1737.17	1744.43	B	Professor	s^cs^e	+1	1	I mean , not necessarily in th in this meeting , but to try to informally think about what the decision variables are .
Bed004.B.dialogueact446	1744.75	1749.26	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	So , if you have some bottom line uh decision about which mode ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact447	1749.74	1751.59	B	Professor	s	+1	0	you know , what are the most relevant things .
Bed004.A.dialogueact448	1751.9	1752.34	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed004.B.dialogueact449	1752.3	1764.49	B	Professor	s	+1	1	And the other trick , which is not a technical trick , it 's kind of a knowledge engineering trick , is to make the n {pause} each node sufficiently narrow that you don't get this combinatorics .
Bed004.B.dialogueact450	1764.49	1772.29	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	So that if you decided that you could characterize the decision as a trade - off between three factors , whatever they may be ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact451	1772.76	1773.01	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	OK ?
Bed004.B.dialogueact452	1773.01	1776.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	then you could say " Aha , let 's have these three factors " ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact453	1777.12	1777.41	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	OK ?
Bed004.B.dialogueact454	1777.41	1784.98	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and maybe a binary version f for each , or some relatively compact decision node just above the final one .
Bed004.A.dialogueact455	1785.02	1785.49	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed004.B.dialogueact456	1785.71	1796.37	B	Professor	s	+1	0	And then the question would be if {disfmarker} if those are the things that you care about , uh can you make a relatively compact way of getting from the various inputs to the things you care about .
Bed004.B.dialogueact457	1797.02	1800.89	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	So that y so that , you know , you can sort of try to do a knowledge engineering thing
Bed004.A.dialogueact458	1798.81	1799.09	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed004.B.dialogueact459	1801.58	1812.24	B	Professor	s	-1	0	given that we 're not gonna screw with the technology and just always use uh sort of orthodox Bayes - nets , then we have a knowledge engineering little problem of how do we do that .
Bed004.B.dialogueact460	1813.18	1814.24	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um
Bed004.B.dialogueact461	1816.27	1817.17	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and
Bed004.A.dialogueact462	1819.83	1823.17	A	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	So what I kind of need to do is to take this one and the old one and merge them together ?
Bed004.B.dialogueact463	1821.24	1821.33	B	Professor	%	-1	0	" Eh - eh - eh . "
Bed004.B.dialogueact464	1822.6	1822.81	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.A.dialogueact465	1823.49	1823.88	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	So that {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact466	1823.67	1825.53	B	Professor	h|s^aap	-1	0	Well , mmm , something .
Bed004.B.dialogueact467	1825.53	1833.31	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	I mean , so uh , Robert has thought about this problem f for a long time , cuz he 's had these examples kicking around ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact468	1833.31	1838.6	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so he may have some good intuition about you know , what are the crucial things .
Bed004.A.dialogueact469	1838.7	1839.08	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed004.B.dialogueact470	1839.39	1845.2	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	and , um , I understand where this {disfmarker} the uh {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact471	1846.81	1857.73	B	Professor	s	-1	0	this is a way of playing with this abs Source - path - goal trajector exp uh uh abstraction and {disfmarker} and sort of sh displaying it in a particular way .
Bed004.A.dialogueact472	1857.67	1857.95	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact473	1858.05	1866.25	B	Professor	h|s.%--	-1	0	Uh , I don't think our friends uh on Wednesday are going to be able to {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact474	1868.96	1869.51	B	Professor	s^bc	-1	0	Well , maybe they will .
Bed004.B.dialogueact475	1869.51	1872.82	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	Well , let me think about whether {disfmarker} whether I think we can present this to them or not .
Bed004.B.dialogueact476	1873.17	1874.48	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact477	1878.38	1879.2	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact478	1881.18	1884.39	D	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , I think this is still , I mean , ad - hoc .
Bed004.D.dialogueact479	1884.39	1897.62	D	Grad	s	-1	0	This is sort of th the second {vocalsound} version and I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} look at this maybe just as a , you know , a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} whatever , UML diagram or , you know , as just a uh screen shot , not really as a Bayes - net as John {disfmarker} Johno said .
Bed004.A.dialogueact480	1896.83	1901.41	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	We could actually , y yeah draw it in a different way , in the sense that it would make it more abstract .
Bed004.D.dialogueact481	1899.92	1900.35	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.D.dialogueact482	1902.6	1915.95	D	Grad	s	+1	2	But the uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the nice thing is that you know , it just is a {disfmarker} is a visual aid for thinking about these things which has comple clearly have to be specified m more carefully
Bed004.B.dialogueact484	1915.99	1918.09	B	Professor	fg|s^co	+1	0	Alright , well , le let me think about this some more ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact483	1915.95	1916.39	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	and uh
Bed004.B.dialogueact485	1918.42	1931.07	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	and uh see if we can find a way to present this to this linguists group that {disfmarker} that is helpful to them .
Bed004.D.dialogueact486	1931.59	1935.73	D	Grad	fg|s.%--	-1	0	I mean , ultimately we {disfmarker} we may w w
Bed004.D.dialogueact487	1937.02	1942.36	D	Grad	s	-1	0	we regard this as sort of an exercise in {disfmarker} in thinking about the problem
Bed004.D.dialogueact488	1942.89	1951.51	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and maybe a first version of uh a module , if you wanna call it that , that you can ask ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact489	1952.57	1953.51	D	Grad	s	-1	0	that you can give input
Bed004.D.dialogueact490	1953.51	1955.93	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and it it 'll uh throw the dice for you ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact491	1956.57	1957.5	D	Grad	s^bc	-1	0	uh throw the die for you ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact492	1957.56	1972.52	D	Grad	s^df	+1	0	because um I integrated this into the existing SmartKom system in {disfmarker} in the same way as much the same way we can um sort of have this uh {disfmarker} this thing .
Bed004.D.dialogueact493	1973.12	1973.84	D	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	Close this down .
Bed004.D.dialogueact494	1974.39	1981.31	D	Grad	s	-1	0	So if this is what M - three - L um will look like and what it 'll give us ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact495	1983.08	1983.3	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact496	1983.3	1984.97	D	Grad	s	-1	0	And a very simple thing .
Bed004.D.dialogueact497	1984.97	1990.18	D	Grad	s	-1	0	We have an action that he wants to go from somewhere , which is some type of object , to someplace .
Bed004.B.dialogueact498	1987.32	1987.69	B	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.D.dialogueact499	1990.62	1995.97	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	And this {disfmarker} these uh {disfmarker} this changed now only um , um {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact500	1996.69	1999.08	D	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's doing it twice now because it already did it once .
Bed004.D.dialogueact501	1999.81	2011.39	D	Grad	fh|s^cc	-1	0	Um , we 'll add some action type , which in this case is " Approach " and could be , you know , more refined uh in many ways .
Bed004.B.dialogueact502	2003.19	2003.66	B	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.B.dialogueact503	2005.65	2005.85	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Good .
Bed004.D.dialogueact504	2011.39	2018.64	D	Grad	s	-1	0	Or we can uh have something where the uh goal is a public place
Bed004.D.dialogueact505	2019.47	2023.62	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and it will give us then of course an action type of the type " Enter " .
Bed004.D.dialogueact506	2024.15	2028.55	D	Grad	s^bs	-1	0	So this is just based on this one {disfmarker} um , on this one feature ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact507	2028.94	2031.33	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and that 's {disfmarker} that 's about all you can do .
Bed004.D.dialogueact508	2031.76	2032.44	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	And so in the f
Bed004.D.dialogueact509	2032.44	2041.82	D	Grad	s	-1	0	if this pla if the object type um here is {disfmarker} is a m is a landmark , of course it 'll be um " Vista " .
Bed004.D.dialogueact510	2043.14	2058.92	D	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	And um this is about as much as we can do if we don't w if we want to avoid uh uh a huge combinatorial explosion where we specify " OK , if it 's this and this but that is not the case " , and so forth , it just gets really really messy .
Bed004.B.dialogueact511	2058.86	2059.46	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	OK , I 'm sorry .
Bed004.B.dialogueact512	2059.46	2059.99	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	You 're {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact513	2059.53	2059.65	D	Grad	qw	-1	0	Hmm ?
Bed004.B.dialogueact514	2060.3	2061.52	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It was much too quick for me .
Bed004.B.dialogueact515	2062.19	2064.57	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	OK , so let me see if I understand what you 're saying .
Bed004.B.dialogueact516	2065.0	2073.48	B	Professor	fh|s^bs.%--	+1	0	So , I {disfmarker} I do understand that uh you can take the M - three - L and add not {disfmarker} and it w
Bed004.B.dialogueact517	2073.48	2074.88	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	and you need to do this , for sure ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact518	2074.88	2079.97	B	Professor	s^cc	+1	1	we have to add , you know , not too much about um object types and stuff ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact519	2080.56	2092.65	B	Professor	s^bu	+1	0	and what I think you did is add some rules of the style that are already there that say " If it 's of type " Landmark " , then you take {disfmarker} you 're gonna take a picture of it . "
Bed004.D.dialogueact520	2093.39	2093.68	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly .
Bed004.B.dialogueact521	2093.93	2094.61	B	Professor	s	-1	0	F full stop ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact522	2094.61	2095.35	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , that 's what you do .
Bed004.B.dialogueact523	2095.93	2098.08	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Ev - every landmark you take a picture of ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact524	2098.61	2102.6	D	Grad	s	-1	0	Every public place you enter , and statue you want to go as near as possible .
Bed004.B.dialogueact525	2099.5	2100.2	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you enter {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact526	2102.23	2102.78	B	Professor	s^2	-1	0	You approach .
Bed004.B.dialogueact527	2103.07	2103.36	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed004.B.dialogueact528	2104.21	2111.41	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , and certainly you can add rules like that to the existing SmartKom system .
Bed004.B.dialogueact529	2112.16	2113.98	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And you just did ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact530	2114.26	2114.47	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bed004.B.dialogueact532	2114.73	2115.05	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed004.D.dialogueact531	2114.43	2114.61	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.D.dialogueact533	2114.77	2116.07	D	Grad	s	+1	0	And it {disfmarker} it would do us no good .
Bed004.B.dialogueact535	2116.41	2116.81	B	Professor	h	-1	0	Ah .
Bed004.D.dialogueact534	2116.38	2116.54	D	Grad	s	-1	0	That {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact536	2116.7	2117.11	D	Grad	s	-1	0	Ultimately .
Bed004.B.dialogueact538	2118.15	2120.65	B	Professor	fg|s^co	-1	0	Well . So , s well , and let 's think about this .
Bed004.D.dialogueact537	2117.81	2118.11	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	W
Bed004.B.dialogueact539	2121.05	2124.53	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um , that 's a {disfmarker} that 's another kind of baseline case ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact540	2124.53	2131.6	B	Professor	s	+1	1	that 's another sort of thing " OK , here 's a {disfmarker} another kind of minimal uh way of tackling this " .
Bed004.B.dialogueact541	2131.92	2133.16	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	Add extra properties ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact542	2133.16	2135.17	B	Professor	s	+1	1	a deterministic rule for every property
Bed004.B.dialogueact543	2135.17	2136.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you have an action , " pppt ! "
Bed004.B.dialogueact544	2136.95	2137.37	B	Professor	s	-1	0	You do that .
Bed004.B.dialogueact545	2138.26	2140.7	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Um , then the question would be
Bed004.B.dialogueact546	2141.37	2147.91	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh Now , if that 's all you 're doing , then you can get the types from the ontology ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact547	2149.05	2149.61	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	OK ?
Bed004.B.dialogueact548	2149.72	2154.35	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because that 's all {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} all you 're using is this type {disfmarker} the types in the ontology and you 're done .
Bed004.D.dialogueact549	2154.53	2154.93	D	Grad	qw^rt	-1	0	Hmm ?
Bed004.B.dialogueact550	2155.2	2155.44	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bed004.B.dialogueact551	2155.44	2161.01	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So we don't {disfmarker} we don't use the discourse , we don't use the context , we don't do any of those things .
Bed004.D.dialogueact552	2161.58	2161.71	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	No .
Bed004.B.dialogueact553	2162.13	2172.24	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Alright , but that 's {disfmarker} but that 's OK , and I mean it it 's again a kind of one minimal extension of the existing things .
Bed004.B.dialogueact554	2172.52	2175.76	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And that 's something the uh SmartKom people themselves would {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact555	2175.76	2177.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	they 'd say " Sure , that 's no problem {disfmarker}

Bed004.B.dialogueact557	2182.82	2183.09	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bed004.D.dialogueact558	2183.7	2183.88	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .

Bed004.D.dialogueact562	2193.97	2206.51	D	Grad	s	-1	0	we have this {disfmarker} this silly uh interface and we have the rules that are as banal as of we just saw , and we have our content .
Bed004.B.dialogueact564	2207.09	2207.46	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Hmm .

Bed004.D.dialogueact568	2215.7	2228.0	D	Grad	s	-1	0	This will um be um a job to find ways of writing down Image schema , X - schema , constructions , in some {disfmarker} some form ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact569	2228.57	2231.71	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and have this be in a {disfmarker} in a {disfmarker} in the content ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact570	2232.3	2233.69	D	Grad	s	-1	0	loosely called " Constructicon " .
Bed004.D.dialogueact571	2234.42	2236.58	D	Grad	s	+1	0	And the rules we want to throw away completely .
Bed004.D.dialogueact572	2238.11	2244.61	D	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	And um {disfmarker} and here is exactly where what 's gonna be replaced with our Bayes - net ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact573	2245.77	2247.95	D	Grad	s	-1	0	which is exactly getting the input feeding into here .
Bed004.D.dialogueact574	2247.95	2252.71	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	This decides whether it 's an whether action {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact575	2252.92	2254.08	D	Grad	s	-1	0	the {disfmarker} the Enter ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact576	2254.62	2255.39	D	Grad	s	-1	0	the Vista ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact577	2256.44	2257.73	D	Grad	s	-1	0	or the whatever
Bed004.B.dialogueact578	2257.76	2259.13	B	Professor	s^bsc	-1	0	Uh , " approach " , you called it , I think this time .
Bed004.D.dialogueact579	2258.7	2266.23	D	Grad	s	-1	0	uh Approach um construction should be activated , IE just pasted in .
Bed004.B.dialogueact580	2259.98	2260.72	B	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's what you said {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact581	2260.72	2261.23	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Yeah , that 's fine .
Bed004.B.dialogueact582	2264.79	2265.07	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah , but {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact583	2265.56	2265.78	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.B.dialogueact584	2265.78	2267.46	B	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	But it 's not construction there , it 's action .
Bed004.B.dialogueact585	2267.79	2269.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Construction is a d is a different story .
Bed004.D.dialogueact586	2268.78	2269.05	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.A.dialogueact587	2269.55	2269.79	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.A.dialogueact588	2269.79	2271.02	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	This is uh {disfmarker}
Bed004.A.dialogueact589	2271.15	2279.03	A	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	so what we 'd be generating would be a reference to a semantic uh like parameters for the {disfmarker} for the X - schema ?
Bed004.B.dialogueact590	2277.93	2278.58	B	Professor	s^2.%-	-1	0	For {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact591	2279.1	2279.46	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bed004.A.dialogueact592	2279.62	2279.85	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed004.B.dialogueact593	2280.36	2280.56	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact594	2280.93	2283.61	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So that {disfmarker} that uh
Bed004.B.dialogueact595	2284.11	2289.91	B	Professor	s	+1	0	i if you had the generalized " Go " X - schema
Bed004.B.dialogueact596	2289.91	2293.45	B	Professor	s	+1	1	and you wanted to specialize it to these three ones , then you would have to supply the parameters .
Bed004.A.dialogueact597	2293.35	2293.59	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.B.dialogueact598	2294.09	2303.71	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	And then uh , although we haven't worried about this yet , you might wanna worry about something that would go to the GIS
Bed004.B.dialogueact599	2304.07	2309.53	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and use that to actually get you know , detailed route planning .
Bed004.B.dialogueact600	2309.53	2312.28	B	Professor	fh|s^e	-1	0	So , you know , where do you do take a picture of it and stuff like that .
Bed004.A.dialogueact601	2312.33	2312.92	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.B.dialogueact602	2312.89	2316.53	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But that 's not {disfmarker} It 's not the immediate problem .
Bed004.A.dialogueact603	2316.74	2316.98	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.B.dialogueact604	2317.86	2321.37	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	But , presumably that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that functionality 's there when {disfmarker} when we {disfmarker}
Bed004.A.dialogueact605	2321.16	2323.97	A	Grad	s^bu.%-	+1	1	So the immediate problem is just deciding w which {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact606	2324.12	2326.05	D	Grad	s^2	+1	1	Aspects of the X - schema to add .
Bed004.B.dialogueact607	2327.24	2331.72	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , so the pro The immediate problem is {disfmarker} is back t t to what you were {disfmarker} what you are doing with the belief - net .
Bed004.A.dialogueact608	2328.33	2328.78	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact609	2331.99	2335.19	B	Professor	fh|qh	+1	0	You know , uh what are we going to use to make this decision {disfmarker}
Bed004.A.dialogueact610	2335.47	2339.27	A	Grad	qh	-1	0	Right and then , once we 've made the decision , how do we put that into the content ?
Bed004.B.dialogueact611	2337.27	2337.51	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact612	2338.8	2339.02	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.B.dialogueact613	2339.55	2339.71	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.B.dialogueact614	2339.71	2343.37	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , that {disfmarker} that actually is relatively easy in this case .
Bed004.A.dialogueact615	2343.7	2344.37	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed004.B.dialogueact616	2343.7	2347.35	B	Professor	s	+1	1	The harder problem is we decide what we want to use , how are we gonna get it ?
Bed004.B.dialogueact617	2347.94	2349.4	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And that the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} that 's the hardest problem .
Bed004.B.dialogueact618	2349.64	2358.3	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So , the hardest problem is how are you going to get this information from some combination of the {disfmarker} what the person says and the context and the ontology .
Bed004.B.dialogueact619	2359.34	2359.7	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	The h
Bed004.B.dialogueact620	2360.0	2362.5	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So , I think that 's the hardest problem at the moment is {disfmarker} is
Bed004.A.dialogueact621	2361.36	2361.66	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed004.B.dialogueact622	2363.53	2364.23	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	where are you gonna {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact623	2364.23	2365.77	B	Professor	s	-1	0	how are you gonna g get this information .
Bed004.B.dialogueact624	2367.84	2368.79	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact625	2369.01	2370.63	B	Professor	s^t^tc	-1	0	and that 's {disfmarker} so , getting back to here ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact626	2371.71	2377.99	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	+1	2	uh , we have a d a technical problem with the belief - nets that we {disfmarker} we don't want all the com
Bed004.A.dialogueact627	2376.92	2378.59	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	There 's just too many factors right now .
Bed004.B.dialogueact628	2378.38	2381.8	B	Professor	s^m	+1	2	too many factors if we {disfmarker} if we allow them to just go combinatorially .
Bed004.A.dialogueact629	2379.03	2379.35	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.B.dialogueact630	2382.27	2384.83	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So we wanna think about which ones we really care about
Bed004.B.dialogueact631	2385.48	2387.58	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and what they really most depend on ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact632	2387.58	2392.98	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	and can we c you know , clean this {disfmarker} this up to the point where it {disfmarker}
Bed004.A.dialogueact633	2392.49	2393.36	A	Grad	s^bu.%--	-1	0	So what we really wanna do i
Bed004.A.dialogueact634	2393.36	2399.68	A	Grad	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	cuz this is really just the three layer net , we wanna b make it {disfmarker} expand it out into more layers basically ?
Bed004.B.dialogueact635	2396.32	2396.47	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.B.dialogueact636	2399.48	2400.04	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	We might .
Bed004.B.dialogueact637	2400.79	2405.34	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , I mean that {disfmarker} that 's certainly one thing we can do .
Bed004.B.dialogueact638	2405.81	2413.2	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Uh , it 's true that the way you have this , a lot of the times you have {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact639	2413.66	2416.49	B	Professor	s	-1	0	what you 're having is the values rather than the variable .
Bed004.B.dialogueact640	2417.41	2419.56	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So uh {disfmarker}
Bed004.A.dialogueact641	2422.29	2422.57	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.A.dialogueact643	2422.96	2428.14	A	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	So instead of in instead it should really be {disfmarker} just be " intention " as a node instead of " intention business " or " intention tour " .
Bed004.B.dialogueact642	2422.82	2423.13	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK ?
Bed004.B.dialogueact644	2423.13	2423.44	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	So you {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact645	2427.27	2427.53	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact646	2427.53	2427.72	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	right ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact647	2427.72	2432.93	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and then it would have values , uh , " Tour " , " Business " , or uh " Hurried " .
Bed004.A.dialogueact648	2428.85	2429.09	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.B.dialogueact649	2433.22	2439.08	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But then {disfmarker} but i it still some knowledge design to do , about i how do you wanna break this up , what really matters .
Bed004.A.dialogueact650	2436.12	2436.33	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.B.dialogueact651	2439.95	2440.4	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	I mean , it 's fine .
Bed004.B.dialogueact652	2440.4	2441.56	B	Professor	s	-1	0	You know , we have to {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's iterative .
Bed004.B.dialogueact653	2441.56	2442.75	B	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	We 're gonna have to work with it some .
Bed004.A.dialogueact654	2442.87	2447.62	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I think what was going through my mind when I did it was someone could both have a business intention and a touring intention
Bed004.A.dialogueact655	2447.62	2447.89	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	and
Bed004.A.dialogueact656	2448.41	2451.93	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	the probabilities of both of them happening at the same time {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact657	2451.24	2452.52	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , you {disfmarker} you could do that .
Bed004.B.dialogueact658	2452.52	2460.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And it 's perfectly OK {pause} to uh insist that {disfmarker} that , you know , th um , they add up to one ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact659	2461.06	2464.71	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	but that there 's uh {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that it doesn't have to be one zero zero .
Bed004.A.dialogueact660	2464.96	2465.5	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Mmm .
Bed004.A.dialogueact661	2465.5	2465.85	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed004.B.dialogueact662	2465.58	2465.88	B	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	OK .
Bed004.B.dialogueact663	2466.06	2467.52	B	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	So you could have the conditional p
Bed004.B.dialogueact664	2467.75	2467.96	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So
Bed004.B.dialogueact665	2468.38	2471.57	B	Professor	s	-1	0	the {disfmarker} each of these things is gonna be a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a probability .
Bed004.B.dialogueact666	2471.83	2472.92	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So whenever there 's a choice ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact667	2473.65	2474.16	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact668	2475.59	2477.64	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so like landmark - ness and usefulness ,
Bed004.A.dialogueact669	2478.0	2479.26	A	Grad	s^nd.%--	-1	0	Well , see I don't think those would be mutually {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact670	2478.02	2478.31	B	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	OK {disfmarker}
Bed004.A.dialogueact671	2479.26	2481.43	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	it seems like something could both be {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact672	2481.51	2482.29	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Absolutely right .
Bed004.A.dialogueact673	2482.42	2482.69	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed004.B.dialogueact674	2483.14	2485.58	B	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	And so that you might want to then have those
Bed004.B.dialogueact675	2485.63	2486.99	B	Professor	s	-1	0	b Th - Then they may have to be separate .
Bed004.B.dialogueact676	2486.99	2492.57	B	Professor	s	-1	0	They may not be able to be values of the same variable .
Bed004.D.dialogueact677	2492.17	2492.72	D	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Object type ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact678	2492.89	2493.03	D	Grad	b	-1	0	mm - hmm .
Bed004.B.dialogueact679	2493.64	2494.02	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	So that 's {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact680	2494.13	2497.27	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but again , this is {disfmarker} this is the sort of knowledge design you have to go through .
Bed004.B.dialogueact681	2504.91	2505.11	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.B.dialogueact682	2507.05	2514.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} you know , it 's great {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is , you know , as one step toward uh {disfmarker} toward where we wanna go .
Bed004.D.dialogueact683	2517.03	2538.08	D	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	Also it strikes me that we {disfmarker} we m may want to approach the point where we can sort of try to find a {disfmarker} uh , a specification for some interface , here that um takes the normal M - three - L , looks at it .
Bed004.D.dialogueact684	2538.87	2546.88	D	Grad	s	-1	0	Then we discussed in our pre - edu {disfmarker} EDU meeting um how to ask the ontology , what to ask the ontology
Bed004.D.dialogueact685	2547.48	2552.58	D	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um the fact that we can pretend we have one , make a dummy until we get the real one ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact686	2553.1	2558.07	D	Grad	fh|s^cs	-1	0	and so um we {disfmarker} we may wanna decide we can do this from here ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact687	2558.07	2562.67	D	Grad	s^e	-1	0	but we also could do it um you know if we have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a belief - net interface .
Bed004.D.dialogueact688	2563.22	2565.97	D	Grad	s	+1	1	So the belief - net takes as input , a vector ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact689	2566.29	2566.73	D	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bed004.D.dialogueact690	2567.7	2568.33	D	Grad	s^e	-1	0	of stuff .
Bed004.D.dialogueact691	2569.53	2569.84	D	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	And it {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact692	2573.46	2573.68	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.D.dialogueact693	2573.92	2579.38	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	And um it Output is whatever , as well .
Bed004.D.dialogueact694	2579.97	2583.74	D	Grad	fh|s^rt	-1	0	But this information is just M - three - L ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact695	2584.0	2587.02	D	Grad	s	+1	1	and then we want to look up some more stuff in the ontology
Bed004.D.dialogueact696	2587.02	2589.97	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and we want to look up some more stuff in the {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact697	2589.97	2591.57	D	Grad	s^cs	+1	0	maybe we want to ask the real world ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact698	2591.57	2593.16	D	Grad	s^cs^rt	+1	0	maybe you want to look something up in the GRS ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact699	2593.16	2599.22	D	Grad	s	+1	1	but also we definitely want to look up in the dialogue history um some s some stuff .
Bed004.D.dialogueact700	2599.73	2600.18	D	Grad	%--	-1	0	Based on
Bed004.D.dialogueact701	2600.68	2602.36	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	we {disfmarker} we have uh {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact702	2602.36	2604.74	D	Grad	s	-1	0	I was just made some examples from the ontology
Bed004.D.dialogueact703	2605.24	2613.62	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and so we have for example some information there that the town hall is both a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a building and it has doors and stuff like this ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact704	2613.62	2616.83	D	Grad	s	-1	0	but it is also an institution , so it has a mayor and so forth and so forth
Bed004.D.dialogueact705	2617.17	2622.64	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and we get relations out of it and once we have them , we can use that information to look in the dialogue history ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact706	2622.88	2629.09	D	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	" were any of these things that {disfmarker} that are part of the town hall as an institution mentioned ? " ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact707	2625.82	2626.22	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.D.dialogueact708	2629.09	2632.29	D	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	" were any of these that make the town hall a building mentioned ? " ,
Bed004.C.dialogueact709	2630.69	2631.02	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.D.dialogueact710	2632.77	2633.26	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and so forth ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact711	2633.68	2635.41	D	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	and maybe draw some inferences on that .
Bed004.D.dialogueact712	2636.11	2644.83	D	Grad	s^rt	+1	0	So this may be a {disfmarker} a sort of a process of two to three steps before we get our vector , that we feed into the belief - net ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact714	2646.2	2646.42	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact715	2646.42	2648.45	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I think that 's {disfmarker} I think that 's exactly right .
Bed004.D.dialogueact713	2646.05	2646.93	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	and then {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact716	2648.69	2656.4	B	Professor	s	+1	1	There will be rules , but they aren't rules that come to final decisions , they 're rules that gather information for a decision process .
Bed004.B.dialogueact718	2656.83	2657.05	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact717	2656.38	2656.53	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact719	2657.1	2658.14	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	no I think that 's {disfmarker} that 's just fine .
Bed004.B.dialogueact720	2663.06	2663.95	B	Professor	h|s^aa	-1	0	Uh , yeah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact721	2663.95	2670.88	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	So they 'll {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} presumably there 'll be a thread or process or something that
Bed004.B.dialogueact722	2671.47	2673.44	B	Professor	s^m^na	-1	0	" Agent " , yeah , " Agent " , whatever you wan wanna say , yeah ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact723	2673.9	2682.14	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	that uh is rule - driven , and can {disfmarker} can uh {disfmarker} can do things like that .
Bed004.B.dialogueact724	2682.76	2694.01	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	And um there 's an issue about whether there will be {disfmarker} that 'll be the same agent and the one that then goes off and uh carries out the decision ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact725	2694.01	2694.83	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so it probably will .
Bed004.B.dialogueact726	2695.85	2705.79	B	Professor	s.%-	+1	1	My guess is it 'll be the same basic agent that um can go off and get information , run it through a {disfmarker} a c this belief - net that {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact727	2706.44	2707.55	B	Professor	s^m	-1	0	turn a crank in the belief - net ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact728	2707.55	2709.85	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that 'll come out with s uh more {disfmarker} another vector ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact729	2710.28	2710.7	B	Professor	s^f	-1	0	OK ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact730	2710.98	2717.67	B	Professor	s	+1	0	which can then be uh applied at what we would call the simulation or action end .
Bed004.B.dialogueact731	2717.8	2719.31	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So you now know what you 're gonna do
Bed004.B.dialogueact732	2719.71	2723.65	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	and that may actually involve getting more information .
Bed004.B.dialogueact733	2723.65	2726.56	B	Professor	s:s^fe	-1	0	So on once you pull that out , it could be that that says " Ah !
Bed004.B.dialogueact734	2726.56	2729.7	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Now that we know that we gonna go ask the ontology something else . "
Bed004.B.dialogueact735	2730.66	2730.88	B	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	OK ?
Bed004.B.dialogueact736	2730.88	2732.69	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Now that we know that it 's a bus trip ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact737	2733.37	2733.68	B	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	OK ?
Bed004.B.dialogueact738	2733.68	2743.47	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we didn't {disfmarker} We didn't need to know beforehand , uh how long the bus trip takes or whatever , but {disfmarker} but now that we know that 's the way it 's coming out then we gotta go find out more .
Bed004.D.dialogueact739	2740.48	2741.15	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.B.dialogueact740	2743.47	2744.33	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	So I think that 's OK .
Bed004.D.dialogueact741	2747.24	2747.75	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.D.dialogueact742	2753.11	2757.66	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So this is actually , s if {disfmarker} if we were to build something that is um ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact743	2758.71	2759.91	D	Grad	h|s	-1	0	and , uh , I had one more thing ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact744	2760.47	2762.98	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	the {disfmarker} it needs to do {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact745	2763.78	2764.01	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.D.dialogueact746	2764.29	2772.72	D	Grad	s^cc	+1	1	I think we {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I can come up with a {disfmarker} a code for a module that we call the " cognitive dispatcher " , which does nothing ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact747	2771.59	2771.89	B	Professor	s^bk^rt	-1	0	OK .
Bed004.D.dialogueact748	2772.72	2777.96	D	Grad	s	+1	1	but it looks of complect object trees and decides how {disfmarker} are there parts missing that need to be filled out ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact749	2777.96	2782.56	D	Grad	s	-1	0	there 's {disfmarker} this is maybe something that this module can do , something that this module can do
Bed004.D.dialogueact750	2782.56	2788.72	D	Grad	s	+1	1	and then collect uh sub - objects and then recombine them and put them together .
Bed004.D.dialogueact751	2789.25	2797.81	D	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	So maybe this is actually some {disfmarker} some useful tool that we can use to rewrite it , and uh get this part ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact752	2796.11	2796.54	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bed004.B.dialogueact753	2797.18	2797.66	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Uh .
Bed004.D.dialogueact754	2798.4	2798.87	D	Grad	%--	-1	0	then .
Bed004.D.dialogueact755	2798.87	2799.05	D	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact756	2799.41	2808.24	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I confess , I 'm still not completely comfortable with the overall story .
Bed004.B.dialogueact757	2808.24	2808.58	B	Professor	h	-1	0	Um .
Bed004.B.dialogueact758	2809.85	2809.99	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	I
Bed004.B.dialogueact759	2810.82	2814.23	B	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	i This {disfmarker} this is not a complaint , this is a promise to do more work .
Bed004.B.dialogueact760	2814.23	2816.31	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So I 'm gonna hafta think about it some more .
Bed004.B.dialogueact761	2817.3	2820.16	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Um . In particular {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact762	2820.42	2830.01	B	Professor	s	-1	0	see what we 'd like to do , and {disfmarker} and this has been implicit in the discussion , is to do this in such a way that you get a lot of re - use .
Bed004.B.dialogueact763	2830.57	2842.2	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	So . What you 're trying to get out of this deep co cognitive linguistics is the fact that w if you know about source {disfmarker} source , paths and goals , and nnn {comment} all this sort of stuff , that a lot of this is the same , for different tasks .
Bed004.B.dialogueact764	2842.2	2846.9	B	Professor	s	+1	1	And that {disfmarker} uh there 's {disfmarker} there 's some {disfmarker} some important generalities that you 're getting ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact765	2846.9	2850.93	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so that you don't take each and every one of these tasks and hafta re - do it .
Bed004.B.dialogueact766	2851.76	2853.68	B	Professor	s	+1	1	And I don't yet see how that goes .
Bed004.B.dialogueact767	2855.18	2855.47	B	Professor	s.%	-1	0	Alright .
Bed004.D.dialogueact768	2855.29	2858.14	D	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	There 're no primitives upon which {pause} uh
Bed004.B.dialogueact769	2855.84	2858.4	B	Professor	qw.%--	-1	0	u u What are the primitives , and how do you break this {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact770	2858.14	2858.34	D	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact771	2858.71	2864.27	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So I y I 'm just {disfmarker} just there saying eee {comment} well you {disfmarker} I know how to do any individual case ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact772	2865.25	2865.56	B	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	right ?
Bed004.B.dialogueact773	2865.56	2866.41	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but I don't yet {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact774	2866.74	2874.92	B	Professor	s	-1	0	see what 's the really interesting question is can you use uh deep uh cognitive linguistics to {pause} get powerful generalizations .
Bed004.B.dialogueact775	2875.55	2876.19	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	And
Bed004.D.dialogueact776	2875.65	2875.81	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bed004.B.dialogueact777	2876.83	2877.62	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um
Bed004.D.dialogueact778	2878.12	2878.74	D	Grad	s^cs.%--	-1	0	Maybe we sho
Bed004.D.dialogueact779	2878.74	2883.93	D	Grad	qy:qw^rt	-1	0	should we a add then the " what 's this ? " domain ?
Bed004.D.dialogueact780	2884.2	2884.29	D	Grad	%--	-1	0	N
Bed004.D.dialogueact781	2885.25	2885.79	D	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , we have to
Bed004.D.dialogueact782	2885.79	2886.91	D	Grad	s:qw	-1	0	" how do I get to X " .
Bed004.D.dialogueact783	2887.41	2892.43	D	Grad	s.%--:qw.%--	-1	0	Then we also have the " what 's this ? " domain , where we get some slightly different {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact785	2889.77	2890.63	B	Professor	qy.%-	-1	0	Could . Uh .
Bed004.C.dialogueact784	2889.31	2889.67	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.D.dialogueact786	2893.22	2896.59	D	Grad	s	-1	0	Um Johno , actually , does not allow us to call them " intentions " anymore .
Bed004.B.dialogueact787	2894.42	2894.65	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.D.dialogueact788	2897.06	2898.7	D	Grad	s	-1	0	So he {disfmarker} he dislikes the term .
Bed004.B.dialogueact789	2898.76	2900.79	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Well , I {disfmarker} I don't like the term either , so I have n i
Bed004.B.dialogueact790	2901.3	2902.37	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	uh
Bed004.B.dialogueact791	2902.46	2903.38	B	Professor	%	-1	0	i i y w i i
Bed004.B.dialogueact792	2903.63	2904.89	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	It uh {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact793	2906.14	2912.75	D	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	But um , I 'm sure the " what 's this ? " questions also create some interesting X - schema aspects .
Bed004.B.dialogueact794	2913.03	2913.36	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	Could be .
Bed004.B.dialogueact796	2913.8	2917.99	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I 'm not a {disfmarker} I 'm not op particularly opposed to adding that or any other task ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact795	2913.36	2914.19	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bed004.B.dialogueact797	2917.99	2920.14	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , eventually we 're gonna want a whole range of them .
Bed004.D.dialogueact798	2919.91	2920.47	D	Grad	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.B.dialogueact800	2921.06	2921.9	B	Professor	h	-1	0	Uh ,
Bed004.C.dialogueact799	2920.62	2920.93	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	That 's right .
Bed004.B.dialogueact801	2923.18	2927.87	B	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	I 'm just saying that I 'm gonna hafta do some sort of first principles thinking about this .
Bed004.B.dialogueact802	2927.87	2929.46	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I just at the moment don't know .
Bed004.D.dialogueact803	2929.8	2930.27	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.B.dialogueact804	2932.63	2932.84	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	H
Bed004.B.dialogueact805	2934.75	2935.12	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bed004.B.dialogueact806	2935.12	2936.96	B	Professor	s^ar|s.%-	-1	0	Well , no the Bayes {disfmarker} the Bayes - nets {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact807	2937.95	2940.07	B	Professor	s^m	-1	0	The Bayes - nets will be dec specific for each decision .
Bed004.B.dialogueact808	2940.07	2950.35	B	Professor	s	+1	1	But what I 'd like to be able to do is to have the way that you extract properties , that will go into different Bayes - nets , be the {disfmarker} uh general .
Bed004.B.dialogueact809	2950.73	2953.98	B	Professor	s	+1	1	So that if you have sources , you have trajectors and stuff like that ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact810	2954.15	2956.23	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and there 's a language for talking about trajectors ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact811	2956.93	2959.04	B	Professor	s	+1	0	you shouldn't have to do that differently
Bed004.B.dialogueact812	2960.31	2966.0	B	Professor	s	+1	0	for uh uh going to something , than for circling it ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact813	2966.0	2968.72	B	Professor	s	+1	0	for uh telling someone else how to go there ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact814	2967.15	2967.6	D	Grad	s^2.%-	-1	0	Getting out of {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact815	2968.72	2969.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	whatever it is .
Bed004.B.dialogueact816	2970.15	2973.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So that {disfmarker} that , the {disfmarker} the decision processes are gonna be different
Bed004.B.dialogueact817	2975.33	2988.27	B	Professor	s	+1	1	What you 'd really like of course is the same thing you 'd always like which is that you have um a kind of intermediate representation which looks the same o over a bunch of inputs and a bunch of outputs .
Bed004.B.dialogueact818	2988.57	2999.09	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	So all sorts of different tasks {pause} and all sorts of different ways of expressing them use a lot of the same mechanism for pulling out what are the fundamental things going on .
Bed004.B.dialogueact819	3000.19	3003.03	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	And that 's {disfmarker} that would be the really pretty result .
Bed004.B.dialogueact820	3004.97	3017.45	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	And pushing it one step further , when you get to construction grammar and stuff , what you 'd like to be able to do is say you have this parser which is much fancier than the parser that comes with uh SmartKom ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact821	3018.0	3025.48	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i that {disfmarker} that actually uses constructions and is able to tell from this construction that there 's uh something about the intent {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact822	3025.48	3029.42	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you know , the actual what people wanna do or what they 're referring to and stuff ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact823	3029.68	3042.47	B	Professor	s	-1	0	in independent of whether it {disfmarker} about {disfmarker} what is this or where is it or something , that you could tell from the construction , you could pull out deep semantic information which you 're gonna use in a general way .
Bed004.B.dialogueact824	3043.35	3043.83	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	So that 's the {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact825	3047.16	3047.6	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	You might .
Bed004.B.dialogueact826	3047.84	3048.3	B	Professor	s^am^r	-1	0	You might .
Bed004.B.dialogueact827	3048.53	3050.4	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	You might be able to {disfmarker} to uh
Bed004.B.dialogueact828	3052.21	3057.36	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	say that this i this is the kind of construction in which the {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact829	3057.7	3059.46	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	there 's {disfmarker} Let 's say there 's a uh cont
Bed004.B.dialogueact830	3059.58	3065.05	B	Professor	s	-1	0	there {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the land the construction implies the there 's a con this thing is being viewed as a container .
Bed004.B.dialogueact831	3065.93	3066.26	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	OK .
Bed004.B.dialogueact832	3066.53	3074.37	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So just from this local construction you know that you 're gonna hafta treat it as a container you might as well go off and get that information .
Bed004.B.dialogueact833	3074.37	3076.55	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And that may effect the way you process everything else .
Bed004.B.dialogueact834	3077.39	3079.09	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So if you say " how do I get into the castle "
Bed004.B.dialogueact835	3080.09	3080.55	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	OK ,
Bed004.B.dialogueact836	3080.98	3084.13	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	then um {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact837	3084.69	3087.01	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Or , you know , " what is there in the castle " or {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact838	3087.01	3091.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so there 's all sorts of things you might ask that involve the castle as a container
Bed004.B.dialogueact839	3092.01	3099.36	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and you 'd like to have this orthogonal so that anytime the castle 's referred to as a container , you crank up the appropriate stuff .
Bed004.B.dialogueact840	3100.86	3105.25	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	Independent of what the goal is , and independent of what the surrounding language is .
Bed004.D.dialogueact841	3102.98	3103.67	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.B.dialogueact842	3106.26	3108.78	B	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	Alright , so that 's {disfmarker} that 's the {disfmarker} that 's the thesis level
Bed004.D.dialogueact843	3108.78	3109.38	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bed004.B.dialogueact844	3109.83	3110.71	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact845	3110.41	3115.17	D	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's unfortunate also that English has sort of got rid of most of its spatial adverbs
Bed004.D.dialogueact846	3115.64	3120.2	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because they 're really fancy then , in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} for these kinds of analysis .
Bed004.D.dialogueact847	3121.32	3122.01	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	But uh .
Bed004.B.dialogueact848	3121.84	3123.22	B	Professor	s^ng.%-	-1	0	Well , you have prepositional phrases that {disfmarker}
Bed004.D.dialogueact849	3123.53	3126.2	D	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	Yeah , but they 're {disfmarker} they 're easier for parsers .
Bed004.B.dialogueact850	3126.28	3126.54	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.D.dialogueact851	3126.45	3131.52	D	Grad	s	-1	0	Parsers can pick those up but {disfmarker} but the {disfmarker} with the spatial adverbs , they have a tough time .
Bed004.D.dialogueact852	3131.72	3135.07	D	Grad	s	-1	0	Because the {disfmarker} mean the semantics are very complex in that .
Bed004.B.dialogueact853	3134.99	3135.22	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.D.dialogueact854	3136.1	3136.84	D	Grad	b	-1	0	OK , yeah ?
Bed004.D.dialogueact855	3137.55	3139.8	D	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	I had one more {pause} thing .
Bed004.D.dialogueact856	3139.8	3140.5	D	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I don't remember .
Bed004.D.dialogueact857	3140.5	3142.11	D	Grad	s	-1	0	I just forgot it again .
Bed004.D.dialogueact858	3142.38	3142.53	D	Grad	h	-1	0	No .
Bed004.D.dialogueact859	3143.78	3144.01	D	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	Oh yeah ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact860	3144.39	3150.86	D	Grad	s	-1	0	b But an architecture like this would also enable us maybe to {disfmarker} to throw this away and {disfmarker} and replace it with something else , or whatever ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact861	3151.34	3157.91	D	Grad	s	+1	0	so that we have {disfmarker} so that this is sort of the representational formats we 're {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} we 're talking about that are independent of the problem ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact862	3158.36	3173.02	D	Grad	s	+1	0	that generalize over those problems , and are oh , t of a higher quality than an any actual whatever um belief - net , or " X " that we may use for the decision making , ultimately .
Bed004.D.dialogueact863	3174.89	3175.9	D	Grad	s	-1	0	Should be decoupled , yeah .
Bed004.D.dialogueact864	3182.6	3182.82	D	Grad	b	-1	0	OK .
Bed004.B.dialogueact865	3183.58	3183.76	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.B.dialogueact866	3184.47	3186.14	B	Professor	fg|qy^rt	-1	0	So , are we gonna be meeting here from now on ?
Bed004.B.dialogueact867	3186.14	3187.3	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm happy to do that .
Bed004.B.dialogueact868	3187.3	3190.91	B	Professor	s	-1	0	We {disfmarker} we had talked about it , cuz you have th th the display and everything , that seems fine .
Bed004.D.dialogueact869	3191.94	3195.32	D	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , um , Liz also asks whether we 're gonna have presentations every time .
Bed004.D.dialogueact870	3195.32	3197.96	D	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	I don't think we will need to do that but it 's {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact871	3197.22	3197.41	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.D.dialogueact872	3198.16	3201.42	D	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	so far I think it was nice as a visual aid for some things and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact873	3200.91	3201.27	B	Professor	s^fe	-1	0	Oh yeah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact874	3201.27	3208.19	B	Professor	s	-1	0	No I {disfmarker} I think it 's worth it to ass to meet here to bring this , and assume that something may come up that we wanna look at .
Bed004.D.dialogueact875	3208.22	3208.41	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact876	3209.72	3210.18	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean . Why not .
Bed004.D.dialogueact877	3212.78	3213.9	D	Grad	h	-1	0	And um .
Bed004.D.dialogueact878	3228.37	3229.41	D	Grad	fh|s.%-	-1	0	Yeah , that was my {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact879	3228.89	3229.53	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	She was good .
Bed004.B.dialogueact880	3229.73	3230.62	B	Professor	s^ba^rt	-1	0	Litonya was good .
Bed004.D.dialogueact881	3233.9	3234.13	D	Grad	qh	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bed004.D.dialogueact882	3234.63	3240.26	D	Grad	fh|s^rt	-1	0	The uh {disfmarker} um , she w she was definitely good in the sense that she {disfmarker} she showed us some of the weaknesses
Bed004.B.dialogueact883	3240.19	3240.5	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.D.dialogueact884	3241.04	3249.25	D	Grad	fh|s.%-	-1	0	and um also the um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the fact that she was a real subject you know , is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker}
Bed004.B.dialogueact885	3248.03	3248.27	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.B.dialogueact886	3249.41	3253.64	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Yeah , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} yeah and {disfmarker} and she took it seriously and stuff
Bed004.B.dialogueact887	3253.64	3254.32	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	l No , it was great .
Bed004.D.dialogueact888	3254.46	3254.64	D	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.B.dialogueact889	3255.12	3255.27	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.D.dialogueact890	3255.98	3259.14	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So I think that um {disfmarker} I mean , w
Bed004.D.dialogueact891	3259.14	3263.7	D	Grad	s	-1	0	Looking {disfmarker} just looking at this data , listening to it , what can we get out of it in terms of our problem ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact892	3264.64	3274.11	D	Grad	s	-1	0	for example , is , you know , she actually m said {disfmarker} you know , she never s just spoke about entering , she just wanted to get someplace , and she said for buying stuff .
Bed004.D.dialogueact893	3274.28	3274.54	D	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Nuh ?
Bed004.D.dialogueact894	3275.29	3278.72	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So this is definitely interesting , and {disfmarker}
Bed004.C.dialogueact895	3277.3	3278.19	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , right .
Bed004.D.dialogueact896	3278.72	3282.46	D	Grad	fh|s^rt	-1	0	Um , and in the other case , where she wanted to look at the stuff at the graffiti ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact897	3283.35	3286.73	D	Grad	s	-1	0	also , of course , not in the sentence " How do you get there ? " was pretty standard .
Bed004.D.dialogueact898	3287.05	3287.22	D	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Nuh ?
Bed004.D.dialogueact899	3287.53	3292.25	D	Grad	s	-1	0	except that there was a nice anaphora , you know , for pointing at what she talked about before ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact900	3292.25	3295.76	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and there she was talking about looking at pictures that are painted inside a wall on walls ,
Bed004.D.dialogueact901	3295.76	3296.07	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	so
Bed004.C.dialogueact902	3298.62	3299.07	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bed004.D.dialogueact903	3298.9	3300.42	D	Grad	s	-1	0	Actually , you 'd need a lot of world knowledge .
Bed004.D.dialogueact904	3300.42	3303.74	D	Grad	s	-1	0	This would have been a classical um uh " Tango " , actually .
Bed004.D.dialogueact905	3303.88	3307.97	D	Grad	fh|s^df	-1	0	Um , because graffiti is usually found on the outside and not on the inside ,
Bed004.C.dialogueact906	3304.57	3304.75	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bed004.D.dialogueact907	3308.03	3308.16	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	but
Bed004.D.dialogueact908	3308.95	3309.15	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bed004.D.dialogueact909	3310.03	3313.19	D	Grad	s	-1	0	So the mistake {comment} would have make a mistake {disfmarker} the system would have made a mistake here .
Bed004.C.dialogueact910	3312.03	3312.22	C	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bed004.B.dialogueact911	3317.69	3317.96	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Click ?
Bed004.B.dialogueact912	3321.01	3321.32	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Alright .
