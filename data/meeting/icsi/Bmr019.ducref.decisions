For comparing Meeting Recorder digits results , it was decided that the Aurora HTK-based system should be tested on data from the TI digits corpus.
The script for extracting speaker ID information will require modifications to obtain a more accurate estimation of the amount of data recorded per speaker.
Subsequent recognition experiments will look at large vocabulary speech from a far-field microphone ( as performed in Switchboard evaluations ).
Hand-marked , word-level alignments are needed to reveal speaker boundaries and tune the parameters of the model.
Modifications to the Transcriber tool are required for allowing transcribers to simultaneously view the signal in XWaves and see where words are located in time.
