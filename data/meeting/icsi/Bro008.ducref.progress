mn007 and fn002 have been working with the new Danish and German databases , making improvements , though more so with results on the Danish.
The results are reasonable , but still not good enough.

There are various techniques that various groups have tried , and they should all be considered for possible combinations of systems.
One suitable candidate for combination is the group's own filtering which reduces bandwidth to half bit transmission rate.
