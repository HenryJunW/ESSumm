Continuing efforts by speaker mn005 to measure energy levels in cases of speaker overlap will not include additional log energy analyses , but rather an analysis of raw energy for normalized speaker dataacross windows of varying duration , followed by an examination of pitch- and harmonicity-related features.
Speakers fe008 and fe016 discussed plans to categorize and produce a taxonomy of types of speaker overlap.
