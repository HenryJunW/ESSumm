ICSI's Meeting Recorder Group at Berkeley met mainly to discuss work on their main project , the Aurora task , but also talked about the work of one of their student members.
Some members of the group met recently with research partners to settle on the current state of their software , and decide on the future work they would investigate , and these decisions were relayed to the rest of the group.
Of the three areas for the future , they touched mostly upon the use of a second , parallel , data stream.
The group also discussed a new part to the evaluation , the use of a chunk of the Wall Street Journal.
Speaker me006 is working on data clustering , and discussion of related issues led to more general acoustic matters.
