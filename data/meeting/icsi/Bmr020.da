Bmr020.D.dialogueact28	21.29	24.06	D	PhD	z	-1	0	There 's gonna be some zeros from this morning 's meeting because I noticed that
Bmr020.F.dialogueact29	21.31	21.6	F	Professor	z	-1	0	u
Bmr020.D.dialogueact30	24.72	27.13	D	PhD	z	-1	0	Barry , I think maybe you turned your mike off before the digits were {disfmarker}
Bmr020.D.dialogueact31	27.13	27.27	D	PhD	z	-1	0	Oh ,
Bmr020.D.dialogueact32	27.27	28.09	D	PhD	z	-1	0	was it during digits ?
Bmr020.D.dialogueact33	28.09	28.68	D	PhD	z	-1	0	Oh , so it doesn't matter .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact34	29.114	29.434	F	Professor	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact36	29.73	30.92	A	Grad	z	-1	0	It 's still not a good idea .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact35	29.7	31.82	B	PhD	z	-1	0	So it 's not {disfmarker} it 's not that bad if it 's at the end ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact37	31.82	33.92	B	PhD	z	-1	0	but it 's {disfmarker} in the beginning , it 's {pause} bad .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact38	31.95	32.11	D	PhD	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact39	32.53	32.66	D	PhD	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact40	33.58	33.66	A	Grad	z	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr020.A.dialogueact41	33.66	36.16	A	Grad	z	-1	0	you wanna {disfmarker} you wanna keep them on so you get {pause} good noise {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact42	37.98	38.68	A	Grad	z	-1	0	noise floors ,
Bmr020.A.dialogueact44	39.259	39.909	A	Grad	z	-1	0	through the whole meeting .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact43	39.16	39.63	C	Postdoc	z	-1	0	That 's interesting .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact47	40.37	40.43	C	Postdoc	z	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact45	40.02	40.27	F	Professor	z	-1	0	Uh ,
Bmr020.F.dialogueact46	40.27	41.54	F	Professor	z	-1	0	I probably just should have left it on .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact48	41.54	42.5	F	Professor	z	-1	0	Yeah I did have to run ,
Bmr020.F.dialogueact49	42.73	42.98	F	Professor	z	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bmr020.E.dialogueact50	44.39	46.02	E	Grad	z	-1	0	Is there any way to change that in the software ?
Bmr020.A.dialogueact51	46.47	47.41	A	Grad	z	-1	0	Change what in the software ?
Bmr020.E.dialogueact52	47.1	51.61	E	Grad	z	-1	0	Where like you just don't {disfmarker} like if you {disfmarker} if it starts catching zeros , like in the driver or something {disfmarker}
Bmr020.E.dialogueact53	52.4	54.58	E	Grad	z	-1	0	in the card , or somewhere in the hardware {disfmarker}
Bmr020.E.dialogueact54	54.58	59.98	E	Grad	z	-1	0	Where if you start seeing zeros on w across one channel , you just add some {vocalsound} random , @ @ {comment} noise floor {disfmarker}
Bmr020.E.dialogueact55	59.98	60.8	E	Grad	z	-1	0	like a small noise floor .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact56	60.925	61.945	A	Grad	z	-1	0	I mean certainly we could do that ,
Bmr020.A.dialogueact57	61.945	63.125	A	Grad	z	-1	0	but I don't think that 's a good idea .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact58	63.125	66.195	A	Grad	z	-1	0	We can do that in post - processing if {disfmarker} if the application needs it .
Bmr020.E.dialogueact59	64.729	65.009	E	Grad	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact61	66.396	67.636	B	PhD	z	-1	0	Manual post - processing .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact60	66.278	74.438	F	Professor	z	-1	0	Well , I {disfmarker} u I actually don't know what the default {comment} is anymore as to how we 're using the {disfmarker} the front - end stuff but {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} when we use the ICSI front - end ,
Bmr020.A.dialogueact63	75.068	75.738	A	Grad	z	-1	0	As an argument .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact62	74.591	75.151	F	Professor	z	-1	0	but um ,
Bmr020.F.dialogueact64	75.608	78.328	F	Professor	z	-1	0	there is an {disfmarker} there is an o an option in {disfmarker} in RASTA ,
Bmr020.F.dialogueact65	78.498	78.888	F	Professor	z	-1	0	which ,
Bmr020.F.dialogueact66	80.737	88.94	F	Professor	z	-1	0	um , {vocalsound} in when I first put it in , uh , back in the days when I actually wrote things , uh , {vocalsound} I {pause} did actually put in a random bit or so that was in it ,
Bmr020.E.dialogueact67	88.421	88.681	E	Grad	z	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact68	88.94	94.36	F	Professor	z	-1	0	but {vocalsound} then I realized that putting in a random bit was equivalent to adding uh {disfmarker} adding flat spectrum ,
Bmr020.E.dialogueact69	94.46	94.68	E	Grad	z	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact70	94.935	100.415	F	Professor	z	-1	0	and it was a lot faster to just add a constant to the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to the spectrum . So then I just started doing that
Bmr020.E.dialogueact71	98.111	98.431	E	Grad	z	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr020.E.dialogueact73	100.522	100.812	E	Grad	z	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact72	100.415	102.205	F	Professor	z	-1	0	instead of calling " rand " {comment} or something ,
Bmr020.E.dialogueact74	102.27	102.44	E	Grad	z	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact75	102.315	102.475	F	Professor	z	-1	0	so .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact76	105.043	105.943	F	Professor	z	-1	0	So it d it does that .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact77	109.61	110.96	F	Professor	s^fe^tc	-1	0	Gee ! Here we all are !
Bmr020.A.dialogueact78	111.991	112.351	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	Uh ,
Bmr020.A.dialogueact79	112.351	118.466	A	Grad	s^t	+1	2	so the only agenda items were Jane {disfmarker} was Jane wanted to talk about some of the IBM transcription process .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact80	113.058	113.598	F	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt^t3	-1	0	There 's an agenda ?
Bmr020.A.dialogueact81	118.466	121.307	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I sort of {vocalsound} condensed the three things you said into that .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact82	121.787	127.827	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And then just {disfmarker} I only have like , this afternoon and maybe tomorrow morning to get anything done before I go to Japan for ten days .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact83	128.236	132.006	A	Grad	s^co	-1	0	So if there 's anything that n absolutely , desperately needs to be done , you should let me know now .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact84	137.15	140.996	F	Professor	fg|s^bu	+1	2	Uh , and you just sent off a Eurospeech paper ,

Bmr020.G.dialogueact199	267.894	270.484	G	PhD	s	+1	0	well it was about {disfmarker} it had three sections

Bmr020.F.dialogueact201	268.84	269.53	F	Professor	s	-1	0	but I haven't seen it yet .

Bmr020.G.dialogueact203	271.294	274.07	G	PhD	s	-1	0	three kinds of uh results , if you will .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact204	274.615	277.715	G	PhD	fh|s^e	+1	2	Uh , the one was that the {disfmarker} just the {disfmarker} the amount of overlap
Bmr020.A.dialogueact205	277.675	278.845	A	Grad	s^j	-1	0	The good , the bad , and the ugly .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact206	277.715	278.095	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact207	278.745	280.715	G	PhD	s^e	+1	1	s in terms of {disfmarker} in terms of number of words
Bmr020.G.dialogueact208	280.715	283.295	G	PhD	s	+1	0	and also we computed something called a " spurt " ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact209	283.97	288.73	G	PhD	s^e	+1	0	which is essentially a stretch of speech with uh , no pauses exceeding five hundred milliseconds .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact210	289.52	300.74	G	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	Um , and we computed how many overlapped i uh spurts there were and how many overlapped words there were . {vocalsound} Um , for four different {pause} corpora ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact211	301.1	302.51	G	PhD	s^e	+1	0	the Meeting Recorder meetings ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact212	302.57	303.72	G	PhD	s^e	+1	0	the Robustness meetings

Bmr020.G.dialogueact214	305.17	305.82	G	PhD	s^e	+1	0	and CallHome ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact215	307.382	310.252	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and , found {disfmarker} and sort of compared the numbers .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact216	311.143	311.523	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact217	312.67	314.16	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and found that the ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact218	314.76	315.36	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact219	316.021	319.991	G	PhD	s	+1	0	you know , as you might expect the Meeting Recorder {pause} meetings had the most overlap
Bmr020.G.dialogueact220	320.731	323.081	G	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	uh , but next were Switchboard and CallHome ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact221	323.161	324.621	G	PhD	s^e	+1	1	which both had roughly the same ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact222	325.38	326.67	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	almost identical in fact ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact223	327.381	329.561	G	PhD	s^e	+1	0	and the Robustness meetings were {disfmarker} had the least ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact224	329.561	329.981	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact225	331.15	340.02	G	PhD	s	-1	0	One sort of unexpected result there is that uh two - party telephone conversations have {vocalsound} about the same amount of overlap ,
Bmr020.A.dialogueact226	335.977	336.767	A	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	I 'm surprised .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact227	340.41	346.39	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	sort of in gen you know {disfmarker} order of magnitude - wise as , uh {disfmarker} as face - to - face meetings with multiple {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact228	345.002	347.452	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I have {disfmarker} I had better start changing all my slides !
Bmr020.G.dialogueact229	347.43	347.56	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact230	347.93	362.324	G	PhD	s	+1	0	Also , I {disfmarker} in the Levinson , the pragmatics book , {comment} in you know , uh , textbook , {vocalsound} there 's {disfmarker} I found this great quote where he says {vocalsound} you know {disfmarker} you know , how people {disfmarker} it talks about how uh {disfmarker} how {disfmarker} how people are so good at turn taking ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact231	351.395	351.605	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact232	352.313	352.463	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact233	353.329	353.429	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact234	362.324	368.59	G	PhD	s	+1	0	and {vocalsound} so {disfmarker} they 're so good that {vocalsound} generally , u the overlapped speech does not {disfmarker} is less than five percent .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact235	369.306	369.556	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact236	369.556	370.466	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	that 's interesting .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact238	370.596	370.896	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact237	370.55	370.94	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact239	371.22	372.95	G	PhD	s	-1	0	this is way more than five percent .
Bmr020.E.dialogueact240	374.33	376.01	E	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Did he mean face {disfmarker} like face - to - face ?
Bmr020.E.dialogueact241	376.01	376.48	E	Grad	qrr.%--	-1	0	Or {disfmarker} ?
Bmr020.G.dialogueact242	376.89	378.28	G	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , in real conversations ,
Bmr020.E.dialogueact244	378.464	378.834	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact243	378.28	379.43	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	everyday conversations .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact246	379.63	379.81	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact245	379.43	383.15	G	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's s what these conversation analysts have been studying for years and years there .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact247	382.148	382.348	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact249	383.179	383.349	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact248	382.923	385.673	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	Well , of course , no , it doesn't necessarily go against what he said ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact250	385.673	391.266	C	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	cuz he said " generally speaking " . In order to {disfmarker} to go against that kind of a claim you 'd have to big canvassing .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact251	387.543	387.803	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact252	388.526	389.286	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	And in f
Bmr020.G.dialogueact253	388.71	390.31	G	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	Well , he {disfmarker} he made a claim {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact254	390.036	390.346	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact255	390.31	390.74	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact257	391.49	392.197	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	
Bmr020.B.dialogueact258	391.884	392.104	B	PhD	fg	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr020.F.dialogueact256	391.47	393.54	F	Professor	s^bk|s	-1	0	Yeah , we {disfmarker} we have pretty limited sample here .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact259	392.709	394.849	B	PhD	qr^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Five percent of time or five percent of what ?
Bmr020.A.dialogueact261	394.527	395.697	A	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	Yeah , I was gonna ask that too .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact260	394.205	394.655	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact263	395.49	395.64	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact264	395.58	396.12	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact262	395.29	396.09	G	PhD	s	-1	0	Well it 's time .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact267	396.282	396.492	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact268	396.492	396.842	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact266	396.12	398.11	C	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} i it 's not against his conclusion ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact265	396.09	398.54	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but still {disfmarker} but still {disfmarker} u
Bmr020.C.dialogueact269	398.11	403.23	C	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	it just says that it 's a bi bell curve , and that , {vocalsound} you have something that has a nice range , in your sampling .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact270	402.6	402.72	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact271	402.72	403.48	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So there are slight {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact272	403.61	405.1	G	PhD	s	-1	0	There are differences in how you measure it ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact273	405.1	411.69	G	PhD	s	-1	0	but still it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} You know , the difference between um {disfmarker} between that number and what we have in meetings ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact274	411.69	417.245	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which is more like , {vocalsound} you know , close to {disfmarker} in meetings like these , uh {disfmarker} you know , close to twenty percent .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact275	412.394	412.554	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact277	417.671	417.801	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact276	417.49	419.93	F	Professor	qw	-1	0	But what was it like , say , in the Robustness meeting , for instance ?
Bmr020.G.dialogueact278	417.924	418.074	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	That {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact279	418.51	418.69	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact280	420.57	421.36	G	PhD	qy^bu^d^m^rt	-1	0	Robustness meeting ?
Bmr020.G.dialogueact281	421.36	423.08	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	It was {vocalsound} about half of the r
Bmr020.G.dialogueact282	423.58	432.603	G	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	So , {vocalsound} in terms of number of words , it 's like seventeen or eigh eighteen percent for the Meeting Recorder meetings and {vocalsound} about half that for , {vocalsound} uh , the Robustness .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact283	424.18	424.9	F	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	Maybe ten percent ?
Bmr020.A.dialogueact284	431.943	439.503	A	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	But I don't know if that 's really a fair way of comparing between , multi - party , conversations and two - party conversations .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact286	440.5	440.66	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact287	440.66	441.41	A	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't know .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact285	440.477	441.417	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Then {disfmarker} then {disfmarker} then you have to {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact288	441.69	442.59	A	Grad	s^df.%-	-1	0	I mean that 's just something {disfmarker}
Bmr020.D.dialogueact289	442.61	445.0	D	PhD	s	+1	1	Yeah , I just wonder if you have to normalize by the numbers of speakers or something .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact290	443.15	443.26	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact291	444.009	446.019	B	PhD	s^na	-1	0	Then {disfmarker} Yeah , then normalize by {disfmarker} by something like that ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact293	445.057	445.197	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact294	445.197	445.977	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	that 's a good point .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact292	444.809	446.269	G	PhD	s	+1	1	Well , we didn't get to look at that ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact295	446.019	446.229	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact296	446.057	446.317	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact297	446.269	451.329	G	PhD	s	-1	0	but this obvious thing to see if {disfmarker} if there 's a dependence on the number of uh {disfmarker} participants .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact298	447.84	448.3	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Good idea .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact299	449.845	450.015	A	Grad	%--	-1	0	I mean {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact300	451.657	453.037	A	Grad	s	+1	1	I bet there 's a weak dependence .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact302	453.307	455.917	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I 'm sure it 's {disfmarker} it 's not a real strong one .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact301	453.25	453.42	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact303	453.69	453.91	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact304	456.565	456.675	A	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr020.A.dialogueact306	456.675	457.065	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	Because you
Bmr020.D.dialogueact305	456.58	457.66	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	Cuz not everybody talks .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact308	457.632	457.922	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact307	457.165	457.365	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact309	457.81	457.96	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact310	458.962	462.61	A	Grad	s	+1	0	You have a lot of {disfmarker} a lot of two - party , subsets within the meeting .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact311	461.3	461.5	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact312	462.061	462.341	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact313	462.61	463.26	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Well regardless {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact315	463.26	464.9	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	it 's an interesting result regardless .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact314	463.2	463.66	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact316	464.22	464.46	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact318	464.874	465.464	C	Postdoc	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yes , that 's right .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact317	464.46	468.53	G	PhD	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and then {disfmarker} and we also d computed this both with and without backchannels ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact319	465.756	465.976	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact320	468.72	472.37	G	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	so you might think that backchannels have a special status because they 're essentially just {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact321	469.56	469.77	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact322	472.17	474.34	A	Grad	s^j	-1	0	So , did {disfmarker} we all said " uh - huh " and nodded at the same time ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact323	473.058	473.548	G	PhD	b	-1	0	R right .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact325	474.34	474.53	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	so .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact324	474.31	476.37	G	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	But , even if you take out all the backchannels {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact326	476.92	480.3	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so basically you treat backchannels l as nonspeech , as pauses ,
Bmr020.A.dialogueact327	479.714	480.124	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact328	480.737	480.827	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact329	480.87	482.67	G	PhD	s	+1	1	you still have significant overlap .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact330	482.82	498.28	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	You know , it goes down from maybe {disfmarker} For Switchboard it goes down from {disfmarker} I don't know {disfmarker} f um {disfmarker} {comment} I don't know {disfmarker} f fourteen percent of the words to maybe {vocalsound} uh I don't know , eleven percent or something {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact331	498.28	500.01	G	PhD	s	-1	0	it 's {disfmarker} it 's not a dramatic change ,
Bmr020.A.dialogueact333	500.323	500.533	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact332	500.01	500.49	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact334	501.891	502.221	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	Anyway ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact335	502.221	502.951	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so it 's uh {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact336	504.29	506.61	G	PhD	s	-1	0	That was {disfmarker} that was one set of {pause} results ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact337	506.61	515.385	G	PhD	s	+1	2	and then the second one was just basically the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the stuff we had in the {disfmarker} in the HLT paper on how overlaps effect the {pause} recognition performance .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact338	507.629	507.709	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact339	511.213	511.363	A	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	Nope .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact340	515.589	515.789	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact341	515.633	515.933	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact342	516.223	519.593	G	PhD	s	+1	1	And we rescored things um , a little bit more carefully .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact343	519.593	522.873	G	PhD	s	-1	0	We also fixed the transcripts in {disfmarker} in numerous ways .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact344	523.583	527.253	G	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Uh , but mostly we added one {disfmarker} one number , which was
Bmr020.G.dialogueact345	528.157	532.047	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	what if you {pause} uh , basically score ignoring all {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact346	532.89	542.536	G	PhD	s	+1	0	So {disfmarker} so the {disfmarker} the conjecture from the HLT results was that {vocalsound} most of the added recognition error is from insertions {vocalsound} due to background speech .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact347	544.04	550.7	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So , we scored {vocalsound} all the recognition results , {vocalsound} uh , in such a way that the
Bmr020.G.dialogueact348	550.81	551.32	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact349	552.34	553.86	A	Grad	qw^rt	-1	0	Oh by the way , who 's on channel four ?
Bmr020.A.dialogueact351	553.99	554.97	A	Grad	s	-1	0	You 're getting a lot of breath .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact350	553.8	554.0	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact353	554.313	555.593	B	PhD	s	-1	0	I j was just wondering .
Bmr020.E.dialogueact352	554.053	554.433	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker}
Bmr020.B.dialogueact354	555.683	555.823	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.E.dialogueact355	556.078	556.618	E	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's me .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact356	559.71	561.13	G	PhD	s	-1	0	uh , well Don 's been working hard .
Bmr020.E.dialogueact357	561.317	561.847	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	That 's right .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact358	562.392	562.652	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	OK ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact359	562.652	570.527	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so if you have the foreground speaker speaking here , and then there 's some background speech , may be overlapping it somehow ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact360	571.25	573.98	G	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um , and this is the time bin that we used ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact361	574.57	576.89	G	PhD	s	-1	0	then of course you 're gonna get insertion errors here and here .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact362	577.068	577.288	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact363	577.29	577.56	G	PhD	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr020.G.dialogueact364	577.92	579.42	G	PhD	s	+1	0	So we scored everything ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact365	579.42	582.56	G	PhD	s	+1	0	and I must say the NIST scoring tools are pretty nice for this ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact366	583.055	589.227	G	PhD	s	+1	0	where you just basically ignore everything outside of the , {vocalsound} uh , region that was deemed to be foreground speech .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact367	589.86	594.33	G	PhD	s	-1	0	And where that was we had to use the t forced alignment , uh , results from s for {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact368	594.33	594.65	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact369	595.227	597.217	G	PhD	s	-1	0	That 's somewhat {disfmarker} that 's somewhat subject to error ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact370	597.217	600.693	G	PhD	s	-1	0	but still we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , Don did some ha hand - checking
Bmr020.G.dialogueact371	601.35	606.05	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and we think that {disfmarker} based on that , we think that the results are you know , valid ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact372	606.05	608.31	G	PhD	s	-1	0	although of course , some error is gonna be in there .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact373	608.931	622.77	G	PhD	s	+1	2	But basically what we found is after we take out these regions {disfmarker} so we only score the regions that were certified as foreground speech , {comment} {vocalsound} the recognition error went down to almost {vocalsound} uh , the {pause} level of the non - overlapped {pause} speech .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact374	623.65	631.818	G	PhD	s	-1	0	So that means that {vocalsound} even if you do have background speech , if you can somehow separate out or find where it is , {vocalsound} uh , the recognizer does a good job ,
Bmr020.A.dialogueact375	624.706	625.196	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	That 's great .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact376	630.064	630.184	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact377	632.409	633.739	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	even though there is this back
Bmr020.A.dialogueact378	633.273	634.643	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , I guess that doesn't surprise me ,
Bmr020.A.dialogueact379	634.643	639.006	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because , with the close - talking mikes , the {disfmarker} the signal will be so much stronger .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact380	636.73	637.01	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact381	638.481	638.671	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact383	639.504	639.794	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact382	639.292	639.572	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact384	641.2	641.73	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bmr020.A.dialogueact386	641.925	643.685	A	Grad	qw^rt	+1	0	What {disfmarker} what sort of normalization do you do ?
Bmr020.G.dialogueact385	641.87	642.33	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact387	645.1	649.88	G	PhD	h|s.%-	-1	0	Uh , well , we just {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} we do {disfmarker} u you know , vit
Bmr020.A.dialogueact388	649.36	650.42	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	I mean in you recognizer ,
Bmr020.A.dialogueact389	650.42	651.6	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	in the SRI recognizer .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact390	651.45	656.03	G	PhD	s	+1	0	Well , we do uh , VTL {disfmarker} {vocalsound} vocal tract length normalization ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact391	656.03	664.0	G	PhD	s	+1	0	w and we uh {disfmarker} you know , we {disfmarker} we uh , {vocalsound} make all the features have zero mean and unit variance .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact393	664.59	665.77	A	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Over an entire utterance ?
Bmr020.F.dialogueact392	664.517	664.677	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact395	666.028	666.658	A	Grad	qrr^d	-1	0	Or windowed ?
Bmr020.G.dialogueact394	665.95	668.8	G	PhD	s^ng	+1	0	Over {disfmarker} over the entire c over the entire channel .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact396	667.978	668.968	B	PhD	s^t1.%--	-1	0	Don't {pause} train {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact397	669.08	669.38	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Over the {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact399	669.678	670.038	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact398	669.47	670.22	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	but you know .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact400	670.77	672.85	G	PhD	s	+1	0	Um , now we didn't re - align the recognizer for this .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact401	673.01	674.07	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	We just took the old {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact402	674.623	677.143	G	PhD	s	-1	0	So this is actually a sub - optimal way of doing it ,
Bmr020.A.dialogueact405	677.28	677.54	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact403	676.84	677.19	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact404	677.143	677.383	G	PhD	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right ?
Bmr020.G.dialogueact406	677.383	679.123	G	PhD	s	-1	0	So we took the old recognition output
Bmr020.G.dialogueact407	679.123	680.793	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and we just scored it differently .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact408	681.271	685.521	G	PhD	s^e.%-	+1	0	So the recognizer didn't have the benefit of knowing where the foreground speech {disfmarker} a start
Bmr020.F.dialogueact409	684.77	686.95	F	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Were you including the {disfmarker} the lapel {pause} in this ?

Bmr020.F.dialogueact411	687.913	692.063	F	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	And did the {disfmarker} did {disfmarker} did the la did the {disfmarker} the problems with the lapel go away also ?
Bmr020.F.dialogueact413	692.063	692.253	F	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	Or {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact412	691.8	693.35	G	PhD	h|s^aa	-1	0	Um , it {disfmarker} Yeah .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact414	693.148	695.048	F	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	fray for {disfmarker} for insertions ?
Bmr020.G.dialogueact415	693.35	695.41	G	PhD	s^aap	-1	0	It u not per {disfmarker} I mean , not completely ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact416	695.41	696.21	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	but yes ,
Bmr020.F.dialogueact418	696.35	696.7	F	Professor	s^2	-1	0	Less so .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact417	696.3	696.96	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	dramatically .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact419	697.59	698.34	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So we have to
Bmr020.G.dialogueact420	698.34	698.86	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bmr020.F.dialogueact421	699.39	699.93	F	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , you still {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact422	699.73	702.1	G	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	Well I should bring the {disfmarker} should bring the table with results .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact423	702.1	703.67	G	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Maybe we can look at it {pause} Monday .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact424	703.19	707.22	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I would presume that you still would have somewhat higher error with the lapel for insertions than {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact425	705.16	705.55	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact426	706.254	706.674	G	PhD	%--	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker}
Bmr020.F.dialogueact428	707.39	707.64	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact427	707.044	707.434	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact429	707.824	708.044	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact430	708.57	714.15	F	Professor	s^df.%-	-1	0	Cuz again , looking forward to the non - close miked case , I think that we s still {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact431	712.44	712.67	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact432	713.86	714.98	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I 'm not looking forward to it .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact433	714.955	716.775	F	Professor	s	-1	0	i it 's the high signal - to - noise ratio
Bmr020.G.dialogueact434	717.19	717.4	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact435	718.4	719.39	F	Professor	s^t3	-1	0	here that {disfmarker} that helps you .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact436	718.57	719.23	G	PhD	b	-1	0	u s Right .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact437	720.16	720.84	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact438	721.0	724.79	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so that was number {disfmarker} that was the second set of {disfmarker} uh , the second section .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact439	724.79	731.23	G	PhD	s	+1	0	And then , {vocalsound} the third thing was , we looked at , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} uh , what we call " interrupts " ,

Bmr020.G.dialogueact441	733.65	735.87	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but basically {vocalsound} we looked at cases where {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact442	736.632	740.072	G	PhD	s	+1	0	Uh , so we {disfmarker} we used the punctuation from the original transcripts
Bmr020.G.dialogueact443	740.76	744.1	G	PhD	s	+1	0	and we inferred the beginnings and ends of sentences .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact444	745.33	745.66	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact445	746.1	746.38	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	you know {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact446	748.711	750.641	C	Postdoc	qy	-1	0	Di - did you use upper - lower case also , or not ?
Bmr020.G.dialogueact447	748.75	749.23	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact449	750.959	752.089	C	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	U upper lower case or no ?
Bmr020.G.dialogueact448	750.542	750.782	G	PhD	qw^br^rt	-1	0	Hmm ?
Bmr020.C.dialogueact452	752.089	752.289	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .

Bmr020.G.dialogueact451	752.035	757.565	G	PhD	s^e^nd	-1	0	we only used , you know , uh periods , uh , question marks and {pause} exclamation .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact453	757.904	759.914	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And we know that there 's th that 's not a very g
Bmr020.G.dialogueact454	760.56	761.8	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	I mean , we miss a lot of them ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact455	761.742	761.812	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact457	761.812	762.182	C	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	That 's OK
Bmr020.C.dialogueact458	762.182	762.342	C	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact456	761.8	763.28	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but it 's f i i
Bmr020.C.dialogueact459	763.0	763.88	C	Postdoc	qy^d	-1	0	Comma also or not ?
Bmr020.G.dialogueact460	764.37	764.91	G	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	No commas .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact461	765.16	765.26	G	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact462	766.296	770.25	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And then {vocalsound} we looked at locations where ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact463	771.13	771.74	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact464	773.18	785.37	G	PhD	qw	+1	0	if you have overlapping speech and someone else starts a sentence , you know , where do these {disfmarker} where do other people start their {vocalsound} turns {disfmarker} not turns really , but you know , sentences ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact465	782.69	782.74	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Ah .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact466	785.91	786.52	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact467	787.62	790.71	G	PhD	s	-1	0	So we only looked at cases where there was a foreground speaker
Bmr020.G.dialogueact468	791.15	797.35	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and then at the to at the {disfmarker} so the {disfmarker} the foreground speaker started into their sentence and then someone else started later .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact470	798.65	800.23	B	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	Somewhere in between the start and the end ?
Bmr020.G.dialogueact469	798.63	799.03	G	PhD	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	OK ?
Bmr020.G.dialogueact471	799.604	800.534	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And so what {disfmarker}
Bmr020.B.dialogueact472	800.33	800.56	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact473	800.844	801.094	G	PhD	qw^br^d^rt	-1	0	Sorry ?
Bmr020.B.dialogueact474	801.41	803.66	B	PhD	s^bu^r	-1	0	Somewhere in between the start and the end of the foreground ?
Bmr020.G.dialogueact475	802.52	802.84	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact476	803.4	806.31	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	Uh , so that such that there was overlap between the two sentences .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact477	805.499	805.669	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact478	806.764	818.32	G	PhD	s	+1	0	So , the {disfmarker} the question was how can we {disfmarker} what can we say about the places where the second or {disfmarker} or actually , several second speakers , {vocalsound} um {pause} start their {pause} " interrupts " , as we call them .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact479	818.27	819.22	D	PhD	s^cs^j	-1	0	Three words from the end .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact480	820.256	821.276	A	Grad	s	-1	0	At pause boundaries .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact481	821.05	821.17	G	PhD	%-	-1	0	w
Bmr020.G.dialogueact482	821.6	823.61	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And we looked at this in terms of
Bmr020.G.dialogueact483	823.61	824.3	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact484	824.718	826.228	A	Grad	s^cs^j	-1	0	On T - closures , only .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact485	826.3	828.71	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so we had {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we had
Bmr020.G.dialogueact486	828.71	829.33	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	um u
Bmr020.G.dialogueact487	829.99	835.67	G	PhD	s	+1	0	to {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} for the purposes of this analysis , we tagged the word sequences , and {disfmarker} and we time - aligned them .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact488	836.36	836.68	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact489	836.97	840.23	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and we considered it interrupt {disfmarker} if it occurred in the middle of a word ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact490	840.23	846.42	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	we basically {disfmarker} you know , considered that to be a interrupt as if it were at {disfmarker} at the beginning of the word .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact491	846.42	851.32	G	PhD	s^e	+1	0	So that , {vocalsound} if any part of the word was overlapped , it was considered an interrupted {pause} word .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact492	851.13	851.43	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact493	852.123	858.72	G	PhD	s	-1	0	And then we looked at the {disfmarker} the locatio the , {vocalsound} um , you know , the features that {disfmarker} the tags
Bmr020.G.dialogueact494	858.72	865.48	G	PhD	s^df	+1	0	because we had tagged these word strings , {comment} {vocalsound} um , that {disfmarker} that occurred right before these {disfmarker} these uh , interrupt locations .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact495	860.5	861.2	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Tag by uh
Bmr020.G.dialogueact496	865.868	869.927	G	PhD	s^e	+1	0	And the tags we looked at are {vocalsound} the spurt tag ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact497	869.927	871.017	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	which basically says {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact498	871.66	872.07	G	PhD	s.%--	+1	0	or actually {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact499	872.19	872.36	G	PhD	s^fa	-1	0	Sorry .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact500	873.32	873.91	G	PhD	s^bsc	+1	1	End of spurt .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact501	873.91	877.12	G	PhD	s	+1	0	So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} whether there was a pause essentially here ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact502	877.12	881.75	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because spurts are a {disfmarker} defined as being you know , five hundred milliseconds or longer pauses ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact503	882.54	884.72	G	PhD	s	+1	1	and then we had things like discourse markers ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact504	885.71	886.97	G	PhD	s	+1	1	uh , backchannels ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact505	888.08	889.2	G	PhD	s	+1	1	uh , disfluencies .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact506	890.04	890.81	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact507	891.59	892.8	G	PhD	s	+1	0	uh , filled pauses {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact508	893.41	898.74	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	So disfluen the D 's are for , {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} the interruption points of a disfluency ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact509	898.74	901.66	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	so , where you hesitate , or where you start the repair there .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact510	902.57	903.99	G	PhD	fh|qw^t1	-1	0	Uh , what else do we had .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact511	903.99	907.65	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	Uh , repeated {disfmarker} you know , repeated words is another of that kind of disfluencies and so forth .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact512	908.01	909.84	G	PhD	s	-1	0	So we had both the beginnings and ends of these {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact513	911.96	914.02	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	uh so , the end of a filled pause
Bmr020.G.dialogueact514	915.326	917.006	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and the end of a discourse marker .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact515	918.95	919.7	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And we just eyeballed {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact516	919.7	922.69	G	PhD	s	+1	0	I mean {vocalsound} we didn't really hand - tag all of these things .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact517	922.69	925.22	G	PhD	s	-1	0	We just {pause} looked at the distribution of words ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact518	925.22	932.19	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and so every {vocalsound} " so yeah " , and " OK " , uh , and " uh - huh " were {disfmarker} were the {disfmarker} were deemed to be backchannels
Bmr020.G.dialogueact519	932.19	938.93	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and {vocalsound} " wow " and " so " and {vocalsound} uh " right " , uh were um {disfmarker} {pause} Not " right " . " Right " is a backchannel .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact520	938.93	946.38	G	PhD	s	+1	0	But so , we sort of {disfmarker} just based on the lexical {disfmarker} {vocalsound} um , identity of the words , we {disfmarker} we tagged them as one of these things .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact521	947.743	951.173	G	PhD	s	-1	0	And of course the d the interruption points we got from the original transcripts .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact522	952.12	952.42	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact523	952.8	954.0	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and then we looked at the disti
Bmr020.G.dialogueact524	954.0	958.54	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so we looked at the {pause} distribution of these different kinds of tags , overall
Bmr020.G.dialogueact525	958.75	961.53	G	PhD	s	-1	0	uh , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and particularly at the interruption points .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact526	962.06	964.97	G	PhD	s	-1	0	And uh , we found that there is a marked difference
Bmr020.G.dialogueact527	964.97	965.32	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	so
Bmr020.G.dialogueact528	965.84	967.15	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	that for instance after {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact529	967.15	974.07	G	PhD	s	+1	2	so at the end after a discourse marker or after backchannel or after filled pause , you 're much more likely to be interrupted {vocalsound} than before .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact530	974.74	975.12	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	OK ?
Bmr020.G.dialogueact531	975.43	977.41	G	PhD	s	+1	1	And also of course after spurt ends ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact532	977.41	979.21	G	PhD	s^e	+1	0	which means basically in p inside pauses .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact533	979.27	981.29	G	PhD	s^e.%--	-1	0	So pauses are always an opportunity for {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact534	981.748	984.678	G	PhD	s	-1	0	So we have this little histogram which shows these distributions
Bmr020.G.dialogueact535	984.678	986.008	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	and , {vocalsound} um ,
Bmr020.D.dialogueact536	986.54	987.14	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I wonder {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact537	986.694	989.164	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	you know , it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's not {disfmarker} No big surprises ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact538	989.164	991.024	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	but it is {pause} sort of interesting from {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact539	990.34	991.62	A	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's nice to actually measure it though .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact540	991.414	991.794	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact541	992.0	993.56	D	PhD	s	+1	0	I wonder about the cause and effect there .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact542	994.47	998.84	D	PhD	s^df	+1	0	In other words uh {pause} if you weren't going to pause you {disfmarker} you will because you 're g being interrupted .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact543	994.92	995.25	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Well we 're ne
Bmr020.D.dialogueact544	999.48	999.8	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact545	999.88	1000.0	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact546	1000.0	1001.74	G	PhD	s^ng	+1	1	There 's no statement about cause and effect .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact547	1001.41	1001.67	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah ,

Bmr020.G.dialogueact548	1001.74	1003.82	G	PhD	s	-1	0	This is just a statistical correlation ,
Bmr020.D.dialogueact551	1003.38	1003.55	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right ,
Bmr020.D.dialogueact552	1003.55	1004.04	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I see .

Bmr020.F.dialogueact556	1005.6	1006.21	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	y I mean maybe
Bmr020.F.dialogueact557	1006.84	1008.29	F	Professor	s	-1	0	you weren't intending to pause at all ,
Bmr020.F.dialogueact558	1008.29	1011.73	F	Professor	s	-1	0	but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} You were intending to stop for fifty - seven milliseconds ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact559	1008.56	1008.8	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact561	1012.26	1013.26	F	Professor	s	-1	0	but then Chuck came in
Bmr020.G.dialogueact560	1012.17	1012.37	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact563	1013.41	1013.78	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact562	1013.26	1015.02	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and so you {vocalsound} paused for a second
Bmr020.G.dialogueact564	1013.46	1013.67	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact565	1015.76	1016.51	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	Anyway . {comment} So ,

Bmr020.G.dialogueact567	1017.61	1018.89	G	PhD	s	-1	0	uh , and that was basically it .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact568	1018.89	1020.49	G	PhD	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and we {disfmarker} so we wrote this
Bmr020.G.dialogueact569	1020.49	1023.18	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and then , {vocalsound} we found we were at six pages ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact570	1023.18	1025.51	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and then we started {vocalsound} cutting furiously

Bmr020.G.dialogueact572	1025.51	1028.16	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and {vocalsound} threw out half of the {vocalsound} material again ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact573	1028.27	1030.13	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and uh played with the LaTeX stuff
Bmr020.G.dialogueact574	1030.13	1030.3	G	PhD	%--	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact577	1031.84	1033.82	A	Grad	s^j	-1	0	Made the font smaller and the narrows longer .

Bmr020.G.dialogueact588	1042.38	1044.61	G	PhD	s	-1	0	so I d shrunk it to eight millimeters
Bmr020.G.dialogueact589	1044.61	1046.41	G	PhD	s	-1	0	and that helped some . And stuff like that .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact590	1046.06	1048.24	D	PhD	qy	-1	0	Wasn't there {disfmarker} wasn't there some result , Andreas {disfmarker}

Bmr020.D.dialogueact597	1058.4	1059.83	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	You know you get a falling pitch .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact599	1060.93	1062.79	D	PhD	s	-1	0	And so that 's when people tend to backchannel .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact598	1060.48	1060.84	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact600	1061.19	1061.57	G	PhD	fg	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}

Bmr020.G.dialogueact606	1070.73	1072.72	G	PhD	s^e	+1	0	now that we have the data and we have the alignment ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact608	1072.72	1073.13	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	so .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact609	1074.21	1076.75	G	PhD	s	-1	0	This is purely based on you know the words

Bmr020.D.dialogueact628	1094.32	1094.72	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}

Bmr020.D.dialogueact630	1099.59	1103.83	D	PhD	s	-1	0	And you just have this little detector that listens for these {vocalsound} drops in pitch and gives them the backchannel .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact631	1103.96	1105.93	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	And so then you {vocalsound} hook that to the phone and go off
Bmr020.A.dialogueact632	1105.14	1105.5	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact634	1105.98	1106.46	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .

Bmr020.G.dialogueact646	1119.42	1122.68	G	PhD	s	+1	0	and he did this backchanneling , automatic backchanneling system .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact647	1119.94	1120.18	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact648	1122.68	1123.23	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	It 's a very {disfmarker}

Bmr020.G.dialogueact730	1253.67	1258.57	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	So , {vocalsound} in other words , to access anything under there , you have to {vocalsound} be told what the name is .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact732	1259.21	1259.45	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact731	1259.11	1263.15	G	PhD	s	-1	0	So that 's sort of a g {vocalsound} quick and dirty way of doing access control .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact733	1263.28	1263.69	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact734	1263.56	1264.0	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact735	1264.84	1268.26	G	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	uh , and the directory for this I call it I " ASR zero point one "
Bmr020.G.dialogueact736	1268.26	1270.51	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because it 's sort of meant for recognition .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact737	1269.98	1271.75	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So anyone who hears this meeting now knows the {disfmarker}

Bmr020.G.dialogueact739	1271.69	1275.73	G	PhD	s	-1	0	And then {disfmarker} then in there I have a file that lists all the other {vocalsound} files ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact740	1275.78	1279.68	G	PhD	s^df	+1	0	so that someone can get that file and then know the file names and therefore download them .

Bmr020.G.dialogueact746	1287.62	1287.99	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	Anyway .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact747	1288.34	1294.83	G	PhD	s	+1	1	So all I {disfmarker} all I was gonna do there was stick the {disfmarker} the transcripts after we {disfmarker} the way that we munged them for scoring ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact748	1294.89	1296.75	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because that 's what he cares about ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact749	1296.76	1297.0	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact750	1297.88	1298.33	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact751	1299.31	1303.47	G	PhD	s	+1	0	and also {disfmarker} and then the {disfmarker} the {pause} waveforms that Don segmented .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact752	1303.77	1310.51	G	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , just basically tar them all up f I mean {disfmarker} w for each meeting I tar them all into one tar file and G - zip them and stick them there .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact753	1310.86	1314.93	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I uh , put digits in my own home directory {disfmarker} home FTP directory ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact754	1311.35	1311.67	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	And so .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact755	1314.93	1316.26	A	Grad	s	-1	0	but I 'll probably move them there as well .

Bmr020.D.dialogueact769	1332.58	1334.5	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	so that when they did experiments they could compare .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact770	1334.49	1334.7	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact771	1334.7	1335.99	G	PhD	s	-1	0	but they don't have a recognizer even .

Bmr020.D.dialogueact782	1345.32	1346.26	D	PhD	s.%-	+1	0	so I was gonna probably put it {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact783	1345.99	1347.18	A	Grad	s	-1	0	We can put it in the same place .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact785	1347.3	1348.41	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Just put in another directory .

Bmr020.E.dialogueact799	1357.73	1364.16	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	Um , so either we should regenerate the original {vocalsound} versions , {comment} {pause} or um , we should just make a note of it .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact798	1357.25	1357.56	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact800	1361.91	1362.24	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Oh .

Bmr020.G.dialogueact802	1365.12	1367.52	G	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	OK , because in one directory there 's two versions .
Bmr020.E.dialogueact803	1367.6	1369.49	E	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	Yeah , that 's the first meeting I cut both versions .
Bmr020.E.dialogueact805	1369.7	1372.08	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Just to check which w if there is a significant difference .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact804	1369.53	1370.03	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact806	1370.47	1370.96	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And so I {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact807	1370.96	1371.52	G	PhD	%--	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact808	1371.62	1371.92	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK
Bmr020.G.dialogueact809	1371.92	1374.73	G	PhD	s^bu	+1	0	so {disfmarker} but for the other meetings it 's the downsampled version that you have .
Bmr020.E.dialogueact810	1374.03	1374.86	E	Grad	s^na	-1	0	They 're all downsampled ,
Bmr020.E.dialogueact811	1374.86	1375.19	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact812	1375.45	1376.49	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact813	1376.96	1378.05	G	PhD	s	-1	0	Oh that 's th important to know ,

Bmr020.G.dialogueact815	1378.42	1378.98	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	so
Bmr020.G.dialogueact816	1379.92	1383.38	G	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	we should probably {disfmarker} uh {pause} give them the non - downsampled versions .
Bmr020.E.dialogueact817	1382.55	1382.91	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.E.dialogueact818	1384.14	1385.4	E	Grad	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker}

Bmr020.G.dialogueact829	1395.03	1397.49	G	PhD	s	-1	0	Yeah , definitely they should have the full bandwidth version ,
Bmr020.E.dialogueact831	1399.18	1399.29	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr020.E.dialogueact832	1399.29	1405.29	E	Grad	s	-1	0	because I mean {disfmarker} I I think Liz decided to go ahead with the {pause} downsampled versions cuz we can {disfmarker} There was no s like , r significant difference .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact830	1399.15	1399.42	G	PhD	fh.%	-1	0	yeah . OK .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact833	1404.33	1407.04	G	PhD	fg|s^df	-1	0	Well , it takes {disfmarker} it takes up less disk space , for one thing .
Bmr020.E.dialogueact834	1406.61	1407.82	E	Grad	s^m^na	-1	0	It does take up less disk space ,
Bmr020.E.dialogueact835	1407.82	1410.98	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and apparently it did even better {pause} than the original {disfmarker} than the original versions ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact836	1409.24	1409.48	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact837	1409.9	1410.2	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.E.dialogueact839	1410.98	1413.14	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	which you know , is just , probably random .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact838	1410.49	1410.76	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact840	1412.6	1413.81	G	PhD	s	-1	0	Yeah , it was a small difference
Bmr020.E.dialogueact842	1414.15	1416.63	E	Grad	s	+1	1	But , um {pause} they probably w want the originals .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact841	1413.81	1414.35	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	but yeah .

Bmr020.F.dialogueact855	1425.83	1428.09	F	Professor	s	-1	0	that 's why it was good to have Andreas , say these things
Bmr020.F.dialogueact856	1428.09	1428.24	F	Professor	%--	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bmr020.F.dialogueact857	1429.0	1432.19	F	Professor	s^cs^t^tc.%--	+1	2	So , we should probably talk about the IBM transcription process stuff that {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact858	1432.84	1433.1	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact860	1434.01	1438.85	C	Postdoc	h|qy^d^rt	+1	1	So , um you know that Adam created um , a b a script to generate the beep file ?

Bmr020.C.dialogueact863	1444.53	1446.2	C	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	you {disfmarker} you should probably talk about that .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact864	1446.2	1449.14	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	But {disfmarker} but you were gonna to use the {pause} originally transcribed file
Bmr020.C.dialogueact865	1449.14	1450.49	C	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	because I tightened the time bins
Bmr020.C.dialogueact866	1450.49	1454.12	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	and that 's also the one that they had already {vocalsound} in trying to debug the first stage of this .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact867	1454.78	1455.54	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	And uh ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact868	1456.19	1457.29	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	my understanding was that ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact869	1457.29	1457.64	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact870	1458.33	1460.33	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I haven't {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I haven't listened to it yet ,

Bmr020.C.dialogueact873	1461.21	1464.75	C	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and I understand that you guys {vocalsound} were going to have a meeting today , before this meeting .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact874	1464.87	1466.81	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	It was just to talk about how to generate it .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact875	1467.16	1471.21	A	Grad	fh|s^e	-1	0	Um , just so that while I 'm gone , you can regenerate it if you decide to do it a different way .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact877	1472.14	1476.2	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So uh , Chuck and Thilo should , now more or less know how to generate the file
Bmr020.C.dialogueact876	1471.99	1472.36	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Excellent .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact878	1472.64	1472.92	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact879	1476.2	1483.35	A	Grad	s	+1	0	and , {vocalsound} the other thing Chuck pointed out is that , um , {vocalsound} since this one is hand - marked , {vocalsound} there are discourse boundaries .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact880	1483.73	1483.94	A	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr020.A.dialogueact882	1483.94	1486.8	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so when one person is speaking , there 's breaks .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact881	1483.74	1483.86	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact883	1487.15	1488.53	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Whereas Thilo 's won't have that .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact886	1489.23	1497.26	A	Grad	s	+1	1	So what {disfmarker} what we 're probably gonna do is just write a script , that if two , chunks are very close to each other on the same channel we 'll just merge them .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact884	1488.75	1488.93	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh !
Bmr020.C.dialogueact885	1489.15	1489.49	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact887	1489.78	1490.28	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Ah , interesting .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact888	1490.4	1490.53	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact889	1491.02	1491.1	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact890	1497.45	1497.74	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Oh , sure .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact891	1498.0	1498.38	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , sure .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact892	1498.47	1498.93	C	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	Makes sense .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact893	1499.08	1505.74	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	So , uh , and that will get around the problem of , the , {vocalsound} you know " one word beep , one word beep , one word beep , one word beep " .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact894	1502.57	1502.95	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact895	1504.85	1505.85	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Ah !
Bmr020.C.dialogueact896	1505.91	1506.27	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Clever .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact897	1506.27	1506.85	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact898	1507.07	1507.47	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Clever .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact899	1510.54	1510.93	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact900	1511.03	1511.53	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Excellent .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact901	1511.61	1525.89	D	PhD	s	+1	2	Yeah , in fact after our meeting uh , this morning Thilo came in and said that {vocalsound} um , there could be {pause} other differences between {vocalsound} the uh {pause} already transcribed meeting with the beeps in it and one that has {pause} just r been run through his process .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact902	1512.31	1513.02	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And that 's the purpose .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact903	1525.6	1525.86	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact904	1525.89	1533.2	D	PhD	s	+1	1	So tomorrow , {vocalsound} when we go to make the um {pause} uh , chunked file {vocalsound} for IBM , we 're going to actually compare the two .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact905	1533.2	1535.66	D	PhD	s	-1	0	So he 's gonna run his process on that same meeting ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact906	1536.13	1536.79	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Great idea !
Bmr020.D.dialogueact907	1536.41	1541.75	D	PhD	s	+1	1	and then we 're gonna do the beep - ify on both , and listen to them and see if we notice any real differences .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact908	1538.94	1539.16	G	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	Beep - ify !
Bmr020.C.dialogueact909	1541.89	1542.08	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact910	1542.08	1545.77	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	now one thing that prevented us from apply you {disfmarker} you from applying {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact911	1545.91	1546.25	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact912	1546.25	1546.63	C	Postdoc	s^m^na	-1	0	The training {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact913	1546.63	1547.72	C	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	So that is the training meeting .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact916	1548.33	1548.56	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact914	1548.04	1548.2	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr020.D.dialogueact915	1548.2	1549.07	D	PhD	s	-1	0	w and we know that .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact917	1549.07	1554.36	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Wel - uh we just wanna if {disfmarker} if there 're any major differences between {vocalsound} doing it on the hand
Bmr020.C.dialogueact918	1550.19	1550.47	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact919	1555.9	1556.87	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Oh , interesting .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact920	1557.29	1557.36	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Ah !
Bmr020.A.dialogueact922	1557.82	1558.1	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact921	1557.36	1558.19	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact923	1558.63	1559.37	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Interesting idea .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact925	1562.16	1562.41	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Great .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact924	1561.97	1570.89	G	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	So this training meeting , uh w un is that uh {pause} some data where we have uh very um , {vocalsound} you know , accurate {pause} time marks ? for {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact926	1570.8	1573.02	C	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	I went back and hand - marked the {pause} ba the bins ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact927	1573.02	1574.93	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I ment I mentioned that last week .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact928	1574.04	1574.41	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact929	1574.41	1574.72	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact930	1575.01	1582.63	D	PhD	s	-1	0	But the {disfmarker} but there 's {disfmarker} yeah , but there is this one issue with them in that there 're {disfmarker} {vocalsound} there are time boundaries in there that occur in the middle of speech .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact931	1575.24	1575.63	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Because {disfmarker}
Bmr020.D.dialogueact932	1583.37	1583.89	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr020.D.dialogueact933	1585.06	1586.44	D	PhD	s^e.%--	-1	0	Like when we went t to
Bmr020.D.dialogueact934	1586.44	1587.0	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bmr020.D.dialogueact935	1587.27	1593.87	D	PhD	s^e	+1	0	When I was listening to the original file that Adam had , it 's like you {disfmarker} you hear a word then you hear a beep {vocalsound} and then you hear the continuation of what is the same sentence .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact936	1593.12	1594.23	A	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's on the other channel .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact937	1595.05	1596.26	A	Grad	s	+1	1	That 's because of channel overlap .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact938	1597.01	1597.24	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	Well ,
Bmr020.D.dialogueact939	1597.31	1598.98	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and so the {disfmarker} th
Bmr020.C.dialogueact940	1598.27	1598.46	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact942	1599.26	1599.63	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} i
Bmr020.D.dialogueact941	1599.11	1603.54	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So there are these chunks that look like uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that have uh {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact943	1604.09	1606.01	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean that 's not gonna be true of the foreground speaker .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact944	1606.01	1607.79	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	That 'll only be if it 's the background speaker .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact945	1609.1	1609.2	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact946	1609.2	1614.41	D	PhD	s	-1	0	So you 'll {disfmarker} you 'll have a chunk of , you know , channel {vocalsound} A which starts at zero and ends at ten ,
Bmr020.D.dialogueact947	1615.05	1616.99	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and then the same channel starting at eleven ,
Bmr020.D.dialogueact948	1616.99	1618.12	D	PhD	s	-1	0	ending at fifteen ,
Bmr020.D.dialogueact949	1618.93	1620.58	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and then again , starting at sixteen ,
Bmr020.D.dialogueact950	1620.58	1621.73	D	PhD	s	-1	0	ending at twenty .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact951	1621.95	1622.15	D	PhD	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right ,
Bmr020.D.dialogueact952	1622.15	1626.36	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so that 's three chunks where {vocalsound} actually we w can just make one chunk out of that
Bmr020.D.dialogueact954	1626.87	1628.87	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which is A , zero , twenty .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact953	1626.62	1626.94	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact955	1627.82	1628.18	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact957	1629.42	1630.2	A	Grad	s^na	-1	0	That 's what I just said ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact956	1628.95	1629.13	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Sure .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact958	1629.68	1629.94	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Sure .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact959	1630.25	1630.48	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact960	1630.65	1630.77	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact961	1630.77	1632.44	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	So I just wanted to make sure that it was clear .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact962	1632.67	1632.8	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact963	1632.8	1633.3	C	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	I thought that was {disfmarker}
Bmr020.D.dialogueact964	1632.82	1638.08	D	PhD	fg|s.%-	-1	0	So {vocalsound} if you were to use these , you have to be careful not to pull out these individual {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact965	1633.69	1633.78	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact966	1636.14	1636.37	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh !
Bmr020.G.dialogueact967	1636.63	1637.0	G	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I mean it {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact968	1638.26	1638.64	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact969	1638.64	1647.33	G	PhD	s	+1	1	I mean w I mean what I would {disfmarker} I was interested in is having {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a se having time marks for the beginnings and ends of speech
Bmr020.G.dialogueact970	1648.25	1649.46	G	PhD	s^e	+1	0	by each speaker .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact971	1649.44	1650.56	A	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	Well , that 's definitely a problem .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact972	1650.3	1654.6	G	PhD	s^df	+1	1	Uh , because we could use that to fine tune our alignment process
Bmr020.A.dialogueact975	1655.11	1655.43	A	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	Battery .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact974	1654.95	1655.22	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact973	1654.78	1655.9	G	PhD	s^e	-1	0	to make it more accurate .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact976	1655.93	1656.33	B	PhD	qy^bu^d^m^rt^t3	-1	0	Battery ?
Bmr020.D.dialogueact977	1656.31	1656.64	D	PhD	s^aa^t3	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact978	1657.24	1657.76	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact979	1658.29	1658.74	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact980	1658.74	1664.41	G	PhD	s	-1	0	it {disfmarker} I don't care that you know , there 's actually abutting segments that we have to join together .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact981	1664.41	1664.97	G	PhD	s	-1	0	That 's fine .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact982	1665.13	1665.37	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact983	1665.55	1674.06	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But what we do care about is that {vocalsound} the beginnings and ends um {pause} are actually close to the speech {vocalsound} inside of that
Bmr020.D.dialogueact984	1674.39	1674.54	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr020.D.dialogueact986	1674.54	1676.94	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I think Jane tightened these up by hand .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact985	1674.53	1674.84	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bmr020.B.dialogueact988	1676.96	1677.17	B	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .

Bmr020.G.dialogueact990	1676.98	1678.93	G	PhD	qw	-1	0	so what is the {disfmarker} sort of how tight are they ?
Bmr020.F.dialogueact991	1677.55	1678.41	F	Professor	s^ba^t3	-1	0	Uh , it looks much better .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact992	1678.66	1678.84	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact993	1679.24	1679.66	B	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Looks good .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact994	1680.1	1684.89	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	They were , um , reasonably tight , but not excruciatingly tight .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact995	1684.67	1684.88	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact996	1685.19	1686.35	C	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	That would 've taken more time .

Bmr020.G.dialogueact1008	1693.61	1698.41	G	PhD	s^df^na	+1	0	You always want to have a little bit of pause or nonspeech around the speech , say for recognition purposes .

Bmr020.C.dialogueact1015	1715.48	1727.55	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but my main goal was {pause} um , in these areas where you have a three - way overlap {vocalsound} and one of the overlaps involves " yeah " , {vocalsound} and it 's swimming in this huge bin , {vocalsound} I wanted to get it so that it was clo more closely localized .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1016	1719.41	1719.73	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1017	1721.81	1722.15	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1018	1724.68	1724.94	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1019	1728.34	1732.6	G	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	But are we talking about , I don't know , {pause} a {vocalsound} {pause} tenth of a second ?
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1020	1732.71	1733.21	G	PhD	%--	-1	0	a {disfmarker} ?
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1021	1734.09	1734.47	G	PhD	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	You know ?
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1022	1734.69	1737.39	G	PhD	qw^bu	-1	0	How {disfmarker} how much {disfmarker} how much extra would you allow at most {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1023	1736.31	1737.63	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I wanted to {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1024	1737.86	1741.88	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	I wanted it to be able to {disfmarker} l he be heard normally ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1025	1741.99	1742.37	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1026	1742.56	1750.15	C	Postdoc	s^e	+1	1	so that if you {disfmarker} if you play {pause} back that bin and have it in the mode where it stops at the boundary , {vocalsound} it sounds like a normal word .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1027	1747.88	1748.18	G	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1028	1750.15	1751.45	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	It doesn't sound like the person {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1029	1752.48	1753.66	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	i it sounds normal .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1030	1753.66	1755.55	C	Postdoc	s^e	+1	0	It 's as if the person could 've stopped there .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1031	1753.75	1754.14	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1033	1756.23	1758.06	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	And it wouldn't have been an awkward place to stop .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1032	1755.89	1756.23	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1034	1758.51	1762.39	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Now sometimes you know , it 's {disfmarker} these are involved in places where there was no time .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1035	1762.71	1765.83	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And so , {vocalsound} {vocalsound} there wouldn't be {pause} a gap afterwards because {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1036	1765.59	1765.86	G	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1037	1766.13	1775.23	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean some cases , there 're some people {pause} um , who {disfmarker} who have very long {pause} segments of discourse where , {vocalsound} you know , they 'll {disfmarker} they 'll breath {pause} and then I put a break .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1038	1775.41	1775.72	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1039	1776.42	1778.02	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But other than that , it 's really pretty continuous
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1040	1778.02	1782.68	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	and this includes things like going from one sentence into the {disfmarker} u one utterance into the next , one sentence into the next ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1041	1783.21	1783.57	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1042	1784.69	1786.26	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	w without really stopping .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1043	1786.26	1787.64	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	I mean {disfmarker} i they , i
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1044	1787.64	1790.36	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know in writing you have this {vocalsound} two spaces and a big gap
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1045	1787.78	1787.87	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1046	1790.36	1790.63	C	Postdoc	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	you know .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1047	1790.53	1790.76	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1048	1791.07	1793.74	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but uh {pause} {vocalsound} i some people are planning
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1049	1793.74	1796.93	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and , you know , I mean , a lot {disfmarker} we always are planning {pause} what we 're going to say next .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1050	1796.64	1797.0	G	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1051	1797.75	1808.48	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But uh , in which case , the gap between {pause} these two complete syntactic units , {vocalsound} um , which of course n spoken things are not always complete syntactically ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1052	1808.48	1813.72	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but it would be a shorter p shorter break {vocalsound} than {vocalsound} maybe you might like .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1053	1812.07	1812.39	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1054	1813.95	1820.71	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But the goal there was to {pause} not have {vocalsound} the text be so {disfmarker} so crudely {pause} parsed in a time bin .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1055	1820.82	1827.76	C	Postdoc	s^df.%--	-1	0	I mean , because {vocalsound} from a discourse m purpose {pause} it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's more {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's more useful to be able to see {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1056	1827.85	1835.22	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and also you know , from a speech recognition purpose my impression is that {vocalsound} if you have too long a unit , it 's {disfmarker} it doesn't help you very much either ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1057	1835.22	1836.05	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	cuz of the memory .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1058	1835.31	1835.81	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Well , yeah .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1059	1836.02	1836.46	G	PhD	s^na	-1	0	That 's fine .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1060	1837.25	1845.02	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	So , that means that {vocalsound} the amount of time after something is variable depending partly on context ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1061	1845.02	1854.31	C	Postdoc	s	+1	1	but my general goal {vocalsound} when there was {pause} sufficient space , room , pause {pause} after it {pause} to have it be {pause} kind of a natural feeling {pause} gap .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1062	1853.83	1854.12	G	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1063	1855.43	1857.24	C	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	Which I c I don't know what it would be quantified as .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1064	1857.44	1867.65	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	You know , Wally Chafe says that {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} in producing narratives , the spurts that people use {vocalsound} tend to be , {vocalsound} uh , that the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} what would be a pause might be something like two {disfmarker} two seconds .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1065	1867.77	1868.09	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1066	1868.78	1871.25	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	And um , that would be , you know one speaker .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1067	1872.23	1875.16	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	The discourse {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the people who look at turn taking often do use {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1068	1874.5	1874.76	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1069	1875.27	1880.02	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I was interested that you chose uh , {vocalsound} you know um , {comment} the {disfmarker} you know that you use
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1070	1880.02	1883.46	C	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	cuz I think that 's a unit that would be more consistent with sociolinguistics .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1072	1884.35	1884.61	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1071	1884.26	1887.5	G	PhD	s	+1	0	Well we chose um , you know , half a second
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1073	1887.5	1898.45	G	PhD	s^df	+1	0	because {vocalsound} if {disfmarker} if you go much larger , you have a {disfmarker} y you know , your {disfmarker} your statement about how much overlap there is becomes less , {vocalsound} um , precise ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1075	1898.71	1899.39	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1074	1898.51	1903.52	G	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because you include more of actual pause time into what you consider overlap speech .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1076	1904.5	1904.84	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1077	1905.0	1905.51	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	so ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1078	1906.01	1907.19	G	PhD	s	-1	0	it 's sort of a compromise ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1080	1907.66	1927.54	B	PhD	s^bk|s	+1	0	Yeah . {comment} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yeah , I also used I think something around zero point five seconds for the speech - nonspeech detector {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1079	1907.19	1908.89	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's also based {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1081	1908.89	1918.22	G	PhD	s^e	+1	0	I mean Liz suggested that value based on {vocalsound} the distribution of pause times that you see in Switchboard and {disfmarker} and other corpora .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1082	1917.39	1917.66	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1083	1919.01	1919.42	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1084	1920.78	1921.19	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1085	1927.54	1929.38	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	for the minimum silence length .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1086	1927.73	1928.04	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1087	1929.63	1929.97	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1088	1930.5	1930.71	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1089	1930.55	1930.75	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1090	1931.92	1932.2	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1091	1933.15	1933.37	G	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1092	1935.12	1937.62	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	In any case , this {disfmarker} this uh , meeting {pause} that I hand {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1093	1937.95	1939.56	C	Postdoc	s	+1	1	I {disfmarker} I hand - adjusted two of them
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1094	1939.68	1940.52	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mentioned before ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1095	1939.84	1940.1	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1097	1940.72	1941.78	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and I sent {disfmarker} I sent email ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1096	1940.61	1940.96	G	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1099	1941.88	1941.99	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1098	1941.68	1945.92	G	PhD	s	+1	1	So {disfmarker} so at some point we will try to fine - tune our forced alignment
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1100	1942.84	1944.67	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And I sent the {comment} {pause} path .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1101	1945.92	1948.07	G	PhD	s^am^e	+1	0	maybe using those as references
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1102	1949.0	1952.83	G	PhD	s	-1	0	because you know , what you would do is you would play with different parameters .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1103	1952.83	1960.61	G	PhD	s	-1	0	And to get an object You need an objective {vocalsound} measure of how closely you can align the models to the actual speech .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1104	1961.23	1965.66	G	PhD	s	-1	0	And that 's where your your data would be {pause} very important to have .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1105	1965.99	1966.57	G	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So , I will {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1106	1967.81	1968.11	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1107	1968.98	1976.48	B	PhD	s	-1	0	Yeah and hopefully the new meetings {pause} which will start from the channelized version will {disfmarker} will have better time boundaries {pause} and alignments .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1108	1975.4	1975.84	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1109	1977.79	1978.09	G	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1110	1978.81	1985.85	C	Postdoc	s	+1	1	But I like this idea of {disfmarker} uh , for our purposes for the {disfmarker} for the IBM preparation , {vocalsound} uh , n having these {pause} joined together ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1111	1982.62	1982.77	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1113	1986.14	1986.25	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1112	1985.85	1986.48	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and uh {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1114	1987.25	1988.12	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It makes a lot of sense .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1115	1988.33	1990.68	C	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	And in terms of transcription , it would be easy to do it that way .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1116	1988.4	1988.6	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1117	1990.9	1993.13	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	The way that they have with the longer units ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1118	1990.96	1991.02	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1119	1993.13	1995.36	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	not having to fuss with adding these units at this time .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1120	1994.23	1994.4	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1122	1995.08	2001.03	B	PhD	s^rt	+1	0	Whi - which could have one drawback . If there is uh a backchannel in between those three things ,
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1121	1994.87	1995.07	G	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1123	1999.85	2000.24	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1124	2001.64	2005.45	B	PhD	s^e	+1	0	the {disfmarker} the n the backchannel will {disfmarker} will occur at the end of {disfmarker} of those three .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1125	2004.92	2005.37	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1126	2005.45	2013.24	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and in {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} in the previous version where in the n which is used now , {vocalsound} there , the backchannel would {disfmarker} would be in - between there somewhere ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1128	2013.46	2013.72	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	so .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1127	2013.42	2013.68	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1130	2014.05	2014.89	B	PhD	s	-1	0	That would be more natural
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1129	2013.89	2014.04	C	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1131	2014.24	2014.52	C	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	Well ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1132	2014.89	2015.05	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1133	2014.94	2015.67	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	that 's {disfmarker} that 's right ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1134	2015.67	2019.33	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	but you know , thi this brings me to the other f stage of this which I discussed with you earlier today ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1135	2019.02	2019.13	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1136	2019.54	2025.82	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	which is {vocalsound} the second stage is {vocalsound} um , w what to do {pause} in terms of the transcribers adjustment of these data .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1137	2025.82	2026.77	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I discussed this with you too .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1138	2027.18	2028.65	C	Postdoc	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Um , the tr
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1139	2028.65	2032.08	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so the idea initially was , we would get {vocalsound} uh , for the new meetings ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1140	2032.08	2038.44	C	Postdoc	s^e	+1	1	so the e EDU meetings , that {vocalsound} Thilo ha has now presegmented all of them for us , on a channel by channel basis .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1141	2039.0	2039.71	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	And um ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1142	2040.04	2044.53	C	Postdoc	s	+1	1	so , I 've assigned {disfmarker} I 've {disfmarker} I 've assigned them to our transcribers
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1143	2044.86	2045.91	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and um ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1144	2046.4	2047.64	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so far I 've discussed it with one ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1145	2047.74	2048.29	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	with uh {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1146	2048.37	2051.06	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And I had a {pause} about an hour discussion with her about this yesterday ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1147	2051.06	2053.89	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	we went through {vocalsound} uh EDU - one , at some extent .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1148	2054.58	2063.19	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And it occurred to me that {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} that {vocalsound} basically what we have in this kind of a format is {disfmarker} you could consider it as a staggered mixed file ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1149	2063.19	2067.17	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	we had some discussion over the weekend a about {disfmarker} at {disfmarker} at this other meeting that we were all a at {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1150	2067.66	2073.33	C	Postdoc	fh|s^e	-1	0	um , {vocalsound} about whether the tran the IBM transcribers should hear a single channel audio , or a mixed channel audio .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1151	2073.95	2081.63	C	Postdoc	fh|s	+1	0	And um , {vocalsound} in {disfmarker} in a way , by {disfmarker} by having this {disfmarker} this chunk and then the backchannel {vocalsound} after it , it 's like a stagal staggered mixed channel .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1152	2082.18	2086.93	C	Postdoc	fh|s.%--	-1	0	And um , {vocalsound} it occurred {pause} to me in my discussion with her yesterday that um ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1153	2087.41	2087.82	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1154	2088.78	2096.02	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	the {disfmarker} {pause} the {disfmarker} the maximal gain , it 's {disfmarker} from the IBM {pause} people , may be in long stretches of connected speech .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1155	2096.39	2102.64	C	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	So it 's basically a whole bunch of words {vocalsound} which they can really do , because of the continuity within that person 's turn .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1156	2103.18	2113.84	C	Postdoc	fh|s^cs	+1	0	So , what I 'm thinking , and it may be that not all meetings will be good for this , {comment} but {disfmarker} but what I 'm thinking is that {vocalsound} in the EDU meetings , they tend to be {vocalsound} driven by a couple of dominant speakers .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1157	2114.27	2124.76	C	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	1	And , if the chunked files focused on the dominant speakers , {vocalsound} then , when {disfmarker} when it got s patched together when it comes back from IBM , we can add the backchannels .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1158	2125.36	2129.88	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	It seems to me {vocalsound} that {vocalsound} um , you know , the backchannels per - se wouldn't be so hard ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1159	2129.88	2135.05	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	but then there 's this question of the time {pause} @ @ {comment} uh , marking , and whether the beeps would be {vocalsound} uh y y y
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1160	2135.14	2138.71	C	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	And I 'm not exactly sure how that {disfmarker} how that would work with the {disfmarker} with the backchannels .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1161	2139.61	2139.98	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	And ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1162	2140.31	2141.1	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	so um {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1163	2141.51	2149.23	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	And certainly things that are {vocalsound} intrusions of multiple words , {vocalsound} taken out of context and displaced in time from where they occurred , {vocalsound} that would be hard .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1164	2149.66	2161.05	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So , m my {vocalsound} thought is {pause} i I 'm having this transcriber go through {vocalsound} the EDU - one meeting , and indicate a start time {nonvocalsound} f for each dominant speaker , endpoi end time for each dominant speaker ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1165	2161.05	2166.62	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and the idea that {vocalsound} these units would be generated for the dominant speakers , {vocalsound} and maybe not for the other channels .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1166	2167.69	2172.88	A	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	Yeah the only , um , disadvantage of that is , then it 's hard to use an automatic method to do that .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1167	2173.75	2178.95	A	Grad	s^na	-1	0	The advantage is that it 's probably faster to do that than it is to use the automated method and correct it .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1168	2179.14	2179.44	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1169	2179.85	2180.28	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	Well , it {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1171	2180.58	2181.26	A	Grad	s	-1	0	We 'll just have to see .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1170	2180.28	2180.65	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1172	2180.65	2188.46	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I think um , you know , the original plan was that the transcriber would adjust the t the boundaries , and all that for all the channels
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1173	2188.46	2190.67	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	but , {vocalsound} you know , that is so time - consuming ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1174	2190.67	2195.4	C	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	and since we have a bottleneck here , we want to get IBM things that are usable s as soon as possible ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1175	2195.4	2198.64	C	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	then this seemed to me it 'd be a way of gett to get them a flood of data ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1176	2198.96	2200.76	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	which would be useful when it comes back to us .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1177	2201.72	2202.44	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	And um {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1179	2203.34	2203.59	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1178	2203.22	2214.68	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Oh also , at the same time she {disfmarker} when she goes through this , she 'll be {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} If there 's anything that {vocalsound} was encoded as a pause , but really has something transcribable in it , {vocalsound} then she 's going to {vocalsound} uh , make a mark {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1180	2215.28	2218.99	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	w uh , so you know , so {vocalsound} that {disfmarker} that bin would be marked as it {disfmarker} as double dots
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1181	2219.38	2220.51	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	and she 'll just add an S .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1182	2221.24	2229.29	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	And in the other {disfmarker} in the other case , if it 's marked as speech , {vocalsound} and really there 's nothing transcribable in it , then she 's going to put a s dash ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1183	2229.29	2238.06	C	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	and I 'll go through and it {disfmarker} and um , you know , with a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} with a substitution command , get it so that it 's clear that those are the other category .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1184	2238.06	2239.38	C	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	I 'll just , you know , recode them .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1185	2239.88	2250.36	C	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	But um , {vocalsound} um , the transcribable events {pause} that um , I 'm considering in this , {vocalsound} uh , continue to be {vocalsound} laugh , as well as speech , and cough and things like that ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1186	2250.36	2251.67	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so I 'm not stripping out anything ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1187	2251.67	2254.56	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	just {disfmarker} just you know , being very lenient in what 's considered speech .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1189	2256.19	2256.43	C	Postdoc	qw^d	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1188	2255.83	2256.05	D	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	Jane ?
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1190	2256.45	2262.49	D	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	In terms of the {disfmarker} this new procedure you 're suggesting , {vocalsound} um , u what is the {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1191	2260.65	2261.6	A	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	It 's not that different .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1192	2263.65	2264.59	D	PhD	s	-1	0	So I 'm a little confused ,
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1193	2264.59	2266.17	D	PhD	qw^bu^rt	-1	0	because how do we know where to put beeps ?
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1194	2266.41	2267.34	D	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	Is it {disfmarker} i d y is it {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1195	2266.99	2267.42	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1197	2267.72	2268.67	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Transcriber will do it .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1196	2267.7	2272.18	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So what it {disfmarker} what it {disfmarker} what it involves is {disfmarker} is really a s uh , {vocalsound} uh , the original pr procedure ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1198	2272.46	2279.4	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	but {vocalsound} only applied to {pause} uh , a certain {pause} strategically chosen {pause} s aspect of the data .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1199	2279.83	2281.81	A	Grad	s	-1	0	We pick the easy parts of the data basically ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1200	2279.87	2280.2	C	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1201	2281.81	2283.66	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and transcriber marks it by hand .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1202	2281.82	2282.17	C	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	You got it .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1203	2284.39	2285.13	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	And because {disfmarker}
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1204	2284.45	2285.91	D	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	But after we 've done Thilo 's thing .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1205	2286.06	2286.28	A	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1206	2286.44	2286.73	C	Postdoc	s^ar	-1	0	Yes !
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1207	2287.0	2287.6	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , after .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1209	2287.6	2287.9	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1208	2287.18	2287.55	C	Postdoc	s^ar^r	-1	0	Yes !
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1211	2287.9	2289.17	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	I didn't {disfmarker} I didn't understand that .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1210	2287.77	2288.07	C	Postdoc	s^aa^fe	-1	0	Oh yeah !
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1212	2289.17	2289.45	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1213	2289.89	2290.1	B	PhD	fg	-1	0	So ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1214	2290.58	2291.68	B	PhD	s	-1	0	I 'm @ @ {disfmarker} now I 'm confused .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1215	2291.97	2292.17	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1216	2292.31	2293.98	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	We start with your presegmented version {disfmarker}
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1217	2292.6	2293.93	G	PhD	s	-1	0	OK , and I 'm leaving .
Bmr020.E.dialogueact1218	2294.4	2295.4	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , I have to go as well .
Bmr020.G.dialogueact1219	2295.24	2296.0	G	PhD	fh	-1	0	So , um {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1220	2295.89	2296.92	A	Grad	s^bk|s^co	-1	0	OK , leave the mikes on ,
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1221	2296.92	2297.92	A	Grad	s^co	-1	0	and just put them on the table .
Bmr020.E.dialogueact1222	2297.9	2298.2	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.E.dialogueact1223	2298.87	2299.17	E	Grad	s^ft	-1	0	Thanks .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1224	2302.26	2304.32	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	We start with the presegmented version {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1225	2303.74	2305.25	A	Grad	s^co^t3	-1	0	Let me mark you as no digits .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1226	2304.45	2305.74	B	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	You start with the presegmentation ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1227	2305.74	2306.5	B	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	r {vocalsound} yeah ?
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1228	2305.99	2306.17	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1229	2307.56	2316.76	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And then um , {vocalsound} the transcriber , {vocalsound} instead of going painstakingly through all the channels and moving the boundaries around , and deciding if it 's speech or not , but not transcribing anything .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1230	2317.69	2317.99	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK ?
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1231	2317.99	2324.6	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Instead of doing that , which was our original plan , {vocalsound} the tra They focus on the dominant speaker {disfmarker}
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1232	2320.23	2320.55	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1233	2322.25	2325.17	D	PhD	s	-1	0	They just {vocalsound} do that on {pause} the main channels .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1234	2325.08	2325.29	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1235	2325.52	2329.91	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So what they do is they identify who 's the di dominant speaker , and when the speaker starts .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1236	2325.56	2325.77	D	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1237	2328.6	2328.94	B	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1238	2330.93	2331.24	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1239	2331.83	2332.83	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	So I mean , you 're still gonna {disfmarker}
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1241	2332.99	2333.49	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	And you just {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1240	2332.83	2333.08	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	So we 're {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1242	2333.08	2334.82	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It 's based on your se presegmentation ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1243	2334.82	2335.88	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that 's the basic {pause} thing .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1244	2335.93	2341.78	B	PhD	qy^d^rt	+1	1	and you just use the s the segments of the dominant speaker then ? For {disfmarker} for sending to {disfmarker} to IBM
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1245	2341.78	2342.07	B	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1246	2341.79	2341.88	C	Postdoc	s^aa	+1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1247	2342.12	2342.53	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1248	2342.71	2351.37	D	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	So , now Jane , my question is {vocalsound} when they 're all done adjusting the w time boundaries for the dominant speaker , {comment} have they then also erased the time boundaries for the other ones ?
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1249	2347.03	2347.37	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1250	2351.76	2352.38	C	Postdoc	s^ar	-1	0	Uh No . No , no .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1252	2352.58	2352.72	C	Postdoc	s^ar	-1	0	Huh - uh .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1253	2352.78	2353.29	C	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	S
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1251	2352.5	2354.33	D	PhD	qw.%-	-1	0	So how will we know who {disfmarker}
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1254	2353.79	2354.03	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1255	2354.06	2357.23	C	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker} that 's why she 's notating the start and end points of the dominant speakers .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1256	2357.88	2364.78	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	So , on a {disfmarker} you know , so {vocalsound} i in EDU - one , i as far as I listened to it , you start off with a {disfmarker} a s section by Jerry .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1257	2364.78	2366.97	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	So Jerry starts at minute so - and - so ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1258	2367.16	2368.63	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	and goes until minute so - and - so .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1259	2368.63	2369.97	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	And then Mark Paskin comes in .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1260	2370.32	2372.34	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	And he starts at {vocalsound} minute such - and - such ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1261	2372.66	2374.13	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	and goes on till minute so - and - so .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1262	2374.55	2374.9	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1263	2375.1	2379.18	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And then {vocalsound} meanwhile , she 's listening to {vocalsound} {pause} both of these guys ' channels ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1264	2379.48	2384.03	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	determining if there 're any cases of misclassification of speech as nothing , and nothing as speech ,
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1265	2383.23	2383.58	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1266	2384.02	2384.27	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1267	2384.88	2387.46	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and {vocalsound} a and adding a tag if that happens .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1268	2385.9	2387.64	D	PhD	qy^bu^d	-1	0	So she does the adjustments on those guys ?
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1269	2388.22	2396.92	C	Postdoc	s	+1	1	But you know , I wanted to say , his segmentation is so good , that {vocalsound} um , the part that I listened to with her yesterday {vocalsound} didn't need any adjustments of the bins .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1270	2393.08	2393.6	B	PhD	s^2	-1	0	On that meeting .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1271	2394.86	2395.12	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1272	2397.07	2397.94	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So far we haven't .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1273	2398.21	2400.17	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So this is not gonna be a major part of the process ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1274	2400.33	2402.55	C	Postdoc	s^e.%-	-1	0	at least {disfmarker} least not in {disfmarker} not on ones that {disfmarker} that really {disfmarker}
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1275	2400.49	2404.58	D	PhD	qh^cs	-1	0	So if you don't have to adjust the bins , why not just do what it {disfmarker} for all the channels ?
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1276	2402.76	2403.0	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm ?
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1277	2404.83	2406.76	D	PhD	qh^cs	-1	0	Why not just throw all the channels to IBM ?
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1278	2406.99	2409.34	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	Well there 's the question o of {pause} whether {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1279	2410.97	2411.51	C	Postdoc	h	-1	0	Well , OK .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1280	2411.79	2421.15	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	She i It 's a question of how much time we want our transcriber to invest here {vocalsound} when she 's gonna have to invest that when it comes back from IBM anyway .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1281	2421.01	2421.39	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1282	2421.68	2433.16	C	Postdoc	qy	-1	0	So if it 's only inserting " mm - hmm "s here and there , then , wouldn't that be something that would be just as efficient to do at this end , instead of having it go through I B M , then be patched together , then be double checked here .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1283	2421.74	2421.89	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1284	2424.22	2424.5	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1285	2427.06	2427.12	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1286	2428.73	2428.82	B	PhD	%	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1287	2433.62	2439.81	B	PhD	s^cs^ng	+1	2	But then we could just use the {disfmarker} the output of the detector , and do the beeping on it , and send it to I B
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1288	2440.8	2441.96	D	PhD	s^2	+1	1	Without having her check anything .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1290	2442.49	2442.66	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1289	2442.44	2442.65	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1291	2443.26	2443.85	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	Well , I guess {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1293	2444.38	2446.85	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	I think we just {disfmarker} we just have to listen to it and see how good they are .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1292	2444.33	2446.08	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	For some meetings , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sure it {disfmarker} i
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1294	2446.64	2446.75	B	PhD	%	-1	0	n
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1295	2446.97	2447.73	C	Postdoc	s^na	+1	0	I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm open to that ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1296	2447.73	2447.89	C	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	it was {disfmarker}
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1297	2447.75	2448.82	F	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah , if it 's working well ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1299	2449.12	2451.14	B	PhD	s	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker} And some {disfmarker} on some meetings it 's good .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1298	2449.0	2450.19	F	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	that sounds like a good idea
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1300	2450.19	2452.27	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	since as you say you have to do stuff with the other end anyway .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1301	2452.32	2452.52	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1302	2452.46	2452.71	C	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	Well yea
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1303	2452.71	2453.15	C	Postdoc	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	OK , good .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1305	2453.27	2454.48	C	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	I mean the detector , this {disfmarker}
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1304	2453.18	2455.22	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	Yeah , I mean we have to fix it when it comes back anyhow .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1306	2454.66	2454.84	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1307	2454.87	2460.18	C	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	Now , you were saying that they {disfmarker} they differ in how well they work depending on channel s sys systems and stuff .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1308	2458.24	2458.38	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1309	2459.26	2465.38	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	So we should perhaps just select meetings on which the speech - nonspeech detection works well ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1310	2461.34	2462.4	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	But EDU is great .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1311	2465.43	2470.14	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	and just use , {vocalsound} those meetings to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to send to IBM and , do the other ones .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1312	2467.32	2468.21	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Release to begin with .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1313	2468.83	2469.35	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	How interesting .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1315	2469.55	2470.11	C	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	You know {disfmarker}
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1314	2469.53	2470.89	F	Professor	s	-1	0	What 's the problem {disfmarker} the l I forget .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1316	2470.89	2472.12	F	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Is the problem the lapel ,
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1317	2472.12	2472.87	F	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker}
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1318	2473.38	2474.89	B	PhD	h|s^aap	-1	0	Uh , it really depends .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1319	2475.59	2482.03	B	PhD	s^aap^rt	-1	0	Um , my {disfmarker} my {disfmarker} my impression is that it 's better for meetings with fewer speakers ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1320	2482.27	2485.98	B	PhD	s^aap^j	-1	0	and it 's better for {disfmarker} {vocalsound} for meetings where nobody is breathing .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1321	2487.44	2487.51	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1323	2488.38	2488.69	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1322	2488.03	2488.8	F	Professor	s^j	-1	0	the dead meetings .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1324	2488.97	2489.22	B	PhD	%	-1	0	get {disfmarker}
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1325	2489.34	2489.75	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	That 's it .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1326	2490.21	2494.88	D	PhD	s	-1	0	So in fact this might suggest an alternative sort of a {disfmarker} a c a hybrid between these two things .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1327	2491.12	2492.07	A	Grad	s^j^nd^t3	-1	0	No , the undead meeting ,
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1328	2492.07	2492.2	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1329	2492.66	2492.75	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1330	2494.72	2494.99	C	Postdoc	qy^bh	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1331	2494.88	2498.09	D	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	So the {disfmarker} the one suggestion is you know we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we run Thilo 's thing
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1332	2498.09	2500.07	D	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	and then we have somebody go and adjust all the time boundaries
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1335	2500.19	2500.34	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1333	2499.95	2500.25	C	Postdoc	qy^bh	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1334	2500.07	2500.84	D	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	and we send it to IBM .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1336	2500.84	2503.32	D	PhD	s^cs	+1	2	The other one is {vocalsound} we just run his thing and send it to IBM .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1338	2503.83	2503.96	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1337	2503.71	2507.9	D	PhD	s	+1	0	There 's a {disfmarker} a another possibility if we find that there are some problems ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1339	2507.58	2507.71	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1341	2508.3	2508.49	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1340	2507.9	2514.36	D	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	and that is {vocalsound} if we go ahead and we {vocalsound} just run his , and we generate the beeps file , then we have somebody listen beeps file .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1342	2514.41	2514.6	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1344	2514.96	2515.64	B	PhD	s^2	-1	0	And erase {disfmarker}
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1343	2514.84	2518.15	D	PhD	s^cs.%--	+1	0	And they listen to each section and say " yes , no " whether that section is
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1345	2516.1	2516.27	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1346	2518.63	2519.57	C	Postdoc	s^2	-1	0	Is intelligible .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1347	2519.03	2520.41	D	PhD	s^m^na	-1	0	i i intelligible or not .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1348	2520.63	2527.44	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	And it just {disfmarker} You know , there 's a little interface which will {disfmarker} for all the " yes " - es it {disfmarker} then that will be the final {vocalsound} beep file .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1349	2523.13	2523.28	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1350	2524.47	2524.59	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Blech .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1351	2525.87	2526.53	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	That 's interesting !
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1352	2526.53	2529.64	C	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	Cuz that 's {disfmarker} that 's directly related to the e end task .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1353	2529.66	2530.41	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Stress test .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1354	2529.86	2530.12	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1355	2530.97	2531.79	C	Postdoc	s^ba^fe	-1	0	How interesting !
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1356	2531.06	2531.24	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1357	2531.46	2535.26	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean it wouldn't be that much fun for a transcriber to sit there , hear it , beep , yes or no .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1358	2533.17	2533.35	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Nope .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1359	2534.91	2536.35	F	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't know .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1360	2535.85	2536.71	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	But it would be quick .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1361	2536.97	2538.26	F	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	It would be {disfmarker} kind of quick
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1362	2538.26	2539.78	F	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	but they 're still listening to everything .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1363	2539.94	2540.96	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	But there 's no adjusting .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1364	2541.06	2541.9	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	And that 's what 's slow .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1365	2541.9	2543.49	D	PhD	s^df^r	-1	0	There 's no adjusting of time boundaries .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1366	2542.64	2544.71	C	Postdoc	s^nd	-1	0	Well , {vocalsound} eh , listening does take time too .

Bmr020.B.dialogueact1545	2777.89	2778.42	B	PhD	s^t1	-1	0	Let me think .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1546	2779.45	2792.1	B	PhD	s^e	+1	0	So the {pause} speech {disfmarker} the amount of speech that is missed by the {pause} detector , for a good meeting , I th is around {pause} or under one percent , I would say .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1547	2792.79	2794.26	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But there can be {disfmarker}
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1548	2795.35	2795.62	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1549	2795.96	2796.2	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	For {disfmarker}
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1550	2796.34	2796.55	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1551	2796.55	2797.59	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but there can be more {disfmarker}
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1552	2798.95	2800.15	B	PhD	s	-1	0	There 's {disfmarker} There 's more amount speech {disfmarker}
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1553	2800.53	2801.6	B	PhD	s^e.%--	-1	0	uh , more amount of {disfmarker}
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1554	2802.24	2804.24	B	PhD	s	-1	0	Yeah well , the detector says there is speech ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1555	2804.24	2804.84	B	PhD	s	-1	0	but there is none .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1556	2805.76	2809.9	B	PhD	s	-1	0	So that {disfmarker} that can be a lot when {disfmarker} when it 's really a breathy channel .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1557	2810.24	2811.49	F	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	But I think that 's less of a problem .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1559	2811.73	2811.83	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1558	2811.49	2812.03	F	Professor	s	-1	0	They 'll just listen .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1560	2812.03	2812.9	F	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's just wasted time .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1561	2813.04	2813.22	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1562	2813.64	2815.01	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	And th and that 's for a good meeting .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1563	2815.45	2818.1	F	Professor	qo	-1	0	Now what about in a meeting that you said we 've {disfmarker} you 've had some more trouble with ?
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1564	2819.85	2826.11	B	PhD	s^no	+1	1	I can't {comment} really {disfmarker} hhh , {comment} {pause} Tsk . {comment} I {pause} don't have really representative numbers , I think .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1565	2826.62	2827.36	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	That 's really {disfmarker}
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1566	2827.36	2832.43	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I did {pause} this on {disfmarker} on four meetings and only five minutes of {disfmarker} of every meet of {disfmarker} of these meetings
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1567	2832.43	2835.17	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so , {vocalsound} it 's not {disfmarker} not that representative ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1568	2835.17	2835.38	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	but ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1569	2836.19	2837.54	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	it 's perhaps ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1570	2838.24	2838.27	B	PhD	x	-1	0	Fff .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1571	2840.06	2840.47	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1572	2841.04	2844.02	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	Yeah , it 's perhaps then {disfmarker} it 's perhaps five percent of something ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1573	2844.02	2848.3	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which s uh the {disfmarker} the frames {disfmarker} speech frames which are {disfmarker} which are missed ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1574	2848.3	2850.56	B	PhD	s	-1	0	but um , I can't {disfmarker} can't really tell .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1575	2850.87	2851.1	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1576	2851.24	2860.66	F	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	So I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So i Sometime , we might wanna go back and look at it more in terms of {vocalsound} how many times is there a spurt that 's {disfmarker} that 's uh , interrupted ?
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1577	2855.72	2855.89	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1578	2859.87	2860.04	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1579	2861.45	2861.53	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1580	2861.5	2862.3	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	Something like that ?
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1581	2862.97	2870.35	C	Postdoc	s	+1	1	The other problem is , that when it {disfmarker} when it uh d i on the breathy ones , where you get {vocalsound} {vocalsound} breathing , uh , inti indicated as speech .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1582	2863.06	2863.46	F	Professor	fh	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1583	2863.6	2863.73	B	PhD	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1584	2871.07	2875.59	C	Postdoc	s^cs.%--	-1	0	And I guess we could just indicate to the transcribers not to {pause} encode that if they {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1585	2875.89	2877.06	C	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	We could still do the beep file .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1586	2875.95	2878.93	F	Professor	s^bk|s^ng	-1	0	Yeah again I {disfmarker} I think that that is probably less of a problem
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1587	2878.93	2887.5	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because if you 're {disfmarker} if there 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If {disfmarker} if a {disfmarker} if a word is {disfmarker} is split , then they might have to listen to it a few times to really understand that they can't quite get it .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1588	2879.89	2880.09	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1589	2886.28	2886.47	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1592	2888.23	2888.32	B	PhD	fg	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1590	2887.76	2887.98	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1591	2888.1	2892.34	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Whereas if they listen {nonvocalsound} to it and there 's {disfmarker} don't hear any speech I think they 'd probably just listen to it once .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1593	2890.72	2890.87	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1594	2892.34	2896.94	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	So there 'd {disfmarker} you 'd think there 'd be a {disfmarker} a factor of three or four in {disfmarker} in , uh , cost function ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1595	2894.72	2894.89	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1596	2897.11	2898.44	F	Professor	s^e	-1	0	you know , between them or something .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1597	2898.27	2898.35	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1598	2898.42	2904.04	B	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	so {disfmarker} but I think that 's {disfmarker} n that really doesn't happen very often that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that a word is cut in the middle or something .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1599	2904.1	2906.72	B	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker} that 's really not {disfmarker} not normal .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1600	2907.06	2917.41	F	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so what you 're saying is that nearly always what happens when there 's a problem is that {disfmarker} is that uh , there 's {vocalsound} some uh , uh nonspeech that uh {disfmarker} that is b interpreted as speech .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1601	2916.15	2917.06	B	PhD	s^2	-1	0	That is marked as speech .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1602	2917.06	2917.21	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1603	2917.62	2917.78	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1604	2918.16	2920.04	F	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Well then , we really should just send the stuff .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1605	2920.15	2920.72	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	That would be great .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1606	2921.05	2921.32	F	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1607	2921.42	2922.86	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Because that doesn't do any harm .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1608	2923.7	2923.95	B	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1610	2923.95	2924.31	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1609	2923.85	2926.42	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	You know , if they {disfmarker} they hear you know , a dog bark and they say what was the word ,
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1611	2926.42	2927.16	F	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	they {comment} you know , they {disfmarker}
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1612	2928.76	2929.39	B	PhD	fg|%-	-1	0	Yeah , I als I {disfmarker}
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1613	2928.83	2929.43	F	Professor	s^fe^j	-1	0	Ruff ruff !
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1614	2929.58	2935.36	B	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	Yeah I also thought of {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there are really some channels where it is almost {comment} um , only bre breathing in it .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1616	2935.74	2937.77	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And to {disfmarker} to re - run 's
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1615	2935.58	2935.92	F	Professor	qy^bh^rt	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1617	2938.2	2945.42	B	PhD	fh|s^rt	+1	0	Eh , um . Yeah . I 've got a {disfmarker} a {pause} P - a {pause} method with loops into the cross - correlation with the PZM mike ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1619	2946.01	2949.35	B	PhD	s	+1	0	and then to reject everything which {disfmarker} which seems to be breath .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1618	2945.79	2946.22	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1620	2949.82	2952.56	B	PhD	s^cs^rt	+1	1	So , I could run this on those breathy channels ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1621	2952.56	2954.08	B	PhD	s^cs.%-	-1	0	and perhaps throw out {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1622	2953.61	2954.18	A	Grad	s^ba^na	-1	0	That 's a good idea .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1623	2954.43	2955.21	C	Postdoc	s^ba^na	-1	0	Wow , that 's a great idea .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1624	2954.92	2955.18	F	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1625	2955.35	2957.73	F	Professor	s^na	-1	0	But I think {disfmarker} I th Again , I think that sort of {disfmarker} that that would be good ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1627	2958.51	2958.62	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1626	2958.04	2959.94	F	Professor	s^na	+1	1	and what that 'll do is just cut the time a little further .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1629	2960.31	2960.37	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1628	2960.02	2960.38	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1630	2960.58	2966.03	F	Professor	s	-1	0	But I think none of this is stuff that really needs somebody doing these {disfmarker} these uh , uh , explicit markings .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1631	2962.13	2962.29	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1632	2963.82	2964.25	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Excellent .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1633	2965.11	2966.08	C	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	Oh , I 'd be delighted with that ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1634	2966.08	2968.03	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I was very impressed with the {disfmarker} with the result .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1635	2968.19	2968.34	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1636	2968.21	2971.84	F	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah , cuz the other thing that was concerning me about it was that it seemed kind of specialized to the EDU meeting ,
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1637	2971.84	2974.54	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and that then when you get a meeting like this or something ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1638	2974.27	2974.38	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1639	2974.54	2977.78	F	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and you have a b a bunch of different dominant speakers
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1640	2975.3	2975.55	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh yeah ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1641	2975.85	2976.26	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	interesting .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1642	2977.78	2978.8	F	Professor	qw	-1	0	you know , how are you gonna handle it .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1644	2978.92	2979.17	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh yeah .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1643	2978.89	2980.62	F	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Whereas this sounds like a more general solution
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1646	2980.64	2980.98	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh yeah ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1647	2980.98	2982.13	C	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	I pr I much prefer this ,
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1645	2980.62	2980.83	F	Professor	%--	-1	0	is {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1648	2982.13	2983.63	C	Postdoc	s^na.%--	-1	0	I was just trying to find a way {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1650	2983.72	2987.58	C	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	Cuz I {disfmarker} I don't think the staggered mixed channel is awfully good as a way of handling overlaps .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1649	2983.67	2983.93	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1651	2987.81	2988.17	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1652	2988.72	2988.85	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1654	2989.88	2990.36	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	but uh {disfmarker}
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1653	2989.77	2990.01	D	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Well good .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1655	2990.15	2991.58	D	PhD	s	-1	0	That {disfmarker} that really simplifies thing then .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1656	2991.15	2991.61	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1657	2991.58	2993.77	D	PhD	s	+1	0	And we can just , you know , get the meeting ,
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1658	2993.85	2994.56	D	PhD	s	+1	0	process it ,
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1659	2995.25	2995.92	D	PhD	s	+1	1	put the beeps file ,

Bmr020.B.dialogueact1669	3002.89	3003.98	B	PhD	h|s	-1	0	Um , {pause} listen to it ,
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1670	3004.08	3004.56	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and then {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1671	3004.79	3005.63	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	Or at least sample it .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1673	3005.19	3005.45	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1672	3005.0	3005.82	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Well , sample it .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1676	3006.11	3006.22	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1675	3006.1	3006.53	D	PhD	s^cs^r	-1	0	Sample it .
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1674	3006.09	3007.28	F	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I would just use some samples ,

Bmr020.C.dialogueact1734	3080.59	3080.94	C	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1735	3081.17	3081.41	C	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	I mean {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1736	3081.41	3088.29	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So my standard approach has been if it 's not someone close - miked , then , they don't end up on one of the close - miked channels .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1737	3088.34	3089.41	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	They end up on a different channel .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1738	3089.58	3091.56	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	And we have any number of channels available ,
Bmr020.F.dialogueact1739	3091.19	3091.63	F	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1741	3091.95	3092.04	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1740	3091.56	3092.84	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	I mean it 's an infinite number of channels .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1743	3093.03	3093.14	B	PhD	fg	-1	0	But ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1742	3092.9	3094.45	C	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	So just put them on some other channel .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1744	3094.11	3099.61	B	PhD	s^no.%--	-1	0	when thi when this is sent to {disfmarker} to the I M - eh , I B M transcribers , I don't know if {disfmarker} if they can tell that 's really {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1745	3096.62	3096.76	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1746	3096.76	3097.27	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	that 's right .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1747	3100.03	3102.73	A	Grad	s^aa|s^df	-1	0	Yeah cuz there will be no channel on which it is foreground .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1748	3101.53	3101.69	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1749	3102.85	3103.04	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1751	3103.58	3103.93	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker}
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1750	3103.29	3109.17	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Well , they have a convention , in their own procedures , {vocalsound} which is for a background {pause} sound .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1752	3109.63	3112.99	A	Grad	s^bk|s^nd	-1	0	Right , but , uh , in general I don't think we want them transcribing the background ,
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1753	3112.99	3114.22	A	Grad	s^df^nd	-1	0	cuz that would be too much work .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1754	3113.19	3114.46	A	Grad	b.%	-1	0	
Bmr020.B.dialogueact1755	3114.46	3114.66	B	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr020.A.dialogueact1757	3115.1	3115.36	A	Grad	%--	-1	0	For it {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1758	3115.36	3117.48	A	Grad	s^df.%-	-1	0	because in the overlap sections , then they 'll
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1759	3116.68	3118.53	D	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	Well I don't think Jane 's saying they 're gonna transcribe it ,
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1760	3118.53	3121.02	D	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	but they 'll just mark it as being {disfmarker} there 's some background stuff there ,
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1761	3120.52	3122.13	A	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	But that 's gonna be all over the place .
Bmr020.C.dialogueact1763	3121.48	3121.68	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1762	3121.02	3121.27	D	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1764	3122.12	3128.09	A	Grad	qw^df	-1	0	How w how will they tell the difference between that sort of background and the dormal {disfmarker} normal background of two people talking at once ?

Bmr020.C.dialogueact1766	3128.02	3131.1	C	Postdoc	s^cs^nd	-1	0	Oh , I think {disfmarker} I think it 'd be easy to to say " background laptop " .
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1768	3132.04	3132.87	A	Grad	qw^nd	-1	0	How would they know that ?
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1767	3131.68	3132.24	D	PhD	s^co	-1	0	But wait a minute ,
Bmr020.D.dialogueact1769	3132.24	3133.48	D	PhD	qw^bu	-1	0	why would they treat them differently ?

Bmr020.C.dialogueact1771	3133.91	3135.06	C	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	Well because one of them {disfmarker}
Bmr020.A.dialogueact1772	3134.47	3136.92	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Because otherwise it 's gonna be too much work for them to mark it .
