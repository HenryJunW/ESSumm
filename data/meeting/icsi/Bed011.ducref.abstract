The main focus of the meeting was firstly on the structure of the belief-net , its decision nodes and the parameters that influence them , and secondly , on the design of the data collection tasks.
For the latter , there are already 30 subjects lined up and more are expected to be recruited off campus.
It was agreed that making subjects select from categories of tasks , such as "big place" , "service" , etc . could provide a better range of data.
The duration of each dialogue will probably be no more than 10 minutes.
On the other hand , the organisation of the intermediate nodes of the belief-net and their properties is almost complete , although no conditional probabilities have been inserted yet.
These nodes represent decisions that will function as parameters to action calls in the system.
Their values will either be inferred from the user-system interaction , or -as a last resort- requested directly from the user.
Finally , as to the semantic and syntactic constructions , work will start with more general and brief descriptions , before moving to exhaustive analysis of at least a subset.
Similarly , the construction parser that is to be built within a year is expected to be relatively basic , yet robust.
