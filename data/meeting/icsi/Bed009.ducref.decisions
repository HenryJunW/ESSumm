The group set a date for assessing SmartKom plans.
It was decided that SmartKom's action plans should be represented in XML as a state transition network.
It was proposed that the term 'dialogue planner' should replace 'dialogue manager'.
Prolog will be phased out completely and replaced by Java code.
The dialogue manager must be capable of changing states , i.e . go from being event driven to answering a question from a planning module.
SmartKom should feature a well defined core interface , with domain-specific information kept external.
A syntactic analysis component that performs chunk parsing will be added to the system.
