Bed010.B.dialogueact0	0.03	0.18	B	Grad	z	-1	0	the better just 
Bed010.D.dialogueact1	0.51	1.83	D	Grad	z	-1	0	the better just to go through 
Bed010.B.dialogueact2	9.27	9.55	B	Grad	z	-1	0	i do all right 
Bed010.C.dialogueact3	9.66	9.95	C	Professor	z	-1	0	i do all right 
Bed010.A.dialogueact4	10.55	10.9	A	PhD	z	-1	0	so mm 
Bed010.C.dialogueact5	10.88	11.03	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	so mm 
Bed010.C.dialogueact6	13.318	13.518	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah 
Bed010.C.dialogueact7	15.72	17.9	C	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	okay so that's retarded nancy 
Bed010.C.dialogueact8	17.9	19.14	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that's retarded nancy said she's coming and i mean she will be 
Bed010.C.dialogueact9	19.14	20.21	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and i mean she will be 
Bed010.C.dialogueact10	21.124	32.567	C	Professor	fh|s^t	-1	0	um my suggestion is that robert and john was sort of give us a report on last week's adventures uh to start 
Bed010.C.dialogueact11	33.35	43.71	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so everybody knows there were these guys uh from heidelberg right actually from uh do you ski i uh part of the german sparkling project who were here for the week 
Bed010.C.dialogueact12	44.43	46.49	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and then they got a lot done 
Bed010.E.dialogueact13	48.04	48.71	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	i think so too 
Bed010.E.dialogueact14	49.7	50.42	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed010.E.dialogueact15	51.9	65.27	E	Grad	s	+1	1	uh we got to the point where we can now speak introduced market system and and go all the way through and then say something like real men newer real one i'm smock of course it actually 
Bed010.E.dialogueact16	65.739	68.759	E	Grad	s	-1	0	it actually says squeamish i and so i'm smart to course which means 
Bed010.B.dialogueact18	69.044	69.304	B	Grad	b	-1	0	okay it's just 
Bed010.E.dialogueact17	68.759	74.807	E	Grad	s	+1	1	okay to course which means it's just using a german synthesis montrose for english sentences 
Bed010.B.dialogueact19	75.067	75.327	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay so 
Bed010.E.dialogueact20	75.507	76.877	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	okay it doesn't know hi so uh 
Bed010.C.dialogueact21	76.124	77.024	C	Professor	s^j.x	-1	0	it doesn't know hi uh 
Bed010.B.dialogueact22	77.799	77.949	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed010.E.dialogueact23	79.35	81.473	E	Grad	fh|%-	-1	0	oh this topic i i um the uh 
Bed010.B.dialogueact24	80.99	81.19	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	oh this topic i i the uh 
Bed010.B.dialogueact25	81.61	82.44	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	this topic is i i i try guess is it's uh 
Bed010.D.dialogueact26	81.618	83.508	D	Grad	s	-1	0	this topic is okay i i i try guess is it's the thing uh 
Bed010.A.dialogueact28	83.15	83.34	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	okay the thing 
Bed010.B.dialogueact27	82.84	83.26	B	Grad	s	-1	0	is okay i try guess is it's the thing 
Bed010.B.dialogueact30	83.63	83.99	B	Grad	b	-1	0	okay the thing 
Bed010.D.dialogueact29	83.508	83.648	D	Grad	%	-1	0	okay the thing 
Bed010.E.dialogueact31	84.518	93.632	E	Grad	s	-1	0	the uh synthesis it's just a question of uh hopefully just a question of exchanging a couple of five once we have them 
Bed010.E.dialogueact32	94.19	101.524	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and um it's not going to be a problem but cos we decided to stick to these so called concept of speech approached i'm 
Bed010.E.dialogueact33	101.934	103.304	E	Grad	s	-1	0	i'm i'm i'm going backwards not so synthesis 
Bed010.E.dialogueact34	103.304	107.86	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	not so synthesis is where you sort of make this uh make these sounds 
Bed010.E.dialogueact35	108.253	114.877	E	Grad	s	+1	1	a concept of speeches feeding into this synthesis much we're giving it to what needs to be said and devote some tactic structure 
Bed010.E.dialogueact36	115.057	119.721	E	Grad	s^df	+1	1	uhhuh so i can pronounce things better presumably than just with texas beach 
Bed010.B.dialogueact37	119.684	120.084	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh beach and 
Bed010.E.dialogueact38	120.623	125.334	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and uh john doe that are how talks rights x. amount tax 
Bed010.E.dialogueact39	126.51	132.67	E	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	yeah and that right the treated running gram uh for some some sentences now right 
Bed010.E.dialogueact40	132.67	132.88	E	Grad	qy^d^g	-1	0	sentences now right 
Bed010.E.dialogueact41	132.88	133.14	E	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	yes the sentences now right to recover 
Bed010.D.dialogueact43	133.55	133.72	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yes the to recover 
Bed010.E.dialogueact42	133.14	133.88	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	yes the to recover 
Bed010.D.dialogueact44	133.72	143.465	D	Grad	s	-1	0	yes the guys and the lady yeah and i like magic versus the dumps out when he wants to know oh watch to tell the person to a very an x. m. l. to recover 
Bed010.D.dialogueact45	144.02	148.73	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and there's a conversion system for different uh back up something else 
Bed010.D.dialogueact46	149.04	161.39	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and so the knowledge base where the system that generate a statistic tactic structures or is that just generation is uh you know but like but it was like four and 
Bed010.D.dialogueact47	161.9	166.94	D	Grad	s	-1	0	four and and i think it actually these some tactic structures is like 
Bed010.D.dialogueact48	167.71	170.26	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so you have to basically i'd go and it you 
Bed010.D.dialogueact49	170.34	174.942	D	Grad	s	-1	0	uhhuh and it you know says okay well i'm going to try to do the greek person goal 
Bed010.B.dialogueact50	174.449	174.789	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh goal 
Bed010.D.dialogueact51	175.372	180.402	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so i just starts i find it very up and just decides to you know @reject@ did you speak 
Bed010.D.dialogueact52	180.402	181.732	D	Grad	s^e	-1	0	you speak up the tree 
Bed010.B.dialogueact54	182.334	182.514	B	Grad	b.%	-1	0	and it passes the tree 
Bed010.D.dialogueact53	182.271	186.59	D	Grad	s	-1	0	and it passes the tree on to uh um the just the generation dorm 
Bed010.E.dialogueact55	188.13	199.4	E	Grad	s	+1	1	yes it does it takes trees are but i think the the part is that of the twelfth possible after insist that the german system can do we've already written that the syntax trees for three or four 
Bed010.D.dialogueact56	198.68	198.74	D	Grad	fg	-1	0	yes it three or four 
Bed010.D.dialogueact57	198.74	198.89	D	Grad	fg	-1	0	yes it three or four 
Bed010.D.dialogueact58	198.89	200.77	D	Grad	s	-1	0	yes it does it takes trees are very simple it's like three or four 
Bed010.D.dialogueact59	200.77	202.98	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	very simple it's like most of the sentences and one tree 
Bed010.B.dialogueact60	203.355	203.705	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh and instead 
Bed010.D.dialogueact61	203.713	213.322	D	Grad	s	-1	0	uhhuh and instead of you know you to like well you didn't take used it isn't it isn't it the happen or you know and if there's or something like that and make you said it does and 
Bed010.D.dialogueact62	214.02	226.83	D	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	so uh i'd i'd come and it a little too they take listen generate an x. m. l. uh three uh like structure i'm not into that so 
Bed010.D.dialogueact63	227.55	231.57	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	it's so you just say you know now and goes to you know 
Bed010.D.dialogueact64	232.65	235.06	D	Grad	s^no	-1	0	hurt not i don't i never been good it does so it's like the b. p. 
Bed010.D.dialogueact65	235.06	240.637	D	Grad	s	-1	0	okay and yeah okay so it's like the b. p. goes to and then those things and less and a generic brand 
Bed010.B.dialogueact66	236.863	237.183	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay and yeah goes to and then those things 
Bed010.B.dialogueact67	237.814	238.194	B	Grad	s^bk^m	-1	0	and yeah okay those things and 
Bed010.B.dialogueact68	238.194	238.444	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay and 
Bed010.B.dialogueact69	238.444	238.694	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay and 
Bed010.B.dialogueact70	242.243	242.493	B	Grad	s^tc	-1	0	right and because 
Bed010.E.dialogueact71	242.77	249.294	E	Grad	s	-1	0	right and because we're sticking to that start traditions as a sponsor doesn't need to be changed so all that offensive stuff and the 
Bed010.E.dialogueact72	249.294	256.124	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and the texas beach version of it switches i should send the reason is it going to be done in october which is much too late for us so 
Bed010.E.dialogueact73	256.234	256.434	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	so 
Bed010.E.dialogueact74	257.361	259.091	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	this way we we worked around that be uh 
Bed010.E.dialogueact75	259.593	263.013	E	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	be uh the system um i can show you the system i actually won that 
Bed010.E.dialogueact76	263.013	269.573	E	Grad	s	-1	0	actually won that easter you'll should be able to started on your own if you want to play around with it in the future 
Bed010.E.dialogueact77	270.13	281.93	E	Grad	s	+1	2	right now it's brett so and you need to started up and then make it's twenty changes on on on on seventeen montrose before they actually can stomach it anything 
Bed010.E.dialogueact78	283.05	290.34	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and send in a like a couple of side curries on some dummy sender setup program so that it actually works because it's 
Bed010.E.dialogueact79	290.34	299.84	E	Grad	s^df	+1	1	uhhuh because it's designed for this you get thing where you have d. jester recognition running with this sickness even switch central touch screen which we don't have here 
Bed010.B.dialogueact80	295.974	296.314	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh running with this sickness 
Bed010.E.dialogueact81	300.736	303.236	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and so we're doing it's b. i'm nollis but this one system 
Bed010.E.dialogueact82	303.236	305.466	E	Grad	s	-1	0	but this one system was designed to work with this thing and it was 
Bed010.E.dialogueact83	305.466	308.476	E	Grad	s	-1	0	this thing and it was it was about if engineering stuff 
Bed010.E.dialogueact84	309.288	311.248	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	no signs in that whatsoever but it's working 
Bed010.E.dialogueact85	311.248	312.468	E	Grad	s	+1	1	but it's working now and um 
Bed010.E.dialogueact86	312.468	314.8	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	now and um that's the good news so 
Bed010.E.dialogueact87	314.91	319.37	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	well i i the good news so everything has actually did prove to be that which independent except for the person in that generation 
Bed010.D.dialogueact88	319.66	322.79	D	Grad	s^ng^rt	+1	1	well i i take generate different reason and german once and 
Bed010.D.dialogueact89	323.28	329.38	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	uhhuh because you know like yeah i did and in in german is automatically take care of it just a regular for so i 
Bed010.E.dialogueact90	328.923	329.813	E	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	uhhuh it just a regular for so i 
Bed010.B.dialogueact91	329.602	329.932	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh so i 
Bed010.D.dialogueact92	329.858	331.508	D	Grad	s:s	-1	0	uhhuh okay so i that that and walking that little yeah 
Bed010.B.dialogueact94	331.79	332.29	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay that little stamp or the and 
Bed010.D.dialogueact93	331.508	335.14	D	Grad	s	-1	0	okay okay yeah that little stamp or the and doped up a tree 
Bed010.B.dialogueact95	333.28	333.54	B	Grad	fg	-1	0	okay 
Bed010.B.dialogueact96	335.879	343.41	B	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah i noticed that um that some of the examples they had had you know non-english murderers and so on you know 
Bed010.B.dialogueact97	343.41	344.79	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so on you know all that good stuff so yeah 
Bed010.B.dialogueact98	344.79	345.1	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	all that good stuff so like right yeah 
Bed010.C.dialogueact100	345.265	345.585	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	like right 
Bed010.D.dialogueact99	345.13	345.39	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	like right 
Bed010.B.dialogueact101	345.82	346.01	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	like right so it might be worth 
Bed010.C.dialogueact102	346.157	349.187	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	yeah so it might be worth the piece you looking at this um 
Bed010.B.dialogueact103	349.38	349.61	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah um 
Bed010.C.dialogueact104	349.837	351.197	C	Professor	h	-1	0	yeah uh i still um well tell and 
Bed010.B.dialogueact106	351.41	354.35	B	Grad	s^no.%--	-1	0	uh i still don't i just don't really understand it like i mean we sort of say tell and 
Bed010.D.dialogueact105	351.01	352.34	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	uh i still don't i just don't really tell and 
Bed010.B.dialogueact107	354.35	355.67	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i mean we sort of say um 
Bed010.B.dialogueact108	357.29	362.95	B	Grad	s^no	-1	0	you know i i still don't exactly understand sort of the information flow uh in in this thing or what the modules are and so on so 
Bed010.B.dialogueact109	362.95	370.459	B	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	are and so on so you know like just that such and such module uh um decides that it once to achieve the goal of greeting the user and then magically yeah 
Bed010.B.dialogueact110	370.459	371.999	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	the user and then magically it sort of yeah 
Bed010.C.dialogueact111	370.541	370.751	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	the user and then magically yeah 
Bed010.B.dialogueact112	372.412	375.462	B	Grad	qw	-1	0	i mean how do they know which in tactic structure to pull out and all that i see yeah so i think it's not worth 
Bed010.C.dialogueact113	373.01	373.74	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	do they know which in tactic see 
Bed010.C.dialogueact114	374.16	374.47	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	structure to pull out and yeah so i think 
Bed010.C.dialogueact115	374.47	377.43	C	Professor	s	-1	0	structure to pull out and all that for sure yeah so i think it's not worth going over in the group it's sort of when 
Bed010.B.dialogueact116	376.991	377.441	B	Grad	%	-1	0	for sure going over in the group it's sort of when 
Bed010.B.dialogueact118	377.441	377.811	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	for sure in the group it's sort of when 
Bed010.C.dialogueact117	377.43	385.64	C	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	for sure yeah soon okay in the group it's sort of when you get this free and you have the time uh either robert or china or i can't walk you through it 
Bed010.B.dialogueact119	380.87	381.17	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah soon have the time uh either 
Bed010.B.dialogueact120	381.69	382.11	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	soon uh either robert 
Bed010.B.dialogueact121	385.66	385.95	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay through it 
Bed010.C.dialogueact122	386.25	389.72	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that's fine and you can ask all the questions about how this all fits together 
Bed010.B.dialogueact123	389.48	389.88	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	that's fine fits together 
Bed010.C.dialogueact124	390.23	391.29	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it's a messy but once 
Bed010.C.dialogueact125	391.29	393.36	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but once you understand it you understand that it's it's there's 
Bed010.C.dialogueact126	393.36	396.03	C	Professor	s	-1	0	okay that it's it's there's nothing really complicated about

Bed010.C.dialogueact144	443.4	444.83	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	make our stuff two uh 
Bed010.B.dialogueact145	444.308	445.658	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	make our stuff fit and uh yeah 
Bed010.C.dialogueact146	445.79	446.27	C	Professor	s^aa|%--	-1	0	fit and yeah i no know to just 
Bed010.C.dialogueact147	446.27	449.75	C	Professor	s^ar|s^df	+1	1	uhhuh i no know to just get the damn to get the demos they need 
Bed010.B.dialogueact148	449.751	450.021	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh they need okay so 
Bed010.C.dialogueact149	450.3	450.63	C	Professor	qy^d^f	-1	0	okay so 
Bed010.C.dialogueact150	450.92	453.48	C	Professor	s	-1	0	okay so between us all we have them to get them to the demos they need if 
Bed010.C.dialogueact151	453.85	461.24	C	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	uhhuh they need if it turns out we can also give them lots more than that bike you know tapping in the other things we do that's great but 
Bed010.D.dialogueact152	458.921	460.721	D	Grad	s^cs^t3	-1	0	that bike you know tapping in the other things we do that's great 
Bed010.B.dialogueact153	461.978	462.288	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh but as it turns out not @reject@ 
Bed010.C.dialogueact154	462.06	464.75	C	Professor	s	-1	0	okay as it turns out not to be in any any the contracts @reject@ 
Bed010.D.dialogueact155	462.38	464.48	D	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	okay as it turns out not to be in any any the contracts @reject@ 
Bed010.B.dialogueact156	464.97	465.17	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay contracts and 
Bed010.C.dialogueact157	465.78	467.2	C	Professor	fh|s^e	-1	0	and deliberately 
Bed010.C.dialogueact158	468.45	479.15	C	Professor	fh|s^df	-1	0	so the reason i'd like you to understand uh what's going on in this demo system is not because it's important to the research is just for 
Bed010.C.dialogueact159	479.15	480.64	C	Professor	s	-1	0	is just for closure so that 
Bed010.C.dialogueact160	480.64	485.42	C	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	closure so that if we come up with a question of quit we fit this deeper stuff in there or something you know what the hell 
Bed010.C.dialogueact161	485.42	488.844	C	Professor	s	-1	0	right or something you know what the hell we we're talking about fitting in 
Bed010.B.dialogueact162	486.681	487.001	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right we we're talking 
Bed010.B.dialogueact163	489.11	489.35	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay so it's just 
Bed010.C.dialogueact164	489.434	492.904	C	Professor	s	-1	0	okay so it's just uh and the same same actually but the rest of us 
Bed010.C.dialogueact165	493.72	497.55	C	Professor	s	-1	0	we just need to really understand what's there is 
Bed010.C.dialogueact166	497.99	499.68	C	Professor	qy	-1	0	there is there anything we can make use of 
Bed010.C.dialogueact167	501.07	505.23	C	Professor	fh|qy	-1	0	is anything we can give back beyond the the minimum requirements 
Bed010.C.dialogueact168	506.04	507.97	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but none of that is a short time fuse 
Bed010.B.dialogueact169	508.347	508.657	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay so they 
Bed010.C.dialogueact170	508.82	515.38	C	Professor	s	+1	1	okay so they they at the demo requirements for this fall are sort of taking care of as of later this week or something and 
Bed010.C.dialogueact171	515.99	520.91	C	Professor	s	+1	0	and then so it's probably fifteen months or something until there's another serious demo requirement 
Bed010.B.dialogueact173	521.1	521.61	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay that i mean we don't think 
Bed010.C.dialogueact172	520.91	523.18	C	Professor	s	-1	0	oh okay right demo requirement that i mean we don't think about it for fifteen months but it means we can 
Bed010.B.dialogueact175	523.19	523.71	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right but it means we can 
Bed010.C.dialogueact174	523.18	525.48	C	Professor	s	-1	0	right right yeah but it means we can not think about it for six months 
Bed010.B.dialogueact176	525.45	525.88	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right yeah months 
Bed010.C.dialogueact177	526.41	536.4	C	Professor	fh|s^t^tc	-1	0	so the plan for the summer uh really is too step back from the apply project 
Bed010.E.dialogueact178	526.451	526.731	E	Grad	b.x	-1	0	so 
Bed010.C.dialogueact179	537.22	541.82	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uhhuh oh keep it to keep the context open but actually go after the basic issues 
Bed010.B.dialogueact180	539.466	539.776	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh actually go after 
Bed010.B.dialogueact181	541.87	542.23	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay issues 
Bed010.C.dialogueact182	542.72	543.61	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	okay and so 
Bed010.C.dialogueact183	543.86	552.48	C	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	and so the idea is there's this uh other subgroups it's worrying about formalize zine you know take getting a notation but 
Bed010.C.dialogueact184	552.9	562.37	C	Professor	s^co	+1	0	uhhuh but sort of in parallel with that uh that hope is it in particular you will work on constructions in english and german for this domain they 
Bed010.B.dialogueact185	562.399	562.729	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh they 
Bed010.C.dialogueact186	562.96	572.27	C	Professor	s^e	+1	0	uhhuh yeah uhhuh kind of they know not worry about par seeing them are fitting them into smart calm or any of the other anything well in any other constraints for the time being it's hard 
Bed010.B.dialogueact187	566.46	566.87	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah calm or 
Bed010.B.dialogueact188	570.215	570.475	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	uhhuh 
Bed010.B.dialogueact189	572.573	572.853	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	kind of being it's hard 
Bed010.C.dialogueact190	572.65	580.029	C	Professor	s	-1	0	kind of yeah being it's hard enough to get it samantha lynching technically right and in it and get the constructions in their form and stuff and 
Bed010.B.dialogueact191	576.176	576.576	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah technically right and 
Bed010.C.dialogueact192	580.73	587.36	C	Professor	s	-1	0	right right and i don't i don't want you feeling that you have to somehow meet all these other constraints 
Bed010.B.dialogueact193	587.245	587.755	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right right 
Bed010.C.dialogueact194	588.73	596.86	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um and really with the par sing uh we're going to worry about par saying uh the general case 
Bed010.C.dialogueact195	597.51	600.18	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	you know construction parts or for general constructions and 
Bed010.C.dialogueact196	600.75	606.81	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and if we need a cut down version for something or whatever worry about that later 
Bed010.B.dialogueact197	607.025	607.275	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay sounds like 
Bed010.C.dialogueact198	607.65	611.01	C	Professor	s^cc	+1	1	okay okay sounds like to before the summer's turn into science mode and i think that's 
Bed010.B.dialogueact199	611.286	611.616	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay and i think that's 
Bed010.C.dialogueact200	611.64	614.08	C	Professor	s	-1	0	okay and i think that's also uh you're playing as well 
Bed010.B.dialogueact202	616.63	622.58	B	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	so i mean but the point is that like the meetings uh so far that i've been that have been sort of been geared towards this demo right yeah yeah the 
Bed010.C.dialogueact201	616.338	616.538	C	Professor	b	-1	0	so i mean right 
Bed010.C.dialogueact203	620.8	621.0	C	Professor	b	-1	0	that i've been that have been sort of been geared towards this yeah 
Bed010.C.dialogueact204	622.73	622.91	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	demo yeah the 
Bed010.B.dialogueact206	623.239	624.989	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and then that's going to go away pretty soon divorce which we right 
Bed010.C.dialogueact205	622.91	623.91	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	demo and then that's going to go yeah the divorce which we 
Bed010.B.dialogueact208	625.38	625.65	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay and then sort yeah it's 
Bed010.C.dialogueact207	625.02	625.26	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	okay and then sort yeah it's 
Bed010.B.dialogueact209	625.65	628.61	B	Grad	s	-1	0	okay and then sort of shift gears a fairly substantially yeah yeah yeah it's it's not 
Bed010.C.dialogueact210	625.842	626.042	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	okay and then sort of shift gears a yeah yeah it's 
Bed010.E.dialogueact211	626.0	626.22	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	of shift gears a yeah 
Bed010.C.dialogueact212	626.943	627.133	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	of shift gears a fairly substantially yeah 
Bed010.B.dialogueact214	628.61	628.74	B	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	yeah it's not 
Bed010.C.dialogueact215	628.903	629.093	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah it's not what i but 
Bed010.E.dialogueact213	628.586	629.096	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	yeah it's not what i but 
Bed010.E.dialogueact216	629.316	634.286	E	Grad	s	-1	0	what i but i think this is a good idea that i can i can show it to anyone who's interested we can even make instead 
Bed010.E.dialogueact217	634.286	636.316	E	Grad	s	+1	1	we can even make instead of an intern internal demo when i i show you 
Bed010.E.dialogueact218	636.316	638.456	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	uhhuh when i i show you what i do 
Bed010.B.dialogueact219	638.835	639.115	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh i do i speak into it and you 
Bed010.E.dialogueact220	638.996	640.746	E	Grad	s	-1	0	uhhuh i do i speak into it and you hear talk 
Bed010.B.dialogueact221	641.18	641.57	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay and i considered 
Bed010.E.dialogueact222	641.326	643.676	E	Grad	s	-1	0	okay and i considered walks through the information so this 
Bed010.E.dialogueact223	643.676	645.756	E	Grad	s	-1	0	the information so this is like a half hour forty five minutes just fine 
Bed010.E.dialogueact224	645.756	646.246	E	Grad	s	-1	0	okay forty five minutes just fine and 
Bed010.B.dialogueact225	646.765	647.015	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay and so you 
Bed010.E.dialogueact226	647.1	653.06	E	Grad	s	-1	0	right okay so crush so you when somebody on the streets come comes up to you ask you what a smart comes you can just give a sensible answer 
Bed010.B.dialogueact227	651.227	651.407	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right you can just 
Bed010.B.dialogueact228	653.137	653.517	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay so crush 
Bed010.C.dialogueact229	653.28	657.2	C	Professor	qy^d^rt	+1	1	okay so crush we could set that up is actually an inch too wide thing just 
Bed010.C.dialogueact230	657.93	662.15	C	Professor	s^e^rt	-1	0	just people talking the big room and and so people people know what's going on when you're ready 
Bed010.C.dialogueact231	662.52	663.08	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	when you're ready 
Bed010.E.dialogueact232	664.59	665.46	E	Grad	s^aa	+1	0	i mean that's the kind absolutely 
Bed010.C.dialogueact233	665.3	666.6	C	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	i mean that's the kind of thing 
Bed010.C.dialogueact234	667.02	674.329	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah that's the level at which yeah we can just like invite everybody and say this is a project we've been working on and here's a demo version and stuff like that okay 
Bed010.B.dialogueact235	672.68	672.91	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah on and here's a demo 
Bed010.E.dialogueact236	674.85	675.18	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	like that okay how about 
Bed010.E.dialogueact237	675.82	682.5	E	Grad	s^aap.%--	+1	2	yeah dayton how about we we do want to have all the box out there where you have to sort of type in x. x. amount of messages from left and right before 
Bed010.B.dialogueact238	682.451	682.771	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah dayton 
Bed010.C.dialogueact239	682.89	683.35	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah dayton 
Bed010.E.dialogueact240	683.477	683.647	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed010.E.dialogueact241	685.295	685.575	E	Grad	s^rt^tc	-1	0	okay makes sense 
Bed010.E.dialogueact242	685.765	686.305	E	Grad	s	-1	0	but okay makes sense 
Bed010.C.dialogueact243	686.9	687.91	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	but is that it's 
Bed010.C.dialogueact244	687.91	688.89	C	Professor	s	-1	0	is that it's clear then i think 
Bed010.C.dialogueact245	689.337	698.427	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah okay actually roughly starting uh let's say next next meeting because speed we have one other thing too tie up besides the trip report but 
Bed010.B.dialogueact246	694.437	694.797	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah because speed we have one 
Bed010.B.dialogueact247	698.746	698.966	B	Grad	b	-1	0	okay but 
Bed010.C.dialogueact248	699.003	704.97	C	Professor	fh|s^cc.%--	-1	0	is starting next thing i think we won too slipping into this mode where 
Bed010.C.dialogueact249	705.63	707.79	C	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	uh there are a lot of issues what scientology 
Bed010.C.dialogueact250	707.79	709.39	C	Professor	s:qw	+1	1	uhhuh of issues what scientology look like you know what constructions 
Bed010.B.dialogueact251	709.298	709.658	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh you know what constructions 
Bed010.C.dialogueact252	709.39	710.79	C	Professor	s:qw	+1	1	uhhuh you know what constructions look like what's execution 
Bed010.C.dialogueact253	710.79	712.31	C	Professor	s:qw	+1	1	uhhuh look like what's execution engine look like mm what 
Bed010.C.dialogueact254	712.45	713.53	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uhhuh mm what things 
Bed010.B.dialogueact255	712.972	713.312	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh mm what things 
Bed010.C.dialogueact256	714.182	721.67	C	Professor	s	+1	2	but more focused on uh an idealized version then just getting them 
Bed010.C.dialogueact257	723.92	726.887	C	Professor	s^tc.%--	-1	0	now before we do that let's get back and help 
Bed010.C.dialogueact258	727.007	727.177	C	Professor	s^fe	-1	0	but 
Bed010.C.dialogueact259	727.507	741.96	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah okay but it's still i think useful for you to understand a demo version enough so that you can you can see what what it is that that uh it might yeah eventually get retrofit it into or something 
Bed010.B.dialogueact260	732.111	732.341	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah enough 
Bed010.B.dialogueact261	741.868	742.198	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay right it into or something 
Bed010.B.dialogueact262	742.278	742.468	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right 
Bed010.C.dialogueact263	743.6	750.34	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and john is already done that uh looked at the depth of the look it's marked on stuff what right 
Bed010.D.dialogueact264	746.507	747.387	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	uh looked at the depth of what right 
Bed010.D.dialogueact265	747.387	747.417	D	Grad	fg	-1	0	looked at the depth of 
Bed010.D.dialogueact266	751.91	752.44	D	Grad	s^aap.%--	-1	0	some 
Bed010.D.dialogueact267	752.44	754.54	D	Grad	fh|qw	-1	0	well the parts are in that stuff @reject@ 
Bed010.C.dialogueact268	754.02	755.23	C	Professor	s	-1	0	the parts are in that stuff oh yeah 
Bed010.D.dialogueact269	755.23	755.75	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	oh yeah 
Bed010.C.dialogueact270	757.424	757.764	C	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	anyway so the 
Bed010.C.dialogueact271	757.764	758.324	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	anyway so the trip they report 
Bed010.C.dialogueact272	758.434	759.614	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	trip they report on these these 
Bed010.C.dialogueact273	759.874	764.024	C	Professor	s^t	-1	0	yeah that's right on these these last week we started interrupted you guys telling us about what happened last week 
Bed010.B.dialogueact274	762.047	762.457	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah that's right guys telling us about 
Bed010.B.dialogueact275	762.457	763.247	B	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah that's right guys telling us about what happened last week 
Bed010.E.dialogueact276	766.22	776.255	E	Grad	h|s	+1	2	be done um but it was just amazing there to see uh how how unstable the whole thing is and if you just take 
Bed010.C.dialogueact277	768.724	769.244	C	Professor	s	-1	0	be done but it was 
Bed010.E.dialogueact278	776.255	777.495	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	is and if you just take b. 
Bed010.E.dialogueact279	778.526	783.47	E	Grad	s	+1	2	and i i got the feeling that weird the only one friend now wherever running system i don't know what the 
Bed010.E.dialogueact280	783.47	786.03	E	Grad	s^no	-1	0	system i don't know what the guys because the fountain have running because 
Bed010.E.dialogueact281	786.03	786.63	E	Grad	%--	-1	0	because 
Bed010.E.dialogueact282	787.513	791.673	E	Grad	s	+1	1	the version that is the full version that's on the server it's not work 
Bed010.E.dialogueact283	792.756	796.566	E	Grad	s	-1	0	i do need to do a lot of stuff to make it work and so 
Bed010.E.dialogueact284	796.566	797.856	E	Grad	%--	-1	0	it work and so it's 
Bed010.E.dialogueact285	798.71	809.11	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and even some of the rough of such yeah then there wasn't really working worsen it good dated without the all the shortcuts that they put in for the uh it works for situation may be ahead 
Bed010.E.dialogueact286	809.11	811.46	E	Grad	s	-1	0	may be ahead of the system called by now 
Bed010.E.dialogueact287	812.57	814.11	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	the systems integration group 
Bed010.E.dialogueact288	815.19	817.76	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and it was uh it was fun to some extent but 
Bed010.E.dialogueact289	817.76	825.6	E	Grad	fh|s.%--	-1	0	to some extent but be uh the outcome that is sort of a scientific interest is that i think both rough into him and 
Bed010.E.dialogueact290	826.24	827.76	E	Grad	fh|s^rt	-1	0	and i know that they tried to here 
Bed010.E.dialogueact291	828.208	831.668	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and they they they like uh a lot of the stuff they saw here 
Bed010.E.dialogueact292	832.151	833.691	E	Grad	s^e^rt	-1	0	what would we have been thinking about 
Bed010.E.dialogueact293	834.33	838.83	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and they're more than willing to to i'm cooperate by all means 
Bed010.E.dialogueact294	839.726	846.322	E	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	and um part of my responsibly is it to use our inter group where so at you know make that open 
Bed010.E.dialogueact295	846.322	848.422	E	Grad	s	+1	0	know make that open to a lot of us and then so 
Bed010.E.dialogueact296	848.792	855.482	E	Grad	s	+1	1	then so that whatever we discuss in terms of par seeing and and and constructions we we saw i put it in there and they put 
Bed010.E.dialogueact297	855.482	856.982	E	Grad	s	+1	1	it in there and they put what they do in there 
Bed010.E.dialogueact298	857.494	863.691	E	Grad	s.x	+1	1	and maybe we can even um get some overlap got some synergy out of that 
Bed010.E.dialogueact299	864.44	865.92	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bed010.E.dialogueact300	866.76	867.35	E	Grad	%--	-1	0	d. uh 
Bed010.E.dialogueact301	867.47	877.7	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	uh i find someone that know how that is interested in that um i i'm even think that we could look take constructions and and generate from them because 
Bed010.E.dialogueact302	877.7	883.14	E	Grad	s^df	+1	0	from them because the tree trying to grandma said that tremendous using it but she said nothing but a mathematical form and isn't you can just do anything 
Bed010.E.dialogueact303	883.14	888.68	E	Grad	s	+1	0	you can just do anything with it but it's an tactic trees it used to that stuff or whether it's construction 
Bed010.E.dialogueact304	889.47	896.009	E	Grad	s	+1	0	so if you ever get to the generation sides of constructing things and there might be something different just there but the moment were 
Bed010.E.dialogueact305	896.009	902.322	E	Grad	s	-1	0	the moment were of course definitely focus on the understandings um part time 
Bed010.C.dialogueact306	906.04	911.46	C	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	any any other uh reap there's a report sort of stories 
Bed010.C.dialogueact307	1016.45	1020.62	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uhhuh uh we we now know i think what the landscape is like 
Bed010.B.dialogueact308	1020.6	1020.85	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh is like 
Bed010.C.dialogueact309	1021.46	1027.93	C	Professor	s^co	-1	0	and so we just push one and and uh do what we need to do 
Bed010.C.dialogueact310	1030.59	1043.25	C	Professor	s^co	+1	1	and one of the things we need to do is be um it's i think it's relatively tight intently constraint is to finish up this belief that stuff so 
Bed010.C.dialogueact311	1043.64	1044.22	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bed010.C.dialogueact312	1045.16	1049.99	C	Professor	fh|s^t^tc	-1	0	uh and i was going to switch to start talking about that unless their mother other more general questions 
Bed010.C.dialogueact313	1053.04	1056.07	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	so here's where we are in the belief that stuff as far as i understand it um 
Bed010.C.dialogueact314	1056.86	1067.58	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	it um going back i guess two weeks ago uh robert had laid out this belief that missing only the connections 
Bed010.C.dialogueact315	1067.58	1067.91	C	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed010.C.dialogueact316	1068.06	1070.33	C	Professor	s	-1	0	put all the all the dos town and 
Bed010.C.dialogueact317	1070.4	1083.44	C	Professor	s	+1	2	town and we winter is and i think more or less convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the notes that we needed for the demo left we're thinking of were in there and 
Bed010.C.dialogueact318	1083.81	1085.29	C	Professor	s	-1	0	in there and they run across one or two more but connections 
Bed010.C.dialogueact319	1085.53	1086.87	C	Professor	s	-1	0	more but connections worked 
Bed010.C.dialogueact320	1087.86	1106.1	C	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	so uh boston i went off and looked at some technical questions about were certain operations sort of legitimate belief that copy patience and was or some known problem with them or did someone already uh salt you know how to do this and stuff and 
Bed010.C.dialogueact321	1106.7	1108.51	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and to bus track that down the answer seems 
Bed010.C.dialogueact322	1108.51	1115.49	C	Professor	s	+1	1	that down the answer seems to be uh no no one has done it the guests perfectly reasonable thing do if that's what you set out to do 
Bed010.C.dialogueact323	1116.31	1133.53	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and so the current state of things is that again starting now uh um would like to actually get a running belief that for this particular sub domain done in the next few weeks 
Bed010.C.dialogueact324	1134.31	1137.08	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	it's bus for switching projects is the first of june and 
Bed010.C.dialogueact325	1137.08	1147.4	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and uh he's going to leave us an inheritance which is the uh hopefully a belief that that does these things and 
Bed010.C.dialogueact326	1148.0	1150.72	C	Professor	s	+1	0	there are two aspects to it one of which is you know technical getting decoding 
Bed010.C.dialogueact327	1150.72	1154.09	C	Professor	s^e	+1	0	you know technical getting decoding right and making get run and uh stuff like on the other is the actual 
Bed010.C.dialogueact328	1154.09	1156.76	C	Professor	s^e	+1	0	on the other is the actual semantics 
Bed010.C.dialogueact329	1157.47	1162.39	C	Professor	fh|qw	+1	1	okay what don't you know what are the considerations and and what are of the ways in which they relate 
Bed010.C.dialogueact330	1163.27	1173.03	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uhhuh so he got he's he doesn't need help from this group on e. technical aspects or he does uh we'll do that separately but in 
Bed010.B.dialogueact331	1173.2	1173.67	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh but in 
Bed010.C.dialogueact332	1173.64	1181.63	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uhhuh but in terms of what are the decisions and stuff like that that's something that we all have to work out 
Bed010.C.dialogueact333	1183.08	1183.82	C	Professor	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	is that right 
Bed010.C.dialogueact334	1184.82	1186.68	C	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	i mean it's it's both you guys understanding where where absolutely 
Bed010.E.dialogueact335	1186.54	1187.02	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	where where okay absolutely 
Bed010.C.dialogueact336	1187.33	1187.71	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bed010.G.dialogueact337	1189.79	1194.74	G	Grad	fg|qy^rt	-1	0	so i guess so i didn't so 
Bed010.G.dialogueact338	1195.5	1195.61	G	Grad	%-	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed010.E.dialogueact339	1196.44	1197.97	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	we had um decided like 
Bed010.G.dialogueact340	1197.17	1197.41	G	Grad	%-	-1	0	decided like 
Bed010.E.dialogueact341	1199.1	1201.32	E	Grad	fh|s^bsc	-1	0	whatever didn't decide we wanted to 
Bed010.E.dialogueact342	1201.32	1205.89	E	Grad	s	-1	0	decide we wanted to look into maybe getting it's the visualization a bit care of i 
Bed010.E.dialogueact343	1205.89	1215.98	E	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah a bit care of i think if we do it um sort of a paper version of all the notes and then the connections between them that should suffice mm yeah be fine 
Bed010.G.dialogueact344	1211.36	1211.87	G	Grad	b^rt	-1	0	of all the notes mm 
Bed010.G.dialogueact345	1214.22	1214.32	G	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	them yeah be fine 
Bed010.G.dialogueact346	1214.32	1214.95	G	Grad	s^2^ba	-1	0	them yeah be fine 
Bed010.C.dialogueact348	1216.08	1217.41	C	Professor	fg|s^aap	-1	0	right that's a separate problem we do in the long i 
Bed010.D.dialogueact347	1215.94	1216.57	D	Grad	fg	-1	0	right that's a separate problem yeah i that should suffice 
Bed010.C.dialogueact349	1217.41	1219.97	C	Professor	s	+1	0	we do in the long run want to do better visualization office 
Bed010.E.dialogueact350	1219.49	1219.81	E	Grad	b	-1	0	office 
Bed010.C.dialogueact351	1220.24	1220.83	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that separately yeah 
Bed010.C.dialogueact352	1220.83	1221.05	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	that separately yeah i did look into that 
Bed010.D.dialogueact353	1221.16	1225.4	D	Grad	s.%--	+1	0	yep right i did look into that uh in terms of you know it's putting the note done down downey 
Bed010.C.dialogueact354	1223.48	1223.69	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yep of you know it's 
Bed010.C.dialogueact355	1225.85	1225.97	C	Professor	b	-1	0	right 
Bed010.D.dialogueact356	1226.07	1227.46	D	Grad	s	+1	1	job is not to it that i can 
Bed010.D.dialogueact357	1227.65	1231.69	D	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	it that i can imagine and you take note he to do that 
Bed010.D.dialogueact358	1232.16	1235.02	D	Grad	s^rt	+1	0	not not this point you probably take weeks so to actually go through and do it and i went through 
Bed010.C.dialogueact359	1235.02	1235.9	C	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	not this point and i went through 
Bed010.D.dialogueact360	1235.49	1238.49	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	not this point right and i went through all the the packages on @reject@ page and 
Bed010.C.dialogueact361	1238.57	1238.83	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	right page and 
Bed010.D.dialogueact362	1239.02	1248.43	D	Grad	s	-1	0	well they can pay if it i couldn't find it necessary mix of for eat yeah and uh it to get we and i just think we 
Bed010.C.dialogueact363	1248.1	1249.75	C	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	well they can pay if it if we can pay yeah if we 
Bed010.C.dialogueact364	1249.75	1252.37	C	Professor	s	-1	0	if we can pay yeah if you was paying a thousand dollars or something we can do that okay 
Bed010.C.dialogueact365	1252.87	1253.04	C	Professor	qy^d^f^rt	-1	0	okay so it don't view yeah 
Bed010.C.dialogueact367	1253.04	1256.88	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so it don't view free as as a absolute constraint yeah 
Bed010.D.dialogueact366	1252.94	1253.23	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay so it don't view yeah 
Bed010.D.dialogueact368	1257.48	1260.0	D	Grad	s^bk|s^cc.%-	-1	0	okay and you can ask kevin mean is that i would go back and look at the ones on us but yeah

Bed010.C.dialogueact444	1392.54	1396.46	C	Professor	s	-1	0	sort of well they're they're they're they're two different things you do want to she design 
Bed010.E.dialogueact445	1394.7	1394.97	E	Grad	fg	-1	0	they're two 
Bed010.C.dialogueact446	1396.46	1398.19	C	Professor	s^e	+1	0	you do want to she design and the other she'll are okay 
Bed010.C.dialogueact447	1398.62	1398.9	C	Professor	qy^d^f^rt	-1	0	okay 
Bed010.C.dialogueact448	1399.34	1406.13	C	Professor	fh|s^co	+1	2	right so uh what we're going to do initially is is to design and and if you well guess okay 
Bed010.B.dialogueact449	1406.29	1406.52	B	Grad	b	-1	0	right okay 
Bed010.C.dialogueact450	1406.68	1406.98	C	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right okay 
Bed010.C.dialogueact451	1407.29	1414.14	C	Professor	s	-1	0	right yeah uh that is you know use your best knowledge of of the domain too uh plus size what the dependencies or and stuff 
Bed010.B.dialogueact452	1409.35	1409.59	B	Grad	b	-1	0	right of of the domain 
Bed010.B.dialogueact453	1414.27	1414.56	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bed010.C.dialogueact454	1415.27	1423.41	C	Professor	s	+1	0	yeah if it's done right and if you have data they and their art techniques for learning the numbers given the structure and they're 
Bed010.B.dialogueact455	1419.07	1419.33	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah they and 
Bed010.C.dialogueact456	1423.92	1428.23	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and they're even techniques for learning the structure although that takes a lot more data and it's not a 
Bed010.C.dialogueact457	1428.23	1429.84	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and it's not a so forth and so on so 
Bed010.C.dialogueact458	1429.84	1431.16	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so forth and so on so uh 
Bed010.C.dialogueact459	1432.36	1439.32	C	Professor	s^cs	+1	2	yeah but for the limited amount of stuff we have for this particular exercise i think we just it 
Bed010.B.dialogueact460	1439.89	1440.05	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah 
Bed010.E.dialogueact461	1441.14	1441.29	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	oh 
Bed010.E.dialogueact462	1441.88	1449.76	E	Grad	s	-1	0	okay oh well pretty as time passed this we get more more data from heidelberg can some people actually using it and stuff so 
Bed010.B.dialogueact463	1447.68	1447.93	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bed010.E.dialogueact464	1449.76	1453.31	E	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah it and stuff so but this is the i'm run but this 
Bed010.B.dialogueact465	1452.47	1452.69	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah i'm run 
Bed010.E.dialogueact466	1453.86	1458.1	E	Grad	s	-1	0	that's right but this other problems like uh um mediocre designed was too i think 
Bed010.B.dialogueact467	1457.57	1457.72	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	that's right too i think 
Bed010.B.dialogueact468	1457.72	1458.06	B	Grad	s^aa^rt	-1	0	that's right too i think 
Bed010.B.dialogueact469	1459.84	1462.56	B	Grad	fg|s.%--:qy.%--	-1	0	you know and by the way speaking of data uh um are there 
Bed010.B.dialogueact470	1463.18	1466.26	B	Grad	s	-1	0	i could swear i i could try sought sitting on someone's desk at some point but is there um 
Bed010.B.dialogueact471	1466.26	1472.86	B	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	point but is there um a transcript of any of the sort of in actual interactions with people with uh with the system 
Bed010.B.dialogueact473	1473.42	1477.73	B	Grad	s^df	+1	0	because you know i'm still sort of itching to to look at what look at the time and see what people are saying uhhuh yeah yeah make yourself in the 
Bed010.C.dialogueact472	1473.11	1473.44	C	Professor	s^aa^rt	-1	0	because you know i'm still uhhuh 
Bed010.C.dialogueact474	1476.55	1476.75	C	Professor	b	-1	0	look at the time and see what yeah

Bed010.B.dialogueact488	1494.76	1495.02	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay yeah i mean i you something 
Bed010.B.dialogueact489	1495.57	1501.53	B	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah i mean i i sort of um found the uh uh the audio of some of those and um uhhuh 
Bed010.B.dialogueact491	1501.53	1505.6	B	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	of those and um it kind of sounds like i didn't want to trudge through that you know it's just uhhuh 
Bed010.E.dialogueact490	1501.51	1501.83	E	Grad	b	-1	0	of those and um uhhuh 
Bed010.B.dialogueact492	1505.6	1507.38	B	Grad	s	-1	0	that you know it's just strange but yep 
Bed010.B.dialogueact493	1507.38	1507.56	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	but yep 
Bed010.C.dialogueact494	1507.94	1508.18	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	but yep we probably would not 
Bed010.E.dialogueact495	1508.07	1511.87	E	Grad	s	-1	0	oh yeah we probably would not get those two described because of were trial runs 
Bed010.B.dialogueact496	1511.9	1512.15	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	oh yeah okay runs um 
Bed010.B.dialogueact497	1512.15	1512.38	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay um 
Bed010.E.dialogueact498	1512.74	1517.78	E	Grad	fh|s	+1	0	okay okay um but uh that's said that but we have some data in english and german already so 
Bed010.B.dialogueact500	1517.82	1518.01	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay yeah mean and german already so transcribed i've 
Bed010.B.dialogueact501	1518.12	1518.5	B	Grad	fg	-1	0	yeah mean transcribed i've 
Bed010.E.dialogueact499	1517.78	1518.1	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	okay yeah mean and german already so transcribed i've 
Bed010.E.dialogueact502	1518.36	1518.87	E	Grad	s^e	+1	0	yeah mean transcribed i've 
Bed010.E.dialogueact503	1518.87	1519.73	E	Grad	s^cc	+1	0	yeah mean transcribed i've seen that 
Bed010.E.dialogueact504	1523.09	1523.32	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed010.C.dialogueact505	1539.66	1539.93	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	okay so 
Bed010.C.dialogueact506	1539.93	1547.03	C	Professor	fh|qy^d^t	-1	0	okay so while we're still at this sort of top level anything else that we ought to talk about today 
Bed010.E.dialogueact507	1553.17	1555.51	E	Grad	qw^t	-1	0	oh sure thinking 
Bed010.B.dialogueact508	1623.64	1631.12	B	Grad	fg|s^t^tc	-1	0	oh um i just wanted to uh it's like mentioned as an issue you know last meeting i wasn't here because i went to a 
Bed010.B.dialogueact509	1631.12	1634.22	B	Grad	s^df	+1	0	because i went to a linguistics program on the fact of motion stuff and that was pretty interesting oh right 
Bed010.C.dialogueact510	1632.41	1632.75	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	linguistics program oh right 
Bed010.B.dialogueact511	1634.22	1635.37	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	and that was pretty interesting and you know i mean 
Bed010.B.dialogueact512	1635.37	1636.12	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	and you know i mean seems to me that that 
Bed010.B.dialogueact513	1636.12	1641.03	B	Grad	s	+1	0	seems to me that that will fairly obviously be of relevance to so what we're doing here because you know people are likely 
Bed010.B.dialogueact514	1641.03	1643.0	B	Grad	s	-1	0	because you know people are likely to give descriptions like you know what's 
Bed010.B.dialogueact515	1643.01	1647.9	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	you know what's that saying uh right where you start to go up the hill or something like that you know 
Bed010.B.dialogueact516	1647.9	1652.6	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	or something like that you know meaning a few feet up the hill or whatever from some reference point all that stuff so i mean i'm 
Bed010.B.dialogueact517	1652.6	1659.13	B	Grad	s	-1	0	all that stuff so i mean i'm sure in terms of you know people trying to state locations or you know all that kind of stuff is going to be very relevant so um 
Bed010.B.dialogueact518	1659.13	1659.48	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bed010.B.dialogueact519	1659.93	1669.89	B	Grad	fh|s.%--	-1	0	so um i was the talk was about english versus japanese um which obviously the japanese doesn't affect us directly except that um some of the construction he'd 
Bed010.B.dialogueact520	1669.89	1674.55	B	Grad	s:s	-1	0	some of the construction he'd what you talked about was you know an english we say things like that you know your bike is parked across the street from 
Bed010.B.dialogueact521	1675.01	1680.06	B	Grad	s:s	-1	0	we just oppositional phrases you know well if you were to move across the street you would be at the bike but um in 
Bed010.B.dialogueact522	1680.06	1689.7	B	Grad	s:s	-1	0	but um in in japanese that the more conventional eyes tendency is to use uh sort of of a description of where one has crossed the river there's a tree 
Bed010.B.dialogueact523	1690.17	1698.07	B	Grad	fh|s:s	-1	0	um and you know you can actually say things like um there's a tree where one has crossed the river but no one has ever crossed the river or something like that and so the idea is that 
Bed010.B.dialogueact524	1698.07	1701.72	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and so the idea is that this really you know that's supposed to show that it's really effective and so on but 
Bed010.B.dialogueact525	1702.04	1702.66	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed010.B.dialogueact526	1703.81	1712.65	B	Grad	s:s	-1	0	but the point is that that kind of construction is also used in english you know like right where you start to go up the hill or just when you get off the train or something like that tend came or something and so we'll have to 
Bed010.C.dialogueact527	1711.15	1711.54	C	Professor	b	-1	0	tend came 
Bed010.B.dialogueact528	1712.65	1713.62	B	Grad	s^cc.%-	-1	0	or something and so we'll have to think about how much 
Bed010.C.dialogueact529	1713.08	1713.23	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	think about how much 
Bed010.C.dialogueact530	1713.8	1715.03	C	Professor	qw	-1	0	think about how much is it used in german um 
Bed010.E.dialogueact531	1716.07	1722.04	E	Grad	h|s	-1	0	okay be uh well i was i was in i on a on a different subject i mean 
Bed010.C.dialogueact533	1722.62	1722.91	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay i mean 
Bed010.E.dialogueact532	1722.42	1727.89	E	Grad	s	-1	0	okay i mean did the deep map project which um is undergoing some renovation at at the moment but 
Bed010.E.dialogueact534	1727.89	1731.26	E	Grad	s	-1	0	okay at at the moment but this this uh three language protract german english japanese and 
Bed010.B.dialogueact535	1731.16	1731.46	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay and 
Bed010.E.dialogueact536	1731.93	1739.99	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	okay and um we have uh uh uh i have taken care of that we have speed the japanese generation and stuff and 
Bed010.E.dialogueact537	1739.99	1743.3	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and stuff and so i looked into a special um description so we can generate 
Bed010.E.dialogueact538	1743.3	1749.51	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	uhhuh so we can generate especially description sounded to for me to be and and information on object german english and japanese since 
Bed010.B.dialogueact539	1746.24	1746.57	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh and and 
Bed010.E.dialogueact540	1749.51	1755.86	E	Grad	s	+1	0	since there's a huge show project on special descriptions is differences in especially descriptions 
Bed010.E.dialogueact541	1756.48	1758.06	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	what if you if you're interested in that so how how 
Bed010.E.dialogueact542	1758.57	1759.34	E	Grad	qw.%--	-1	0	so how how i mean that definitely 
Bed010.E.dialogueact543	1759.34	1763.37	E	Grad	s	-1	0	uhhuh i mean that definitely going all the way down to the conceptual level to some extent so 
Bed010.B.dialogueact544	1762.77	1763.06	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	uhhuh level to some extent so 
Bed010.E.dialogueact545	1763.37	1763.65	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	so 
Bed010.E.dialogueact546	1764.68	1765.3	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	so where's um 
Bed010.C.dialogueact547	1765.48	1766.98	C	Professor	qw^rt	-1	0	so where's this huge project 
Bed010.E.dialogueact548	1767.42	1768.22	E	Grad	s	+1	0	it's nice it's the 
Bed010.E.dialogueact549	1768.61	1774.59	E	Grad	s	-1	0	uhhuh it's the be the folks generation off uh spurs descriptions and whatever 
Bed010.C.dialogueact550	1770.29	1770.61	C	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	uhhuh generation 
Bed010.E.dialogueact551	1775.88	1779.83	E	Grad	%	-1	0	uhhuh well it may be another thing to keep it from but um i i think 
Bed010.C.dialogueact552	1776.47	1778.07	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	uhhuh well it may be another thing to keep it from

Bed010.C.dialogueact706	2057.11	2057.98	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	just put it like that yeah i 
Bed010.C.dialogueact708	2057.98	2058.13	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	just put it like that yeah but it's i 
Bed010.E.dialogueact707	2057.67	2057.99	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	just put it like that yeah i 
Bed010.C.dialogueact710	2058.61	2074.26	C	Professor	fg|s	+1	1	uhhuh but it's something that i didn't know until about a week ago or so is apparently there are separate brain areas four things within reach reaching things that are out of reach so there's there's 
Bed010.E.dialogueact709	2058.15	2058.29	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	but it's 
Bed010.B.dialogueact712	2074.63	2075.06	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh so there's there's uh all this linguistics 
Bed010.C.dialogueact711	2074.61	2081.41	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uhhuh mm so there's there's uh all this linguistics stuff about you know near and far or you on and and so forth so this is 
Bed010.B.dialogueact713	2080.69	2080.84	B	Grad	b	-1	0	mm and and so forth 
Bed010.C.dialogueact714	2081.67	2083.67	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so this is what this is this is linguistic facts but apparently 
Bed010.C.dialogueact715	2083.67	2087.6	C	Professor	s	-1	0	facts but apparently and uh here's the way the findings go 
Bed010.C.dialogueact716	2088.25	2096.3	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that yeah they do m. r. i and and if you or uh got something within reach then there's one clip your areas lights up into some things out 
Bed010.C.dialogueact717	2096.3	2098.98	C	Professor	s	-1	0	up into some things out of reach uh a different one 
Bed010.C.dialogueact718	2100.07	2105.06	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	here's the new amazing resell um they say you 
Bed010.C.dialogueact719	2105.87	2112.99	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you get someone with a with the deficit so that they i uh perfectly normal ability at distance thing so 
Bed010.C.dialogueact720	2112.99	2115.76	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	at distance thing so they just difficult task to subdivisions there's 
Bed010.C.dialogueact721	2115.76	2119.99	C	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	to subdivisions there's a a line on the wall over there and you get laser pointer and you say where's the midpoint 
Bed010.C.dialogueact722	2119.99	2120.79	C	Professor	s	-1	0	where's the midpoint they do for 
Bed010.C.dialogueact723	2121.66	2123.48	C	Professor	s	-1	0	if you give the line into touch it they can't 
Bed010.C.dialogueact724	2123.61	2124.16	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	it they can't it's just 
Bed010.C.dialogueact725	2124.76	2127.26	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it's just that part of the brain isn't functioning so they can't do the here's 
Bed010.C.dialogueact726	2128.01	2129.07	C	Professor	s	-1	0	a real experiment same 
Bed010.C.dialogueact727	2129.63	2131.98	C	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	same thing on the wall human laser where's it 
Bed010.B.dialogueact729	2132.85	2133.09	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh they do it give a stack 
Bed010.C.dialogueact728	2132.43	2132.8	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	uhhuh they do it 
Bed010.C.dialogueact730	2133.05	2135.15	C	Professor	s:s	-1	0	give a stack long stick and say do it they can't do it 
Bed010.C.dialogueact731	2135.15	2135.89	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	it they can't do it 
Bed010.C.dialogueact732	2136.74	2142.39	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yes so there's a re mapping of distance space into nearby space 
Bed010.A.dialogueact733	2141.68	2141.86	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yes nearby space 
Bed010.A.dialogueact734	2143.34	2143.93	A	PhD	s^bu.%-	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed010.A.dialogueact736	2144.16	2145.45	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	yeah it's not within reach

Bed010.C.dialogueact737	2145.17	2149.62	C	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	yeah yeah it's not within reach and use that within reach uh mechanism i'll uh 
Bed010.B.dialogueact740	2146.19	2146.4	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah and use that uh 
Bed010.F.dialogueact739	2146.17	2147.23	F	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	yeah and use that within reach uh 
Bed010.B.dialogueact741	2148.87	2149.29	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	uh mechanism i'll 
Bed010.A.dialogueact743	2150.03	2150.61	A	PhD	b	-1	0	they dig up reference 
Bed010.C.dialogueact742	2149.9	2151.14	C	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	mechanism i'll they dig up reference and so this 
Bed010.B.dialogueact744	2151.45	2151.87	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	and so this 
Bed010.C.dialogueact745	2151.48	2153.57	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and so this start this is uh the first explain 
Bed010.C.dialogueact746	2153.57	2155.97	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh the first explain something that i've always wondered about 
Bed010.C.dialogueact747	2156.59	2159.23	C	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	and i'll do this this testing you guys as well so 
Bed010.C.dialogueact748	2159.61	2159.87	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	well so 
Bed010.C.dialogueact749	2160.38	2173.75	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh i i have had experience not often but a certain numbers of times and for example i'm working with a pool a screwdriver something for a long time i start feeling the tip directly 
Bed010.C.dialogueact750	2174.36	2175.26	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	yeah not in direct that you actually 
Bed010.C.dialogueact751	2175.26	2177.6	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah uhhuh that you actually can feel the tip and people who

Bed010.A.dialogueact789	2240.6	2243.19	A	PhD	s	-1	0	away right right yeah yeah i said 
Bed010.B.dialogueact790	2240.63	2241.05	B	Grad	b	-1	0	away right right 
Bed010.C.dialogueact791	2240.84	2241.65	C	Professor	b	-1	0	away right right 
Bed010.C.dialogueact792	2243.39	2249.57	C	Professor	fg|s^tc	-1	0	that's cool yeah yeah i said this was the first actual experimental evidence i'd seen it was consistent with this anecdotal stuff 
Bed010.B.dialogueact793	2244.84	2245.39	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	that's cool this was the first actual experimental 
Bed010.C.dialogueact794	2250.09	2257.38	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and of course it makes a lovely deaf that story about why languages uh uh make this the fish of course the behavioral 
Bed010.C.dialogueact795	2257.38	2259.37	C	Professor	s	-1	0	fish of course the behavioral differences two things you can reach 
Bed010.C.dialogueact796	2259.37	2261.44	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah two things you can reach really quite different things you can't but there 
Bed010.B.dialogueact797	2261.61	2262.06	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah you can't but there seems to be an actual 
Bed010.C.dialogueact798	2261.86	2266.27	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah you can't but there seems to be an actual really deep embodied girl difference that this is 
Bed010.C.dialogueact799	2266.27	2267.67	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	that this is uh so 
Bed010.C.dialogueact800	2267.92	2270.22	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	uh so in addition to the he there's an approximate this'll 
Bed010.E.dialogueact801	2269.88	2271.87	E	Grad	s	-1	0	he yeah exactly so there's an approximate this'll 
Bed010.C.dialogueact802	2271.14	2271.91	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah exactly so 
Bed010.C.dialogueact803	2271.91	2283.8	C	Professor	s	+1	1	yeah exactly so addition the ego in aloe centric uh which appear older especially also apparently have this partial but still thing which is very deeply embedded 
Bed010.C.dialogueact804	2284.59	2284.92	C	Professor	%	-1	0	well 
Bed010.E.dialogueact805	2285.04	2286.46	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	then nintendo sort of he he does 
Bed010.E.dialogueact806	2286.46	2291.09	E	Grad	s	-1	0	of he he does see or is it the cognitive from world down in santa barbara and 
Bed010.E.dialogueact807	2291.89	2294.03	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and he he always talks about these he he already 
Bed010.E.dialogueact808	2294.49	2295.31	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	he he already but probably most 
Bed010.E.dialogueact809	2295.31	2303.8	E	Grad	s	-1	0	well this isn't a lot of behavioral but probably most talking about doing this this evidence is talking about these small scares basis that you can manipulated versus large scale environmental justice 
Bed010.C.dialogueact810	2297.69	2297.94	C	Professor	b	-1	0	this this evidence 
Bed010.C.dialogueact811	2302.71	2307.33	C	Professor	s	-1	0	well this isn't a lot of behavioral things on this it was the first north north isn't much with that large scale environmental justice 
Bed010.C.dialogueact812	2308.96	2310.99	C	Professor	s^cc^tc	-1	0	yeah yes well well look at this 
Bed010.C.dialogueact813	2311.9	2314.85	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and so all of these issues now are now starting the crops and 
Bed010.C.dialogueact814	2314.85	2316.41	C	Professor	s	-1	0	starting the crops and outward all done with them is starting to do science 
Bed010.C.dialogueact815	2316.41	2317.32	C	Professor	s	-1	0	them is starting to do science right and 
Bed010.C.dialogueact816	2317.32	2317.67	C	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right and 
Bed010.C.dialogueact817	2317.67	2329.55	C	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	uhhuh uhhuh right and so these issues about uh reference in special reference discourse reference uh all this sort of stuff uh dykes this which is part of what you were talking about 
Bed010.B.dialogueact818	2325.2	2325.6	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh all this sort 
Bed010.B.dialogueact819	2329.67	2330.01	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh about um 
Bed010.C.dialogueact820	2330.01	2336.63	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um so all of this stuff is coming up essentially starting now 
Bed010.C.dialogueact821	2337.5	2338.39	C	Professor	s^co	+1	1	we got to do all this so 
Bed010.C.dialogueact822	2339.01	2339.91	C	Professor	s^t	-1	0	there's that and 
Bed010.C.dialogueact823	2339.91	2344.54	C	Professor	s^t	+1	0	there's that and then then there's also a set of systems things that come up so 
Bed010.C.dialogueact824	2344.98	2349.09	C	Professor	s:s	+1	2	uhhuh yeah that come up so okay we're not using their system that means we need our system it it 
Bed010.B.dialogueact825	2349.12	2349.48	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	uhhuh yeah it it 
Bed010.C.dialogueact826	2349.15	2349.39	C	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	uhhuh yeah it it 
Bed010.B.dialogueact828	2349.85	2350.13	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	uhhuh yeah it it follows and 
Bed010.C.dialogueact827	2349.39	2350.49	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uhhuh yeah it it follows and 
Bed010.C.dialogueact829	2350.9	2362.23	C	Professor	fh|s^cc	+1	1	follows and so uh in addition to the business about just getting the linguistics right in the formal as him and stuff we actually going to build something 
Bed010.C.dialogueact830	2363.1	2369.99	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and uh john oh is point person on you parse or analyze or whatever that is 
Bed010.C.dialogueact831	2370.55	2376.96	C	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	and we're going to start on that in parallel with the uh the grammar stuff 
Bed010.B.dialogueact833	2377.49	2377.8	B	Grad	b	-1	0	but 
Bed010.C.dialogueact832	2377.4	2383.62	C	Professor	s	+1	1	but to do that we're going to need to make some decisions like an apology 
Bed010.C.dialogueact834	2384.69	2398.81	C	Professor	fh|s.%--:qy.%--	-1	0	so uh and so this is another thing where we're going to you know to get involved and makes relatively early i think make some decisions on is there non apology a. p. i. uh that there's 
Bed010.C.dialogueact835	2398.81	2401.54	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh that there's a certain standard way of getting things month allergies and we 
Bed010.C.dialogueact836	2401.54	2404.07	C	Professor	s	-1	0	allergies and we build departure and stuff around that or is there a particular 
Bed010.C.dialogueact837	2404.19	2411.95	C	Professor	qy	-1	0	or is there a particular on apology that we're going to standardize on and if so for example is there something that we can use their 
Bed010.C.dialogueact838	2412.37	2423.96	C	Professor	qy	+1	1	it does uh or the uh smart come project or one of the projects that the email have something that we can just pull out for that 
Bed010.C.dialogueact839	2425.39	2433.71	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	so they're going to be some some some things like that which are not science but system 
Bed010.C.dialogueact840	2435.2	2436.18	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but we are can ignore this because we're we're not only 
Bed010.C.dialogueact841	2436.18	2444.37	C	Professor	s^df	+1	1	because we're we're not only going to play is not only to lay out this thing that actually build some of 
Bed010.C.dialogueact842	2445.2	2447.05	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i and how much we building and so forth 
Bed010.B.dialogueact843	2447.17	2447.46	B	Grad	%--	-1	0	i 
Bed010.C.dialogueact844	2484.15	2487.8	C	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	he is with looks 
Bed010.C.dialogueact845	2487.8	2503.69	C	Professor	s	+1	1	he is with looks like we're now in a position that the construction analyzers that we want for this applied project can be the same as the construction analyze that nancy needs for the child language modeling 
Bed010.C.dialogueact846	2504.29	2505.66	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so it's always been out of face but it now 
Bed010.C.dialogueact847	2505.66	2510.14	C	Professor	s	-1	0	of face but it now seems that um there's a good shot at so we've talked 
Bed010.C.dialogueact848	2510.45	2511.51	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so we've talked about it 
Bed010.C.dialogueact849	2511.63	2517.44	C	Professor	s	-1	0	okay about it and the hope is that we can make these things the same 
Bed010.B.dialogueact850	2517.84	2518.12	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay and of course 
Bed010.C.dialogueact851	2518.47	2522.23	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uhhuh and of course it's only in both cases only one piece of a bigger system it would be 
Bed010.B.dialogueact852	2522.35	2522.66	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh it would be 
Bed010.C.dialogueact853	2522.74	2526.32	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uhhuh right it would be nice if that piece we're exactly the same piece it was just this 
Bed010.B.dialogueact855	2526.61	2526.87	B	Grad	b	-1	0	right piece it was just this 
Bed010.C.dialogueact854	2526.32	2530.38	C	Professor	s	-1	0	right piece it was just this uh construction allies or 
Bed010.C.dialogueact856	2531.17	2535.76	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	okay and so we think we think we have a shot at that 
Bed010.B.dialogueact857	2535.98	2536.2	B	Grad	b	-1	0	okay at that 
Bed010.C.dialogueact858	2549.36	2549.89	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so therefore itself 
Bed010.C.dialogueact859	2549.89	2550.22	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so therefore itself to to come full 
Bed010.C.dialogueact860	2550.45	2553.82	C	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	to to come full circle on that is foremost nations task 
Bed010.C.dialogueact861	2554.3	2554.64	C	Professor	qy^d^f	-1	0	okay 
Bed010.C.dialogueact862	2555.11	2565.37	C	Professor	s^e.%-	+1	0	yeah you used to someone is is trying to get the formal as you know put into a a shape work and actually uh 
Bed010.B.dialogueact863	2564.03	2564.24	B	Grad	fg	-1	0	uh 
Bed010.B.dialogueact864	2565.18	2566.85	B	Grad	s^2	+1	0	you used to someone is trying to do this well 
Bed010.B.dialogueact865	2566.85	2566.97	B	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	trying to do this well 
Bed010.C.dialogueact866	2566.85	2567.33	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	trying to do this well yeah where'd actually is 
Bed010.C.dialogueact867	2567.43	2570.2	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah where'd actually is is covers the whole range of things 
Bed010.C.dialogueact868	2570.95	2579.56	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and the the the the thing that got marking the worst trouble is he had a very ambitious and he was trying to do and 
Bed010.C.dialogueact869	2579.66	2585.97	C	Professor	s	-1	0	to do and he insisted on trying to do it with the limited set of mechanisms that 
Bed010.C.dialogueact870	2585.97	2588.47	C	Professor	s	-1	0	okay mechanisms that turned out inherently not to cover the space 
Bed010.B.dialogueact871	2588.64	2588.92	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay space 
Bed010.C.dialogueact872	2589.07	2591.9	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah it just was just terribly frustrating form 
Bed010.B.dialogueact873	2592.05	2592.3	B	Grad	b	-1	0	he 
Bed010.C.dialogueact874	2592.07	2599.25	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	okay right he seem fully committed to both sides of this if you reconcile a boy thing 
Bed010.B.dialogueact875	2596.46	2596.78	B	Grad	b	-1	0	okay if 
Bed010.B.dialogueact876	2598.38	2598.61	B	Grad	b	-1	0	right a boy thing 
Bed010.C.dialogueact877	2599.75	2600.72	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	and 
Bed010.C.dialogueact878	2602.09	2604.81	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	john oh is much more pragmatic 
Bed010.B.dialogueact879	2605.09	2605.34	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay yeah 
Bed010.B.dialogueact881	2606.85	2607.29	B	Grad	s	-1	0	huh this is 
Bed010.C.dialogueact880	2606.63	2606.84	C	Professor	qy^br^rt	-1	0	huh 
Bed010.C.dialogueact882	2607.62	2608.31	C	Professor	s	-1	0	this is true it's not yeah 
Bed010.C.dialogueact883	2608.31	2608.67	C	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	true it's not yeah 
Bed010.D.dialogueact884	2608.81	2609.15	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	true it's not okay yeah 
Bed010.C.dialogueact885	2609.4	2609.83	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bed010.C.dialogueact886	2610.22	2617.33	C	Professor	s	-1	0	okay so there's you know sort of deep really deep emotional commitment to a certain theory being uh complete 
Bed010.B.dialogueact887	2615.04	2615.39	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed010.F.dialogueact888	2617.05	2618.63	F	Grad	qy^d^j^rt	-1	0	oh

Bed010.C.dialogueact895	2625.45	2628.45	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh now you do but that's okay 
Bed010.C.dialogueact896	2629.18	2630.36	C	Professor	fh|%-	-1	0	because i don't have to implement uh so for for 
Bed010.B.dialogueact897	2630.19	2631.58	B	Grad	s^df^j	-1	0	because i don't have to implement anything for exactly right 
Bed010.C.dialogueact898	2631.34	2632.12	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	anything exactly right exactly 
Bed010.C.dialogueact900	2633.1	2633.5	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	cause was 
Bed010.F.dialogueact899	2632.83	2633.84	F	Grad	s^j	-1	0	exactly cause was 
Bed010.F.dialogueact901	2635.16	2638.38	F	Grad	s^j	-1	0	yeah right well yeah 
Bed010.A.dialogueact902	2636.28	2636.58	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bed010.C.dialogueact906	2638.71	2647.57	C	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	right well yeah actually uh the thing is you you do but the the thing you have to implement is is so small that uh 
Bed010.F.dialogueact905	2638.69	2639.57	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	right well yeah actually 
Bed010.F.dialogueact907	2647.14	2649.17	F	Grad	s^2^j	-1	0	uh within that yeah 
Bed010.C.dialogueact908	2648.75	2649.49	C	Professor	s^aa^m	-1	0	within that yeah

Bed010.C.dialogueact964	2765.26	2772.69	C	Professor	s	+1	1	and actually i talked today too e. uh undergraduate who wants to do an honors thesis s 
Bed010.C.dialogueact965	2773.69	2774.39	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bed010.F.dialogueact966	2773.7	2774.61	F	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	uh 
Bed010.C.dialogueact967	2775.06	2775.86	C	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	no interest 
Bed010.C.dialogueact968	2775.86	2776.81	C	Professor	s	-1	0	no interest mean 
Bed010.F.dialogueact969	2776.63	2778.63	F	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	mean some some of them 
Bed010.C.dialogueact970	2778.47	2779.41	C	Professor	s^arp	-1	0	some some of them yeah so 
Bed010.F.dialogueact971	2778.91	2779.37	F	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	some some of them yeah so 
Bed010.C.dialogueact972	2780.08	2781.13	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	anyway uh 
Bed010.C.dialogueact973	2781.21	2786.31	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uhhuh uh but that's just another one of these ones is the three point nine average and so forth and so on 
Bed010.B.dialogueact974	2785.58	2785.97	B	Grad	b	-1	0	uhhuh and so forth and 
Bed010.C.dialogueact975	2786.96	2790.97	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	so on so uh um i get i've given her some things to read 
Bed010.C.dialogueact976	2791.69	2792.57	C	Professor	s	-1	0	supposed to discuss how it's another 
Bed010.C.dialogueact977	2792.57	2798.03	C	Professor	s	+1	1	discuss how it's another one of the incoming first incoming first year graduate students a expressed so we'll see how that goes 
Bed010.C.dialogueact978	2798.03	2798.9	C	Professor	s	-1	0	we'll see how that goes 
Bed010.C.dialogueact979	2799.74	2800.28	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed010.C.dialogueact980	2801.17	2801.52	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	anyway 
Bed010.C.dialogueact981	2803.48	2827.99	C	Professor	fh|s^t	+1	2	so i think it's for as this group goes um it's certainly worth continuing or for the next few weeks to get closure on d. uh belief that in the ideas that are involved in that and what are the what are the concepts 
Bed010.C.dialogueact982	2829.41	2842.28	C	Professor	s	-1	0	we'll see whether it's going to make sense to have this be separate from the other bigger effort with the formal station stuff or not i'm not sure 
Bed010.C.dialogueact983	2842.28	2842.93	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	not i'm not sure 
Bed010.C.dialogueact984	2843.06	2847.58	C	Professor	s	-1	0	partly depends on what your thesis turns out to be how that goes 
Bed010.C.dialogueact985	2848.28	2849.39	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so it was like and then 
Bed010.C.dialogueact986	2849.75	2853.61	C	Professor	s^co	-1	0	it was like and then i mean you can decide you know how much time you want to put into it 
Bed010.C.dialogueact987	2853.74	2857.44	C	Professor	s	-1	0	into it and uh it's it's beginning to take shape shape so 
Bed010.A.dialogueact988	2855.21	2855.42	A	PhD	b	-1	0	it's it's beginning 
Bed010.C.dialogueact989	2857.44	2860.65	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	right shape so uh and i
