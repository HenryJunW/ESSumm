Speaker me026 has been experimenting with spectral subtraction using different data window sizes.
One possible idea is to use increasing windows as more data becomes available.
Speaker mn049 has been working on Wiener filtering , and testing with just the base system provides 30% improvement.
Using a second stage of filtering led to even more improvement.
Speaker mn007 is working on spectral subtraction , still with minimal results.
Smoothing seems to help , and implementing alongside the neural net should also be positive.
He has also been working on noise estimation with an energy minima approach that does not require the voice activity detector.
