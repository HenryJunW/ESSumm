In the first part of the Berkeley Meeting Recorder group meeting , members discussed the results and implications of a spoken digit recognition experiment using lapel microphones and the Hidden Markov Model Toolkit ( HTK ).
It is reported that while the lapel microphones deliver good results , the HTK is outperformed by the SRI toolkit.
Comparisons to other digit corpora such as TI are also made.
The second part of the discussion focused on alignment of multiple speaker channels , specifically the problems of overlapping speech and back-channelling.
Speaker adaptation was identified as an important issue is recognition as well as alignment.
