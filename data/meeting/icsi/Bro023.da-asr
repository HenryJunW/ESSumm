Bro023.A.dialogueact54	71.778	75.468	A	PhD	fg|s^tc	+1	1	so um i guess we got lots to catch up on we haven't 
Bro023.A.dialogueact55	75.468	77.008	A	PhD	s^df	+1	1	catch up on we haven't met for a couple of weeks we didn't meet last week morning 
Bro023.A.dialogueact56	77.008	78.118	A	PhD	s	-1	0	we didn't meet last week morning um i went 
Bro023.A.dialogueact57	78.63	80.02	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um i went around talk to everybody in seemed like they they 
Bro023.A.dialogueact58	80.02	82.45	A	PhD	s	-1	0	in seemed like they they had some new results but 
Bro023.A.dialogueact59	82.45	88.749	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but rather than them coming up and telling me i figure we should just wait a week and they can tell those you know all of us 
Bro023.A.dialogueact60	89.564	90.654	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bro023.A.dialogueact61	91.751	93.901	A	PhD	qw^co	+1	1	why don't we we start with you dave 
Bro023.A.dialogueact63	94.431	96.811	A	PhD	s^co	-1	0	and then um we can 
Bro023.E.dialogueact62	94.25	94.66	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	and then um 
Bro023.A.dialogueact64	97.451	97.561	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro023.E.dialogueact65	97.94	114.7	E	Grad	fg|s	+1	2	so i'm since we're looking at putting this um mean log manatees spectacle subtraction um into the smart on this um i i do the testing if um it would work you can pass tony and plus the present to calculate the means so 
Bro023.E.dialogueact66	114.7	124.104	E	Grad	s	+1	1	the means so i just passed um where i use twelve seconds from the past and the present frame to uh calculate the mean and 
Bro023.E.dialogueact67	124.614	125.064	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	twelve second and 
Bro023.A.dialogueact68	125.27	126.22	A	PhD	s^bk^m	-1	0	twelve second 
Bro023.A.dialogueact69	127.231	129.771	A	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	told told seconds back from the current things that 
Bro023.A.dialogueact71	129.771	130.271	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	things that i mean close 
Bro023.E.dialogueact70	129.658	129.918	E	Grad	h	-1	0	things that 
Bro023.E.dialogueact72	130.99	134.52	E	Grad	s^na	+1	1	i mean okay okay close second um counting back from the end of the current frame yes 
Bro023.A.dialogueact74	134.66	134.84	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay okay frame yes 
Bro023.A.dialogueact76	134.99	135.25	A	PhD	s^bk^r	-1	0	okay okay frame yes it was um 
Bro023.E.dialogueact73	134.63	134.96	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	okay okay frame yes 
Bro023.E.dialogueact75	134.96	137.67	E	Grad	s	+1	1	okay okay frame yes it was um what i think it was twenty one frames frame that 
Bro023.E.dialogueact77	137.67	139.53	E	Grad	s	-1	0	one frames frame that work that's about i and 
Bro023.A.dialogueact78	139.58	139.94	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i and 
Bro023.E.dialogueact79	140.11	146.57	E	Grad	s^rt	+1	1	and compared to um did using it twelve seconds centered window i think there was a drop in performance it was just 
Bro023.E.dialogueact80	146.63	147.66	E	Grad	s	+1	1	performance it was just like uh 
Bro023.A.dialogueact82	148.29	148.54	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.C.dialogueact81	148.237	148.907	C	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.E.dialogueact83	148.98	149.51	E	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.C.dialogueact84	150.21	150.92	C	Professor	h	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.C.dialogueact85	151.21	152.79	C	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	yeah i mean it's pretty it's pretty tiny 
Bro023.C.dialogueact87	153.23	153.46	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.E.dialogueact86	152.92	153.2	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	it's pretty tiny 
Bro023.E.dialogueact88	154.255	155.325	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so it's encouraging and um 
Bro023.E.dialogueact89	155.325	156.215	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bro023.E.dialogueact90	157.585	163.255	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	that that um that's encouraging for for the idea of using an interactive system like smart calm 
Bro023.E.dialogueact91	164.05	168.1	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and um another issue i'm i'm thinking about is in the smart some system so say 
Bro023.E.dialogueact92	168.67	172.2	E	Grad	s	+1	1	so say put twelve seconds and you're they're testing like a good length of time but what 
Bro023.E.dialogueact93	172.66	174.91	E	Grad	qw	+1	1	but what happens if you a lesson call second 
Bro023.E.dialogueact94	175.57	176.74	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bro023.E.dialogueact95	178.07	185.4	E	Grad	s	+1	1	so i would be foot before um backing me i did some experiments using say two seconds of four seconds or six seconds know 
Bro023.E.dialogueact96	185.74	192.81	E	Grad	s	+1	1	seconds know as i trained the models using mean subtraction with the means calculated over two seconds of four seconds or six seconds 
Bro023.E.dialogueact97	193.41	194.51	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bro023.E.dialogueact98	195.864	199.124	E	Grad	s	+1	1	here i was curious what if i train the models using twelve seconds but i i gave 
Bro023.E.dialogueact99	199.434	205.164	E	Grad	s	+1	1	but i i gave it a situation where the test that i was subtract using two seconds of four seconds or six seconds and um 
Bro023.E.dialogueact100	205.164	206.424	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bro023.E.dialogueact101	207.78	210.87	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so i did that for about three different conditions 
Bro023.E.dialogueact102	211.08	212.06	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um i mean 
Bro023.E.dialogueact103	212.847	216.067	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i mean i i think it was um fourth i think 
Bro023.E.dialogueact104	216.847	223.565	E	Grad	s^r	-1	0	i think i think it was um something like four seconds and um six seconds and eight seconds something like that 
Bro023.E.dialogueact105	223.565	224.195	E	Grad	s	-1	0	seconds something like that and it seems like 
Bro023.E.dialogueact106	224.415	230.615	E	Grad	s	+1	1	and it seems like it it it hurts compared to if you actually train the models using that same length of time but it doesn't 
Bro023.E.dialogueact107	230.675	232.285	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	length of time but it doesn't hurt that much um 
Bro023.E.dialogueact108	232.285	232.755	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro023.E.dialogueact109	233.522	236.232	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	you usually less than twenty five percent although i think i did see 
Bro023.E.dialogueact110	236.232	241.392	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	although i think i did see one where was it point eight percent or so rising were error rate but this 
Bro023.E.dialogueact111	241.752	256.012	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	rate but this is um where um even if i trained on daytime models means attracted with the same length of time isn't attached it to where areas around um ten percent or ninety percent so it doesn't seem like that 
Bro023.E.dialogueact112	256.012	258.142	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	but it but looking so it doesn't seem like that big of a difference 
Bro023.C.dialogueact113	258.49	264.57	C	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	but it but looking at the other way is that what you're saying that it didn't help you to have the longer time for training if you were 
Bro023.C.dialogueact114	264.65	266.37	C	Professor	s^e.%--	-1	0	training if you were going to have a short time for that 
Bro023.E.dialogueact115	266.87	268.15	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	for that that's true um 
Bro023.E.dialogueact116	268.57	269.09	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro023.C.dialogueact117	270.046	274.606	C	Professor	qw	+1	1	yeah it seems like for your i mean why would you do it if you knew that you were going to have for windows 
Bro023.E.dialogueact118	270.236	271.266	E	Grad	%	-1	0	i mean why would you do it if you knew that you were going 
Bro023.A.dialogueact119	273.847	278.867	A	PhD	s	+1	1	yeah it seems like for your in normal situations would never get twelve seconds of speech

Bro023.C.dialogueact135	298.06	310.759	C	Professor	s	+1	1	the other thing i'm which may really it's a little bit something else we've talked about in terms of when doing and so on is that um i wonder if you trained to twelve seconds and then when you were two seconds and he two seconds and when you 
Bro023.C.dialogueact136	310.759	312.989	C	Professor	s	+1	1	two seconds and when you were four seconds in use four seconds and 
Bro023.C.dialogueact137	312.989	313.629	C	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	four seconds and we six i mean basically 
Bro023.C.dialogueact138	313.629	315.699	C	Professor	s	+1	1	we six i mean basically build up to the twelve second so that if 
Bro023.C.dialogueact139	315.699	318.209	C	Professor	s	+1	1	second so that if you have very long letter it says you have the best but if 
Bro023.E.dialogueact140	315.741	316.021	E	Grad	b	-1	0	second so that if you have very long letter 
Bro023.C.dialogueact141	318.79	321.33	C	Professor	s	+1	1	but if you have shorter endurance issues but you can't right 
Bro023.E.dialogueact142	321.693	322.083	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right and that's actually what 
Bro023.E.dialogueact143	322.363	325.023	E	Grad	s	+1	1	and that's actually what we're trying to do in smart calm but

Bro023.E.dialogueact147	326.003	331.523	E	Grad	s	-1	0	decided so difficult to question i'll try and get out with those experiments is doesn't matter what models used as a matter how

Bro023.C.dialogueact151	341.744	349.529	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean the other way of looking at this going back to uh mean capsules subtraction versus roster kind of things is that you could cook it in castro subtraction especially the 
Bro023.C.dialogueact152	349.529	353.699	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	especially the way you're doing it as being kind of filter 
Bro023.C.dialogueact153	354.457	356.637	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and so the other thing is just to design a filter 
Bro023.C.dialogueact154	357.753	361.563	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	yeah basically you're you're you're doing i pass filter that pass smoked some sort 
Bro023.C.dialogueact155	362.163	364.063	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and and just i filter and then 
Bro023.C.dialogueact156	364.779	367.119	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	and then you know filter won't have certain behavior and you can look at the startup 
Bro023.C.dialogueact157	367.119	370.527	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	and you can look at the startup behavior you start up with nothing and and you 
Bro023.E.dialogueact158	369.352	370.012	E	Grad	b	-1	0	you start up with nothing and and you 
Bro023.C.dialogueact159	370.527	385.567	C	Professor	s	-1	0	nothing and and you know it will uh if you have an i. r. filter for instance it will um behave in the steady state way that you would like it to behave until you get along period but um 
Bro023.C.dialogueact160	385.567	386.377	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	period but um

Bro023.C.dialogueact162	387.918	394.488	C	Professor	s	-1	0	by just constrain yourself to have your filter be only attractions i mean you're kind of tying your hands behind your back because there's 
Bro023.C.dialogueact163	394.488	398.853	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	your back because there's filters have all sorts of temper owns sparkle behaviors 
Bro023.E.dialogueact164	398.647	399.777	E	Grad	b	-1	0	behaviors and the only thing 
Bro023.C.dialogueact165	399.343	405.543	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and the only thing you know consistent we know about is that you want to get rid of the very low frequency

Bro023.E.dialogueact191	440.046	444.226	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	i was trying to call seconds because that was the that my test before and increasing

Bro023.B.dialogueact195	450.403	451.603	B	PhD	b	-1	0	they um yeah i guess

Bro023.E.dialogueact197	451.894	457.114	E	Grad	s	-1	0	um yeah i guess it's something i need to play with more of this i'd have to set that up for this mark on system like 
Bro023.E.dialogueact198	457.114	464.534	E	Grad	s^cs^e.%--	-1	0	like may maybe if i trained on six seconds that would work better when i only had two seconds four second and

Bro023.E.dialogueact202	467.584	467.714	E	Grad	b	-1	0	um 
Bro023.C.dialogueact203	469.8	475.926	C	Professor	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	yeah and again if you take this filtering perspectives and if you they have it build up over time i mean 
Bro023.C.dialogueact204	475.926	483.253	C	Professor	s	-1	0	up over time i mean if you computed means every two and then over for over six sense what you're getting at is a kind of uh wrap up filter anyway and see me they 
Bro023.C.dialogueact205	483.253	485.203	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and see me they just want to think of is filter but 
Bro023.C.dialogueact206	485.803	508.745	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but yeah if you do that then um in practice somebody using spark i'm system i think they're using it for a while it means that the first daughter rents instead of you know getting a forty percent error rate reduction they'll get a uh over with you get without this uh uh policy uh you get thirty percent 
Bro023.C.dialogueact207	508.745	516.435	C	Professor	s	-1	0	oh so you you cash thirty percent and then the second underage that you give they get the full you know full benefit of it if it's it's ongoing thing 
Bro023.A.dialogueact208	515.671	515.941	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh so it's it's ongoing 
Bro023.A.dialogueact209	515.941	517.741	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	oh so you you cash theater and says that's how it's it's ongoing thing 
Bro023.A.dialogueact210	517.741	518.701	A	PhD	s^bu.%--	-1	0	theater and says that's how you get your 
Bro023.A.dialogueact211	519.341	519.761	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh one thing 
Bro023.C.dialogueact213	519.653	521.073	C	Professor	s^na	-1	0	uh uh okay one thing in practice yeah that's 
Bro023.E.dialogueact212	519.393	521.003	E	Grad	%	-1	0	uh uh okay one thing in practice yeah that's 
Bro023.A.dialogueact214	520.97	521.64	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	uh okay in practice yeah that's 
Bro023.A.dialogueact216	521.7	522.14	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay that's somebody using the system 
Bro023.C.dialogueact215	521.263	525.093	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	okay okay that's somebody using the system to ask for directions or something you know 
Bro023.A.dialogueact217	525.37	525.85	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay you know 
Bro023.C.dialogueact218	525.865	527.355	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	okay you know they'll say something first and and to begin 
Bro023.C.dialogueact219	527.355	531.525	C	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	uhhuh and and to begin with if it doesn't get them quite right maybe i'll come back and say excuse me 
Bro023.A.dialogueact220	532.0	532.39	A	PhD	b	-1	0	uh us i mean 
Bro023.C.dialogueact221	532.085	532.695	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh us i mean

Bro023.C.dialogueact223	532.955	534.695	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh us i mean should have some policy like that anyway

Bro023.C.dialogueact226	537.5	539.76	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh in any that they might ask a second question and 
Bro023.C.dialogueact227	539.76	543.97	C	Professor	s	-1	0	question and it's not like what he's doing doesn't uh improve things 
Bro023.C.dialogueact228	544.4	545.66	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it does improve things just 
Bro023.C.dialogueact229	546.01	547.22	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	not as much as you would like 
Bro023.C.dialogueact230	548.18	554.287	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	be really and so uh there's a higher probability of making an air uh the first daughter 
Bro023.A.dialogueact231	554.736	556.386	A	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	be really cool that you could have this 
Bro023.A.dialogueact232	556.886	558.566	A	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	this probably uses would never like this but if you had 
Bro023.A.dialogueact233	558.566	564.947	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	like this but if you had kind of a system where um before they began to use it they had to introduce themselves early 
Bro023.C.dialogueact234	564.25	564.83	C	Professor	b	-1	0	early 
Bro023.A.dialogueact235	565.207	565.597	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	you know hi my name 
Bro023.A.dialogueact237	565.597	565.837	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	you know hi my name 
Bro023.A.dialogueact238	565.837	566.657	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	you know hi my name is on so i'm from 
Bro023.C.dialogueact236	565.505	565.855	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	you know hi my name 
Bro023.A.dialogueact239	566.657	567.277	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	is on so i'm from a in you could use 
Bro023.A.dialogueact240	567.277	570.894	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	a in you could use that initial speech to do all these have patience 
Bro023.A.dialogueact242	570.894	571.014	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	have patience 
Bro023.C.dialogueact243	570.98	571.27	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	have patience 
Bro023.E.dialogueact241	570.89	572.08	E	Grad	b	-1	0	have patience oh the other thing i guess 
Bro023.C.dialogueact244	572.313	574.123	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	oh the other thing i guess which which uh 
Bro023.C.dialogueact245	574.123	574.503	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bro023.C.dialogueact246	575.264	577.874	C	Professor	s^no	+1	1	i don't know much about not so sure about this the system but 
Bro023.C.dialogueact247	577.874	579.094	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	this the system but but um 
Bro023.C.dialogueact248	580.133	584.385	C	Professor	qy^cs.%--	-1	0	couldn't you uh if you if you sort of did a first pass i don't 
Bro023.C.dialogueact249	584.815	598.577	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	i don't know what kind of uh uh capability we have at the moment for for doing second passes on on uh uh some kind of little small last or graph for fusion network or something but if 
Bro023.C.dialogueact250	598.577	608.376	C	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	or something but if you did first pass with um he was easy without the means of uh subtraction are with uh uh very short time one 
Bro023.C.dialogueact251	609.262	634.423	C	Professor	s	+1	1	and then um went to uh actually had the whole letter in san if you did uh uh longer time version then based on everything that you had um and then at that point only used it to distinguish between possible addresses or something you you might it might not take very much time yeah 
Bro023.C.dialogueact252	634.974	644.924	C	Professor	s	+1	1	yeah know in um start vocabulary stuff uh systems people we're evaluating uh in the past some people really pushed everything in to make it anyone one passed but 
Bro023.C.dialogueact253	644.924	647.294	C	Professor	s	+1	1	it anyone one passed but the people didn't and have multiple passes and 
Bro023.C.dialogueact254	648.014	648.884	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro023.C.dialogueact255	649.55	658.17	C	Professor	s:s	+1	1	the argument um against multiple passes was it has often been but we want this to be you know that nice interactive response and the counter 
Bro023.C.dialogueact256	658.637	662.827	C	Professor	s:s^bk	+1	1	and the counter argument to that which is a b. b. n. i think had was yeah but our 
Bro023.C.dialogueact257	662.827	667.177	C	Professor	s:s	+1	1	yeah but our second responses second that passes and took us is a really really fast so 
Bro023.A.dialogueact258	667.37	667.79	A	PhD	b	-1	0	so 
Bro023.C.dialogueact259	668.07	672.6	C	Professor	fh|qh	-1	0	um if if you're second past takes a millisecond who cares 
Bro023.C.dialogueact260	673.772	674.302	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.E.dialogueact261	675.75	676.86	E	Grad	fg	-1	0	so um 
Bro023.E.dialogueact262	678.084	682.694	E	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	the the idea of the second pass would be waiting till you have more recorded speech or 
Bro023.E.dialogueact263	682.694	683.034	E	Grad	qrr.%--	-1	0	yeah so it turned out speech or 
Bro023.C.dialogueact264	683.21	683.37	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah so it turned out 
Bro023.C.dialogueact265	683.37	705.245	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah so it turned out to be a problem that you didn't have enough speech because you need longer and longer window to do this processing then uh one tactic is looking at the larger system and not just at the front and stuff is to take in um speech we some simpler mechanism or shorter time mechanism um 
Bro023.E.dialogueact266	691.793	692.413	E	Grad	b	-1	0	processing then 
Bro023.C.dialogueact267	706.034	710.504	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	do the best you can come up with some a possible alternative it might have been set 
Bro023.C.dialogueact268	711.737	717.327	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and uh either in the form of an end does list or in the form of a lot of us or confusion network or whatever and 
Bro023.E.dialogueact269	715.93	716.32	E	Grad	b	-1	0	of us or confusion network or whatever 
Bro023.C.dialogueact270	717.855	725.045	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and then the decoding of that much much faster can't be much much faster if it isn't a big pushing network and you can 
Bro023.C.dialogueact271	725.632	733.532	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and you can decode that uh with speech that you've actually processed using this longer time uh subtraction 
Bro023.E.dialogueact272	732.089	733.089	E	Grad	b	-1	0	uh subtraction 
Bro023.C.dialogueact273	736.25	744.3	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	i mean it it's it's common people do this sort of thing where they do more things are more complex require looking over more time whatever in some kind of second pass 
Bro023.E.dialogueact274	742.23	742.72	E	Grad	b	-1	0	whatever in 
Bro023.E.dialogueact275	744.475	744.725	E	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.C.dialogueact276	745.138	762.375	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um and again it's the second passes really really fast uh another one i've heard of is is in in connected digit stuff um going back and and to back trace and finding regions that are considered to be uh a digit but i would have very low energy 
Bro023.E.dialogueact277	762.772	763.242	E	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.E.dialogueact278	765.662	765.902	E	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.C.dialogueact279	766.42	769.94	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	so uh i mean there's lots of things you can do in second passes all sorts of levels 
Bro023.C.dialogueact280	770.42	771.7	C	Professor	s	-1	0	anyway spring too many things out 
Bro023.C.dialogueact281	771.84	771.95	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	many things out 
Bro023.A.dialogueact282	779.36	781.817	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	so is that uh that it 
Bro023.E.dialogueact283	782.155	782.835	E	Grad	s^na	-1	0	i guess that's it 
Bro023.A.dialogueact284	785.486	785.826	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bro023.A.dialogueact285	786.046	787.676	A	PhD	fh|qy^co^rt^tc	+1	1	uh do you want to go see now 
Bro023.B.dialogueact286	787.87	788.04	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	go see now 
Bro023.B.dialogueact287	790.063	790.963	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	um so 
Bro023.B.dialogueact288	792.153	793.793	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	the last two weeks was like so 
Bro023.B.dialogueact289	794.013	795.853	B	PhD	s	+1	2	i've been looking on that i mean everything 
Bro023.B.dialogueact290	796.633	797.113	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	and uh

Bro023.B.dialogueact293	806.294	810.194	B	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	and that doesn't actually give me any incremental or like make a big 
Bro023.B.dialogueact294	810.264	812.504	B	PhD	s	+1	1	make a big actually was on the baseline but it's not 
Bro023.B.dialogueact295	812.504	815.584	B	PhD	s	+1	1	baseline but it's not like it doesn't need something like fifty percent or something 
Bro023.B.dialogueact296	816.284	817.994	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	improves over the baseline so i've been playing with it 
Bro023.A.dialogueact297	817.32	819.32	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	+1	1	improves over the baseline m. i. c. c. system yeah with it yeah yeah yeah

Bro023.B.dialogueact314	836.76	838.52	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	okay i end up in our system that so 
Bro023.A.dialogueact315	838.382	838.772	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay that so 
Bro023.B.dialogueact316	838.86	840.63	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	okay that so i did it it does it does i mean it gets worse 
Bro023.C.dialogueact317	839.545	841.295	C	Professor	fg|qy^rt	-1	0	i did it no it does it does i mean it gets worse or

Bro023.B.dialogueact319	841.95	842.12	B	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	no it actually improves or or 
Bro023.B.dialogueact320	842.21	845.73	B	PhD	s^df^nd	-1	0	it actually improves or the base now not having i mean if you're going to know it's just 
Bro023.B.dialogueact321	846.14	848.73	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	like i have an idiot idiot but online on my decision 
Bro023.B.dialogueact323	849.188	850.758	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and i have like a new canoeing and that they 
Bro023.C.dialogueact322	849.071	849.491	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	and i have like a new canoeing 
Bro023.B.dialogueact324	851.018	852.748	B	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	didn't do though and not having a the 
Bro023.B.dialogueact325	853.516	854.406	B	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	so it didn't was but it it 
Bro023.B.dialogueact326	854.406	858.436	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	was but it it doesn't take it like be beyond like thirty percent or the basically 
Bro023.B.dialogueact327	859.258	859.618	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro023.C.dialogueact328	860.19	861.14	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but that's what i'm confused though because i think i thought 
Bro023.C.dialogueact329	861.14	865.21	C	Professor	s^bu^df	-1	0	though because i think i thought that our system was more like forty percent without those 
Bro023.B.dialogueact330	866.14	866.49	B	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	know it's 
Bro023.B.dialogueact331	866.69	867.57	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	know it's like uh

Bro023.B.dialogueact487	1176.12	1181.04	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	just like one but instead less than forty guard using the french because i don't system 
Bro023.D.dialogueact488	1177.01	1177.78	D	PhD	b	-1	0	one but instead

Bro023.C.dialogueact490	1182.57	1184.45	C	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	it's very similar but it's a pretty similar number

Bro023.C.dialogueact492	1185.49	1185.71	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.C.dialogueact493	1186.17	1188.62	C	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	but again you're you're more listing what they're doing right 
Bro023.C.dialogueact494	1188.62	1188.86	C	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	what they're doing right 
Bro023.B.dialogueact495	1189.42	1191.63	B	PhD	s^nd.%--	-1	0	it's it's different and events like 
Bro023.B.dialogueact496	1192.28	1194.07	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	actually cleaning up the cleanup spectrum but that are doing 
Bro023.B.dialogueact497	1194.07	1194.78	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	but that are doing 
Bro023.B.dialogueact498	1195.69	1200.0	B	PhD	s	-1	0	that what they're doing is they have the states stages of it i mean even if they do but 
Bro023.B.dialogueact500	1200.82	1207.66	B	PhD	s	-1	0	but the finance food or what they do is they they take it to their time demand by doing a little of time so 
Bro023.C.dialogueact499	1200.35	1200.62	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	but 
Bro023.B.dialogueact502	1208.5	1211.31	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and they're afraid go to tennessee measures and that's it and we 
Bro023.C.dialogueact501	1208.22	1208.55	C	Professor	b	-1	0	and they're afraid 
Bro023.B.dialogueact503	1211.95	1217.56	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	it and we just like finer for today's acting on they and book noises he said i that i don't end up 
Bro023.B.dialogueact504	1217.99	1220.94	B	PhD	s	-1	0	end up this is more like i'm doing you know there twice 
Bro023.B.dialogueact505	1221.5	1229.26	B	PhD	s	-1	0	but the funny thing is that the second time i'm actually somewhat thing if it does and then cleaning up and uh cleaned up spectrum plus uh and 
Bro023.B.dialogueact507	1230.0	1232.88	B	PhD	s	-1	0	that that that's that's what the difference is actually 
Bro023.C.dialogueact506	1229.56	1229.82	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	uh and 
Bro023.B.dialogueact508	1232.88	1243.99	B	PhD	s	-1	0	the difference is actually i'd i don't dawns the origin is being a go to the spectrum that like i economics i mean does it does but i keep you know the noisy speech but other than that us all those less days and 
Bro023.B.dialogueact509	1243.99	1248.66	B	PhD	s	-1	0	those less days and that doesn't seem to be a mm getting him and that machine but him and i i 
Bro023.B.dialogueact510	1248.75	1250.54	B	PhD	s	-1	0	but him and i i just been trying for the rookies 
Bro023.B.dialogueact511	1251.19	1251.59	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.B.dialogueact512	1252.68	1256.32	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and what what it died was by using the same thing but uh 
Bro023.B.dialogueact513	1256.32	1257.22	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	thing but uh would be actually phone 
Bro023.B.dialogueact514	1257.22	1261.64	B	PhD	s	-1	0	would be actually phone that the values is eighty like loser i mean 
Bro023.B.dialogueact515	1261.64	1265.37	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	loser i mean just by changing divide it just gives you the uh art of improvement bike instead of using 
Bro023.C.dialogueact516	1264.81	1265.08	C	Professor	b	-1	0	the uh art of improvement bike instead of using 
Bro023.B.dialogueact517	1265.37	1272.59	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	bike instead of using that they're not if you just take up the i don't from to town as you know when it's written challenges on channel one 
Bro023.B.dialogueact518	1273.08	1278.74	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because that does the that is the reason why i wasn't are getting a lot of improvement for estimating the noise so 
Bro023.B.dialogueact519	1278.74	1286.16	B	PhD	s	-1	0	the noise so i just use it down is know lack that you made the noise so that it gives me another lab of mine mock is for this not his division what's the channel 
Bro023.C.dialogueact520	1286.4	1287.83	C	Professor	qw	-1	0	um what's the channel zero um

Bro023.A.dialogueact604	1443.69	1445.95	A	PhD	qy^rt	+1	1	can i ask just uh high-level question 
Bro023.A.dialogueact605	1446.22	1451.26	A	PhD	qy^co	+1	1	can you just say like one or two sentences about winter filtering and why why are people doing that what's what's 
Bro023.B.dialogueact606	1450.51	1451.02	B	PhD	b	-1	0	why are people doing that what's what's 
Bro023.A.dialogueact607	1451.26	1453.27	A	PhD	qw	-1	0	that what's what's the deal with that 
Bro023.B.dialogueact608	1454.08	1454.32	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i so 
Bro023.B.dialogueact609	1454.32	1454.81	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	i so 
Bro023.B.dialogueact610	1455.39	1461.43	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	the you know for you it's it's like it's like you tried to minimize coming to the basic 
Bro023.B.dialogueact611	1461.43	1468.28	B	PhD	s	+1	1	coming to the basic principles benefit is like you tried to minimize the uh the difference between the noisy signal and a pizza a if you have which and 
Bro023.B.dialogueact612	1468.28	1469.39	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	a if you have which and it's like let's say you have 
Bro023.B.dialogueact613	1469.39	1474.87	B	PhD	s	-1	0	it's like let's say you have a team signal and you know and i decent and that you know what is that noise semen and 
Bro023.A.dialogueact615	1475.01	1475.26	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	then you try to minimize 
Bro023.B.dialogueact614	1474.87	1477.41	B	PhD	s	-1	0	noise semen and then you try to minimize the better be doing this too so 
Bro023.A.dialogueact616	1477.67	1477.92	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	this too so 
Bro023.B.dialogueact617	1478.01	1478.99	B	PhD	s	-1	0	that's a basic things when 
Bro023.B.dialogueact618	1478.99	1480.12	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	that's a basic things when you get you can't do that 
Bro023.B.dialogueact619	1480.12	1481.02	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	you can't do that i if if 
Bro023.B.dialogueact620	1481.31	1489.1	B	PhD	s	-1	0	i if if you have a twenty eight no you see now that it would be it that is too made the no i some though assuming that the first few frames that noise or if you have a 
Bro023.B.dialogueact621	1489.1	1492.8	B	PhD	s	-1	0	or if you have a life acted you didn't that you that you i pick spectrum 
Bro023.A.dialogueact622	1493.12	1493.48	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and then you 
Bro023.B.dialogueact623	1493.45	1493.97	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and then you 
Bro023.A.dialogueact624	1494.41	1496.15	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	too soon the noises the same in down to the 
Bro023.B.dialogueact625	1495.41	1495.74	B	PhD	b	-1	0	the same 
Bro023.B.dialogueact626	1496.26	1497.9	B	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	in down to the speech starts 
Bro023.A.dialogueact627	1498.05	1498.31	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so but 
Bro023.B.dialogueact628	1498.36	1498.64	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	so but 
Bro023.B.dialogueact629	1499.03	1501.24	B	PhD	s	-1	0	that's on the kids in the many many of look at it but it looks reasonably 
Bro023.B.dialogueact630	1501.24	1502.38	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	at it but it looks reasonably but and 
Bro023.A.dialogueact631	1502.86	1503.29	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	but and and then you 
Bro023.B.dialogueact632	1502.87	1507.63	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but and and then you what you do is you uh 
Bro023.B.dialogueact633	1507.63	1507.66	B	PhD	x	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.B.dialogueact634	1507.87	1508.25	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	i guess i can ride on someone 
Bro023.B.dialogueact635	1508.25	1509.76	B	PhD	s^t3.%--	-1	0	i guess i can ride on someone just oh okay 
Bro023.B.dialogueact636	1509.76	1510.18	B	PhD	s^bk^t3	-1	0	just oh okay 
Bro023.B.dialogueact637	1511.59	1511.83	B	PhD	s^bk^t3	-1	0	yeah 
Bro023.B.dialogueact638	1512.05	1513.11	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and then you do this this is the time so 
Bro023.B.dialogueact639	1513.25	1515.95	B	PhD	s	-1	0	this is the time so functional though i mean if there's a 
Bro023.B.dialogueact640	1516.16	1518.87	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so and seventies it's being speech spectrum boss him 
Bro023.A.dialogueact641	1519.13	1519.44	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and he's a noisy 
Bro023.B.dialogueact642	1519.48	1520.89	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and he's a noisy prospecting 
Bro023.B.dialogueact643	1521.79	1523.75	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and so this is the time function 
Bro023.C.dialogueact644	1523.72	1523.9	C	Professor	s^aa^t1	-1	0	function 
Bro023.B.dialogueact646	1524.98	1525.28	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro023.B.dialogueact649	1534.15	1538.52	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and then you might be polite your and all he bought spectrum but this is you've got an 
Bro023.B.dialogueact650	1538.52	1540.53	B	PhD	s	-1	0	this is you've got an estimate of the team prospect 
Bro023.A.dialogueact651	1541.12	1541.67	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i see okay 
Bro023.A.dialogueact652	1541.93	1542.34	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i see okay 
Bro023.B.dialogueact653	1543.67	1544.07	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	but the thing 
Bro023.B.dialogueact654	1544.53	1549.54	B	PhD	s	-1	0	but the thing is that you have pasty made uh s. f. that um the noisy specter what do you have so 
Bro023.B.dialogueact655	1549.88	1553.34	B	PhD	s	-1	0	do you have so you to made that and have around and you need you know explosions and then 
Bro023.B.dialogueact656	1553.83	1558.77	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and then you step back back from the continent i noisy spectrum to get an estimate of dance 
Bro023.B.dialogueact657	1559.37	1561.48	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so sometimes that becomes you know because you don't you 
Bro023.B.dialogueact658	1561.48	1563.73	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	you know because you don't you don't have a christian men the nice 
Bro023.B.dialogueact659	1564.17	1567.34	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so the food they would have like sometimes udalls goes and it because somebody's 
Bro023.A.dialogueact660	1566.94	1567.32	A	PhD	b	-1	0	udalls goes and it because somebody's 
Bro023.B.dialogueact661	1567.34	1570.32	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	it because somebody's going to that is a beat it sort of because of that and 
Bro023.B.dialogueact662	1570.9	1576.05	B	PhD	s	-1	0	that and that creates are um just going to do that across the spectrum because a bit different than 
Bro023.B.dialogueact663	1577.05	1577.44	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro023.B.dialogueact664	1578.52	1578.77	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bro023.B.dialogueact665	1579.38	1582.57	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so is so that's what that does justify state of and everything that type 
Bro023.A.dialogueact666	1582.82	1588.34	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	so is this uh um basically it's uh similar to just regular spectra subtracting that type 
Bro023.B.dialogueact667	1589.24	1589.54	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	it it's all pretty 
Bro023.C.dialogueact668	1589.3	1590.54	C	Professor	s^na	-1	0	it yeah it's all pretty related yeah 
Bro023.B.dialogueact670	1590.56	1591.24	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah related yeah it's it's 
Bro023.C.dialogueact669	1590.54	1590.93	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah related yeah 
Bro023.C.dialogueact671	1591.29	1597.19	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	it's it's is it that there's a whole class of techniques where you try in some sense to minimize the noise and 
Bro023.A.dialogueact672	1597.35	1597.7	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and 
Bro023.C.dialogueact673	1597.71	1602.69	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and it's typically i mean square sense uh uh in in in some way and 
Bro023.C.dialogueact674	1602.79	1609.68	C	Professor	s	-1	0	do people use some way and uh uh spectra subtraction is is uh one approach to it 
Bro023.A.dialogueact675	1609.44	1613.22	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	do people use the winner filtering in combination with the special subtraction typically yours are they to it 
Bro023.A.dialogueact676	1613.22	1615.57	A	PhD	qrr	-1	0	yours are they sort of competing pick me nazi dad 
Bro023.B.dialogueact677	1614.41	1615.04	B	PhD	s	-1	0	sort of competing pick me nazi dad 
Bro023.B.dialogueact678	1615.63	1618.2	B	PhD	s^na	-1	0	pick me yeah okay dad vase similar techniques it was like an event 
Bro023.A.dialogueact679	1618.06	1618.36	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay it was like an event 
Bro023.A.dialogueact681	1618.59	1619.21	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay it was like an event seen witty things 
Bro023.B.dialogueact680	1618.2	1622.04	B	PhD	s	-1	0	okay i see i see it was like an event seen witty things you know if it if it's because of i mean in the long

Bro023.C.dialogueact689	1626.49	1631.68	C	Professor	s	-1	0	some and spectrums attraction for instance there's a uh that summation factor you sometimes 
Bro023.A.dialogueact690	1626.99	1627.39	A	PhD	b	-1	0	some and spectrums 
Bro023.C.dialogueact691	1631.68	1634.33	C	Professor	s	-1	0	factor you sometimes will figure out what the noises and you know multiply 
Bro023.C.dialogueact692	1634.33	1639.47	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and you know multiply that no i spectrum times some constant and subtract that rabbits and

Bro023.C.dialogueact695	1642.15	1648.18	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you know this really should be in the part of maine sometimes people's work in the magnitude to maine because of it

Bro023.B.dialogueact699	1656.71	1665.03	B	PhD	h|s	-1	0	uh that is in order like we had this started off using spectra suppression you know for thing and there was one wanting thing to a jam trying is this subsidies approaches stepson stephanie's

Bro023.A.dialogueact718	1681.89	1682.48	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	uh okay that makes to cover up a bunch of different things 
Bro023.A.dialogueact719	1682.48	1682.82	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay that makes things 
Bro023.A.dialogueact721	1682.82	1683.4	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay that makes sense yeah things with this task 
Bro023.B.dialogueact720	1682.61	1683.16	B	PhD	b	-1	0	okay that makes sense yeah things with this task 
Bro023.A.dialogueact722	1684.05	1684.26	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and see you know what 
Bro023.A.dialogueact723	1686.23	1686.6	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	for each of them 
Bro023.A.dialogueact724	1687.02	1687.3	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro023.A.dialogueact726	1688.17	1688.32	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	cool thing 
Bro023.A.dialogueact727	1688.54	1688.86	A	PhD	s^ft	-1	0	cool thing 
Bro023.B.dialogueact728	1689.25	1689.7	B	PhD	fg	-1	0	so so 
Bro023.B.dialogueact730	1689.83	1696.62	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so so i don't want other thing that i'd i'd like i said well as to the more those was and the for the food of by doing something with being able to the 
Bro023.C.dialogueact729	1689.45	1689.66	C	Professor	b	-1	0	so so 
Bro023.A.dialogueact731	1696.91	1697.15	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	able to the like you if 
Bro023.B.dialogueact732	1697.35	1699.37	B	PhD	s	-1	0	like you if you made uh it just glad and then you live 
Bro023.B.dialogueact733	1699.37	1704.38	B	PhD	s	-1	0	uhhuh glad and then you live smoking across the frequency so that those who does going like right out 
Bro023.A.dialogueact734	1704.44	1704.91	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	uhhuh out 
Bro023.B.dialogueact735	1705.19	1708.89	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and that doesn't seems to be doing by buying it on the first time so 
Bro023.B.dialogueact736	1708.96	1711.69	B	PhD	s	-1	0	it on the first time so what i do is like i did is and then you 
Bro023.B.dialogueact737	1711.69	1716.77	B	PhD	s	-1	0	did is and then you i've been i've been the one more the same thing but but the smoke free the second time i'm 
Bro023.A.dialogueact739	1717.0	1717.29	A	PhD	b	-1	0	that seems to be 
Bro023.B.dialogueact738	1716.93	1718.47	B	PhD	s	-1	0	second time i'm that seems to be working 
Bro023.A.dialogueact740	1718.66	1718.9	A	PhD	b	-1	0	working 
Bro023.B.dialogueact741	1719.13	1723.82	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so that's what i guard like fifty six point five percent improvement on stage that of that 
Bro023.B.dialogueact742	1725.04	1725.43	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.B.dialogueact743	1726.74	1729.87	B	PhD	s	-1	0	without anywhere i as i used to that kind of things up and i just made but 
Bro023.B.dialogueact744	1729.87	1732.46	B	PhD	s	-1	0	up and i just made but i use this kind of you to lacquered all the things i'm 
Bro023.B.dialogueact745	1732.92	1734.42	B	PhD	s	-1	0	things i'm not stood on its meaning and that that's 
Bro023.B.dialogueact746	1734.42	1738.01	B	PhD	s	-1	0	meaning and that that's taken the bottom line it's like sixty seven checked out we colleges which 
Bro023.B.dialogueact747	1738.01	1745.77	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	colleges which it's like some of the shows that by using the proper lied again just take it but going to let and 
Bro023.B.dialogueact748	1746.02	1746.42	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.B.dialogueact749	1747.5	1747.85	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.A.dialogueact750	1748.17	1750.85	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	so that's sort of like you know best case performance yeah 
Bro023.B.dialogueact751	1750.87	1751.13	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	performance yeah so what i've seen 
Bro023.B.dialogueact752	1751.13	1753.04	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so what i've seen sixty seven i'm in ohio and seems 
Bro023.B.dialogueact753	1753.04	1753.43	B	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	i'm in ohio and seems 
Bro023.B.dialogueact754	1753.43	1755.09	B	PhD	s	-1	0	i'm in ohio and seems like sixty seven percent 
Bro023.B.dialogueact755	1755.9	1757.07	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh using the dodgers 
Bro023.B.dialogueact756	1757.22	1760.44	B	PhD	s	-1	0	using the dodgers olack it in ourselves it seems to be doing but i don't have the 
Bro023.B.dialogueact757	1760.44	1762.69	B	PhD	s	-1	0	be doing but i don't have the sense for all the cases that that 
Bro023.B.dialogueact758	1763.46	1766.79	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so i use was it a lot to see midnight as a lesser tall frame we 
Bro023.B.dialogueact759	1766.98	1769.65	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	tall frame we just like today that i use it sounds a lot and that seems 
Bro023.B.dialogueact760	1769.65	1773.73	B	PhD	s	-1	0	it sounds a lot and that seems to be the best competition i've been using a few names just to meet and then come 
Bro023.C.dialogueact761	1774.65	1776.38	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so i'm i'm still a little confused is that channel 
Bro023.C.dialogueact762	1776.38	1782.64	C	Professor	qy^bu	-1	0	no this is is that channel zero information going to be accessible 
Bro023.B.dialogueact763	1781.5	1782.27	B	PhD	h	-1	0	no this is 
Bro023.B.dialogueact764	1782.45	1782.75	B	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	no this is 
Bro023.B.dialogueact765	1782.75	1786.52	B	PhD	s^df^nd	-1	0	no this is just to pass that again the income by using a back a lot 
Bro023.C.dialogueact766	1784.45	1785.0	C	Professor	b	-1	0	again the income by using a back 
Bro023.B.dialogueact768	1787.31	1787.67	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	so i mean 
Bro023.C.dialogueact767	1786.94	1787.39	C	Professor	b	-1	0	a lot so i mean 
Bro023.B.dialogueact769	1787.94	1790.92	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so i mean so this is like the noise commendations he's fixed but 
Bro023.D.dialogueact770	1789.35	1790.22	D	PhD	b	-1	0	commendations he's fixed but 
Bro023.B.dialogueact771	1790.92	1794.21	B	PhD	s	-1	0	he's fixed but you make a better decision on the end points that's like 
Bro023.B.dialogueact772	1794.6	1795.83	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	that's like seems to be 
Bro023.C.dialogueact773	1794.8	1796.13	C	Professor	b	-1	0	that's like seems to be so 
Bro023.B.dialogueact774	1796.72	1797.52	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so we we've been which 
Bro023.B.dialogueact775	1797.52	1802.07	B	PhD	s	-1	0	we we've been which which means like by using this technique what seemed we just divided can just take the poems 
Bro023.C.dialogueact776	1799.57	1799.77	C	Professor	b	-1	0	by using this 
Bro023.B.dialogueact777	1802.07	1804.82	B	PhD	s	-1	0	can just take the poems about it ten percent of back 
Bro023.C.dialogueact778	1805.75	1805.95	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.B.dialogueact779	1806.35	1809.67	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so that that is just uh the reason for doing that experiment 
Bro023.B.dialogueact780	1810.32	1811.6	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	and um yeah but 
Bro023.B.dialogueact781	1811.75	1815.0	B	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	um yeah but this other thing that goes to type on the gate it's it's just like 
Bro023.B.dialogueact782	1815.39	1816.71	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	it's just like i'm designing and that 
Bro023.B.dialogueact783	1816.71	1819.95	B	PhD	s	-1	0	i'm designing and that seems to be knocking improving uh a lot on the gated sounds 
Bro023.B.dialogueact784	1819.95	1822.39	B	PhD	s	-1	0	lot on the gated sounds like it is she getting that whites on 
Bro023.B.dialogueact785	1823.07	1823.44	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.B.dialogueact786	1823.8	1824.16	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro023.B.dialogueact789	1829.79	1830.24	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	so uh 
Bro023.B.dialogueact790	1830.66	1831.06	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh without the other thing 
Bro023.B.dialogueact791	1831.21	1835.0	B	PhD	s	-1	0	without the other thing is like i mean i'm doing all this stuff on the politic them so 
Bro023.B.dialogueact792	1835.31	1835.68	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro023.B.dialogueact793	1837.02	1839.33	B	PhD	s	-1	0	had this stuff on the matters as well madeleine the 
Bro023.B.dialogueact794	1839.59	1842.23	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	well madeleine the magnitude and madder i get all the things about it seems to be the 
Bro023.B.dialogueact795	1842.23	1845.01	B	PhD	s	-1	0	about it seems to be the boss making seem to be getting the best is and so 
Bro023.B.dialogueact796	1845.51	1854.42	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so wop one of the reasons i thought like do the averaging for the food thing using the method of and that seems to me maybe having that event banging on the message about freaked that i'm puts so 
Bro023.C.dialogueact797	1852.19	1852.66	C	Professor	b	-1	0	banging on the message 
Bro023.C.dialogueact798	1853.24	1853.67	C	Professor	b	-1	0	about freaked that i'm 
Bro023.B.dialogueact800	1854.99	1856.05	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	puts so just yeah that's makes sense 
Bro023.C.dialogueact799	1854.93	1855.22	C	Professor	%	-1	0	puts so just makes sense 
Bro023.C.dialogueact801	1855.79	1856.32	C	Professor	s	-1	0	just yeah that's makes sense 
Bro023.B.dialogueact802	1856.49	1856.81	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah that's 
Bro023.B.dialogueact803	1856.81	1860.76	B	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah that's that's the only thing i could think of five white skiing improvement on the map 
Bro023.B.dialogueact804	1861.71	1862.88	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	and yeah 
Bro023.B.dialogueact805	1863.37	1864.43	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so that's it 
Bro023.C.dialogueact806	1865.44	1867.11	C	Professor	qw^rt	-1	0	say that i'm about the substation 
Bro023.B.dialogueact807	1867.4	1870.81	B	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	say that i'm i'm like that students it's usually in the back burner that 
Bro023.B.dialogueact808	1870.81	1876.03	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	in the back burner that i've been putting a lot of on this to make it look on doing things and all that stuff so it's like

Bro023.D.dialogueact823	1898.37	1902.68	D	PhD	s	+1	2	guess so i mean uh working still um the spectra subtraction 
Bro023.D.dialogueact824	1904.0	1904.55	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.D.dialogueact825	1905.42	1913.72	D	PhD	s	+1	1	what's or three my new bits of of what when they did before is just up by some construction but universe commission factor also to 
Bro023.D.dialogueact826	1913.72	1918.99	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	commission factor also to get and came it doesn't noise uh spectrum 
Bro023.D.dialogueact827	1919.74	1931.35	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and subtract these estimates shyness nice spectrum from the uh uh you know spectrum but subtracting more windows in our a nice uh we just

Bro023.D.dialogueact831	1937.93	1943.3	D	PhD	s	-1	0	oh okay i see then i expect from you must've and i spectrum by a car which depends um an hour a both twenty 
Bro023.A.dialogueact832	1940.49	1940.88	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay which 
Bro023.A.dialogueact834	1943.52	1943.82	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i see hour a both twenty

Bro023.D.dialogueact840	1955.13	1960.64	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which is bounded tool like two or three windows and be you know you would it be

Bro023.A.dialogueact842	1960.93	1961.25	A	PhD	b	-1	0	you would it be 
Bro023.D.dialogueact843	1962.2	1973.12	D	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	um uh um doing just dace uh either on the fifty bins or on the demand downs doesn't in any improvement

Bro023.C.dialogueact845	1973.65	1977.14	C	Professor	fg|qw	-1	0	um uh what are you doing with negative yeah so there is also a threshold 
Bro023.D.dialogueact846	1974.05	1974.18	D	PhD	%	-1	0	what are you doing with negative 
Bro023.D.dialogueact847	1976.4	1976.67	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah so there 
Bro023.D.dialogueact848	1976.73	1978.74	D	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah so there is also a threshold of calls goes 
Bro023.D.dialogueact849	1978.74	1982.9	D	PhD	s	-1	0	of calls goes after suppression you of have negative energies and

Bro023.D.dialogueact852	1984.92	1993.57	D	PhD	s	-1	0	to it i just do we to but uh to to add to put the threshold first and then to add a small amount of noise 
Bro023.D.dialogueact853	1994.66	1996.82	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which right know he's speak shaped

Bro023.A.dialogueact862	2011.57	2018.71	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	so when you when you talk about there being something less than zero after subtracting the noises added a particular frequency been carrots yeah 
Bro023.D.dialogueact863	2012.41	2012.52	D	PhD	%	-1	0	when you talk about there being 
Bro023.D.dialogueact864	2016.28	2016.59	D	PhD	b	-1	0	added a particular 
Bro023.D.dialogueact865	2018.91	2019.17	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	been okay yeah that can be frequency 
Bro023.A.dialogueact867	2019.44	2019.74	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay that can be frequency 
Bro023.D.dialogueact866	2019.35	2022.5	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	okay and so when you say you're adding some has overall that can be frequency bands with negative negativity 
Bro023.A.dialogueact868	2021.42	2027.27	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	and so when you say you're adding some has overall shape of speech is that in a in a particular frequency then where with negative negativity 
Bro023.A.dialogueact869	2028.04	2031.48	A	PhD	qrr^d	-1	0	you're adding something across all the frequencies when you get these negatives for each frequencies 
Bro023.D.dialogueact870	2030.96	2035.76	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	when you get these negatives for each frequencies i i'm adding some uh noise 
Bro023.D.dialogueact871	2036.7	2042.18	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	oh okay i got ya right but that that whole month of yeah month of noise i add it's not the same for all the frequency 
Bro023.A.dialogueact872	2041.04	2041.45	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay i the frequency 
Bro023.A.dialogueact873	2041.57	2041.97	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay i the frequency 
Bro023.A.dialogueact874	2041.97	2042.39	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay i got ya right the frequency 
Bro023.A.dialogueact875	2042.61	2042.83	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	got ya right 
Bro023.D.dialogueact876	2043.1	2046.44	D	PhD	s	-1	0	right no i don't think if it makes sense about something that speaks shape because then 
Bro023.D.dialogueact877	2046.44	2053.77	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	shape because then you of silence portion that and some spectra assuming though too girls expect but 
Bro023.A.dialogueact878	2049.52	2049.81	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.D.dialogueact879	2053.77	2053.96	D	PhD	%--	-1	0	expect but 
Bro023.D.dialogueact880	2054.92	2055.06	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	so this is something 
Bro023.D.dialogueact881	2055.58	2057.96	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so this is something i can see work working 
Bro023.A.dialogueact882	2058.09	2059.29	A	PhD	fg|qw	-1	0	so what does that mean i'm trying to understand what 
Bro023.D.dialogueact883	2058.56	2058.66	D	PhD	%--	-1	0	so what does that mean 
Bro023.D.dialogueact884	2058.66	2058.79	D	PhD	b	-1	0	so what does that mean 
Bro023.A.dialogueact885	2059.29	2063.38	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i'm trying to understand what it means when you do the specter subtraction and you get and negative it means that 
Bro023.A.dialogueact886	2063.38	2070.06	A	PhD	s^bu.%-	-1	0	it means that at that particular frequency range use attracted more energy than there was actually that means that yeah so so you you haven't 
Bro023.D.dialogueact887	2064.75	2065.53	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	at that particular frequency that means that 
Bro023.D.dialogueact888	2065.97	2066.16	D	PhD	b	-1	0	particular frequency range use attracted that 
Bro023.D.dialogueact889	2069.25	2069.45	D	PhD	b	-1	0	there was actually yeah so 
Bro023.D.dialogueact890	2069.77	2073.07	D	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	there was actually yeah so so you you haven't finished commission then i spectrum 
Bro023.D.dialogueact891	2073.65	2077.54	D	PhD	s	-1	0	sometimes of course just as the nicest up perfectly stationery sometimes 
Bro023.D.dialogueact892	2077.74	2080.75	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	sometimes it's just commission can be uh too small 
Bro023.D.dialogueact893	2081.74	2082.72	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so you don't septic enough but sometimes 
Bro023.D.dialogueact894	2082.72	2091.49	D	PhD	s	-1	0	uhhuh septic enough but sometimes it can be well if if uh noise the energy and the spectrum frequency pen cups for some reason 
Bro023.A.dialogueact895	2085.29	2085.96	A	PhD	b	-1	0	uhhuh if 
Bro023.A.dialogueact896	2091.7	2092.26	A	PhD	b	-1	0	reason 
Bro023.D.dialogueact897	2092.68	2093.58	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.A.dialogueact898	2094.57	2104.22	A	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	so in in an ideal word it world if the noise we're always the same then when you subtract that it the worst of the you would get would be a zero i mean the lowest it 
Bro023.A.dialogueact899	2104.33	2105.69	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean the lowest it gets easier because it 
Bro023.A.dialogueact901	2105.69	2110.04	A	PhD	s^bu^df	-1	0	gets easier because it there was no other energy there you're just attracting exactly the noise yep there's all there's 
Bro023.C.dialogueact900	2105.37	2105.5	C	Professor	b	-1	0	gets easier because it 
Bro023.D.dialogueact902	2109.19	2109.47	D	PhD	b	-1	0	exactly the noise 
Bro023.C.dialogueact904	2110.38	2113.19	C	Professor	s^bk|s	-1	0	yep there's all there's all sorts of uh deviation some ideal here i mean for instance 
Bro023.D.dialogueact903	2110.3	2110.53	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yep there's all there's 
Bro023.C.dialogueact905	2113.19	2120.44	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	here i mean for instance you're you're talking about the signal noise at a particular point even 
Bro023.C.dialogueact906	2120.9	2132.07	C	Professor	s	-1	0	point even if something is sort of stationary and stirred terms of statistics there's no guarantee that any particular instance she and a piece of it is exactly a particular number bounded that particular range so 
Bro023.D.dialogueact907	2127.95	2128.37	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and a piece of it is exactly 
Bro023.C.dialogueact908	2132.57	2139.05	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so you're figuring out from some chunk of of of the signal what you think the noise is then you should tracking 
Bro023.C.dialogueact909	2139.37	2141.47	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uhhuh then you should tracking that from another chunk 
Bro023.A.dialogueact910	2141.81	2142.32	A	PhD	b	-1	0	uhhuh chunk and 
Bro023.C.dialogueact911	2142.58	2147.39	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and there's absolutely no reason to think that you'd know that wouldn't uh be negative in some places uh 
Bro023.D.dialogueact912	2144.22	2144.81	D	PhD	b	-1	0	to think that you'd know that 
Bro023.D.dialogueact913	2146.04	2146.93	D	PhD	b	-1	0	be negative in some places 
Bro023.C.dialogueact914	2147.91	2150.98	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh on the other hand that just means that some since you've made a mistake because 
Bro023.C.dialogueact915	2150.98	2155.91	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	you've made a mistake because you certainly have subjected to bigger numbers and it's due to the noise 
Bro023.A.dialogueact916	2156.21	2156.66	A	PhD	b	-1	0	uhhuh um 
Bro023.C.dialogueact917	2156.79	2162.21	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uhhuh um also we speak the whole world is stuff comes from is from an assumption that same noise on correlated and 
Bro023.C.dialogueact918	2162.88	2172.8	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uhhuh and that certainly makes sense is and and uh statistical interpretation that you know over um all possible utilizations there and correlated or 
Bro023.A.dialogueact919	2167.47	2167.84	A	PhD	b	-1	0	uhhuh that you know 
Bro023.C.dialogueact920	2172.8	2179.29	C	Professor	s	-1	0	correlated or assuming uh here good this is that that uh um across time uh it's on correlated but 
Bro023.C.dialogueact921	2179.95	2192.22	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but if you just look at quarter second uh and you cross multiply the two things uh you could very well uh end up with something that sounds to something not zero so in fact 
Bro023.C.dialogueact922	2192.22	2197.99	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so in fact the two signals could have some relation to one another and 
Bro023.C.dialogueact923	2197.99	2201.68	C	Professor	s	-1	0	to one another and so is all sorts of deviation from ideal and this and 
Bro023.C.dialogueact924	2201.68	2204.82	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and this and and given all that you can definitely end up something negative 
Bro023.C.dialogueact925	2205.27	2214.84	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but it's down the road here making use of something is is is is a power spectrum then it can be bad to have something negative 
Bro023.C.dialogueact926	2215.32	2219.6	C	Professor	qw	-1	0	now the other thing i wonder about actually is what if you lasted negative 
Bro023.C.dialogueact927	2221.53	2222.2	C	Professor	qw	-1	0	what happens i mean because 
Bro023.B.dialogueact929	2222.85	2223.85	B	PhD	qy	-1	0	the the dog i mean because 
Bro023.C.dialogueact928	2222.44	2223.23	C	Professor	s^df.%-	-1	0	the the dog i mean because 
Bro023.C.dialogueact930	2224.28	2227.74	C	Professor	fh|qy^rt	-1	0	after that um are you taking the log before you add them up to the mail 
Bro023.B.dialogueact931	2226.06	2226.59	B	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	after that you add them up 
Bro023.B.dialogueact932	2228.61	2228.84	B	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	no one wonder 
Bro023.B.dialogueact933	2228.84	2229.21	B	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	no one wonder right 
Bro023.C.dialogueact934	2229.63	2229.86	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	right 
Bro023.C.dialogueact935	2230.41	2239.7	C	Professor	s	-1	0	where'd you live we do end so the thing is i wonder how if you put your threshold after that i wonder how often you would end up with is uh was negative 
Bro023.B.dialogueact936	2237.35	2238.43	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	where'd you live uh was negative 
Bro023.B.dialogueact937	2239.62	2243.14	B	PhD	s^bu|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	we do end up using tonight putting sequences bean soup and the average right 
Bro023.B.dialogueact938	2244.17	2246.27	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and you had the negative to the positive about image the to 
Bro023.B.dialogueact939	2246.27	2247.64	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	image the to estimate 
Bro023.C.dialogueact940	2248.74	2249.31	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.C.dialogueact941	2250.66	2254.13	C	Professor	s^ng|qy^d^g	-1	0	but nonetheless uh you know these are just another kind of smoothing right that you do 
Bro023.C.dialogueact942	2254.28	2254.78	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	that you do 
Bro023.B.dialogueact943	2255.29	2255.82	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.C.dialogueact944	2256.67	2256.79	C	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.C.dialogueact945	2257.05	2260.67	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so you've done your best shot at figuring out what the noise should be 
Bro023.C.dialogueact946	2261.4	2263.15	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and i then you distracted it off and 
Bro023.C.dialogueact947	2263.9	2272.87	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and then after that instead of instead of uh uh leaving it as is and adding things ending up some neighbors you are officially push it up 
Bro023.B.dialogueact948	2273.73	2274.34	B	PhD	b	-1	0	which is you know it's 
Bro023.C.dialogueact949	2273.9	2277.75	C	Professor	s	-1	0	which is you know it's there's no particular reason that that's the right thing to do either right 
Bro023.C.dialogueact950	2277.75	2278.18	C	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	thing to do either right 
Bro023.B.dialogueact951	2278.35	2278.84	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.C.dialogueact952	2279.18	2280.34	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bro023.C.dialogueact953	2281.24	2281.75	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.C.dialogueact954	2281.75	2295.6	C	Professor	s:s	-1	0	in fact what should be doing is saying well we're we're we're going to definitely diminished the of this frequency in this little frequency been in the in the overall mel summation is 
Bro023.C.dialogueact955	2295.97	2296.64	C	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	summation is to 
Bro023.C.dialogueact956	2296.85	2297.94	C	Professor	s^no.%-	-1	0	sort of the ops to 
Bro023.A.dialogueact958	2297.64	2303.6	A	PhD	s	-1	0	sort of the ops uh be if if you find out you're going to get a negative number you don't do the subtraction for that 
Bro023.B.dialogueact957	2297.49	2298.07	B	PhD	b	-1	0	sort of the ops uh be if 
Bro023.B.dialogueact959	2298.23	2298.54	B	PhD	b	-1	0	uh be if 
Bro023.B.dialogueact960	2305.76	2306.44	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	it is 
Bro023.C.dialogueact961	2306.81	2307.64	C	Professor	h|s^aa	-1	0	that would be almost is 
Bro023.D.dialogueact962	2307.1	2307.53	D	PhD	b	-1	0	that would be almost 
Bro023.C.dialogueact964	2307.64	2308.12	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	that would be almost the opposite right 
Bro023.A.dialogueact963	2307.64	2308.66	A	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	that would be almost the opposite right 
Bro023.A.dialogueact965	2308.66	2309.01	A	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	the opposite right 
Bro023.A.dialogueact966	2310.34	2311.86	A	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	so the living a negative you don't do it 
Bro023.A.dialogueact967	2313.49	2319.04	A	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	if you're if you're subtracting is going to result in a negative number you you don't do subtraction yeah 
Bro023.C.dialogueact968	2319.87	2320.19	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah that means that 
Bro023.C.dialogueact969	2320.19	2325.2	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah that means that in a situation where you thought that that the bin was almost entirely noisy left it 
Bro023.A.dialogueact970	2325.33	2325.61	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah it 
Bro023.A.dialogueact973	2326.79	2328.2	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	i'm just saying that's like the opposite yeah yeah and that's the fiance 
Bro023.B.dialogueact971	2326.57	2326.91	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	i'm just

Bro023.D.dialogueact1002	2394.81	2397.39	D	PhD	s	-1	0	you can say that do your specter suppression just or 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1003	2398.08	2408.2	D	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um and again if d. c. trace it um see no energy minus what you subtract divided by dissing no energy

Bro023.D.dialogueact1233	2863.97	2864.61	D	PhD	b	-1	0	another approach i mean it's it 
Bro023.C.dialogueact1235	2866.3	2873.3	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you action everyone always raises which has some truth to it is that um it's good for mapping from in particular noise to clean then you get a 
Bro023.C.dialogueact1236	2873.52	2874.73	C	Professor	s	-1	0	then you get a different nice 
Bro023.A.dialogueact1237	2874.96	2875.36	A	PhD	b	-1	0	different nice and experience 
Bro023.C.dialogueact1238	2875.51	2888.06	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and experience we saw uh that visitors did you hear showed that it there was at least some gentleness to the the aggravation when you switched to different noises it did seem to help 
Bro023.C.dialogueact1239	2888.06	2889.06	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it did seem to help so that you're right that's

Bro023.D.dialogueact1288	2984.67	2986.55	D	PhD	s	-1	0	um so this is the first think um 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1289	2986.59	2987.32	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	first think um 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1290	2988.61	2997.69	D	PhD	s^bk|s	+1	1	yeah another thing that they it's important to mention these um that this has this has some additional latency 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1291	2998.98	2999.87	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1292	3001.29	3009.8	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because when they do the smoking uh it's a regression that it's gimmes demeans them up because the game curve 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1293	3010.43	3010.94	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.D.dialogueact1294	3012.86	3014.66	D	PhD	s	-1	0	these kids are that and some agency 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1295	3015.2	3019.98	D	PhD	s^ba^cs	+1	1	and i know it just that it's better if we take into account he can see some 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1296	3019.98	3031.98	D	PhD	s^cs^df	-1	0	he can see some instead of if you think the current around mean do uh subtract the gun training it's better to use an estimate that some somewhere in the future

Bro023.A.dialogueact1298	3034.26	3035.59	A	PhD	qw^d^rt	-1	0	and that's what causes the latency 
Bro023.A.dialogueact1301	3036.24	3036.45	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i mean the 
Bro023.B.dialogueact1302	3036.5	3040.3	B	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	i mean the computer it up based on some things in the future also you 
Bro023.C.dialogueact1300	3036.19	3037.12	C	Professor	b	-1	0	i mean the computer 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1299	3035.85	3036.02	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	the latency i mean the 
Bro023.B.dialogueact1303	3040.3	3041.13	B	PhD	qrr	-1	0	you it's their aggression 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1304	3041.56	3042.44	D	PhD	s	-1	0	it's their aggression so it's 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1305	3042.54	3044.64	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so it's used to send a regression right 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1306	3044.64	3044.9	D	PhD	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	a regression right

Bro023.C.dialogueact1363	3125.7	3126.59	C	Professor	s	+1	1	i worry about little 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1364	3127.23	3127.93	D	PhD	b	-1	0	because 
Bro023.C.dialogueact1365	3127.86	3136.16	C	Professor	s^df	+1	2	because if we completely ignore latency and then we discover that we really have to do something about it we're going to be find ourselves in a bind so

Bro023.C.dialogueact1373	3144.91	3148.72	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	little concerted because we may end up with a scratch for all the sudden we have to cut the latency now or something

Bro023.A.dialogueact1384	3160.72	3162.43	A	PhD	s	-1	0	sorry quick question just about the latency thing if if there's another 
Bro023.A.dialogueact1385	3162.43	3168.6	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	thing if if there's another part of the system that causes the latency of a hundred millisecond is this an additive thing work or 
Bro023.A.dialogueact1386	3168.6	3170.26	A	PhD	qrr	-1	0	thing work or is yours hidden in that uh no it's 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1387	3169.03	3169.95	D	PhD	b	-1	0	is yours hidden in 
Bro023.A.dialogueact1389	3170.82	3171.12	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	that uh no it's it's it

Bro023.D.dialogueact1390	3170.95	3172.19	D	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	that uh it said no it's it's it 
Bro023.A.dialogueact1391	3172.41	3173.07	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	it said okay 
Bro023.A.dialogueact1393	3173.49	3173.89	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay

Bro023.B.dialogueact1394	3174.73	3175.18	B	PhD	%--	-1	0	begin i mean we 
Bro023.B.dialogueact1395	3175.41	3175.64	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i mean we 
Bro023.B.dialogueact1396	3175.64	3181.5	B	PhD	s	-1	0	uhhuh i mean we can't do something and i don't know in some like some cases like you want to do i sector did addiction 
Bro023.A.dialogueact1397	3181.87	3182.2	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	uhhuh addiction and 
Bro023.B.dialogueact1398	3182.73	3187.05	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and again because i didn't i love it some other thing you can do so you make a decision 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1399	3183.97	3184.51	D	PhD	b	-1	0	again because i didn't i love it 
Bro023.B.dialogueact1400	3187.05	3189.89	B	PhD	s	-1	0	so you make a decision on that well sector it is and then 
Bro023.B.dialogueact1401	3189.89	3191.82	B	PhD	s	-1	0	sector it is and then you be that really wanted i don't know but by 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1402	3189.97	3190.25	D	PhD	b	-1	0	sector it is and then you be that really wanted 
Bro023.B.dialogueact1403	3191.82	3194.87	B	PhD	s	-1	0	i don't know but by you already have of sufficient december sort of thing 
Bro023.A.dialogueact1404	3194.98	3195.53	A	PhD	b	-1	0	sort of thing 
Bro023.B.dialogueact1405	3196.12	3196.35	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.B.dialogueact1406	3197.15	3198.26	B	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean they sometimes it can 
Bro023.A.dialogueact1407	3198.72	3199.49	A	PhD	qy.%--	-1	0	i mean they couldn't yeah 
Bro023.A.dialogueact1408	3199.68	3199.72	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	couldn't yeah 
Bro023.A.dialogueact1409	3200.27	3200.47	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	i couldn't 
Bro023.A.dialogueact1410	3200.81	3208.25	A	PhD	qy	-1	0	i couldn't you just also i mean if you know that the the largest latency in the system is two in a millisecond so i could needed buffer up a number of frames and then everything 
Bro023.A.dialogueact1411	3208.25	3210.27	A	PhD	s^e^rt	-1	0	and then everything uses that buffer and that way

Bro023.A.dialogueact1413	3210.47	3212.54	A	PhD	s^e^rt	-1	0	and that way it's not additive 
Bro023.C.dialogueact1414	3213.14	3215.76	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	well it's like everything is sent over and offers because of 
Bro023.C.dialogueact1415	3215.76	3219.61	C	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	i mean because of the t. c. p. 
Bro023.B.dialogueact1416	3219.56	3222.14	B	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	i mean they're they're that uh the super frame or something 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1417	3220.11	3220.72	D	PhD	b	-1	0	they're they're that uh 
Bro023.C.dialogueact1418	3221.4	3221.58	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	the super frame or something

Bro023.B.dialogueact1421	3223.63	3225.33	B	PhD	s^bk|s^ng	-1	0	yeah but that has immediately latency because the last 
Bro023.B.dialogueact1422	3225.33	3227.35	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because the last name doesn't have any tinge in what's his name

Bro023.A.dialogueact1441	3250.98	3260.99	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	that one in particular but more of you know if if there is some part of your system that has the buffer twenty frames uh can be other parts of the system draw out of that buffer and therefore not add to the latency

Bro023.D.dialogueact1457	3296.96	3308.25	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and uh that sort of noise and after uh i know that adding noise out um that's just and just using specter suppression we don't smoke thing but i don't know 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1458	3308.31	3316.97	D	PhD	s^no	-1	0	thing but i don't know right now if it's too you bought on on not and if the that's that i choose before easton the right one um same 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1459	3316.97	3319.75	D	PhD	s	-1	0	right one um same thing for the shape of uh the nice 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1460	3320.65	3324.76	D	PhD	s^am	-1	0	that maybe it would be better to adjust white noise instead of speech shape now 
Bro023.C.dialogueact1461	3324.94	3327.31	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that was more like the i thing in a sense now

Bro023.D.dialogueact1467	3335.34	3343.64	D	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah for they say just you is as nice estimates made i mean uh spectrum of the first twenty frames of each determines 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1468	3344.14	3347.63	D	PhD	s^no	-1	0	i used to and just end frames it up remember for these experiments but do you supposed to take 
Bro023.B.dialogueact1469	3346.59	3348.09	B	PhD	s	-1	0	i used to and just end frames yeah because do you supposed to take but then frame

Bro023.D.dialogueact1512	3474.56	3476.21	D	PhD	s^e^rt	-1	0	so you have one minimum frame which is sixty four basic um 
Bro023.A.dialogueact1513	3476.36	3478.27	A	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	so you have one minimum for each frequency

Bro023.C.dialogueact1546	3593.84	3594.24	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	i mean on um

Bro023.D.dialogueact1551	3600.51	3610.56	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so the rest of this is that as with this technique you can estimates some reasonable nice spectra we've only five hundred me comes say no 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1552	3611.17	3616.76	D	PhD	s	-1	0	is that none the noise diaries a lot uh you can track better tracking nice 
Bro023.C.dialogueact1553	3617.09	3617.63	C	Professor	b	-1	0	which is not 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1554	3617.54	3621.21	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which is not the case you rely on is like sixty detector so even 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1555	3621.71	3626.07	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so even if they're on not no speech poses you can track denies that though 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1556	3627.25	3633.67	D	PhD	s	-1	0	the only requirement is that you must have and decided hundred music comes segment you must have voice sounds east 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1557	3634.47	3638.98	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because these these wouldn't have you too correct and nice haven't 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1558	3641.06	3641.73	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1559	3642.89	3651.46	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so what it is just to simply replace the few days but uh no just made like this estimate 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1560	3652.94	3654.26	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	so some speed that car but 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1561	3654.87	3656.37	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	but only on speeds up garcetti and 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1562	3656.98	3660.95	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and it's uh psyche walls like 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1563	3660.95	3666.31	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	psyche walls like one percent if compared to the few days estimates 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1564	3668.23	3668.84	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1565	3670.68	3676.24	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	i think the reason why it's not better is that that speech the economy sorrow stationery 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1566	3676.73	3677.16	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1567	3677.57	3678.11	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1568	3679.68	3682.19	D	PhD	s	-1	0	you you there is no need to have something that you can 
Bro023.C.dialogueact1569	3681.84	3682.53	C	Professor	b	-1	0	something that you can 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1570	3682.19	3683.96	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	you can let

Bro023.D.dialogueact1631	3797.96	3804.9	D	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah i am mostly implemented is spectra anemic idea 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1632	3805.24	3808.34	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	which is and um erickson proposal 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1633	3810.32	3828.02	D	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah the idea is just too um that um the dog like drum and to fascinate more is key the primary just assignments you i hear 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1634	3830.11	3834.05	D	PhD	s	-1	0	during this way you kind of also reduce much reduced to musical he's and 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1635	3834.64	3839.75	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and you breed your departed every teacher trump nice shapes 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1636	3840.17	3846.07	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because the spectrum becomes more fat into sinus portions 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1637	3847.11	3847.86	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1638	3850.13	3850.3	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro023.D.dialogueact1639	3851.93	3853.15	D	PhD	s	-1	0	we this no improvements uh but 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1640	3853.28	3856.13	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	uh but there are lots of farm each that the company with and 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1641	3856.28	3856.77	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	and 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1642	3858.56	3859.09	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	um could just 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1643	3859.69	3863.01	D	PhD	s	-1	0	could just this could be seen as soft version of the frame dropping because 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1644	3863.01	3873.54	D	PhD	s^df^rt	-1	0	because um you could just put the threshold and say that you know the threshold i wish that income puppy he's got into the spectrum 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1645	3874.22	3878.45	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and i both specials uh keep the same spectrum it 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1646	3878.79	3881.04	D	PhD	s	-1	0	it would be like from dropping because 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1647	3881.04	3890.72	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because during science portions which r. b. nutritional tough like sixty t. probably take uh you would have some kind of dummy frame which is 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1648	3890.72	3892.6	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	dummy frame which is perfect you've got spectrum 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1649	3893.49	3907.86	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and this uh whitening you something that's more soft it goes you white and you just uh a function the whitening is a function of this beach probably fifty so 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1650	3907.86	3909.8	D	PhD	s	-1	0	beach probably fifty so it's not our decision

Bro023.D.dialogueact1653	3912.73	3921.38	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so i think maybe ten be used together we spend dropping them well and we we're not sure about it's speech assignments but 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1654	3921.38	3923.61	D	PhD	s^am	-1	0	it's interesting i mean but maybe it's something to do with it 
Bro023.C.dialogueact1655	3922.7	3923.46	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	it's interesting i mean maybe it's something to do with it 
Bro023.C.dialogueact1656	3923.46	3934.81	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean um you know in n. j. roster we we're essentially adding and uh wait uh white noise depending on our estimate of the noise to do with it 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1657	3934.68	3934.92	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	the noise

Bro023.C.dialogueact1659	3937.28	3942.51	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh i think it never occurred to use probability 
Bro023.D.dialogueact1660	3942.85	3943.45	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	you can imagine 
Bro023.C.dialogueact1661	3943.59	3954.45	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you can imagine one that that that made use of where where the amount that you read it in this uh function of the probability of it speech are nice
