Bro026.A.dialogueact152	319.32	327.968	A	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	so we've been working like six weeks and the nice compensation we end up with something that seems reasonable 
Bro026.A.dialogueact153	329.23	330.01	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	are you going to use

Bro026.A.dialogueact155	334.12	338.96	A	PhD	s	+1	1	so finding eats it's um we finished running on the fifty bands 
Bro026.A.dialogueact156	339.643	344.543	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	he's huge he's uh two step smoking transfer function first that 
Bro026.A.dialogueact157	344.543	348.477	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	first that that's a long time 
Bro026.A.dialogueact158	349.783	358.6	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	after the steps there therese a sort of smoking and frequency choose the sagging newest twenty fifty games

Bro026.A.dialogueact160	362.34	363.44	A	PhD	h	-1	0	so this is on the uh 
Bro026.E.dialogueact161	362.82	368.409	E	PhD	qy^bu^d	-1	0	so this is on the uh before any email scaling has been done this is 
Bro026.A.dialogueact162	368.04	368.19	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	been done this is

Bro026.A.dialogueact166	369.252	369.772	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	this this moving 
Bro026.B.dialogueact165	369.236	378.336	B	Professor	qr^bu^d	-1	0	this this moving is done on the estimates um of what you're going to subtract or on b. sing that has already had things attracted 
Bro026.A.dialogueact167	369.772	369.982	A	PhD	b	-1	0	this this moving 
Bro026.A.dialogueact168	379.55	382.832	A	PhD	h|s	-1	0	uh it's on the transfer function so 
Bro026.A.dialogueact169	382.952	383.212	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	the transfer function so what's on the transfer 
Bro026.B.dialogueact170	383.6	385.39	B	Professor	s^bu^m	-1	0	what's on the transfer functions for the winter something 
Bro026.A.dialogueact171	385.479	385.619	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	something 
Bro026.B.dialogueact172	385.75	386.19	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	something 
Bro026.A.dialogueact173	390.37	396.3	A	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	yeah so basically we tried different configuration within these idea 
Bro026.A.dialogueact174	398.84	405.44	A	PhD	s	-1	0	tried you tang do some metal fans i think because of traction instead of thing if they're trying 
Bro026.A.dialogueact175	406.06	406.61	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.A.dialogueact176	408.22	414.41	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	but sunday we end up with this configuration that uh quite well 
Bro026.A.dialogueact177	415.81	421.08	A	PhD	s^cc	+1	1	so we think to fix this for the moment work the other aspects of the world system so 
Bro026.E.dialogueact178	418.034	418.474	E	PhD	b	-1	0	work the other 
Bro026.A.dialogueact179	421.08	421.24	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro026.B.dialogueact180	422.99	426.45	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	actually i mean it davis and here talk about it but let me just interject this 
Bro026.B.dialogueact181	426.81	433.9	B	Professor	s	-1	0	this module the principal and i mean you would know whether if it's true in fact is somewhat independent for the rest of the me 
Bro026.B.dialogueact182	433.9	435.82	B	Professor	s	-1	0	for the rest of the me because you reset this i speech right 
Bro026.B.dialogueact183	435.82	436.09	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	this i speech right so 
Bro026.A.dialogueact184	436.409	436.879	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	so 
Bro026.B.dialogueact185	436.877	438.672	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro026.B.dialogueact186	440.29	442.94	B	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	we we do not uh well you know i guess you don't recent speech you could 
Bro026.A.dialogueact187	442.41	443.47	A	PhD	s^aa.%-	-1	0	we we do not so speech you could uh but 
Bro026.B.dialogueact188	443.63	444.53	B	Professor	h|s^cs^r	-1	0	so uh but you could 
Bro026.A.dialogueact189	445.32	448.03	A	PhD	s^arp	-1	0	what what we do but we've been done for synthesizing into programming television 
Bro026.A.dialogueact190	448.03	451.48	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	into programming television because guys and then re i once again just 
Bro026.A.dialogueact191	451.57	453.93	A	PhD	s	-1	0	again just used to fifty things 
Bro026.B.dialogueact192	454.14	456.97	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	it's just an option of but you have a recent the size thing that you that's as an option 
Bro026.A.dialogueact193	455.27	457.04	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	it's just an option of thing that you that's as an option yeah i guess 
Bro026.A.dialogueact194	457.19	457.28	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah i guess 
Bro026.B.dialogueact195	457.688	472.547	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	yeah i guess i guess my point is that um it in some of the work using reverberations one of the things we're finding is that uh it's it's further for an artificial situation we can just deal with reparation and his techniques work really well but 
Bro026.B.dialogueact196	472.917	479.302	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well but for the real situation uh problem is is that you don't just have reverberations reverberations noise annoys if you don't include that 
Bro026.B.dialogueact197	479.302	481.552	B	Professor	s	-1	0	annoys if you don't include that in the model it doesn't work very well 
Bro026.B.dialogueact198	482.062	496.35	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so in fact it might be very nice thing to do to just take the noise removal part of it and put that in front of what he's looking and uh we generate new files or whatever uh and then the reverberations part 
Bro026.A.dialogueact199	488.904	489.314	A	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	looking and uh 
Bro026.B.dialogueact200	497.92	498.46	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	so it's 
Bro026.D.dialogueact201	500.343	500.553	D	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact202	500.956	501.246	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so dave 
Bro026.E.dialogueact203	501.76	503.09	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	no so dave hasn't tried that yet 
Bro026.B.dialogueact204	503.744	505.384	B	Professor	s^ar|%-	-1	0	no no he's i mean 
Bro026.E.dialogueact205	506.45	507.5	E	PhD	s^2.%-	-1	0	pretty i guess he's busy with 
Bro026.B.dialogueact206	508.012	509.192	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it prevents right yeah so pretty now yeah yeah 
Bro026.C.dialogueact207	508.018	508.928	C	Grad	s	-1	0	it prevents right pretty now yeah 
Bro026.B.dialogueact209	509.192	509.382	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah so yeah 
Bro026.E.dialogueact208	508.874	509.344	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	it prevents right yeah so pretty now yeah yeah 
Bro026.B.dialogueact210	509.382	509.612	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah so yeah 
Bro026.E.dialogueact211	509.514	509.794	E	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah so yeah 
Bro026.B.dialogueact212	511.274	512.794	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	um but but yeah that will 
Bro026.B.dialogueact213	513.124	520.824	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that we it's clear that we we are not with the real case that we're looking at we can't justa okay reverberations isolation because 
Bro026.B.dialogueact214	520.824	524.094	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	isolation because the interaction between that noise is is considerable and that's 
Bro026.B.dialogueact215	524.637	537.939	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and that's me in the past we've looked at uh and this is hard enough the interaction between channel facts and and uh and additives noise so convoluted and all facts and and additive affects 
Bro026.B.dialogueact216	538.584	539.504	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and that's hard enough i mean i don't think 
Bro026.B.dialogueact217	539.504	540.644	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	enough i mean i don't think we really mean we're trying 
Bro026.B.dialogueact218	540.644	541.854	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we really mean we're trying to deal with that 
Bro026.B.dialogueact219	542.044	544.644	B	Professor	s	-1	0	in a sense that's what we're trying to deal with in this or our task 
Bro026.B.dialogueact220	545.051	552.411	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and we have uh be uh uh l. d. a. stuff that in principle is doing something about conversational effects and 
Bro026.B.dialogueact221	552.951	556.82	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and we have to only suppression doing something about noise 
Bro026.B.dialogueact222	557.456	558.826	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh even as hard enough and and 
Bro026.B.dialogueact223	558.826	561.966	B	Professor	s	-1	0	as hard enough and and the on normalization as well that's category 
Bro026.B.dialogueact224	563.214	569.264	B	Professor	s	-1	0	there's all these interactions between these two and that's part of what these guys have to work so hard and and juggling everything around now anything on 
Bro026.B.dialogueact225	569.394	571.594	B	Professor	s	-1	0	now anything on the reverberations it's even worse because 
Bro026.B.dialogueact226	571.594	575.674	B	Professor	s	-1	0	worse because not only do you have these effects but you also have some long time 
Bro026.B.dialogueact227	576.75	583.934	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and um so david something which uh is doing some nice things under something editions with with longtime effects but 
Bro026.B.dialogueact228	583.934	587.254	B	Professor	s	-1	0	longtime effects but when it's when it's nice there too it's it's it's pretty hard so we have to start 
Bro026.B.dialogueact229	587.254	588.004	B	Professor	s^co.%--	-1	0	so we have to start 
Bro026.B.dialogueact230	589.091	597.241	B	Professor	s	-1	0	just any almost any real situation is going to have uh where you have the microphone distant is going to have both we we actually 
Bro026.B.dialogueact231	597.711	599.871	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	we we actually have to think about both at the same time

Bro026.B.dialogueact233	607.56	607.84	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro026.B.dialogueact234	608.22	611.824	B	Professor	fh|s^t	-1	0	um so there's just always suppression thing which is sort of worked out and then 
Bro026.B.dialogueact235	611.824	617.15	B	Professor	s^co^t	-1	0	sort of worked out and then uh maybe just continued time what what else is in 
Bro026.A.dialogueact236	616.28	628.0	A	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	the other parts of the system the books that's where over the prison before

Bro026.B.dialogueact272	738.183	741.803	B	Professor	s	-1	0	of uh there's there's some need ideas for in a. d.'s so 
Bro026.B.dialogueact273	741.943	742.793	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	d.'s so i mean it 
Bro026.B.dialogueact274	743.466	747.567	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i think they're sort of like there's a bunch of tuning things to improve stuff is questions 
Bro026.B.dialogueact275	747.567	755.627	B	Professor	s	-1	0	is questions about praise places where there's next on in this thread exponentially or ways that were estimating noise so we can prove resting noise and there's going to 
Bro026.B.dialogueact276	755.627	756.897	B	Professor	s	-1	0	noise and there's going to be host of those structurally 
Bro026.B.dialogueact277	756.897	783.99	B	Professor	s	+1	2	be host of those structurally it seemed like the things the main things that that we were brought up that uh because they're going to need to get work done seriously are uh a uh um uh significantly better v. a. d. putting their all that on um which you know we have been doing anything with either they're all at the end there and um thee opening up the second front 
Bro026.B.dialogueact278	785.846	786.226	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	the other

Bro026.B.dialogueact281	788.551	795.611	B	Professor	s^aa|s	+1	1	yeah yeah i mean because we we have we have uh uh half the of be uh data rate so i mean 
Bro026.E.dialogueact280	788.21	788.55	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	yeah yeah so i mean 
Bro026.B.dialogueact282	796.67	809.202	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	and uh so the initial thing which came from a the meeting that we had down south well initially just put an email spectrum a second it's 
Bro026.B.dialogueact283	809.957	811.927	B	Professor	s	+1	1	it's you know

Bro026.B.dialogueact285	814.593	816.303	B	Professor	s	+1	1	the question but exactly how we do it we probably will 
Bro026.B.dialogueact286	816.363	818.353	B	Professor	s	+1	1	it we probably will go to something better later but 
Bro026.B.dialogueact288	819.001	823.0	B	Professor	s	-1	0	initial thing is that cancer inspector behave differently so

Bro026.B.dialogueact294	840.864	841.194	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so if you took the system 
Bro026.E.dialogueact295	841.07	847.57	E	PhD	qw	+1	1	so if you took the system the way it is now the way it's for your going to freeze it and ran it on the last evaluation where would it be 
Bro026.A.dialogueact296	844.415	844.985	A	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	it and 
Bro026.A.dialogueact297	849.114	849.644	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	in terms of ranking 
Bro026.E.dialogueact298	849.19	850.17	E	PhD	s^e	+1	1	yeah second in terms of ranking 
Bro026.A.dialogueact300	850.77	851.84	A	PhD	s	+1	1	yeah right like second second

Bro026.B.dialogueact312	864.887	866.783	B	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	what it i mean but 
Bro026.B.dialogueact313	867.751	874.251	B	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	when you're saying second year comparing to the numbers that they uh that the best system before god um uh we also without german and danish

Bro026.B.dialogueact315	875.66	876.4	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	and the 
Bro026.D.dialogueact316	876.7	880.2	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and the the findings actually didn't change after the general and that ish so 
Bro026.D.dialogueact317	880.948	881.608	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	well ranking so yeah 
Bro026.B.dialogueact318	881.5	890.87	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	well ranking didn't it before but i'm just asking where this is too where there's was without the german and danish right yeah 
Bro026.A.dialogueact319	886.091	886.151	A	PhD	b	-1	0	where this is too 
Bro026.D.dialogueact320	887.812	888.162	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	where there's was 
Bro026.A.dialogueact322	889.818	890.158	A	PhD	b	-1	0	without the german and danish right 
Bro026.D.dialogueact321	889.43	889.67	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	without the 
Bro026.B.dialogueact324	890.87	891.2	B	Professor	qy^d^f^rt	-1	0	german and danish right so where where 
Bro026.D.dialogueact323	890.589	891.179	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	german and danish right so where where 
Bro026.B.dialogueact325	891.38	891.86	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so where where 
Bro026.E.dialogueact326	891.54	894.18	E	PhD	qw	-1	0	so how're also where where where where we actually on the last test 
Bro026.B.dialogueact327	894.29	900.57	B	Professor	s	-1	0	how're also this essentially second although there were there were i mean we had a couple systems and they had a couple systems and so 
Bro026.B.dialogueact328	900.57	902.69	B	Professor	s	-1	0	systems and so like guess by that we are third but i mean 
Bro026.B.dialogueact329	902.69	907.149	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	we are third but i mean there were two systems that were pretty close they came from the same place okay 
Bro026.E.dialogueact330	903.815	904.155	E	PhD	b	-1	0	there were two systems that were pretty close 
Bro026.E.dialogueact331	905.64	906.0	E	PhD	s^bk^rt	-1	0	they came from the same place 
Bro026.E.dialogueact332	907.376	907.716	E	PhD	s^bk^rt	-1	0	okay 
Bro026.B.dialogueact333	908.28	913.14	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um so institutionally we were we were second it there's their system we're so the second that you're saying now 
Bro026.E.dialogueact334	912.24	915.49	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	their system uh no we're so the second that you're saying now is system wide 
Bro026.B.dialogueact335	914.55	914.72	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	is system wide 
Bro026.B.dialogueact336	915.28	917.65	B	Professor	h|s^nd	-1	0	uh no i think it's also a socialist not right still institutionally 
Bro026.B.dialogueact338	917.65	918.0	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	a socialist not right i mean i think both of still institutionally second 
Bro026.E.dialogueact337	917.34	918.78	E	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	a socialist not right i mean i think both of still institutionally second 
Bro026.B.dialogueact339	918.0	918.25	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	i mean i think both of second 
Bro026.B.dialogueact340	918.25	920.07	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	uh we are between there too i mean i think both of their systems probably second 
Bro026.A.dialogueact341	919.68	921.46	A	PhD	fg|s^nd	-1	0	uh we are between there too is just so their systems probably 
Bro026.A.dialogueact343	921.61	921.9	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	is just so 
Bro026.B.dialogueact342	921.41	921.77	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	is just so 
Bro026.A.dialogueact344	922.517	924.088	A	PhD	s	-1	0	dad data for system is 
Bro026.D.dialogueact345	922.92	923.1	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	dad 
Bro026.B.dialogueact347	923.82	924.23	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	dad data for system is 
Bro026.D.dialogueact346	923.8	926.35	D	PhD	s	-1	0	dad data for system is fifty four point something and i'll be uh 
Bro026.D.dialogueact348	926.35	928.14	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but everything is and i'll be uh fifty people in something and that second just 
Bro026.A.dialogueact350	928.28	932.267	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but everything is within the range of one one person yeah so basically and that second just to me though if fifty point something yeah one pleasant oh wow that's very 
Bro026.D.dialogueact349	928.21	930.55	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but everything is within the range of one and that second just to me though if fifty point something yeah 
Bro026.D.dialogueact351	930.83	931.79	D	PhD	s^aa^m	-1	0	of one one person something yeah one pleasant oh 
Bro026.B.dialogueact353	932.13	934.33	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah so basically they're all they're all pretty close wow that's very close yeah 
Bro026.E.dialogueact352	931.932	932.392	E	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	one person yeah so basically one pleasant oh wow that's very 
Bro026.A.dialogueact355	933.005	933.235	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	they're all they're all pretty close close yeah 
Bro026.E.dialogueact354	932.712	933.692	E	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah so basically they're all they're all pretty close wow that's very close yeah 
Bro026.D.dialogueact356	933.61	933.83	D	PhD	b	-1	0	they're all they're all pretty close close yeah 
Bro026.E.dialogueact357	933.752	933.982	E	PhD	b	-1	0	they're all they're all pretty close close yeah 
Bro026.B.dialogueact358	934.33	938.87	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	and and um you know in some sense relative fairly similar things 
Bro026.B.dialogueact359	939.498	943.038	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh yeah i mean could argue about the l. d. a. and so forth but i i think 
Bro026.B.dialogueact360	943.038	946.33	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but i i think you know a lot of ways remember similar things but what what so how 
Bro026.B.dialogueact361	946.33	946.93	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	but what what so how 
Bro026.E.dialogueact362	946.83	949.81	E	PhD	qw	+1	1	but what what so how did they fill up this all these these debts i mean 
Bro026.E.dialogueact363	949.81	950.64	E	PhD	s^e.%--	-1	0	debts i mean affordable 
Bro026.B.dialogueact364	952.359	953.579	B	Professor	fg|qy^bu^rt	+1	1	um why we're using yeah yeah 
Bro026.B.dialogueact366	954.316	955.456	B	Professor	fg|%-	-1	0	well so you could you or how are they using more than half 
Bro026.E.dialogueact365	953.92	954.14	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	using yeah well so you could yeah or how 
Bro026.E.dialogueact367	954.73	956.96	E	PhD	s.%-:qw.%-	-1	0	well so you could you or how are they using more than half i guess maybe uh 
Bro026.B.dialogueact368	957.11	971.148	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah so i i think i think guys closer to it to me so correctly from wrong but i i think that what's going on is that in both cases some kind of normalization has done to deal with cobblers compilation along fax they have some kind 
Bro026.B.dialogueact369	971.504	973.794	B	Professor	s	-1	0	they have some kind of stroll not a vacation right 
Bro026.A.dialogueact371	974.16	974.51	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	in our case 
Bro026.B.dialogueact370	973.794	974.074	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	not a vacation right in our case 
Bro026.B.dialogueact372	974.66	976.36	B	Professor	s	-1	0	in our case we have a couple things the online normalization 
Bro026.B.dialogueact373	976.36	978.96	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	things the online normalization then we have the all the rest 
Bro026.B.dialogueact374	979.913	985.673	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and they seem to copley complement each other enough and be different enough that they both seem to help help us 
Bro026.B.dialogueact375	986.22	988.34	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but any that they're both doing the same sort of thing but this one difference 
Bro026.B.dialogueact376	988.34	989.3	B	Professor	s	-1	0	of thing but this one difference you know the 
Bro026.B.dialogueact377	989.77	994.99	B	Professor	s	+1	1	you know the rest uh uh throws away uh high my tuition frequency 
Bro026.B.dialogueact378	996.227	997.347	B	Professor	s	+1	1	and they're not there 
Bro026.E.dialogueact379	998.303	999.333	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	so that if you so so 
Bro026.B.dialogueact380	999.065	1002.65	B	Professor	s	+1	1	so that if you throw away how much relation frequencies and you can downtown 
Bro026.C.dialogueact381	1001.53	1001.94	C	Grad	s^2.%	-1	0	frequencies and you can 
Bro026.E.dialogueact382	1003.62	1004.18	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.E.dialogueact383	1004.47	1004.84	E	PhD	s^bk^r	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact384	1006.2	1006.87	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so so what 
Bro026.E.dialogueact385	1006.73	1009.3	E	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	so so what if you didn't see do you explicitly down temple then do we explicitly 
Bro026.E.dialogueact386	1009.55	1010.85	E	PhD	qy^bsc^rt	-1	0	then do we explicitly down some 
Bro026.B.dialogueact387	1010.57	1010.75	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	down some 
Bro026.A.dialogueact388	1011.26	1011.47	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and what if 
Bro026.E.dialogueact389	1011.63	1012.73	E	PhD	qw	-1	0	and what if we didn't do that 
Bro026.E.dialogueact390	1013.92	1015.05	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	i we get worse performance 
Bro026.A.dialogueact392	1016.36	1019.29	A	PhD	h|s	-1	0	and that term well think it doesn't affect it i see okay 
Bro026.B.dialogueact391	1016.01	1017.25	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	and think it doesn't affect it 
Bro026.B.dialogueact393	1017.25	1017.59	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	and it 
Bro026.E.dialogueact394	1018.59	1018.93	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	that term well i see okay 
Bro026.E.dialogueact395	1019.02	1019.33	E	PhD	s^bk^rt	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact396	1019.54	1019.78	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact397	1020.45	1025.72	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so i think the thing is since we're not evidently throwing away useful information disturbance unusual yeah yeah 
Bro026.E.dialogueact398	1025.56	1025.88	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah yeah 
Bro026.E.dialogueact399	1025.99	1026.27	E	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	and uh yeah yeah 
Bro026.B.dialogueact400	1026.54	1034.47	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	and uh so i you know we we've found a lot of ways for quite a while it having a second stream helps a lot so that's 
Bro026.B.dialogueact401	1034.47	1040.63	B	Professor	s	+1	1	a lot so that's that's put in and yeah i may even end up with mel spectrum even though i'm saying i think we can do much better just because it's simple 
Bro026.E.dialogueact402	1040.86	1041.22	E	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	it's simple 
Bro026.B.dialogueact403	1042.07	1042.6	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact404	1044.23	1049.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and you know in the long run having something everybody look at and say oh yeah i understand is is very helpful 
Bro026.E.dialogueact405	1050.16	1057.15	E	PhD	qr^bu	-1	0	well that's a question so you would you're you're thinking to put b. uh mel spectrum in before any of the noise removal stuff or after 
Bro026.B.dialogueact406	1057.08	1058.01	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that's a question i mean we are talking about 
Bro026.B.dialogueact407	1058.05	1059.28	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean we are talking about that it looks like 
Bro026.B.dialogueact408	1059.28	1064.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that it looks like it'd be straightforward to to uh remove the noise 
Bro026.B.dialogueact409	1065.4	1067.89	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	because 
Bro026.E.dialogueact410	1067.98	1070.01	E	PhD	s	-1	0	because that happens before the mail conversion right 
Bro026.E.dialogueact411	1070.01	1070.27	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact412	1070.66	1070.9	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact413	1071.83	1077.88	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	so i mean to do it after the mill conversion uh after that i zero four ounces no conversion 
Bro026.B.dialogueact414	1078.51	1082.05	B	Professor	s	-1	0	is even a question in my mind anyhow whether you stick to log in 
Bro026.B.dialogueact415	1083.86	1084.4	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact416	1085.79	1086.74	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i sort of think it should 
Bro026.B.dialogueact417	1087.02	1091.12	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.A.dialogueact418	1093.3	1095.05	A	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	what about you know 
Bro026.B.dialogueact419	1097.22	1097.54	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact420	1099.01	1099.58	B	Professor	h	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact421	1104.69	1107.6	B	Professor	h|qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	well but normalized inspector instead of cancer 
Bro026.A.dialogueact422	1108.31	1108.52	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact423	1109.34	1110.19	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah probably some kind 
Bro026.B.dialogueact424	1110.73	1111.91	B	Professor	s	-1	0	some kind would be good 
Bro026.B.dialogueact425	1112.02	1112.42	B	Professor	qh^rt	-1	0	you know i would think 
Bro026.B.dialogueact426	1112.42	1113.02	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you know i would think but it 
Bro026.D.dialogueact427	1113.6	1121.27	D	PhD	s	-1	0	if but it it it some of it actually makes it depending on though at all in it you know for the um the frame 
Bro026.B.dialogueact428	1121.79	1123.39	B	Professor	qr^bu^d	-1	0	if you do or don't don't 
Bro026.D.dialogueact429	1124.2	1127.3	D	PhD	s	-1	0	right if he if he going on nice and if if you do and not nice 
Bro026.B.dialogueact430	1127.83	1128.14	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right yes i mean one would 
Bro026.B.dialogueact431	1128.23	1131.02	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yes i mean one would think that you would want to normalize but i i 
Bro026.B.dialogueact432	1131.49	1132.92	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	but i i 
Bro026.B.dialogueact433	1133.35	1138.27	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	my thought is uh pick we've take the log 
Bro026.B.dialogueact434	1139.68	1149.4	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then it's if if they if if if normalization it helps then if you have something to compare it against us say no 
Bro026.B.dialogueact435	1149.4	1150.65	B	Professor	s	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.D.dialogueact436	1149.7	1150.68	D	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact437	1150.65	1154.28	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that's simple in some way and 
Bro026.B.dialogueact438	1154.94	1162.92	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	and then say a ticket because we found a pastor's all these these these different helps you get with a slight modifications of can normalization normalization 
Bro026.B.dialogueact439	1162.92	1166.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	normalization normalization is very tricky sensitive thing and you learn a lot so 
Bro026.B.dialogueact440	1166.29	1173.95	B	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	so i would think you'd want to have some baseline says okay we don't know lives as we get we do this normalization to that 
Bro026.B.dialogueact441	1175.02	1176.49	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but the other question is so i think ultimately 
Bro026.B.dialogueact442	1176.49	1178.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	is so i think ultimately wanted one thinks normalization i agree 
Bro026.B.dialogueact443	1178.62	1179.05	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i agree so the second 
Bro026.E.dialogueact444	1179.4	1183.9	E	PhD	qy^rt	+1	1	so the second the stream will it add latency to the system or 
Bro026.B.dialogueact446	1184.12	1185.18	B	Professor	s^nd	+1	1	no it's in parallel or not 
Bro026.E.dialogueact445	1183.9	1184.49	E	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	no it's in parallel the system or 
Bro026.C.dialogueact447	1184.64	1185.08	C	Grad	%	-1	0	no it's in parallel or not 
Bro026.B.dialogueact449	1185.86	1187.52	B	Professor	s	+1	1	or not i'm a competition time here the copper i think 
Bro026.E.dialogueact448	1185.67	1186.38	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	or not i'm a competition 
Bro026.B.dialogueact450	1187.52	1188.76	B	Professor	s	-1	0	time here the copper i think we're pretty far so it's 
Bro026.E.dialogueact451	1188.01	1188.24	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	we're pretty far so it's 
Bro026.B.dialogueact452	1188.76	1191.75	B	Professor	s	+1	1	we're pretty far so it's just in terms of what data is depending on its depending 
Bro026.B.dialogueact453	1191.74	1193.42	B	Professor	s	+1	1	is depending on its depending on the same date as the other so it's a parallel same day okay 
Bro026.E.dialogueact454	1192.89	1193.31	E	PhD	s^m	-1	0	on the same date as the other so it's a parallel same day okay 
Bro026.B.dialogueact456	1193.42	1194.34	B	Professor	s	-1	0	the other so it's a parallel day okay 
Bro026.E.dialogueact455	1193.31	1193.64	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	the other so it's a parallel day okay

Bro026.C.dialogueact458	1198.39	1203.92	C	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	so with this uh new stream would you train up uh v. a. d. on both both features 
Bro026.D.dialogueact459	1206.79	1209.27	D	PhD	s^ar|s^df	-1	0	okay so i just to be eighty has its own set of features 
Bro026.C.dialogueact460	1209.43	1209.8	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bro026.C.dialogueact462	1210.68	1211.1	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	oh which could be this one off the streams 
Bro026.D.dialogueact461	1210.31	1215.18	D	PhD	s	-1	0	oh which could be this one off the streams on it can be something that that from strange

Bro026.A.dialogueact479	1246.11	1246.32	A	PhD	b	-1	0	i mean that's 
Bro026.D.dialogueact478	1245.89	1248.59	D	PhD	s^aa|s^e	-1	0	would have to fit i mean that's just said did you know that's just 
Bro026.B.dialogueact480	1250.45	1251.87	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well this the delays in the storage 
Bro026.C.dialogueact481	1250.51	1250.91	C	Grad	b	-1	0	well this the delays

Bro026.B.dialogueact486	1254.96	1257.6	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that i think the the biggest thing we rent a storage is on that

Bro026.B.dialogueact491	1262.55	1267.91	B	Professor	fh|s:qy	-1	0	i guess the issue there is are we are using all that they straps 
Bro026.B.dialogueact492	1268.37	1269.77	B	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	and and how big are they

Bro026.B.dialogueact508	1292.12	1292.43	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right i mean the thing 
Bro026.B.dialogueact509	1292.43	1303.52	B	Professor	s	-1	0	right i mean the thing is if you do in correlation you just doing simple it was some weights which you happen to learn from these are from the data and so 
Bro026.C.dialogueact510	1302.96	1303.25	C	Grad	b	-1	0	from these are from the data and so

Bro026.B.dialogueact512	1304.91	1308.77	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh putting on money already on it is not that big a deal 
Bro026.B.dialogueact514	1309.35	1310.72	B	Professor	s	-1	0	certainly does take my space

Bro026.B.dialogueact516	1311.84	1314.93	B	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	the question is how complex functions you need you

Bro026.D.dialogueact608	1552.56	1560.06	D	PhD	fg|s.%--	+1	2	is so do said this this this uh but they're doing which people it makes such is to know whether it is actually bias towards any set of features on 
Bro026.B.dialogueact609	1561.39	1573.93	B	Professor	s	+1	2	yes so i did the certainly the thing that i would know about is whether we get really hurt uh on censorship tell the language well scaling sorts of things yeah using our features 
Bro026.E.dialogueact610	1572.88	1573.91	E	PhD	s^2	+1	2	scaling sorts of things yeah using our features

Bro026.E.dialogueact615	1581.77	1582.29	E	PhD	b	-1	0	the case or 
Bro026.B.dialogueact616	1586.32	1586.8	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and 
Bro026.E.dialogueact617	1586.96	1595.93	E	PhD	s.%-	+1	2	yes in this case and we may be able to revisit this idea about somehow modifying our features too work with 
Bro026.B.dialogueact618	1594.93	1595.94	B	Professor	fg|s.%-	-1	0	yes in this case work with 
Bro026.B.dialogueact619	1596.11	1596.7	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	that's right 
Bro026.E.dialogueact620	1596.87	1597.26	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	that's right

Bro026.B.dialogueact622	1599.56	1605.59	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	um some of that maybe uh a last minute rush thing because the see her features are changing

Bro026.B.dialogueact625	1607.77	1609.75	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but uh 
Bro026.B.dialogueact626	1612.02	1620.83	B	Professor	s	-1	0	the other thing is that even though it's months away it's starting to seem to me now like november fifteenth is right around the corner 
Bro026.B.dialogueact627	1621.52	1640.19	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and um if they haven't decided things like this what the parameters are going to be for this uh when deciding not to somebody deciding effect there should be some understanding behind the deciding between some experiments in and so forth it it it seems pretty tight to me so what what's the 
Bro026.E.dialogueact628	1640.35	1642.69	E	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	that's when the so what what's the significance of november fifteenth 
Bro026.B.dialogueact629	1642.7	1643.82	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that's when the valuation is fifteenth

Bro026.B.dialogueact632	1646.45	1647.04	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	so yeah so i have to but 
Bro026.B.dialogueact633	1647.6	1650.12	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i have to but you know they may even deciding and push it off 
Bro026.B.dialogueact634	1651.7	1653.72	B	Professor	s	-1	0	entirely surprised me but 
Bro026.B.dialogueact635	1653.72	1662.34	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	surprised me but do other reasons like some people going away i'm hoping it's not pushed off along while i would be 
Bro026.B.dialogueact636	1662.34	1664.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	while i would be uh but it's an awkward position but

Bro026.B.dialogueact641	1673.67	1674.92	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah i think that be helpful there's 
Bro026.B.dialogueact642	1674.92	1680.18	B	Professor	s	-1	0	be helpful there's there's not anybody oh i currently who's who's uh working with us 
Bro026.B.dialogueact643	1680.18	1680.65	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.E.dialogueact644	1681.23	1685.24	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	is is this part of the evaluation just a small part or how how important 
Bro026.E.dialogueact645	1685.24	1687.72	E	PhD	qrr	-1	0	i or how how important is this to the over all 
Bro026.B.dialogueact646	1687.89	1691.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i i think it's it's um it depends how badly they do i mean i the over all 
Bro026.B.dialogueact647	1691.44	1694.5	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	do i mean i think that it is this is one of the things that will be 
Bro026.D.dialogueact648	1693.99	1694.21	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	this is one of the things that will be 
Bro026.E.dialogueact649	1694.13	1695.95	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^j^rt	-1	0	this is one of the things that will be debated afterwards 
Bro026.B.dialogueact650	1696.16	1696.55	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah but i 
Bro026.B.dialogueact651	1696.55	1706.83	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah but i mean it's it's conceptual leave my impression again you guys correct me if i'm wrong but my impression is that um they want it is a double check 
Bro026.B.dialogueact652	1707.54	1716.85	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	that you haven't come across you haven't invented teachers which are actually going to do badly for uh a significantly different tasks talk to recap 
Bro026.B.dialogueact654	1717.85	1721.46	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and um but it's not the main emphasis i mean the truth is 
Bro026.E.dialogueact653	1717.43	1717.83	E	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact655	1721.46	1725.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean the truth is most of the applications they're looking at a pretty small cabin 
Bro026.E.dialogueact656	1725.41	1725.97	E	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact657	1726.06	1727.35	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so it's it's a double check so they'll probably 
Bro026.B.dialogueact658	1727.35	1729.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	check so they'll probably assign it some sort of low weight 
Bro026.E.dialogueact659	1730.41	1733.55	E	PhD	s	-1	0	seems to me that if it's a double checked they should give you a one or zero 
Bro026.E.dialogueact660	1734.24	1736.49	E	PhD	s^e	-1	0	you you passed the threshold you didn't pass the threshold and they shouldn't even 
Bro026.E.dialogueact661	1736.49	1739.41	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but i mean the threshold and they shouldn't even care about what the score is 
Bro026.B.dialogueact662	1737.78	1738.12	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	care about what the score 
Bro026.B.dialogueact663	1739.46	1741.86	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but i mean what what we'll see what they come up with uh is 
Bro026.B.dialogueact665	1741.91	1755.7	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	what they come up with uh but in in the current thing for instance where you have this well matched moderately matched and and miss i miss man uh the emphasis is somewhat on the on the well matched but it's only uh a marginal right it's 
Bro026.E.dialogueact664	1741.8	1742.11	E	PhD	b	-1	0	what they come up with uh but in 
Bro026.B.dialogueact666	1755.7	1755.92	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	marginal right it's 
Bro026.B.dialogueact667	1755.92	1759.35	B	Professor	s	-1	0	marginal right it's like forty thirty five twenty five or something like that so he still 
Bro026.B.dialogueact669	1759.45	1765.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that so he still if you were way way off um i mean having mismatched it would have a big effect 
Bro026.D.dialogueact668	1759.36	1759.51	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	that so he still 
Bro026.E.dialogueact670	1765.44	1766.08	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and um 
Bro026.B.dialogueact671	1766.14	1770.98	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and um it wouldn't surprise me if they did something like that with us so 
Bro026.B.dialogueact672	1770.98	1783.08	B	Professor	s	-1	0	like that with us so again if you're if you get if it doesn't help you much uh for noisy versions of this uh large vocabulary data then yeah you know i mean i actually that much but if it if you don't 
Bro026.E.dialogueact673	1772.57	1772.97	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	if you get 
Bro026.B.dialogueact674	1783.08	1794.13	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	but if it if you don't if it doesn't help me much at all or put another way if it helps some people a lot more than it helps other people or strategies too so is this uh 
Bro026.E.dialogueact675	1791.95	1792.44	E	PhD	b	-1	0	people or strategies 
Bro026.E.dialogueact676	1793.9	1795.52	E	PhD	fg|qy.%-	-1	0	too so is this uh 
Bro026.E.dialogueact677	1796.04	1800.27	E	PhD	s	-1	0	that's it good or was putting a bunch of wall street journal data on our desks so that's the data 
Bro026.B.dialogueact678	1799.28	1799.67	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	that's it on our desks 
Bro026.E.dialogueact679	1800.52	1802.26	E	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	so that's the data that will be running on

Bro026.C.dialogueact840	2200.88	2206.17	C	Grad	s^na	+1	2	well i've been reading some literature about clustering of they uh just um 
Bro026.C.dialogueact841	2206.38	2210.11	C	Grad	s	-1	0	just um yes let me put it in context okay so 
Bro026.C.dialogueact842	2210.42	2218.12	C	Grad	fh|s	+1	2	okay so we're talking about discovering intermediate categories to um to classify and 
Bro026.C.dialogueact843	2218.59	2224.34	C	Grad	fh|s	+1	2	and uh i was looking at some of the work that uh seventy two is doing on these traps thing so she 
Bro026.C.dialogueact844	2224.34	2234.07	C	Grad	s	+1	2	thing so she has um just temple patterns for um a certain set of phony from from commit that the most common 
Bro026.C.dialogueact845	2234.5	2234.65	C	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	that the most common 
Bro026.C.dialogueact846	2234.65	2235.88	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	that the most common so names and 
Bro026.C.dialogueact847	2235.88	2242.9	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so names and each one of them has has a nice pattern over time one one second window 
Bro026.C.dialogueact848	2243.27	2244.97	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and has has these patterns 
Bro026.C.dialogueact849	2245.22	2256.18	C	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um so she has a trap for each one of the phone means um times fifteen for each of the fifteen critical pants and 
Bro026.C.dialogueact850	2256.79	2277.42	C	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and um she does this a climber tip hierarchy call clustering which which basically um is a clustering outgrow them that um starts with many many many different points many different clusters uh corresponding to the number of data is a pattern so you have the data and 
Bro026.C.dialogueact851	2277.82	2284.79	C	Grad	s	-1	0	the data and then you have this distance magic metric which um measures how how closely related they are 
Bro026.C.dialogueact852	2285.11	2292.7	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and you start um by merging the patterns that are most closely related 
Bro026.E.dialogueact853	2293.3	2294.22	E	PhD	s^2	-1	0	and yeah yeah you create a tree 
Bro026.C.dialogueact854	2294.4	2294.49	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	and yeah yeah 
Bro026.C.dialogueact855	2294.58	2295.09	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	and yeah yeah it than japan 
Bro026.C.dialogueact856	2295.18	2296.67	C	Grad	s^m	-1	0	it than japan tree 
Bro026.E.dialogueact857	2296.19	2296.35	E	PhD	b	-1	0	tree 
Bro026.C.dialogueact858	2297.11	2297.5	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	um then you can pick 
Bro026.E.dialogueact859	2297.22	2303.7	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	um right then you can pick uh values anywhere along that treat to fix your of clusters 
Bro026.C.dialogueact860	2303.89	2312.25	C	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	right usually it's when um when the someone similarity measures um don't go down as much and clusters 
Bro026.E.dialogueact861	2312.27	2312.52	E	PhD	b.%	-1	0	and 
Bro026.C.dialogueact862	2312.89	2315.98	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and so um so you stop at that point 
Bro026.C.dialogueact863	2316.18	2333.24	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and what she found was she um is that there are five broad um brought categories um corresponding to uh things like uh for too is and uh folk how like um and uh stops 
Bro026.B.dialogueact864	2323.41	2323.82	B	Professor	b	-1	0	um 
Bro026.C.dialogueact865	2333.97	2338.38	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and one for silence and and another one first shaw shaw sounds 
Bro026.C.dialogueact866	2338.83	2344.65	C	Grad	fh|s	+1	2	and um i was thinking about ways to to generalize this because 
Bro026.C.dialogueact867	2344.65	2350.81	C	Grad	s^df^rt	+1	2	this because one year it it's sort of like gay it's not a completely automatic way of clustering 
Bro026.C.dialogueact868	2351.16	2359.64	C	Grad	s^df^e	-1	0	because you before hand you have these these traps in saying that that these frames correspond to this particular phony 
Bro026.C.dialogueact869	2360.24	2366.8	C	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um and that's that's constrain your your clustering to to the set a phony that your you have 
Bro026.C.dialogueact870	2367.3	2380.47	C	Grad	fh|s^cs	-1	0	um whereas maybe we want to just take take a look at um arbitrary windows in time um of varying lengths um and cluster thus and 
Bro026.E.dialogueact871	2374.83	2375.4	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	time um 
Bro026.C.dialogueact873	2380.8	2396.85	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and i'm thinking if we we do that then we would probably um at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we've clustered things like okay this is a transitioned um this is a relatively stable sable point 
Bro026.E.dialogueact872	2380.52	2381.12	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and i'm thinking if 
Bro026.C.dialogueact874	2397.17	2410.96	C	Grad	fh|s^cs	-1	0	um you know i'm hoping to find other things uh of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate um intermediate categories uh um uh later classes 
Bro026.E.dialogueact876	2411.32	2411.8	E	PhD	b.%	-1	0	are you looking at this 
Bro026.B.dialogueact875	2411.32	2413.01	B	Professor	qy	+1	1	are you looking at this and there are bands um 
Bro026.C.dialogueact877	2413.78	2415.49	C	Grad	h|s^bk	-1	0	um right um 
Bro026.C.dialogueact878	2415.88	2416.92	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	that's what um i'm 
Bro026.B.dialogueact879	2416.74	2418.06	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that's what you're going to be using i'm yeah yeah 
Bro026.B.dialogueact880	2418.06	2418.22	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	yeah yeah 
Bro026.C.dialogueact881	2418.26	2418.82	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah yeah 
Bro026.C.dialogueact882	2419.0	2419.23	C	Grad	s^aa^r	-1	0	i i've been 
Bro026.C.dialogueact883	2419.23	2424.32	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i i've been exactly figured out um the exact details for that but 
Bro026.C.dialogueact884	2424.32	2436.6	C	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	that but it's uh the representation of the data that i was thinking of was using um critical band um energies um over 
Bro026.C.dialogueact885	2437.02	2437.36	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.C.dialogueact886	2439.19	2439.53	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	yeah i mean 
Bro026.B.dialogueact887	2439.87	2443.47	B	Professor	s	+1	1	yeah i mean it seems somehow that needs to there's a couple things that i wonder about this i mean someone 
Bro026.B.dialogueact889	2443.47	2448.81	B	Professor	s	-1	0	this i mean someone is is again looking at the same representation if 
Bro026.C.dialogueact888	2443.29	2443.57	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	this i mean someone 
Bro026.B.dialogueact890	2448.81	2462.47	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	representation if you're going for this sort of thing where you have uh little detectors that are looking in arab bands then what you're going to be looking for should be some category that you can find with an arab 
Bro026.C.dialogueact891	2462.7	2463.31	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	that that 
Bro026.B.dialogueact892	2463.76	2465.82	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that that seems to be kind of fundamental to it 
Bro026.B.dialogueact894	2466.61	2475.77	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um and then the other thing uh is that i wonder about with it and and and don't take this the wrong way like i i know what i'm doing or anything but 
Bro026.C.dialogueact893	2466.4	2466.62	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	um and 
Bro026.B.dialogueact895	2475.89	2479.09	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	or anything but i mean it's um just wondering really 
Bro026.C.dialogueact896	2479.41	2479.87	C	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact897	2480.2	2506.92	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you're trying to find the right system in some sense what he trying to categories or or parameters um and your goal is to scare me nation then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to um on supervised near ness of things um is actually better 
Bro026.C.dialogueact898	2503.61	2505.38	C	Grad	b	-1	0	near ness of things um is 
Bro026.B.dialogueact899	2507.73	2516.34	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	and i don't know if that means that you're dealing with issues for is you know maybe maybe this isn't right but to be something i'd be concerned about because for 
Bro026.B.dialogueact900	2516.46	2532.61	B	Professor	qy^d^df^f^rt	+1	1	because for instance you can imagine if a remember from from uh from your calls style how uh saying that uh but uh differed uh not really because i voicing because aspiration 
Bro026.B.dialogueact902	2533.52	2535.93	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and as far as what's really there and the acoustics 
Bro026.C.dialogueact901	2533.05	2533.81	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	and as 
Bro026.B.dialogueact903	2536.51	2544.12	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	so um if you look if you're doing some course clustering you probably would put those two sounds together 
Bro026.B.dialogueact904	2545.07	2556.06	B	Professor	s	+1	1	i would yeah i would guess that many of your recognition errors were coming from stirring up on this distinction 
Bro026.C.dialogueact905	2556.85	2557.27	C	Grad	b	-1	0	so 
Bro026.B.dialogueact906	2557.41	2561.73	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	so in fact it's so hard because recognize just to first order sort of work 
Bro026.B.dialogueact907	2562.3	2565.71	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and the reason we're doing the things we're doing is because they don't work as well as with like 
Bro026.B.dialogueact908	2566.24	2571.12	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and since they sort of work uh it means that they are already doing if you go and 
Bro026.B.dialogueact909	2571.12	2580.81	B	Professor	s:qw	+1	1	if you go and take any recognize or that's already out there and you say how well was it distinguishing between she lives and stops 
Bro026.C.dialogueact910	2581.17	2581.8	C	Grad	b	-1	0	boy 
Bro026.B.dialogueact911	2581.99	2584.94	B	Professor	s	+1	1	boy i bet they're all doing nearly perfectly honest 
Bro026.B.dialogueact913	2585.22	2585.5	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right so 
Bro026.C.dialogueact912	2584.84	2585.33	C	Grad	b	-1	0	honest right so 
Bro026.B.dialogueact914	2585.93	2592.11	B	Professor	s	-1	0	right so these these big categories that different huge obvious ways we already know how to do 
Bro026.B.dialogueact915	2593.12	2594.73	B	Professor	qh	-1	0	so what are we bring to the party i mean in 
Bro026.B.dialogueact916	2594.73	2608.09	B	Professor	s	-1	0	to the party i mean in fact we want to do is have something that particularly in the presence of noise uh is better at distinguishing between uh categories that are extra close to one another and hence would probably be clustered together 
Bro026.C.dialogueact917	2609.22	2609.91	C	Grad	b	-1	0	that's 
Bro026.B.dialogueact918	2609.76	2611.08	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that's that's a hard thing i mean i understand this 
Bro026.B.dialogueact919	2611.08	2620.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean i understand this is other constraint that you're considering is that you want to have categories that it it that would be straightforward for say human being to mark if you had manual a notation 
Bro026.B.dialogueact920	2621.61	2623.48	B	Professor	s	-1	0	in something that you really think you can pick up but 
Bro026.B.dialogueact921	2623.48	2639.07	B	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	up but i think it's also essential that you want to look at are the confusion that you were making and how can you come up with uh category's that can clarify these confusion 
Bro026.C.dialogueact922	2629.63	2630.14	C	Grad	b	-1	0	that you were making 
Bro026.C.dialogueact923	2642.0	2642.94	C	Grad	b	-1	0	so 
Bro026.B.dialogueact924	2642.79	2649.13	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so i mean the standards are way doing that is take a look at p. r. rhythms are looking at but then throw in some discriminate of aspect to it and 
Bro026.B.dialogueact925	2649.74	2650.1	B	Professor	%	-1	0	it and this is more like 
Bro026.B.dialogueact926	2649.78	2652.99	B	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	it and this is more like you know how to sell the a. differ from d. c. 
Bro026.B.dialogueact927	2653.82	2654.86	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean the same sort of thing they both 
Bro026.B.dialogueact929	2654.86	2656.06	B	Professor	s	-1	0	the same sort of thing they both start analyzing but 
Bro026.C.dialogueact928	2654.41	2654.76	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	the same sort of thing they both 
Bro026.B.dialogueact930	2656.06	2656.92	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	but 
Bro026.B.dialogueact931	2657.63	2665.9	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and and um this is a little harder because you're not just trying to find parameters you're actually trying to find uh the the the categories themselves 
Bro026.B.dialogueact932	2666.73	2669.47	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	more like brain surgery i think 
Bro026.B.dialogueact933	2670.73	2671.17	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	on yourself 
Bro026.B.dialogueact934	2674.63	2674.97	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bro026.B.dialogueact936	2675.83	2676.74	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh so 
Bro026.C.dialogueact935	2675.42	2675.71	C	Grad	b	-1	0	uh 
Bro026.B.dialogueact937	2677.92	2678.01	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact938	2678.37	2681.25	B	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.C.dialogueact939	2681.63	2682.0	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact940	2685.35	2687.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you've been thinking about this problem for a long time actually i mean well yeah 
Bro026.B.dialogueact941	2687.62	2691.73	B	Professor	s	-1	0	time actually i mean well actually stop thinking about it for a long time but used to think what he's yeah 
Bro026.E.dialogueact942	2688.01	2688.42	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	actually 
Bro026.B.dialogueact943	2691.73	2693.05	B	Professor	s	-1	0	what he's thinking about it one this yeah 
Bro026.D.dialogueact944	2693.09	2693.35	D	PhD	b	-1	0	this yeah 
Bro026.B.dialogueact946	2693.89	2694.71	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	this categories yeah i guess 
Bro026.E.dialogueact945	2693.73	2694.13	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	this categories yeah i guess 
Bro026.B.dialogueact948	2695.1	2695.19	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.E.dialogueact947	2694.93	2695.39	E	PhD	fg	-1	0	categories i guess 
Bro026.E.dialogueact949	2698.14	2706.05	E	PhD	s	-1	0	i don't i don't um it's not clear to me how to reconcile you know what you're saying which i think is right with the way i've been looking at it that it's it's it's 
Bro026.E.dialogueact950	2706.05	2708.36	E	PhD	s^no	-1	0	that it's it's it's all not very clear to me but 
Bro026.E.dialogueact951	2708.91	2718.47	E	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	to me but it seems to me that the desire the desirable feature to have is something that um his bottom up you know however 
Bro026.E.dialogueact952	2718.84	2720.08	E	PhD	s	-1	0	up you know however we do that and 
Bro026.B.dialogueact953	2719.35	2719.72	B	Professor	b	-1	0	we do that 
Bro026.E.dialogueact954	2720.69	2728.04	E	PhD	s^no	-1	0	and and so i guess what i don't understand is how to do that and still be discriminated because to be discriminated 
Bro026.E.dialogueact955	2728.04	2741.62	E	PhD	s	-1	0	because to be discriminated you have to have categories and the only categories that we know of use are for these human human six significant cattery that are maybe to humans like phoney and things like that but that's 
Bro026.B.dialogueact956	2728.86	2729.21	B	Professor	b	-1	0	because to be discriminated you have to have 
Bro026.E.dialogueact957	2741.62	2743.21	E	PhD	s	-1	0	well like that but that's sort of what you want to avoid and so 
Bro026.E.dialogueact958	2743.21	2746.35	E	PhD	s^no	-1	0	well here's a here's a here's and so i feel this i don't know how to get out of this 
Bro026.B.dialogueact959	2744.1	2764.99	B	Professor	s	-1	0	here's a here's a here's a generic and possibly useless thought which is what do you really i mean in a sense the only system's that makes sense are ones that that have something from top down in in them i feel this i don't know how to get out of this 
Bro026.B.dialogueact960	2766.14	2766.36	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right because 
Bro026.B.dialogueact961	2766.36	2776.33	B	Professor	s	-1	0	right because if the even the smallest organisms trying to learn do anything that doesn't have any kind of reward for doing a pound penalty for doing anything then it's just going to behave randomly 
Bro026.E.dialogueact962	2776.52	2777.19	E	PhD	b	-1	0	whether you're talking 
Bro026.B.dialogueact963	2777.36	2786.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	whether you're talking about something being through evolution or being learned through experience it's got to have something come down to it they kisses reward or at least some sort of reinforcement learning right right so the question is how far 
Bro026.E.dialogueact964	2784.66	2784.98	E	PhD	fg	-1	0	reward or at least right 
Bro026.B.dialogueact966	2786.55	2786.81	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	learning right so the question is how far 
Bro026.E.dialogueact965	2786.06	2787.58	E	PhD	s:qw	-1	0	learning right so the question is how far down 
Bro026.B.dialogueact967	2788.34	2788.6	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	we could stop it words 
Bro026.E.dialogueact968	2788.38	2790.28	E	PhD	s	-1	0	we could stop it words that we don't write we go all the way 
Bro026.E.dialogueact969	2790.36	2790.56	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	write we go all the way 
Bro026.E.dialogueact970	2790.56	2791.98	E	PhD	s	-1	0	write we go all the way down the phony 
Bro026.B.dialogueact971	2792.27	2798.25	B	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	right but i i i think it maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is is trying to deal with it with these fundings 
Bro026.B.dialogueact973	2799.33	2809.59	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	you know and and and it's it's almost like you want categories if if arc if our uh um metric of of goodness uh if uh correction 
Bro026.E.dialogueact972	2799.06	2799.36	E	PhD	b	-1	0	you know and and 
Bro026.B.dialogueact974	2809.93	2817.81	B	Professor	s^bsc^cs	-1	0	if uh correction if infra metric of badness is we're there right then um maybe we should be looking at words 
Bro026.E.dialogueact975	2818.06	2818.73	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	i mean for 
Bro026.B.dialogueact976	2818.68	2824.42	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean for for for very nice uh reasons we've looked well syllables they have a lot of good properties but 
Bro026.B.dialogueact977	2824.42	2831.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but if you go all the way to words i mean that's really mean do in many applications you want to go further you want to go to concepts 
Bro026.B.dialogueact978	2831.44	2835.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	go further you want to go to concepts or something and have have of concepts actions this sort of thing but but words would be a nice 
Bro026.E.dialogueact979	2832.88	2833.13	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	or something and have have of concepts 
Bro026.E.dialogueact980	2835.0	2836.13	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	sort of thing but weren't that bad yeah words would be a nice 
Bro026.B.dialogueact981	2835.59	2835.78	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	sort of thing but words would be a nice 
Bro026.B.dialogueact982	2836.29	2837.16	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	weren't that bad yeah and and yeah 
Bro026.B.dialogueact983	2837.32	2837.79	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	and and yeah 
Bro026.E.dialogueact984	2837.9	2841.65	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and and yeah so the common read the common wisdom is you can't do words because there's too many of them right so 
Bro026.E.dialogueact985	2841.65	2841.89	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	many of them right so 
Bro026.E.dialogueact986	2841.89	2846.05	E	PhD	s	-1	0	many of them right so you have to have some smaller set that you can 
Bro026.E.dialogueact987	2846.89	2851.69	E	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	and and so everybody goes to phone teams but 
Bro026.E.dialogueact988	2852.04	2859.49	E	PhD	s	-1	0	the problem is that we we build models of words in terms of means and these models are are really cartoonish right so when 
Bro026.E.dialogueact989	2859.49	2859.73	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right so when 
Bro026.E.dialogueact990	2859.73	2866.13	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but but we're not trying for right so when you look at conversational speech for example you don't see the phone teams that you that you have in your word models 
Bro026.B.dialogueact991	2860.29	2860.65	B	Professor	b	-1	0	you look at 
Bro026.B.dialogueact992	2864.9	2868.44	B	Professor	fg|s^nd	-1	0	but but we're not trying for models of words here she that you have in your word models 
Bro026.B.dialogueact993	2868.86	2870.45	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	here she so his ears maybe where if 
Bro026.B.dialogueact994	2870.88	2886.66	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	where if the issue is that we're trying to come up with um some sort of intermediate categories which will then be useful for later stuff maybe it doesn't matter that we can have enough 
Bro026.E.dialogueact995	2879.72	2880.11	E	PhD	b	-1	0	for later stuff 
Bro026.E.dialogueact996	2881.03	2881.51	E	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact997	2886.84	2893.33	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	have enough i mean what you want to do is is build up these categories that are that are best for word recognition 
Bro026.E.dialogueact998	2893.32	2893.57	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.E.dialogueact999	2894.47	2894.74	E	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact1000	2895.17	2898.63	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and and some house that's built into the loop of what the categories i mean we do 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1001	2898.63	2904.09	B	Professor	s	-1	0	categories i mean we do this every day and this very gross way of of running a thousand experiments because we assess computers right 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1002	2898.81	2899.3	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	categories i mean we do this every day 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1003	2901.3	2901.83	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	gross way of right 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1004	2904.09	2907.6	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because we assess computers picking the thing it has the best word or right yeah 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1005	2907.46	2907.81	E	PhD	b	-1	0	or right yeah 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1006	2908.04	2909.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	in some way we do right that all the time in 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1007	2909.94	2912.24	B	Professor	s	-1	0	right that all the time in some ways it's it's not that bad thing to do because 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1008	2913.01	2919.42	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	it tells you in fact how your adjustments at the very low level effects the the final goal 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1009	2917.82	2918.33	E	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	effects the the final 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1010	2919.71	2920.29	E	PhD	b	-1	0	goal um 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1011	2920.59	2924.85	B	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	um so maybe there's a way to even put that in in a much more automatic way right 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1012	2923.48	2923.98	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	in a much more automatic right 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1013	2925.41	2931.73	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	where you take you know something about the air at the level of the word or some other could be syllable but in some large unit uhhuh 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1014	2932.04	2932.32	E	PhD	b	-1	0	uh 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1015	2933.06	2939.35	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and uh yeah you may not have word models may have phone models whatever but you sort of 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1016	2939.35	2943.87	B	Professor	s	-1	0	whatever but you sort of don't worry about that and just somehow feed through 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1017	2941.4	2941.77	E	PhD	b	-1	0	that 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1018	2944.13	2948.27	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so that's uh probably useless comments because i'm not really tell you how to do it but i mean it's it 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1019	2948.27	2951.63	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	it but i mean it's it it's it's you know it no but i think the important 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1020	2951.3	2958.79	E	PhD	s^bs	-1	0	you know it no but i think the important part is there is that you know if you want to be discriminated you have to have uh you know categories 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1021	2959.02	2959.32	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	and 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1022	2959.39	2966.15	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and i think that the important categories of the words not the phones maybe 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1023	2963.05	2963.34	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact1024	2966.65	2966.92	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	maybe 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1025	2966.75	2967.11	E	PhD	s^am	-1	0	maybe so 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1026	2967.42	2967.97	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1027	2969.26	2969.43	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	right if you can put 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1028	2969.43	2978.14	E	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	right if you can put the words and to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1029	2979.86	2985.03	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	oh that being said i think that that if you have something that is um if once you start doing spontaneous 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1030	2985.1	2988.57	B	Professor	s	-1	0	once you start doing spontaneous speech other things you're saying or really true 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1031	2988.76	2989.32	E	PhD	b	-1	0	true if you 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1032	2989.31	3000.13	B	Professor	s	-1	0	if you have read speech that's been anyway annotated like ten minutes then you know it it you the phones are going to be right actually for the most part so 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1033	2993.59	2993.9	E	PhD	b	-1	0	minutes 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1034	2999.08	2999.25	E	PhD	b	-1	0	for the most part 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1036	3000.2	3006.76	B	Professor	fh|s^rt	-1	0	so to do that put in discrimination it that 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1035	2999.78	3000.05	E	PhD	b	-1	0	for the most part so 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1037	3007.74	3011.09	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um if you go to spontaneous speech then it's it's trick here and and 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1038	3011.28	3013.77	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	and and and uh the phones or 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1039	3014.95	3019.96	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	yeah it's going to be based on that sensation tunnels that you 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1040	3020.4	3021.0	E	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact1042	3021.01	3024.51	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and won't allow for the overlapping saddam so it's almost like 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1041	3020.53	3020.96	E	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.E.dialogueact1043	3024.31	3034.11	E	PhD	s	-1	0	so it's almost like there's this mechanism that we have that you know when when we're hearing read speech and all the funding for their you know we we deal with that but 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1044	3034.11	3043.56	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but when we go to conversational and all of a sudden not all the fundings are there it doesn't really matter that much to us as humans because 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1045	3043.56	3052.67	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	humans because we have some kind of mechanism that allows for these word models whatever those models art to be mine just you know it 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1046	3052.67	3054.37	E	PhD	s	-1	0	you know it doesn't really hurt 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1047	3054.37	3054.54	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.E.dialogueact1048	3060.36	3063.17	E	PhD	s^no	-1	0	i'm not sure how how to build that in 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1049	3064.03	3064.41	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact1050	3068.68	3069.11	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah i mean i guess 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1051	3069.4	3072.92	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean i guess the other thing is is is just think it's a little bit 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1052	3073.44	3079.96	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we when you when you start looking at these kind of results i think it usually is is pretty intuitive but 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1053	3079.96	3095.61	B	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	pretty intuitive but start looking at um what are the kinds of confusion that you do make uh you know between words if you want to or or or uh even between phones and and in in that speech say uh when there is no ice 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1054	3097.02	3100.46	B	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	know so is it more across place or more cross manner as a 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1056	3100.46	3101.83	B	Professor	s.%--:qy.%--	-1	0	manner as a court you know is it 
Bro026.C.dialogueact1055	3100.45	3101.3	C	Grad	b	-1	0	manner as a court you know is it 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1057	3101.93	3111.89	B	Professor	s	-1	0	court you know is it me i know one thing that happens is that you you you lose the um 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1058	3112.78	3116.86	B	Professor	s	-1	0	is that it's noise and energy phones sometimes don't get heard 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1059	3117.45	3126.36	B	Professor	s	-1	0	is that if that is if it's uh that turns into another word or or different you know another pair of words or something it's more likely to happen 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1060	3126.93	3131.77	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	i know i would i would guess that you 
Bro026.C.dialogueact1061	3126.94	3127.54	C	Grad	b.%	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact1062	3133.34	3133.94	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact1063	3134.64	3135.3	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	i think part 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1064	3135.48	3142.58	E	PhD	s	-1	0	i think part of the difficulty is that will a lot of the robust enough that we have is probably coming from much higher level you 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1066	3143.1	3143.48	B	Professor	b	-1	0	know we understand the 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1065	3142.97	3148.23	E	PhD	s	-1	0	level you know we understand the context of yeah situation we're having conversation itself there's noise 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1067	3148.23	3154.14	E	PhD	s	-1	0	well that's we're we're doing some sort of prediction itself there's noise in there you know our brain cells and and imagine's what what should be there yeah 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1068	3152.24	3152.6	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	well that's we're imagine's what 
Bro026.C.dialogueact1069	3152.25	3155.76	C	Grad	fg|s.%-	-1	0	well that's oh sure we're we're doing some sort of prediction of what imagine's what what should be there yeah exactly 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1070	3154.93	3155.83	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	oh sure prediction of what yeah exactly 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1071	3155.78	3157.29	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	oh sure that's really big um but of what exactly 
Bro026.C.dialogueact1072	3156.34	3156.62	C	Grad	b	-1	0	that's really big 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1073	3157.57	3176.0	B	Professor	fh|s^rt	-1	0	um but i mean even if you do um uh diagnostic rhyme test kind of things you know what it really isn't and and any information like that uh people are still better noise then they then they than the machines are 
Bro026.E.dialogueact1074	3176.27	3176.79	E	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro026.B.dialogueact1075	3177.3	3178.74	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	so i mean that's 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1076	3179.55	3183.01	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	right we can't we can't get it all without any language miles fine as long as they're 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1077	3183.01	3184.48	B	Professor	s	-1	0	as long as they're important but 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1078	3184.6	3185.9	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	important but

Bro026.B.dialogueact1080	3189.13	3193.38	B	Professor	s	-1	0	for i work and that then work on something else and member of it 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1081	3193.58	3195.97	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	of it especially if it looks like the potential is there 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1082	3196.14	3196.35	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro026.B.dialogueact1083	3202.4	3203.26	B	Professor	qy^rt^t^tc	-1	0	and that it's
