Bro018.D.dialogueact4	5.5	10.69	D	PhD	s	+1	1	Yeah , I will try to explain the thing that I did this {disfmarker} this week {disfmarker} during this week .
Bro018.C.dialogueact5	10.96	11.18	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.D.dialogueact6	11.336	18.116	D	PhD	s	+1	2	Well eh you know that I work {disfmarker} I begin to work with a new feature to detect voice - unvoice .
Bro018.E.dialogueact7	18.54	18.78	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.D.dialogueact8	19.429	34.6	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	2	What I trying two MLP to {disfmarker} to the {disfmarker} with this new feature and the fifteen feature uh from the eh bus base system
Bro018.E.dialogueact9	35.567	36.607	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	The {disfmarker} the mel cepstrum ?
Bro018.D.dialogueact10	37.78	39.85	D	PhD	s^ar|s.%--	-1	0	No , satly the mes the Mel Cepstrum ,
Bro018.D.dialogueact11	39.85	43.18	D	PhD	s	-1	0	the new base system {disfmarker} the new base system .
Bro018.E.dialogueact12	43.29	43.73	E	PhD	s^bk.%--	-1	0	Oh the {disfmarker}
Bro018.D.dialogueact14	43.99	45.07	D	PhD	s^aa|%-	-1	0	Yeah , we {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact13	43.88	44.5	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact15	44.5	45.22	E	PhD	s^bc	-1	0	the Aurora system .
Bro018.D.dialogueact16	45.44	50.96	D	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah the Aurora system with the new filter , VAD or something like that .
Bro018.E.dialogueact17	45.794	46.054	E	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro018.D.dialogueact18	51.84	57.63	D	PhD	s	+1	1	And I 'm trying two MLP , one one that only have t three output ,
Bro018.D.dialogueact19	58.19	59.82	D	PhD	s	+1	1	voice , unvoice , and silence ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact20	60.05	60.46	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.D.dialogueact21	60.55	65.18	D	PhD	s	+1	1	and other one that have fifty - six output .
Bro018.D.dialogueact22	65.97	67.53	D	PhD	s	+1	1	The probabilities of the allophone .
Bro018.D.dialogueact23	68.84	73.08	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	And I tried to do some experiment of recognition with that
Bro018.D.dialogueact24	73.89	78.51	D	PhD	s	+1	1	and only have result with {disfmarker} with the MLP with the three output .
Bro018.D.dialogueact25	79.273	82.813	D	PhD	s	-1	0	And I put together the fifteen features and the three MLP output .
Bro018.D.dialogueact26	83.623	88.77	D	PhD	s	+1	1	And , well , the result are li a little bit better , but more or less similar .
Bro018.C.dialogueact27	89.18	91.2	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Uh , I {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm slightly confused .
Bro018.E.dialogueact28	89.4	89.57	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact29	91.2	93.99	C	Professor	qw^rt	-1	0	What {disfmarker} what feeds the uh {disfmarker} the three - output net ?
Bro018.D.dialogueact30	94.84	96.47	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Voice , unvoice , and si
Bro018.C.dialogueact31	96.17	96.99	C	Professor	s^ar|qw^r	-1	0	No no , what feeds it ?
Bro018.C.dialogueact32	96.99	98.14	C	Professor	qw	-1	0	What features does it see ?
Bro018.D.dialogueact33	97.86	98.74	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	The feature {disfmarker} the input ?
Bro018.D.dialogueact34	99.43	107.04	D	PhD	s	-1	0	The inputs are the fifteen {disfmarker} the fifteen uh bases feature .
Bro018.C.dialogueact35	107.73	108.02	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro018.D.dialogueact36	107.792	109.222	D	PhD	s	-1	0	the {disfmarker} with the new code .
Bro018.D.dialogueact37	109.802	116.102	D	PhD	s	-1	0	And the other three features are R , the variance of the difference between the two spectrum ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact38	116.44	116.8	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro018.D.dialogueact39	117.13	126.38	D	PhD	s	-1	0	the variance of the auto - correlation function , except the {disfmarker} the first point , because half the height value is R - zero
Bro018.C.dialogueact40	119.992	120.292	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact41	123.556	123.976	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact42	125.393	125.823	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact43	126.149	126.569	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.D.dialogueact44	126.77	128.19	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and also R - zero ,
Bro018.D.dialogueact45	129.42	132.02	D	PhD	s	-1	0	the first coefficient of the auto - correlation function .
Bro018.D.dialogueact46	132.25	135.833	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	That is like the energy with these three feature ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact47	133.84	134.24	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.D.dialogueact48	135.913	136.953	D	PhD	s	-1	0	also these three feature .
Bro018.C.dialogueact49	137.57	140.61	C	Professor	qr^bu^rt	-1	0	You wouldn't do like R - one over R - zero or something like that ?
Bro018.C.dialogueact50	142.29	145.71	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean usually for voiced - unvoiced you 'd do {disfmarker} yeah , you 'd do something {disfmarker} you 'd do energy
Bro018.D.dialogueact51	143.67	143.87	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact52	145.71	151.21	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but then you have something like spectral slope , which is you get like R - one ov over R - zero or something like that .
Bro018.D.dialogueact53	151.952	152.512	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact54	152.996	153.716	E	PhD	qw	-1	0	What are the R 's ?
Bro018.C.dialogueact56	154.35	155.31	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	R correlations .
Bro018.E.dialogueact55	153.876	154.566	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	I 'm sorry I missed it .
Bro018.D.dialogueact57	155.42	155.53	D	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No ,
Bro018.D.dialogueact59	155.53	156.27	D	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	R c No .
Bro018.E.dialogueact58	155.47	155.7	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bro018.D.dialogueact60	157.34	158.15	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Auto - correlation ?
Bro018.D.dialogueact61	158.15	161.48	D	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yes , yes , the variance of the auto - correlation function that uses that
Bro018.C.dialogueact62	158.914	162.64	C	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	Ye - Well that 's the variance ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact63	162.64	163.94	C	Professor	qw.%--	-1	0	but if you just say " what is {disfmarker} "
Bro018.C.dialogueact64	163.94	166.34	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , to first order , um
Bro018.C.dialogueact65	166.48	169.23	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	yeah one of the differences between voiced , unvoiced and silence is energy .
Bro018.C.dialogueact67	169.64	172.0	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Another one is {disfmarker} but the other one is the spectral shape .
Bro018.D.dialogueact66	169.58	169.8	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro018.D.dialogueact68	169.8	170.33	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I I 'll {disfmarker}
Bro018.D.dialogueact69	172.22	173.1	D	PhD	s^m	-1	0	The spectral shape ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact71	173.28	173.48	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact72	173.48	176.41	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and so R - one over R - zero is what you typically use for that .
Bro018.D.dialogueact70	173.15	173.27	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah .
Bro018.D.dialogueact73	176.881	177.001	D	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No ,
Bro018.D.dialogueact74	177.001	178.001	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I don't use that {disfmarker}
Bro018.D.dialogueact75	178.001	178.591	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I can't use {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact76	178.9	178.97	C	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	No ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact77	178.97	181.0	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I 'm saying that 's what people us typically use .
Bro018.D.dialogueact78	181.63	182.48	D	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact79	183.02	190.59	C	Professor	s^df:qr	-1	0	See , because it {disfmarker} because this is {disfmarker} this is just like a single number to tell you um " does the spectrum look like that or does it look like that " .
Bro018.D.dialogueact80	189.149	189.479	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.A.dialogueact81	191.39	191.42	A	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Oh . R {disfmarker}
Bro018.A.dialogueact82	191.42	191.78	A	Grad	s	-1	0	R {disfmarker} R - zero .
Bro018.C.dialogueact83	192.36	192.51	C	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bro018.D.dialogueact84	193.07	193.35	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact85	193.58	203.16	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So if it 's {disfmarker} if it 's um {disfmarker} if it 's low energy uh but the {disfmarker} but the spectrum looks like that or like that , it 's probably silence .
Bro018.D.dialogueact86	202.0	202.33	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact87	204.068	208.821	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh but if it 's low energy and the spectrum looks like that , it 's probably unvoiced .
Bro018.D.dialogueact88	209.58	209.79	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact89	210.15	222.529	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	So if you just {disfmarker} if you just had to pick two features to determine voiced - unvoiced , you 'd pick something about the spectrum like uh R - one over R - zero , um and R - zero
Bro018.D.dialogueact90	219.573	219.983	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm ,
Bro018.D.dialogueact91	220.283	220.533	D	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro018.C.dialogueact92	223.109	226.159	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	or i i you know you 'd have some other energy measure
Bro018.C.dialogueact93	226.159	226.449	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	and
Bro018.C.dialogueact94	226.449	230.56	C	Professor	s	-1	0	like in the old days people did like uh zero crossing counts .
Bro018.D.dialogueact95	230.54	230.99	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact96	231.35	231.63	C	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right . S
Bro018.C.dialogueact97	232.58	233.2	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	S
Bro018.D.dialogueact98	232.59	234.41	D	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Well , I can also th use this .
Bro018.C.dialogueact99	235.45	235.73	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact100	236.75	237.29	C	Professor	h	-1	0	Um ,
Bro018.D.dialogueact101	237.75	240.29	D	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Bec - because the result are a little bit better
Bro018.D.dialogueact102	240.29	246.68	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	but we have in a point that everything is more or less the similar {disfmarker} more or less similar .
Bro018.C.dialogueact103	241.807	242.057	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact104	246.95	247.85	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	But um
Bro018.D.dialogueact105	247.608	248.688	D	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's not quite better .
Bro018.C.dialogueact106	249.08	263.04	C	Professor	fg|s^bk.%--	-1	0	Right , but it seemed to me that what you were what you were getting at before was that there is something about the difference between the original signal or the original FFT and with the filter which is what {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact107	263.04	265.13	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and the variance was one take uh on it .
Bro018.D.dialogueact108	265.02	265.15	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro018.D.dialogueact109	265.15	266.66	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I used this too .
Bro018.C.dialogueact110	267.116	267.356	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.C.dialogueact111	267.356	268.536	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	But it {disfmarker} it could be something else .
Bro018.C.dialogueact112	268.656	270.556	C	Professor	s^df^rt	-1	0	Suppose you didn't have anything like that .
Bro018.C.dialogueact113	270.666	274.546	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Then in that case , if you have two nets ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact114	276.71	280.97	C	Professor	s^f|s.%-	-1	0	Alright , and this one has three outputs , and this one has f
Bro018.D.dialogueact115	279.85	280.21	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact116	281.73	282.11	C	Professor	s	-1	0	whatever ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact117	282.11	283.47	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	fifty - six , or something ,
Bro018.D.dialogueact118	283.782	284.192	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact119	284.6	294.08	C	Professor	s	-1	0	if you were to sum up the probabilities for the voiced and for the unvoiced and for the silence here , we 've found in the past you 'll do better at voiced - unvoiced - silence than you do with this one .
Bro018.C.dialogueact120	295.43	299.33	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So just having the three output thing doesn't {disfmarker} doesn't really buy you anything .
Bro018.C.dialogueact122	300.18	301.63	C	Professor	s	-1	0	The issue is what you feed it .
Bro018.D.dialogueact121	299.79	299.98	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.D.dialogueact123	303.74	303.85	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro018.D.dialogueact124	303.85	304.42	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I have {disfmarker}
Bro018.D.dialogueact125	304.87	305.11	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact126	306.28	307.14	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	So uh
Bro018.D.dialogueact128	307.085	307.275	D	PhD	s^ar.%--	-1	0	No {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact127	306.75	315.05	E	PhD	s^bu.%--	-1	0	So you 're saying take the features that go into the voiced - unvoiced - silence net and feed those into the other one , as additional inputs , rather than having a separate {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact129	312.5	315.34	C	Professor	s	-1	0	w W well that 's another way .
Bro018.D.dialogueact130	314.26	314.53	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact131	315.34	316.15	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	That wasn't what I was saying
Bro018.C.dialogueact132	316.15	318.33	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	but yeah that 's certainly another thing to do .
Bro018.C.dialogueact133	318.58	324.34	C	Professor	qo	-1	0	No I was just trying to say if you b if you bring this into the picture over this , what more does it buy you ?
Bro018.E.dialogueact134	324.71	325.06	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact135	325.29	333.64	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And what I was saying is that the only thing I think that it buys you is um based on whether you feed it something different .
Bro018.C.dialogueact136	334.95	336.71	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And something different in some fundamental way .
Bro018.C.dialogueact137	336.71	360.81	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And so the kind of thing that {disfmarker} that she was talking about before , was looking at something uh ab um {disfmarker} something uh about the difference between the {disfmarker} the uh um log FFT uh log power uh and the log magnitude uh F F - spectrum uh and the um uh filter bank .
Bro018.D.dialogueact138	361.38	361.52	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact139	362.5	368.81	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	And so the filter bank is chosen in fact to sort of integrate out the effects of pitch
Bro018.C.dialogueact140	369.36	370.14	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and she 's saying
Bro018.C.dialogueact141	370.14	370.76	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	you know trying {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact142	370.76	375.49	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So the particular measure that she chose was the variance of this m of this difference ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact144	376.05	377.87	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but that might not be the right number .
Bro018.D.dialogueact143	375.641	375.971	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.D.dialogueact145	378.68	378.88	D	PhD	s^am	-1	0	Maybe .
Bro018.C.dialogueact146	379.3	379.68	C	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bro018.C.dialogueact147	379.68	383.08	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	I mean maybe there 's something about the variance that 's {disfmarker} that 's not enough
Bro018.C.dialogueact148	383.08	385.36	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	or maybe there 's something else that {disfmarker} that one could use ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact149	385.36	391.821	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but I think that , for me , the thing that {disfmarker} that struck me was that uh you wanna get something back here ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact150	391.821	392.991	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so here 's {disfmarker} here 's an idea .
Bro018.C.dialogueact151	393.81	400.69	C	Professor	qw^cs	-1	0	uh What about it you skip all the {disfmarker} all the really clever things , and just fed the log magnitude spectrum into this ?
Bro018.D.dialogueact152	404.05	404.68	D	PhD	s^br	-1	0	Ah {disfmarker} I 'm sorry .
Bro018.C.dialogueact153	405.72	406.39	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	This is f
Bro018.C.dialogueact154	406.49	412.63	C	Professor	s	-1	0	You have the log magnitude spectrum , and you were looking at that and the difference between the filter bank and {disfmarker} and c c computing the variance .
Bro018.D.dialogueact155	407.558	407.818	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.D.dialogueact156	408.178	408.518	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact158	413.09	414.16	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	That 's a clever thing to do .
Bro018.D.dialogueact157	412.698	413.048	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact159	414.16	415.41	C	Professor	qw	-1	0	What if you stopped being clever ?
Bro018.C.dialogueact161	416.42	421.11	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And you just took this thing in here because it 's a neural net and neural nets are wonderful
Bro018.D.dialogueact160	416.279	416.599	D	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact162	421.11	427.291	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and figure out what they can {disfmarker} what they most need from things , and I mean that 's what they 're good at .
Bro018.D.dialogueact163	425.49	425.69	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact164	428.742	433.902	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So I mean you 're {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} you 're trying to be clever and say what 's the statistic that should {disfmarker} we should get about this difference
Bro018.C.dialogueact165	434.662	440.501	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	but uh in fact , you know maybe just feeding this in or {disfmarker} or feeding both of them in
Bro018.E.dialogueact166	438.055	438.295	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact167	441.697	445.487	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	you know , another way , saying let it figure out what 's the {disfmarker} what is the interaction ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact168	445.487	447.587	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	especially if you do this over multiple frames ?
Bro018.D.dialogueact169	447.91	448.25	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact170	448.75	452.88	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Then you have this over time , and {disfmarker} and both kinds of measures
Bro018.C.dialogueact171	452.88	455.94	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and uh you might get uh something better .
Bro018.D.dialogueact172	457.58	457.89	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact173	458.57	459.26	C	Professor	h	-1	0	Um .
Bro018.E.dialogueact174	460.05	462.74	E	PhD	s	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so don't uh {disfmarker} don't do the division ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact175	462.74	464.66	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but let the net have everything .
Bro018.C.dialogueact176	465.01	466.1	C	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's another thing you could do
Bro018.C.dialogueact177	466.1	466.4	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact178	466.96	467.22	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.D.dialogueact179	466.97	467.28	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact180	468.4	469.02	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro018.C.dialogueact181	471.166	476.276	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , it seems to me , if you have exactly the right thing then it 's better to do it without the net
Bro018.C.dialogueact182	476.276	478.646	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because otherwise you 're asking the net to learn this {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact183	478.646	481.246	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you know , say if you wanted to learn how to do multiplication .
Bro018.E.dialogueact184	481.419	481.969	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact185	482.17	486.89	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean you could feed it a bunch of s you could feed two numbers that you wanted to multiply into a net
Bro018.C.dialogueact186	487.66	489.75	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and have a bunch of nonlinearities in the middle
Bro018.C.dialogueact187	489.87	492.99	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	and train it to get the product of the output and it would work .
Bro018.C.dialogueact188	493.71	494.72	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But , it 's kind of crazy ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact189	494.72	495.8	C	Professor	s	-1	0	cuz we know how to multiply
Bro018.C.dialogueact190	495.8	501.08	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and you {disfmarker} you 'd be you know much lower error usually {vocalsound} if you just multiplied it out .
Bro018.C.dialogueact191	501.457	503.807	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But suppose you don't really know what the right thing is .
Bro018.C.dialogueact192	504.397	508.497	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And that 's what these sort of dumb machine learning methods are good at .
Bro018.C.dialogueact193	508.727	508.807	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro018.C.dialogueact194	510.11	510.51	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	Um .
Bro018.C.dialogueact195	510.73	510.96	C	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	Anyway .
Bro018.C.dialogueact196	510.96	511.55	C	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	It 's just a thought .
Bro018.E.dialogueact197	511.81	514.35	E	PhD	qw	-1	0	How long does it take , Carmen , to train up one of these nets ?
Bro018.D.dialogueact198	515.09	516.49	D	PhD	h|s	-1	0	Oh , not too much .
Bro018.E.dialogueact199	516.67	516.85	E	PhD	s^bk^rt	-1	0	Yeah .

Bro018.C.dialogueact203	520.18	520.78	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	it 's probably worth it .
Bro018.A.dialogueact204	522.23	526.12	A	Grad	qw	-1	0	What are {disfmarker} what are your f uh frame error rates for {disfmarker} for this ?

Bro018.C.dialogueact234	566.21	575.912	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I think at the frame level for fifty - six that was the kind of number we were getting for {disfmarker} for uh um reduced band width uh stuff .
Bro018.D.dialogueact235	575.06	584.117	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I think that {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think that for the other one , for the three output , is sixty sixty - two , sixty three more or less .

Bro018.C.dialogueact304	700.29	700.64	C	Professor	s	-1	0	something .
Bro018.C.dialogueact305	700.92	705.198	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Some {disfmarker} some read task actually , that they 're {disfmarker} preparing .
Bro018.A.dialogueact306	703.758	703.968	A	Grad	s^bk^fe^rt	-1	0	Hmm !
Bro018.E.dialogueact307	704.72	705.23	E	PhD	qw^d.%--	-1	0	For what {disfmarker}

Bro018.C.dialogueact309	706.5	706.68	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact310	707.006	707.156	E	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	Oh !
Bro018.C.dialogueact311	708.009	709.069	C	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah , so the uh {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact312	710.503	716.463	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , the issue is whether people make a decision now based on what they 've already seen , or they make it later .
Bro018.C.dialogueact313	716.463	725.148	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And one of the arguments for making it later is let 's make sure that whatever techniques that we 're using work for something more than {disfmarker} than connected digits .
Bro018.E.dialogueact314	726.752	727.132	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact315	727.34	727.62	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro018.E.dialogueact316	729.791	732.02	E	PhD	qw	-1	0	When are they planning {disfmarker} When would they do that ?
Bro018.C.dialogueact317	732.79	735.64	C	Professor	h|s	-1	0	Mmm , I think late {disfmarker} uh I think in the summer sometime .
Bro018.E.dialogueact318	736.035	736.405	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact319	738.784	739.164	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro018.C.dialogueact320	741.23	741.9	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK , thanks .
Bro018.D.dialogueact321	742.387	746.137	D	PhD	s	-1	0	This is the work that I did during this date
Bro018.C.dialogueact322	744.6	744.88	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro018.D.dialogueact323	746.137	755.443	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	3	and also mmm I {disfmarker} H Hynek last week say that if I have time I can to begin to {disfmarker} to study
Bro018.D.dialogueact324	756.247	759.567	D	PhD	s^rt.%--	+1	3	well seriously the France Telecom proposal
Bro018.C.dialogueact325	759.985	760.385	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.D.dialogueact326	760.067	761.137	D	PhD	s^rt.%--	+1	3	to look at the code
Bro018.D.dialogueact327	761.137	762.347	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	and something like that
Bro018.D.dialogueact328	763.28	765.43	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	to know exactly what they are doing
Bro018.D.dialogueact329	765.43	768.08	D	PhD	s	-1	0	because maybe that we can have some ideas
Bro018.C.dialogueact330	768.09	768.63	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.D.dialogueact331	768.819	770.939	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but not only to read the proposal .
Bro018.D.dialogueact332	771.399	778.156	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Look insi look i carefully what they are doing with the program @ @ and
Bro018.D.dialogueact333	778.156	780.606	D	PhD	s^rt^tc	+1	3	I begin to {disfmarker} to work also in that .
Bro018.D.dialogueact334	781.43	792.62	D	PhD	s.%--	+1	3	But the first thing that I don't understand is that they are using R - the uh log energy that this quite {disfmarker}
Bro018.D.dialogueact335	793.49	800.04	D	PhD	s^no	+1	3	I don't know why they have some constant in the expression of the lower energy .
Bro018.D.dialogueact336	800.25	801.64	D	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I don't know what that means .
Bro018.E.dialogueact337	803.94	805.53	E	PhD	qy^br^d^rt	-1	0	They have a constant in there , you said ?
Bro018.D.dialogueact338	805.075	805.355	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact339	807.046	814.226	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Oh , at the front it says uh " log energy is equal to the rounded version of sixteen over the log of two "
Bro018.D.dialogueact340	812.119	812.399	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	This {disfmarker}
Bro018.D.dialogueact341	814.266	814.526	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact342	815.112	816.072	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bro018.C.dialogueact344	817.637	818.537	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	uh times the {disfmarker}
Bro018.D.dialogueact343	817.6	819.47	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Then maybe I can understand .
Bro018.C.dialogueact345	818.537	819.847	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	Well , this is natural log ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact346	819.847	821.757	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and maybe it has something to do with the fact that this is {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact348	823.363	824.693	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I have no idea .
Bro018.E.dialogueact347	823.33	825.06	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Is that some kind of base conversion ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact349	825.06	825.09	E	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bro018.C.dialogueact350	825.86	826.83	C	Professor	s^bk|s	-1	0	Yeah , that 's what I was thinking ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact351	826.83	830.429	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but um , then there 's the sixty - four ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact352	832.04	834.502	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	Uh , {vocalsound} I don't know .
Bro018.D.dialogueact353	835.755	841.585	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Because maybe they 're {disfmarker} the threshold that they are using on the basis of this value {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact354	837.43	838.41	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Experimental results .
Bro018.A.dialogueact355	839.828	841.238	A	Grad	s^j	-1	0	Mc - McDonald 's constant .
Bro018.D.dialogueact356	841.585	842.495	D	PhD	s^bd^no	-1	0	I don't know exactly ,
Bro018.D.dialogueact357	842.825	845.575	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because well th I thought maybe they have a meaning .
Bro018.D.dialogueact358	845.975	849.275	D	PhD	s^no	-1	0	But I don't know what is the meaning of take exactly this value .
Bro018.C.dialogueact359	849.54	850.82	C	Professor	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	Yeah , it 's pretty funny looking .
Bro018.E.dialogueact360	850.29	857.55	E	PhD	s	-1	0	So they 're taking the number inside the log and raising it to sixteen over log base two .
Bro018.C.dialogueact361	850.82	851.23	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I don't know .
Bro018.C.dialogueact362	857.692	858.422	C	Professor	fg|%--	-1	0	Yeah , I {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact363	859.959	862.289	C	Professor	fh|s^bk	-1	0	um Right .
Bro018.C.dialogueact364	864.327	868.803	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Sixteen over {comment} two .
Bro018.E.dialogueact365	865.0	866.88	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Does it have to do with those sixty - fours ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact366	866.88	866.93	E	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bro018.C.dialogueact367	870.434	871.664	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro018.C.dialogueact368	872.25	879.007	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	If we ignore the sixteen , the natural log of t one over the natural log of two times the natu
Bro018.C.dialogueact369	879.107	879.677	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I don't know .
Bro018.C.dialogueact371	880.757	882.527	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , maybe somebody 'll think of something ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact370	880.289	880.699	E	PhD	b	-1	0	
Bro018.C.dialogueact372	882.607	883.407	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but this is uh {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact373	885.04	888.58	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	It may just be that they {disfmarker} they want to have {disfmarker} for very small energies ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact374	888.58	891.04	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	they want to have some kind of a {disfmarker}
Bro018.D.dialogueact375	890.01	894.42	D	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah , the e The effect I don't {disfmarker} @ @ I can understand the effect of this ,
Bro018.D.dialogueact376	894.42	894.63	D	PhD	qy^d^g	-1	0	no ?
Bro018.D.dialogueact377	894.63	898.036	D	PhD	s	-1	0	because it 's to {disfmarker} to do something like that .
Bro018.C.dialogueact379	898.45	907.338	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , it says , since you 're taking a natural log , it says that when {disfmarker} when you get down to essentially zero energy , this is gonna be the natural log of one , which is zero .
Bro018.D.dialogueact378	898.346	898.616	D	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	No ?
Bro018.D.dialogueact380	903.94	904.25	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact381	907.948	913.81	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So it 'll go down to uh to {nonvocalsound} the natural log being {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact382	914.74	916.28	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So the lowest value for this would be zero .
Bro018.C.dialogueact383	916.28	918.41	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So y you 're restricted to being positive .
Bro018.C.dialogueact384	918.78	920.89	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And this sort of smooths it for very small energies .
Bro018.C.dialogueact385	921.666	925.526	C	Professor	s^am^cs	-1	0	Uh , why they chose sixty - four and something else , that was probably just experimental .
Bro018.C.dialogueact387	926.258	929.138	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	And the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the constant in front of it , I have no idea .
Bro018.D.dialogueact386	925.96	926.2	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact388	929.77	930.08	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um
Bro018.D.dialogueact389	930.398	936.028	D	PhD	fg|qo^cc	-1	0	Well . I {disfmarker} I will look to try if I move this parameter in their code what happens ,
Bro018.D.dialogueact390	936.218	940.948	D	PhD	s^am	-1	0	maybe everything is {disfmarker} Maybe they tres hole are on basis of this .
Bro018.C.dialogueact391	938.186	949.079	C	Professor	s^am	-1	0	uh {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they {disfmarker} they probably have some fi particular s fixed point arithmetic that they 're using ,
Bro018.D.dialogueact392	941.9	942.22	D	PhD	s^am	-1	0	I don't know .
Bro018.C.dialogueact394	949.079	949.939	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and then it just {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact393	948.68	950.65	E	PhD	fg|s^cs	-1	0	Yeah , I was just gonna say maybe it has something to do with hardware ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact396	951.332	951.522	C	Professor	s^am	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact395	950.94	951.67	E	PhD	s^e	-1	0	something they were doing .
Bro018.C.dialogueact397	951.91	952.29	C	Professor	s^am^r	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact398	952.5	955.56	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean that {disfmarker} they 're s probably working with fixed point or integer or something .
Bro018.C.dialogueact399	955.56	957.19	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I think you 're supposed to on this stuff anyway ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact400	957.19	960.45	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and so maybe that puts it in the right realm somewhere .
Bro018.E.dialogueact401	959.65	961.32	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Well it just , yeah , puts it in the right range ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact402	961.32	961.38	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	or {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact403	963.41	963.58	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact404	963.73	969.03	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I think , given at the level you 're doing things in floating point on the computer , I don't think it matters , would be my guess ,
Bro018.D.dialogueact405	968.52	968.8	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact406	969.07	969.17	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	but .
Bro018.D.dialogueact407	970.024	972.014	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I {disfmarker} this more or less anything
Bro018.C.dialogueact408	971.063	971.523	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact409	974.527	976.727	C	Professor	fg|qw^rt	+1	1	OK , and wh when did Stephane take off ?
Bro018.C.dialogueact410	976.947	977.487	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	He took off {disfmarker}
Bro018.D.dialogueact411	977.16	980.38	D	PhD	s	+1	1	I think that Stephane will arrive today or tomorrow .
Bro018.C.dialogueact412	980.96	982.8	C	Professor	s^bk|s^bu	-1	0	Oh , he was gone these first few days ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact413	982.8	986.63	C	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	and then he 's here for a couple days before he goes to Salt Lake City .
Bro018.D.dialogueact414	985.25	985.64	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact415	986.84	987.07	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro018.D.dialogueact416	987.314	990.414	D	PhD	s	-1	0	He 's {disfmarker} I think that he is in Las Vegas or something like that .
Bro018.C.dialogueact417	991.01	991.22	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact418	992.164	992.424	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact419	992.944	994.454	C	Professor	s	+1	1	So he 's {disfmarker} he 's going to ICASSP which is good .
Bro018.C.dialogueact420	994.454	997.024	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I don't know if there are many people who are going to ICASSP
Bro018.D.dialogueact421	996.196	996.586	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact422	997.024	999.164	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so {disfmarker} so I thought , make sure somebody go .
Bro018.D.dialogueact423	997.416	997.756	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact424	998.13	1002.84	E	PhD	qy	-1	0	Do {disfmarker} have {disfmarker} Have people sort of stopped going to ICASSP in recent years ?
Bro018.C.dialogueact425	1003.09	1006.32	C	Professor	h|s	-1	0	Um , people are less consistent about going to ICASSP
Bro018.C.dialogueact426	1006.32	1011.47	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	and I think it 's still {disfmarker} it 's still a reasonable forum for students to {disfmarker} to present things .
Bro018.C.dialogueact427	1011.47	1019.01	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Uh , it 's {disfmarker} I think for engineering students of any kind , I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's if you haven't been there much , it 's good to go to ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact428	1019.56	1021.88	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	uh to get a feel for things , a range of things ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact429	1021.88	1022.72	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	not just speech .
Bro018.C.dialogueact430	1023.0	1023.38	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bro018.C.dialogueact431	1024.16	1031.45	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But I think for {disfmarker} for sort of dyed - in - the - wool speech people , um I think that ICSLP and Eurospeech are much more targeted .
Bro018.E.dialogueact432	1031.53	1031.88	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact433	1032.45	1032.76	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bro018.C.dialogueact434	1032.76	1037.87	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And then there 's these other meetings , like HLT and {disfmarker} and uh ASRU {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact435	1035.14	1035.52	E	PhD	b	-1	0	
Bro018.C.dialogueact436	1038.36	1046.48	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so there 's {disfmarker} there 's actually plenty of meetings that are really relevant to {disfmarker} to uh computational uh speech processing of one sort or another .
Bro018.E.dialogueact437	1045.35	1045.69	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.E.dialogueact438	1045.36	1045.7	E	PhD	b	-1	0	
Bro018.C.dialogueact439	1046.75	1048.6	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um . So .
Bro018.C.dialogueact440	1049.08	1053.11	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , I mostly just ignored it because I was too busy and {vocalsound} didn't get to it .
Bro018.C.dialogueact441	1054.19	1055.06	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So uh
Bro018.C.dialogueact442	1056.15	1058.32	C	Professor	qy^rt^t^tc	+1	1	Wanna talk a little bit about what we were talking about this morning ?
Bro018.A.dialogueact443	1058.52	1058.74	A	Grad	s^bk^fe	-1	0	Oh !
Bro018.A.dialogueact445	1058.98	1061.3	A	Grad	fh|s^aa	-1	0	um {pause} uh {pause} Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact444	1058.56	1061.08	C	Professor	qr^rt	-1	0	Just briefly , or {pause} Or anything else ?
Bro018.A.dialogueact446	1061.3	1068.48	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So . I {disfmarker} I guess some of the progress , I {disfmarker} I 've been getting a {disfmarker} getting my committee members for the quals .
Bro018.A.dialogueact447	1069.13	1073.93	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And um so far I have Morgan and Hynek , {vocalsound} Mike Jordan ,
Bro018.A.dialogueact448	1074.19	1076.11	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and I asked John Ohala and he agreed .
Bro018.A.dialogueact450	1076.92	1077.8	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah . Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact449	1076.62	1076.94	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Cool .
Bro018.A.dialogueact451	1077.96	1081.0	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So I 'm {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I just need to ask um Malek .
Bro018.A.dialogueact452	1081.46	1081.69	A	Grad	s	-1	0	One more .
Bro018.A.dialogueact453	1082.16	1083.38	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um . Tsk .
Bro018.A.dialogueact454	1083.59	1091.11	A	Grad	s	+1	1	Then uh I talked a little bit about {vocalsound} um continuing with these dynamic ev um acoustic events ,
Bro018.A.dialogueact455	1091.66	1104.88	A	Grad	s	+1	1	and um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} we 're {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} we 're {vocalsound} thinking about a way to test the completeness of a {disfmarker} a set of um dynamic uh events .
Bro018.A.dialogueact456	1105.45	1122.79	A	Grad	qo	+1	1	Uh , completeness in the {disfmarker} in the sense that {vocalsound} um if we {disfmarker} if we pick these X number of acoustic events , {vocalsound} do they provide sufficient coverage {vocalsound} for the phones that we 're trying to recognize {vocalsound} or {disfmarker} or the f the words that we 're gonna try to recognize later on .
Bro018.A.dialogueact457	1123.44	1139.65	A	Grad	s	+1	1	And so Morgan and I were uh discussing {vocalsound} um s uh s a form of a cheating experiment {vocalsound} where we get {disfmarker} {vocalsound} um we have uh {vocalsound} um a chosen set of features , or acoustic events ,
Bro018.A.dialogueact458	1140.1	1146.28	A	Grad	s	+1	1	and we train up a hybrid {vocalsound} um system to do phone recognition on TIMIT .
Bro018.A.dialogueact459	1146.99	1163.19	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So i i the idea is if we get good phone recognition results , {vocalsound} using um these set of acoustic events , {vocalsound} then {vocalsound} um that {disfmarker} that says that these acoustic events are g sufficient to cover {vocalsound} a set of phones ,
Bro018.A.dialogueact460	1163.3	1164.4	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	at least found in TIMIT .
Bro018.A.dialogueact461	1165.06	1173.5	A	Grad	qo	-1	0	Um so i it would be a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a measure of " are we on the right track with {disfmarker} with the {disfmarker} the choices of our acoustic events " .
Bro018.A.dialogueact462	1174.17	1176.45	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	Um , {vocalsound} So that 's going on .
Bro018.A.dialogueact463	1176.76	1183.95	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And {vocalsound} also , just uh working on my {vocalsound} uh final project for Jordan 's class ,
Bro018.A.dialogueact464	1183.95	1184.88	A	Grad	s^e.%-	-1	0	uh which is {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact465	1185.31	1185.85	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Actually , let me {disfmarker}
Bro018.A.dialogueact467	1186.03	1186.21	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact466	1185.99	1186.52	C	Professor	s^co	-1	0	Hold that thought .
Bro018.A.dialogueact469	1186.93	1187.65	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK , sure .
Bro018.C.dialogueact468	1186.52	1188.12	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Let me back up while we 're still on it .
Bro018.C.dialogueact470	1188.12	1196.61	C	Professor	s	-1	0	The {disfmarker} the other thing I was suggesting , though , is that given that you 're talking about binary features , uh , maybe the first thing to do is just to count
Bro018.C.dialogueact471	1197.55	1202.59	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and uh count co - occurrences and get probabilities for a discrete HMM
Bro018.C.dialogueact472	1203.71	1204.65	C	Professor	s	-1	0	cuz that 'd be pretty simple
Bro018.C.dialogueact473	1204.65	1214.7	C	Professor	s	-1	0	because it 's just {disfmarker} Say , if you had ten {disfmarker} ten events , uh that you were counting , uh each frame would only have a thousand possible values for these ten bits ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact474	1215.53	1222.53	C	Professor	fh|s^rt	-1	0	and uh so you could make a table that would {disfmarker} say , if you had thirty - nine phone categories , that would be a thousand by thirty - nine ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact475	1222.53	1234.69	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and just count the co - occurrences and divide them by the {disfmarker} the uh {disfmarker} uh uh occ uh count the co - occurrences between the event and the phone and divide them by the number of occurrences of the phone ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact476	1234.87	1238.83	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	and that would give you the likelihood of the {disfmarker} of the event given the phone .
Bro018.C.dialogueact477	1239.34	1243.44	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And um then just use that in a very simple HMM
Bro018.C.dialogueact478	1243.71	1251.88	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and uh you could uh do phone recognition then and uh wouldn't have any of the issues of the uh training of the net or {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact479	1251.88	1254.24	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	I mean , it 'd be on the simple side ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact480	1254.24	1254.43	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	but
Bro018.E.dialogueact481	1254.72	1255.05	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact482	1255.24	1256.91	C	Professor	h	-1	0	uh um
Bro018.C.dialogueact483	1259.33	1277.44	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you know , if {disfmarker} uh uh the example I was giving was that if {disfmarker} if you had um onset of voicing and {disfmarker} and end of voicing as being two kinds of events , then if you had those a all marked correctly , and you counted co - occurrences , you should get it completely right .
Bro018.E.dialogueact484	1277.88	1278.17	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact485	1279.28	1279.79	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro018.C.dialogueact486	1280.27	1284.11	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um {disfmarker} But you 'd get all the other distinctions , you know , randomly wrong .
Bro018.C.dialogueact487	1284.21	1285.73	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean there 'd be nothing to tell you that .
Bro018.C.dialogueact488	1285.94	1288.77	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So um {vocalsound} uh
Bro018.C.dialogueact489	1289.58	1301.61	C	Professor	s	-1	0	If you just do this by counting , then you should be able to find out in a pretty straightforward way whether you have a sufficient uh set of events to {disfmarker} to do the kind of level of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of uh classification of phones that you 'd like .
Bro018.C.dialogueact490	1302.89	1304.1	C	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	So that was {disfmarker} that was the idea .
Bro018.C.dialogueact491	1304.1	1309.81	C	Professor	qo^tc	-1	0	And then the other thing that we were discussing was {disfmarker} was um {vocalsound} OK , how do you get the {disfmarker} your training data .
Bro018.E.dialogueact492	1310.22	1310.75	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact493	1311.22	1321.58	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	Cuz uh the {vocalsound} Switchboard transcription project uh uh you know was half a dozen people , or so working off and on over a couple years ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact494	1321.58	1321.67	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	and
Bro018.C.dialogueact495	1323.26	1327.52	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh similar {disfmarker} {vocalsound} similar amount of data {vocalsound} to what you 're talking about with TIMIT training .
Bro018.C.dialogueact496	1327.52	1341.04	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So , it seems to me that the only reasonable starting point is uh to automatically translate the uh current TIMIT markings into the markings you want .
Bro018.C.dialogueact497	1341.75	1351.14	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And uh {vocalsound} it won't have the kind of characteristic that you 'd like , of catching funny kind of things that maybe aren't there from these automatic markings ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact498	1348.72	1349.03	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact499	1351.19	1352.1	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but
Bro018.C.dialogueact500	1352.1	1354.44	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh it 's uh {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact501	1355.04	1356.13	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	It 's probably a good place to start .
Bro018.C.dialogueact502	1356.34	1356.75	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact503	1356.75	1356.98	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact504	1357.34	1358.95	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah and a short {disfmarker} short amount of time ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact505	1358.95	1365.21	C	Professor	s	-1	0	just to {disfmarker} again , just to see if that information is sufficient to uh determine the phones .
Bro018.E.dialogueact506	1359.53	1360.02	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.E.dialogueact507	1365.26	1365.6	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact508	1366.97	1367.34	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro018.E.dialogueact509	1368.13	1377.12	E	PhD	fg|s^cs	-1	0	Yeah , you could even then {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to get an idea about how different it is , you could maybe take some subset and you know , go through a few sentences , mark them by hand
Bro018.E.dialogueact510	1377.12	1381.98	E	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	and then see how different it is from you know , the canonical ones ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact511	1380.93	1381.22	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.E.dialogueact512	1381.98	1386.95	E	PhD	s	-1	0	just to get an idea {disfmarker} a rough idea of h if it really even makes a difference .
Bro018.C.dialogueact513	1386.71	1387.94	C	Professor	s^na	-1	0	You can get a little feeling for it that way ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact515	1387.94	1388.95	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah that is probably right .
Bro018.E.dialogueact514	1387.71	1388.0	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact516	1389.6	1396.74	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean uh my {disfmarker} my guess would be that this is {disfmarker} since TIMIT 's read speech that this would be less of a big deal ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact517	1395.51	1395.99	E	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact518	1396.85	1399.48	C	Professor	s	-1	0	if you went and looked at spontaneous speech it 'd be more {disfmarker} more of one .
Bro018.E.dialogueact519	1398.45	1398.75	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.E.dialogueact520	1399.14	1399.37	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.C.dialogueact521	1400.27	1406.53	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And the other thing would be , say , if you had these ten events , you 'd wanna see , well what if you took two events or four events or ten events or t
Bro018.C.dialogueact522	1406.53	1407.01	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	and you know , and {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact523	1407.08	1414.72	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and hopefully there should be some point at which {vocalsound} having more information doesn't tell you really all that much more about what the phones are .
Bro018.E.dialogueact524	1413.85	1414.45	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.E.dialogueact525	1417.14	1422.86	E	PhD	s.x	-1	0	You could define other events as being sequences of these events too .
Bro018.C.dialogueact526	1425.12	1426.04	C	Professor	fh|s^aap^rt	-1	0	Uh , you could ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact527	1426.04	1433.54	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but the thing is , what he 's talking about here is a uh {disfmarker} a translation to a per - frame feature vector ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact528	1437.54	1440.14	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so there 's no sequence in that ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact529	1440.14	1440.75	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I think .
Bro018.C.dialogueact530	1440.89	1441.84	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I think it 's just a {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact531	1441.19	1444.39	E	PhD	s^arp.%--	-1	0	Unless you did like a second pass over it or something after you 've got your {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact532	1445.11	1447.75	C	Professor	s^aa|s^arp^df.%-	-1	0	Yeah , but we 're just talking about something simple here , yeah , to see if {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact533	1446.55	1446.78	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact534	1446.86	1447.07	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact535	1447.52	1447.65	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact536	1449.41	1450.29	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I 'm adding complexity .
Bro018.C.dialogueact537	1450.61	1450.92	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact538	1451.19	1451.52	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	Just {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact539	1451.77	1461.4	C	Professor	s^f|qo^bs	-1	0	You know . The idea is with a {disfmarker} with a very simple statistical structure , could you {disfmarker} could you uh at least verify that you 've chosen features that {vocalsound} are sufficient .
Bro018.E.dialogueact540	1455.51	1455.8	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact541	1470.04	1473.38	C	Professor	fg|qo^t.%--	-1	0	OK , and you were saying something {disfmarker} starting to say something else about your {disfmarker} your class project , or {disfmarker} ?
Bro018.A.dialogueact542	1472.53	1472.88	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bro018.A.dialogueact543	1473.3	1474.32	A	Grad	h	-1	0	Yeah th Um .
Bro018.C.dialogueact544	1473.78	1474.11	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.A.dialogueact545	1474.39	1481.11	A	Grad	h|s^rt	-1	0	So for my class project I 'm {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I 'm tinkering with uh support vector machines ?
Bro018.A.dialogueact546	1481.21	1482.59	A	Grad	s	-1	0	something that we learned in class ,
Bro018.A.dialogueact547	1482.59	1487.69	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and uh um basically just another method for doing classification .
Bro018.A.dialogueact548	1488.24	1496.13	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And so I 'm gonna apply that to {vocalsound} um compare it with the results by um King and Taylor who did {vocalsound} um these
Bro018.A.dialogueact549	1496.53	1497.32	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	um
Bro018.A.dialogueact550	1497.32	1503.91	A	Grad	s	-1	0	using recurrent neural nets , they recognized {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} a set of phonological features
Bro018.A.dialogueact551	1504.4	1505.16	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	um
Bro018.A.dialogueact552	1505.28	1509.41	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and made a mapping from the MFCC 's to these phonological features ,
Bro018.A.dialogueact553	1509.41	1513.32	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so I 'm gonna {vocalsound} do a similar thing with {disfmarker} {vocalsound} with support vector machines
Bro018.A.dialogueact554	1513.32	1514.29	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and see if {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact555	1514.17	1517.21	E	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	So what 's the advantage of support vector machines ?
Bro018.E.dialogueact556	1517.21	1517.48	E	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	What {disfmarker}
Bro018.A.dialogueact557	1518.08	1524.34	A	Grad	h|s	-1	0	Um . So , support vector machines are {disfmarker} are good with dealing with a less amount of data
Bro018.E.dialogueact558	1524.84	1525.27	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro018.A.dialogueact559	1525.48	1533.24	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and um so if you {disfmarker} if you give it less data it still does a reasonable job {vocalsound} in learning the {disfmarker} the patterns .
Bro018.E.dialogueact560	1533.38	1533.81	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro018.A.dialogueact561	1534.09	1536.93	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um and {vocalsound} um
Bro018.C.dialogueact562	1537.3	1537.66	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I guess it {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact563	1537.66	1537.82	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact564	1537.82	1538.79	C	Professor	s	-1	0	they 're sort of succinct ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact565	1539.08	1541.12	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and they {vocalsound} uh
Bro018.A.dialogueact566	1540.05	1540.28	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact567	1542.56	1546.13	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Does there some kind of a distance metric that they use
Bro018.E.dialogueact568	1546.13	1549.53	E	PhD	qw^g	-1	0	or how do they {disfmarker} for cla what do they do for classification ?
Bro018.A.dialogueact569	1550.08	1550.75	A	Grad	h	-1	0	Um .
Bro018.A.dialogueact570	1550.75	1551.16	A	Grad	h	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.A.dialogueact571	1551.16	1559.91	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So , {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} the simple idea behind a support vector machine is {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} you have {disfmarker} you have this feature space ,
Bro018.A.dialogueact572	1559.91	1560.13	A	Grad	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro018.A.dialogueact574	1560.2	1569.66	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and then it finds the optimal separating plane , um between these two different um classes ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact573	1559.96	1560.34	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.E.dialogueact575	1565.68	1566.15	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.E.dialogueact576	1569.71	1570.06	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.A.dialogueact577	1570.33	1575.37	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um {vocalsound} and so {vocalsound} um ,
Bro018.A.dialogueact578	1575.84	1585.12	A	Grad	s	-1	0	what it {disfmarker} i at the end of the day , what it actually does is {vocalsound} it picks {vocalsound} those examples of the features that are closest to the separating boundary ,
Bro018.A.dialogueact579	1585.4	1586.5	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and remembers those
Bro018.E.dialogueact580	1585.41	1585.73	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.A.dialogueact581	1586.96	1591.56	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and uses them to recreate the boundary for the test set .
Bro018.A.dialogueact582	1592.06	1614.15	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So , given these {vocalsound} um these features , or {disfmarker} or these {disfmarker} these examples , {pause} um , {pause} critical examples , {vocalsound} which they call support f support vectors , {vocalsound} then um {vocalsound} given a new example , {vocalsound} if the new example falls {vocalsound} um away from the boundary in one direction then it 's classified as being a part of this particular class
Bro018.E.dialogueact583	1602.27	1602.6	E	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	Oh .
Bro018.A.dialogueact584	1614.56	1616.73	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and otherwise it 's the other class .
Bro018.E.dialogueact585	1616.74	1618.39	E	PhD	qw	-1	0	So why save the examples ?
Bro018.E.dialogueact586	1618.39	1621.56	E	PhD	qw^g	-1	0	Why not just save what the boundary itself is ?
Bro018.A.dialogueact587	1619.67	1620.12	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.A.dialogueact588	1622.46	1623.83	A	Grad	h	-1	0	Um . Hmm .
Bro018.A.dialogueact589	1624.16	1624.64	A	Grad	h	-1	0	Let 's see .
Bro018.A.dialogueact590	1627.79	1628.47	A	Grad	h	-1	0	Uh .
Bro018.A.dialogueact591	1632.63	1633.55	A	Grad	s^no	-1	0	Yeah , that 's a good question .
Bro018.A.dialogueact592	1633.85	1634.03	A	Grad	%--	-1	0	I {disfmarker}
Bro018.A.dialogueact594	1634.62	1634.79	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact593	1634.19	1635.07	C	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's another way of doing it .
Bro018.C.dialogueact596	1635.61	1637.41	C	Professor	fg|s.%-	-1	0	Right ? So {disfmarker} so it {disfmarker} I mean I {disfmarker} I guess it 's {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact595	1635.55	1635.81	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro018.E.dialogueact597	1637.07	1637.88	E	PhD	s^2	-1	0	Sort of an equivalent .
Bro018.C.dialogueact598	1638.78	1641.6	C	Professor	s	-1	0	You know , it {disfmarker} it goes back to nearest - neighbor {vocalsound} sort of thing ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact599	1641.04	1641.46	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact600	1641.6	1641.92	C	Professor	s	-1	0	right ?
Bro018.C.dialogueact601	1641.91	1644.96	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um , i i if {disfmarker} is it eh w
Bro018.C.dialogueact602	1645.65	1646.9	C	Professor	qw	-1	0	When is nearest - neighbor good ?
Bro018.C.dialogueact603	1646.9	1651.11	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , nearest - neighbor good {disfmarker} is good if you have lots and lots of examples .
Bro018.C.dialogueact604	1651.91	1657.74	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Um but of course if you have lots and lots of examples , then it can take a while to {disfmarker} to use nearest - neighbor .
Bro018.C.dialogueact605	1657.74	1658.64	C	Professor	s	-1	0	There 's lots of look ups .
Bro018.C.dialogueact606	1659.18	1664.63	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So a long time ago people talked about things where you would have uh a condensed nearest - neighbor ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact607	1664.63	1672.97	C	Professor	s	-1	0	where you would {disfmarker} you would {disfmarker} you would pick out uh some representative examples which would uh be sufficient to represent {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to correctly classify everything that came in .
Bro018.E.dialogueact608	1665.78	1666.16	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Oh .
Bro018.E.dialogueact609	1672.6	1673.04	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact610	1673.61	1678.17	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I think s I think support vector stuff sort of goes back to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to that kind of thing .
Bro018.C.dialogueact612	1678.92	1679.22	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Um .
Bro018.E.dialogueact611	1678.53	1679.1	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bro018.E.dialogueact613	1679.95	1685.42	E	PhD	s^bs	-1	0	So rather than doing nearest neighbor where you compare to every single one , you just pick a few critical ones ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact614	1685.42	1685.58	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact615	1686.27	1686.53	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact616	1686.88	1687.25	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact617	1687.45	1688.0	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And th the
Bro018.C.dialogueact618	1688.55	1701.95	C	Professor	s	-1	0	You know , um neural net approach uh or Gaussian mixtures for that matter are sort of {disfmarker} fairly brute force kinds of things , where you sort of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you predefine that there is this big bunch of parameters
Bro018.C.dialogueact619	1702.04	1704.96	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and then you {disfmarker} you place them as you best can to define the boundaries ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact620	1704.96	1708.42	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and in fact , as you know , {vocalsound} these things do take a lot of parameters
Bro018.C.dialogueact621	1708.6	1714.75	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and uh {vocalsound} if you have uh only a modest amount of data , you have trouble {vocalsound} uh learning them .
Bro018.C.dialogueact622	1715.18	1722.48	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um , so I {disfmarker} I guess the idea to this is that it {disfmarker} it is reputed to uh be somewhat better in that regard .
Bro018.E.dialogueact623	1715.52	1715.77	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.A.dialogueact624	1722.52	1722.82	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.A.dialogueact625	1723.07	1732.23	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I it can be a {disfmarker} a reduced um {vocalsound} parameterization of {disfmarker} of the {disfmarker} the model by just keeping {vocalsound} certain selected examples .
Bro018.E.dialogueact626	1732.82	1733.23	E	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro018.A.dialogueact627	1733.39	1733.72	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.A.dialogueact628	1734.24	1734.46	A	Grad	%--	-1	0	So .
Bro018.C.dialogueact629	1734.97	1740.69	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	But I don't know if people have done sort of careful comparisons of this on large tasks or anything .
Bro018.C.dialogueact630	1741.07	1741.81	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Maybe {disfmarker} maybe they have .
Bro018.C.dialogueact631	1742.47	1742.84	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I don't know .
Bro018.A.dialogueact632	1743.15	1744.09	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , I don't know either .
Bro018.C.dialogueact633	1744.41	1744.58	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.B.dialogueact634	1745.38	1749.2	B	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	S do you get some kind of number between zero and one at the output ?
Bro018.A.dialogueact635	1749.82	1753.35	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Actually you don't get a {disfmarker} you don't get a nice number between zero and one .
Bro018.A.dialogueact636	1753.35	1755.29	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	You get {disfmarker} you get either a zero or a one .
Bro018.A.dialogueact637	1756.3	1757.83	A	Grad	h	-1	0	Um , uh
Bro018.A.dialogueact638	1757.83	1758.72	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	there are {disfmarker} there are pap
Bro018.A.dialogueact639	1759.09	1765.2	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , basically , it 's {disfmarker} it 's um {vocalsound} you {disfmarker} you get a distance measure at the end of the day ,
Bro018.A.dialogueact640	1765.55	1770.52	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and then that distance measure is {disfmarker} is um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} is translated to a zero or one .
Bro018.A.dialogueact641	1770.93	1771.64	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro018.C.dialogueact642	1771.77	1775.69	C	Professor	s^bu^ng	-1	0	But that 's looking at it for {disfmarker} for classification {disfmarker} for binary classification ,
Bro018.A.dialogueact643	1774.19	1775.8	A	Grad	s^aa^m	-1	0	That 's for classification ,
Bro018.A.dialogueact646	1775.8	1776.16	A	Grad	b	-1	0	right .
Bro018.C.dialogueact645	1775.69	1776.04	C	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro018.E.dialogueact644	1775.65	1778.81	E	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	And you get that for each class , you get a zero or a one .
Bro018.A.dialogueact647	1779.17	1779.53	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.C.dialogueact648	1779.83	1781.58	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But you have the distances to work with .
Bro018.A.dialogueact649	1781.39	1782.79	A	Grad	s^aa^m	-1	0	You have the distances to work with ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact650	1782.3	1789.94	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Cuz actually Mississippi State people did use support vector machines for uh uh speech recognition and they were using it to estimate probabilities .
Bro018.A.dialogueact651	1782.9	1783.12	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bro018.A.dialogueact652	1785.79	1786.08	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.A.dialogueact653	1789.99	1801.46	A	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , they {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they had a {disfmarker} had a way to translate the distances into {disfmarker} into probabilities with the {disfmarker} with the simple {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} uh sigmoidal function .
Bro018.C.dialogueact654	1801.67	1801.81	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact655	1801.81	1804.29	C	Professor	qr^bu	-1	0	and d did they use sigmoid or a softmax type thing ?
Bro018.A.dialogueact657	1804.53	1806.77	A	Grad	h|s^aa	-1	0	Um {pause} {vocalsound} Yeah ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact656	1804.29	1806.44	C	Professor	qy^bu^g^rt	-1	0	And didn't they like exponentiate or something
Bro018.A.dialogueact659	1806.77	1810.99	A	Grad	s	-1	0	there 's some {disfmarker} there 's like one over one plus the exponential or something like that .
Bro018.C.dialogueact658	1806.44	1808.65	C	Professor	qy^bu^d^g	-1	0	and then {vocalsound} divide by the sum of them ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact660	1808.65	1808.68	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bro018.C.dialogueact661	1809.86	1810.39	C	Professor	s^bk|%--	-1	0	Oh it {disfmarker} i
Bro018.C.dialogueact662	1810.6	1811.66	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , so it is a sigmoidal .
Bro018.A.dialogueact663	1811.69	1811.95	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact664	1811.82	1812.07	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro018.C.dialogueact665	1813.44	1813.67	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Alright .
Bro018.E.dialogueact666	1814.61	1817.54	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Did the {disfmarker} did they get good results with that ?
Bro018.C.dialogueact667	1817.84	1818.71	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	I mean , they 're OK ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact668	1818.71	1821.17	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I don't {disfmarker} I don't think they were earth {disfmarker} earth shattering ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact669	1821.17	1824.68	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but I think that {vocalsound} uh this was a couple years ago ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact670	1821.52	1821.83	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact671	1824.68	1826.07	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I remember them doing it at some meeting ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact672	1826.07	1831.77	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and um I don't think people were very critical because it was interesting just to {disfmarker} to try this
Bro018.C.dialogueact673	1831.77	1833.41	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	and you know , it was the first time they tried it ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact674	1833.41	1836.96	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} so the {disfmarker} you know , the numbers were not incredibly good
Bro018.E.dialogueact675	1833.54	1833.83	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact676	1836.96	1839.54	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but there 's you know , it was th reasonable .
Bro018.E.dialogueact677	1839.77	1840.17	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact678	1840.35	1841.29	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I don't remember anymore .
Bro018.C.dialogueact679	1841.29	1842.75	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I don't even remember what the task was ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact680	1843.07	1845.56	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it {comment} was Broadcast News , or {vocalsound} something .
Bro018.C.dialogueact681	1845.56	1845.86	C	Professor	s^no^r	-1	0	I don't know .
Bro018.E.dialogueact682	1846.07	1846.26	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro018.A.dialogueact683	1847.2	1847.44	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.B.dialogueact684	1847.3	1851.78	B	Grad	qw^t^tc	-1	0	Uh s So Barry , if you just have zero and ones , how are you doing the speech recognition ?
Bro018.A.dialogueact685	1852.21	1852.34	A	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	Oh
Bro018.A.dialogueact686	1852.34	1855.08	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I 'm not do I 'm not planning on doing speech recognition with it .
Bro018.A.dialogueact687	1855.08	1858.32	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I 'm just doing {vocalsound} detection of phonological features .
Bro018.B.dialogueact688	1855.23	1855.45	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh . OK .
Bro018.A.dialogueact689	1858.81	1870.36	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So uh for example , {vocalsound} this {disfmarker} this uh feature set called the uh sound patterns of English {vocalsound} um is just a bunch of {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} binary valued features .
Bro018.A.dialogueact690	1870.73	1873.64	A	Grad	qo	-1	0	Let 's say , is this voicing , or is this not voicing ,
Bro018.A.dialogueact691	1873.64	1876.24	A	Grad	qo	-1	0	is this {vocalsound} sonorants , not sonorants ,
Bro018.A.dialogueact692	1876.24	1877.58	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and {vocalsound} stuff like that .
Bro018.B.dialogueact693	1876.64	1876.94	B	Grad	s^bk^rt	-1	0	OK .
Bro018.A.dialogueact694	1877.58	1877.88	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro018.E.dialogueact695	1877.79	1879.33	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Did you find any more mistakes in their tables ?
Bro018.A.dialogueact696	1879.78	1879.92	A	Grad	s^fe.%	-1	0	Oh !
Bro018.A.dialogueact697	1880.4	1883.09	A	Grad	h|s	-1	0	Uh I haven't gone through the entire table , {pause} yet .
Bro018.A.dialogueact698	1883.09	1883.43	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro018.A.dialogueact699	1883.43	1885.43	A	Grad	s	-1	0	yesterday I brought Chuck {vocalsound} the table
Bro018.A.dialogueact700	1885.43	1893.42	A	Grad	s:qy	-1	0	and I was like , " wait , this {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} Is the mapping from N to {disfmarker} to this phonological feature called um " coronal " ,
Bro018.A.dialogueact701	1893.68	1895.82	A	Grad	s:qy	-1	0	is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} should it be {disfmarker} shouldn't it be a one ?
Bro018.A.dialogueact702	1895.9	1900.75	A	Grad	s:qy	-1	0	or should it {disfmarker} should it be you know coronal instead of not coronal as it was labelled in the paper ? "
Bro018.A.dialogueact703	1901.3	1904.52	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So I ha haven't hunted down all the {disfmarker} all the mistakes yet ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact704	1903.34	1903.67	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro018.A.dialogueact705	1904.52	1904.61	A	Grad	%--	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact706	1906.0	1909.25	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But a as I was saying , people do get probabilities from these things ,
Bro018.B.dialogueact707	1908.45	1908.67	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro018.C.dialogueact708	1909.25	1911.84	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and uh we were just trying to remember how they do ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact709	1911.84	1914.86	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but people have used it for speech recognition , and they have gotten probabilities .

Bro018.A.dialogueact744	1965.91	1966.34	A	Grad	h	-1	0	Right ,
Bro018.A.dialogueact745	1966.48	1981.62	A	Grad	h|s	-1	0	um to come up with a mapping from um MFCC 's or s some feature set , {vocalsound} um to {vocalsound} uh w to whether there 's existence of a particular phonological feature .

Bro018.A.dialogueact750	1984.91	1993.29	A	Grad	s	-1	0	basically it 's to learn a mapping {vocalsound} from {disfmarker} {vocalsound} from the MFCC 's to {vocalsound} uh phonological features .
Bro018.A.dialogueact751	1994.93	1996.11	A	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Is it {disfmarker} did that answer your question ?
Bro018.E.dialogueact752	1996.47	1996.94	E	PhD	s^am	-1	0	I think so .
Bro018.A.dialogueact753	1997.32	1997.56	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .

Bro018.A.dialogueact761	2013.96	2017.55	A	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	I 'm not {disfmarker} I 'm not planning to do any {disfmarker} any phoneme mapping yet .
Bro018.A.dialogueact762	2017.73	2024.43	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Just {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker} it 's basically {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's really simple , basically a detection {vocalsound} of phonological features .
Bro018.E.dialogueact763	2017.76	2018.05	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro018.A.dialogueact765	2025.49	2025.85	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact764	2025.47	2025.9	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bro018.A.dialogueact766	2026.09	2029.44	A	Grad	%--	-1	0	and um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} cuz the uh {disfmarker}
Bro018.A.dialogueact767	2029.8	2034.64	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So King and {disfmarker} and Taylor {vocalsound} um did this with uh recurrent neural nets ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact768	2031.39	2031.59	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.A.dialogueact770	2035.0	2043.01	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and this i their {disfmarker} their idea was to first find {vocalsound} a mapping from MFCC 's to {vocalsound} uh phonological features
Bro018.E.dialogueact769	2034.61	2034.91	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.A.dialogueact771	2043.01	2049.83	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and then later on , once you have these {vocalsound} phonological features , {vocalsound} then uh map that to phones .
Bro018.E.dialogueact772	2047.02	2047.31	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.A.dialogueact773	2050.01	2053.84	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sort of reproducing phase one of their stuff .
Bro018.E.dialogueact774	2050.03	2050.26	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bro018.E.dialogueact775	2052.96	2056.74	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	So they had one recurrent net for each particular feature ?
Bro018.A.dialogueact776	2056.37	2056.99	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.A.dialogueact777	2057.28	2059.13	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Right . Right . Right .
Bro018.E.dialogueact778	2057.38	2057.65	E	PhD	b	-1	0	I see .
Bro018.E.dialogueact779	2060.53	2064.27	E	PhD	qo	-1	0	I wo did they compare that {disfmarker} I mean , what if you just did phone recognition and did the reverse lookup .
Bro018.A.dialogueact780	2066.05	2066.6	A	Grad	h	-1	0	Uh .
Bro018.E.dialogueact781	2066.21	2072.41	E	PhD	s^e	-1	0	So you recognize a phone and which ever phone was recognized , you spit out it 's vector of ones and zeros .
Bro018.A.dialogueact782	2067.8	2069.03	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.A.dialogueact785	2074.03	2074.39	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Uh .
Bro018.C.dialogueact783	2073.88	2074.68	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I expect you could do that .
Bro018.E.dialogueact784	2073.89	2074.16	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I mean uh {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact786	2074.68	2076.48	C	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's probably not what he 's going to do on his class project .
Bro018.C.dialogueact788	2076.48	2076.77	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact787	2076.43	2076.66	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .

Bro018.C.dialogueact790	2079.05	2085.09	C	Professor	qy^rt.%--	+1	1	So um have you had a chance to do this um thing we talked about yet with the uh {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact792	2086.0	2086.62	C	Professor	h	-1	0	um

Bro018.C.dialogueact794	2088.6	2090.4	C	Professor	s^ar|s.%--	-1	0	Uh . No actually I was going a different {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact795	2090.4	2091.35	C	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's a good question , too ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact796	2091.35	2104.24	C	Professor	s	+1	1	but I was gonna ask about the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the um {vocalsound} changes to the data in comparing PLP and mel cepstrum for the SRI system .
Bro018.E.dialogueact797	2105.38	2106.08	E	PhD	h	-1	0	Uh .
Bro018.E.dialogueact798	2107.11	2107.85	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Well what I 've been {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact799	2108.75	2109.7	E	PhD	s^m^t1	-1	0	" Changes to the data " ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact800	2109.7	2110.38	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I 'm not sure I {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact801	2110.36	2110.45	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.C.dialogueact802	2110.76	2115.44	C	Professor	s^rt	+1	1	So we talked on the phone about this , that {disfmarker} that there was still a difference of a {disfmarker} of a few percent
Bro018.E.dialogueact803	2112.42	2112.68	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact804	2114.61	2114.86	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.C.dialogueact805	2115.52	2119.68	C	Professor	s	+1	1	and {vocalsound} you told me that there was a difference in how the normalization was done .
Bro018.C.dialogueact806	2120.14	2128.4	C	Professor	s	+1	1	And I was asking if you were going to do {disfmarker} {vocalsound} redo it uh for PLP with the normalization done as it had been done for the mel cepstrum .
Bro018.E.dialogueact807	2124.3	2124.63	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.E.dialogueact808	2129.03	2130.53	E	PhD	h|s^bk	-1	0	Uh right ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact809	2130.53	2131.94	E	PhD	s^ar|s^df^nd	+1	1	no I haven't had a chance to do that .
Bro018.C.dialogueact811	2132.02	2132.33	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro018.E.dialogueact810	2131.94	2137.5	E	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	What I 've been doing is {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} trying to figure out {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact812	2137.5	2139.92	E	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	it just seems to me like there 's a um {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact813	2140.3	2141.33	E	PhD	s	+1	1	well it seems like there 's a bug ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact814	2141.45	2146.43	E	PhD	s	+1	1	because the difference in performance is {disfmarker} it 's not gigantic
Bro018.E.dialogueact815	2147.01	2149.39	E	PhD	s	+1	1	but it 's big enough that it {disfmarker} it seems wrong .
Bro018.C.dialogueact816	2149.84	2149.95	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact817	2149.95	2150.34	C	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	I agree ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact819	2150.34	2154.62	C	Professor	s^ng^rt	+1	1	but I thought that the normalization difference was one of the possibilities ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact818	2150.16	2150.45	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact820	2153.62	2154.75	E	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah , but I don't {disfmarker} I 'm not {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact821	2154.62	2154.79	C	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro018.E.dialogueact822	2154.94	2155.27	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact823	2155.33	2158.89	E	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	I guess I don't think that the normalization difference is gonna account for everything .
Bro018.C.dialogueact825	2159.67	2159.95	C	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro018.E.dialogueact824	2159.5	2165.16	E	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	So what I was working on is um just going through and checking the headers of the wavefiles ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact826	2165.49	2172.49	E	PhD	s	-1	0	to see if maybe there was a um {disfmarker} a certain type of compression or something that was done that my script wasn't catching .
Bro018.E.dialogueact827	2172.67	2179.4	E	PhD	s	-1	0	So that for some subset of the training data , uh the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the features I was computing were junk .
Bro018.C.dialogueact828	2179.91	2180.25	C	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro018.E.dialogueact829	2180.35	2183.32	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Which would you know cause it to perform OK ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact830	2183.32	2185.17	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but uh , you know , the {disfmarker} the models would be all messed up .
Bro018.E.dialogueact831	2185.17	2192.47	E	PhD	s	-1	0	So I was going through and just double - checking that kind of think first , to see if there was just some kind of obvious bug in the way that I was computing the features .
Bro018.C.dialogueact832	2188.38	2188.7	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact833	2189.31	2189.61	C	Professor	b	-1	0	I see .
Bro018.C.dialogueact834	2192.68	2192.9	C	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro018.E.dialogueact835	2193.11	2198.18	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Looking at all the sampling rates to make sure all the sampling rates were what {disfmarker} eight K , what I was assuming they were ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact836	2196.59	2196.97	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact837	2198.52	2199.07	E	PhD	h	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact838	2199.42	2200.96	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Yeah , that makes sense , to check all that .
Bro018.E.dialogueact839	2200.19	2200.37	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact840	2200.45	2204.78	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So I was doing that first , before I did these other things , just to make sure there wasn't something {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact841	2205.1	2214.36	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Although really , uh uh , a couple three percent uh difference in word error rate uh {comment} could easily come from some difference in normalization , I would think .
Bro018.C.dialogueact842	2215.59	2215.85	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	But
Bro018.E.dialogueact843	2216.06	2216.21	E	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact844	2216.21	2223.81	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and I think , hhh {disfmarker} {comment} I 'm trying to remember but I think I recall that Andreas was saying that he was gonna run sort of the reverse experiment .
Bro018.E.dialogueact845	2224.38	2232.74	E	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	Uh which is to try to emulate the normalization that we did
Bro018.E.dialogueact846	2232.97	2234.4	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but with the mel cepstral features .
Bro018.E.dialogueact847	2235.94	2239.61	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Sort of , you know , back up from the system that he had .
Bro018.E.dialogueact848	2240.15	2241.22	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	I thought he said he was gonna {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact849	2241.22	2243.45	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I have to look back through my {disfmarker} my email from him .
Bro018.C.dialogueact850	2243.41	2245.97	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , he 's probably off at {disfmarker} at uh his meeting now ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact851	2244.89	2245.01	E	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact852	2245.01	2245.72	E	PhD	s^m	-1	0	he 's gone now .
Bro018.C.dialogueact854	2246.24	2246.3	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact853	2246.05	2246.54	E	PhD	fg	-1	0	Um .
Bro018.C.dialogueact855	2247.98	2248.15	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact856	2248.35	2248.52	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	But
Bro018.C.dialogueact857	2248.52	2248.69	C	Professor	b.%	-1	0	yeah
Bro018.E.dialogueact859	2248.69	2248.85	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact858	2248.69	2251.89	C	Professor	s	-1	0	the {disfmarker} I sh think they should be {vocalsound} roughly equivalent ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact860	2251.89	2252.69	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um
Bro018.C.dialogueact861	2253.46	2258.1	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean again the Cambridge folk found the PLP actually to be a little better .
Bro018.C.dialogueact863	2258.24	2260.72	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh So it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} um
Bro018.E.dialogueact862	2258.0	2258.33	E	PhD	s^bk^rt	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.C.dialogueact864	2260.72	2267.49	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean the other thing I wonder about was whether there was something just in the {disfmarker} the bootstrapping of their system which was based on {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact865	2267.66	2268.89	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	but maybe not , since they {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact866	2268.65	2270.84	E	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah see one thing that 's a little bit um {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact867	2271.51	2276.46	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I was looking {disfmarker} I 've been studying and going through the logs for the system that um Andreas created .
Bro018.E.dialogueact868	2277.17	2286.0	E	PhD	s	-1	0	And um his uh {disfmarker} the way that the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {comment} S R I system looks like it works is that it reads the wavefiles directly ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact869	2286.38	2290.77	E	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	uh and does all of the cepstral computation stuff on the fly .
Bro018.C.dialogueact870	2287.02	2287.33	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.C.dialogueact871	2291.01	2291.3	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.E.dialogueact872	2291.61	2299.48	E	PhD	s	-1	0	And , so there 's no place where these {disfmarker} where the cepstral files are stored , anywhere that I can go look at and compare to the PLP ones ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact873	2299.47	2306.08	E	PhD	s	-1	0	so whereas with our features , he 's actually storing the cepstrum on disk , and he reads those in .
Bro018.C.dialogueact874	2304.59	2304.9	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.E.dialogueact875	2306.39	2309.25	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But it looked like he had to give it {disfmarker} uh
Bro018.E.dialogueact876	2309.25	2315.94	E	PhD	s	-1	0	even though the cepstrum is already computed , he has to give it uh a front - end parameter file .
Bro018.E.dialogueact877	2316.02	2323.01	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Which talks about the kind of uh com computation that his mel cepstrum thing does ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact878	2321.96	2322.31	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro018.E.dialogueact879	2323.01	2327.43	E	PhD	s	-1	0	so i I {disfmarker} I don't know if that {disfmarker} it probably doesn't mess it up ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact880	2327.43	2331.83	E	PhD	s	-1	0	it probably just ignores it if it determines that it 's already in the right format or something
Bro018.E.dialogueact881	2331.83	2334.91	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the two processes that happen are a little different .
Bro018.C.dialogueact883	2335.65	2335.86	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact882	2335.48	2336.0	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	So .
Bro018.C.dialogueact884	2336.11	2337.47	C	Professor	s^t^tc	-1	0	So anyway , there 's stuff there to sort out .
Bro018.E.dialogueact885	2337.2	2337.53	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact886	2337.7	2337.91	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact887	2338.67	2339.11	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	So ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact888	2339.11	2339.33	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro018.C.dialogueact889	2339.33	2341.05	C	Professor	s^t^tc	-1	0	Let 's go back to what you thought I was asking you .
Bro018.E.dialogueact890	2341.46	2341.66	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah
Bro018.E.dialogueact891	2341.66	2342.98	E	PhD	s^ar|s^nd	-1	0	no and I didn't have a chance to do that .
Bro018.C.dialogueact892	2343.68	2343.74	C	Professor	s^fe.x	-1	0	Ha !
Bro018.C.dialogueact893	2343.74	2343.8	C	Professor	s^fe.x	-1	0	Oh !
Bro018.C.dialogueact894	2343.8	2345.38	C	Professor	s	-1	0	You had the sa same answer anyway .
Bro018.E.dialogueact895	2345.81	2345.94	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact896	2347.82	2352.29	E	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah . I 've been um , {disfmarker} I 've been working with um Jeremy on his project
Bro018.E.dialogueact897	2352.29	2357.45	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and then I 've been trying to track down this bug in uh the ICSI front - end features .
Bro018.C.dialogueact898	2354.71	2355.14	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro018.E.dialogueact899	2358.15	2363.02	E	PhD	s	-1	0	So one thing that I did notice , yesterday I was studying the um {disfmarker} the uh RASTA code
Bro018.C.dialogueact900	2363.33	2363.67	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro018.E.dialogueact901	2363.63	2372.04	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and it looks like we don't have any way to um control the frequency range that we use in our analysis .
Bro018.E.dialogueact902	2372.04	2378.14	E	PhD	s	-1	0	We basically {disfmarker} it looks to me like we do the FFT , um and then we just take all the bins
Bro018.E.dialogueact903	2378.57	2379.44	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and we use everything .
Bro018.E.dialogueact904	2379.69	2387.01	E	PhD	s:s	-1	0	We don't have any set of parameters where we can say you know , " only process from you know a hundred and ten hertz to thirty - seven - fifty " .
Bro018.C.dialogueact905	2387.91	2388.32	C	Professor	h	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact906	2388.27	2390.11	E	PhD	s^df	-1	0	At least I couldn't see any kind of control for that .
Bro018.C.dialogueact907	2389.51	2390.8	C	Professor	s^bk|s^na	-1	0	Yeah , I don't think it 's in there ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact908	2390.8	2394.97	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I think it 's in the uh uh uh the filters .
Bro018.C.dialogueact909	2395.68	2397.53	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So , the F F T is on everything ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact910	2397.53	2398.67	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but the filters
Bro018.C.dialogueact911	2399.57	2400.24	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact912	2400.29	2407.06	C	Professor	s	-1	0	for instance , ignore the {disfmarker} the lowest bins and the highest bins .
Bro018.C.dialogueact913	2407.95	2409.81	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	And what it does is it {disfmarker} it copies
Bro018.E.dialogueact914	2409.18	2409.94	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	The {disfmarker} the filters ?
Bro018.E.dialogueact915	2409.94	2410.57	E	PhD	qw^g^rt	-1	0	Which filters ?
Bro018.C.dialogueact916	2411.09	2411.33	C	Professor	h	-1	0	um
Bro018.C.dialogueact917	2412.76	2416.8	C	Professor	s	-1	0	The filter bank which is created by integrating over F F T bins .
Bro018.E.dialogueact918	2416.61	2416.99	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact919	2417.67	2418.15	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um
Bro018.E.dialogueact920	2418.2	2420.83	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	When you get the mel {disfmarker} When you go to the mel scale .
Bro018.C.dialogueact921	2420.2	2420.78	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.C.dialogueact922	2420.78	2420.95	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact923	2420.95	2421.77	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it 's bark scale ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact924	2421.77	2431.45	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and it 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it um {disfmarker} it actually copies the uh um {disfmarker} the second filters over to the first .
Bro018.C.dialogueact925	2431.45	2433.01	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So the first filters are always {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact926	2433.01	2439.04	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and you can s you can specify a different number of {vocalsound} uh features {disfmarker} different number of filters ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact927	2439.04	2439.48	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I think ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact928	2439.88	2440.47	C	Professor	s	-1	0	as I recall .
Bro018.C.dialogueact929	2441.66	2449.81	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So you can specify a different number of filters , and whatever {vocalsound} um uh you specify , the last ones are gonna be ignored .
Bro018.C.dialogueact930	2449.81	2454.88	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So that {disfmarker} that 's a way that you sort of change what the {disfmarker} what the bandwidth is .
Bro018.C.dialogueact931	2455.8	2459.51	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Y you can't do it without I think changing the number of filters ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact933	2459.56	2459.8	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact932	2459.54	2465.2	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I saw something about uh {disfmarker} that looked like it was doing something like that , but I didn't quite understand it .
Bro018.E.dialogueact934	2465.2	2465.7	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So maybe {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact935	2465.88	2471.03	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , so the idea is that the very lowest frequencies and {disfmarker} and typically the veriest {comment} highest frequencies are kind of junk .
Bro018.E.dialogueact936	2471.24	2471.56	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro018.C.dialogueact937	2472.73	2474.19	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	And so um
Bro018.C.dialogueact938	2474.24	2480.05	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you just {disfmarker} for continuity you just approximate them by {disfmarker} {vocalsound} by the second to highest and second to lowest .
Bro018.C.dialogueact940	2480.4	2482.27	C	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's just a simple thing we put in .
Bro018.E.dialogueact939	2480.07	2480.5	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact941	2483.66	2484.62	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and so if you h
Bro018.E.dialogueact942	2484.09	2486.44	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	But {disfmarker} so the {disfmarker} but that 's a fixed uh thing ?
Bro018.C.dialogueact944	2486.66	2488.69	C	Professor	s^aa|s^m	-1	0	Yeah , {comment} I think that 's a fixed thing .
Bro018.E.dialogueact943	2486.44	2487.54	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^g.%--	-1	0	There 's nothing that lets you {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact945	2488.69	2490.05	C	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	But see {disfmarker} see my point ?
Bro018.C.dialogueact946	2490.05	2496.27	C	Professor	s	-1	0	If you had {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If you had ten filters , {vocalsound} then you would be throwing away a lot at the two ends .
Bro018.E.dialogueact947	2495.66	2496.0	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact948	2496.99	2500.87	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And if you had {disfmarker} if you had fifty filters , you 'd be throwing away hardly anything .
Bro018.E.dialogueact949	2501.08	2501.53	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact950	2502.15	2508.08	C	Professor	s:s	-1	0	Um , I don't remember there being an independent way of saying " we 're just gonna make them from here to here " .
Bro018.E.dialogueact951	2507.11	2508.97	E	PhD	s^2	-1	0	Use this analysis bandwidth or something .
Bro018.C.dialogueact952	2508.72	2509.64	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	But I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't know ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact953	2509.64	2511.33	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	it 's actually been awhile since I 've looked at it .
Bro018.E.dialogueact954	2510.91	2516.01	E	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , I went through the Feacalc code and then looked at you know just calling the RASTA libs {comment} and thing like that .
Bro018.E.dialogueact955	2516.01	2519.66	E	PhD	s	-1	0	And I didn't {disfmarker} I couldn't see any wh place where that kind of thing was done .
Bro018.E.dialogueact956	2519.85	2522.69	E	PhD	s	-1	0	But um I didn't quite understand everything that I saw ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact957	2522.65	2524.21	C	Professor	fg|s^no	-1	0	Yeah , see I don't know Feacalc at all .
Bro018.E.dialogueact958	2522.69	2522.91	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact959	2524.37	2525.08	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact960	2525.38	2527.37	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But it calls RASTA with some options ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact961	2527.37	2528.34	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	and um
Bro018.E.dialogueact962	2527.46	2527.71	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.C.dialogueact963	2529.75	2530.46	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But I {disfmarker} I think in {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact964	2530.93	2531.53	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I don't know .
Bro018.C.dialogueact965	2531.53	2537.06	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	I guess for some particular database you might find that you could tune that and tweak that to get that a little better ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact966	2537.06	2541.06	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but I think that {vocalsound} in general it 's not that critical .
Bro018.C.dialogueact967	2541.06	2541.74	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean there 's {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact968	2541.55	2541.87	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact969	2542.43	2545.48	C	Professor	s	-1	0	You can {disfmarker} You can throw away stuff below a hundred hertz or so
Bro018.C.dialogueact970	2545.48	2549.73	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and it 's just not going to affect phonetic classification at all .
Bro018.E.dialogueact971	2549.77	2553.53	E	PhD	qy^tc.%--	-1	0	Another thing I was thinking about was um is there a {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact972	2554.99	2563.54	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I was wondering if there 's maybe um {vocalsound} certain settings of the parameters when you compute PLP which would basically cause it to output mel cepstrum .
Bro018.E.dialogueact973	2565.02	2567.64	E	PhD	s	-1	0	So that , in effect , what I could do is use our code
Bro018.E.dialogueact974	2567.64	2568.77	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but produce mel cepstrum
Bro018.E.dialogueact975	2569.67	2571.25	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and compare that directly to {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact976	2572.16	2573.28	C	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	Well , it 's not precisely .
Bro018.C.dialogueact977	2573.87	2574.19	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact979	2574.31	2574.74	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact978	2574.21	2574.6	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact980	2574.93	2577.34	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um , {vocalsound} um
Bro018.C.dialogueact981	2578.33	2592.98	C	Professor	s	-1	0	what you can do is um you can definitely change the {disfmarker} the filter bank from being uh a uh trapezoidal integration to a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a triangular one ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact982	2593.19	2593.55	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact983	2594.05	2597.98	C	Professor	s	-1	0	which is what the typical mel {disfmarker} mel cepstral uh filter bank does .
Bro018.E.dialogueact984	2597.95	2598.4	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact985	2598.94	2601.63	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	And some people have claimed that they got some better performance doing that ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact986	2601.63	2604.01	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so you certainly could do that easily .
Bro018.C.dialogueact987	2604.66	2606.14	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But the fundamental difference ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact988	2606.14	2607.69	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , there 's other small differences {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact989	2606.88	2608.48	E	PhD	s^2^bu	-1	0	There 's a cubic root that happens ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact990	2608.48	2608.71	E	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bro018.C.dialogueact991	2610.14	2610.54	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact992	2610.76	2613.12	C	Professor	s^arp	-1	0	but , you know , as opposed to the log in the other case .
Bro018.C.dialogueact993	2613.12	2627.89	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean {vocalsound} the fundamental d d difference that we 've seen any kind of difference from before , which is actually an advantage for the P L P i uh , I think , is that the {disfmarker} the smoothing at the end is auto - regressive instead of being cepstral {disfmarker} uh , {comment} from cepstral truncation .
Bro018.C.dialogueact994	2629.18	2631.74	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	So um it 's a little more noise robust .
Bro018.E.dialogueact995	2631.93	2632.34	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact996	2633.13	2640.2	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Um , and that 's {disfmarker} that 's why when people started getting databases that had a little more noise in it , like {disfmarker} like uh um Broadcast News and so on ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact997	2640.2	2642.39	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that 's why c Cambridge switched to PLP I think .
Bro018.E.dialogueact998	2642.64	2643.01	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact999	2643.43	2644.51	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So um
Bro018.C.dialogueact1000	2645.94	2650.42	C	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's a difference that I don't {vocalsound} think we put any way to get around ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact1001	2650.42	2651.66	C	Professor	s	-1	0	since it was an advantage .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1003	2652.12	2653.62	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um {vocalsound} uh
Bro018.E.dialogueact1002	2651.98	2652.51	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1004	2653.7	2664.78	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but we did {disfmarker} eh we did hear this comment from people at some point , that {vocalsound} um it uh they got some better results with the triangular filters rather than the trapezoidal .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1005	2664.78	2666.69	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So that is an option in RASTA .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1006	2667.48	2667.74	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1007	2668.25	2670.43	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh and you can certainly play with that .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1008	2670.86	2673.22	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	But I think you 're probably doing the right thing to look for bugs first .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1010	2673.67	2674.28	C	Professor	s^no.%	-1	0	I don't know .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1009	2673.61	2680.07	E	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	Yeah just {disfmarker} it just seems like this kind of behavior could be caused by you know s some of the training data being messed up .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1011	2680.81	2681.1	C	Professor	s^am	-1	0	Could be .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1012	2680.91	2683.65	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	You know , you 're sort of getting most of the way there , but there 's a {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact1013	2684.16	2685.68	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So I started going through and looking {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact1014	2685.91	2697.09	E	PhD	s	-1	0	One of the things that I did notice was that the um log likelihoods coming out of the log recognizer from the PLP data were much lower , much smaller ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact1015	2697.27	2707.07	E	PhD	s	-1	0	than for the mel cepstral stuff , and that the average amount of pruning that was happening was therefore a little bit higher for the PLP features .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1016	2707.22	2707.75	C	Professor	s^fe	-1	0	Oh - huh !
Bro018.E.dialogueact1017	2708.2	2715.16	E	PhD	s	-1	0	So , since he used the same exact pruning thresholds for both , I was wondering if it could be that we 're getting more pruning .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1018	2715.39	2715.96	C	Professor	s^bk^fe	-1	0	Oh !
Bro018.C.dialogueact1019	2716.07	2721.47	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	He {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} {vocalsound} He used the identical pruning thresholds even though the s the range of p of the likeli
Bro018.E.dialogueact1020	2719.01	2719.26	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1021	2721.47	2724.66	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Oh well that 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That 's a pretty good {comment} point right there .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1022	2721.62	2721.86	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1023	2722.71	2722.91	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1024	2724.66	2724.93	C	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1025	2725.01	2725.31	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact1027	2725.9	2733.48	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I would think that you might wanna do something like uh you know , look at a few points to see where you are starting to get significant search errors .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1026	2725.51	2725.88	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact1028	2732.0	2732.54	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact1029	2733.43	2733.63	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1030	2733.83	2739.04	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , what I was gonna do is I was gonna take um a couple of the utterances that he had run through ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact1031	2739.56	2741.52	E	PhD	s	-1	0	then run them through again
Bro018.E.dialogueact1032	2741.52	2745.78	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but modify the pruning threshold and see if it you know , affects the score .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1033	2744.83	2745.04	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1034	2746.72	2746.96	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1036	2747.33	2756.81	C	Professor	s^cs^rt	-1	0	But I mean you could {disfmarker} uh if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if that looks promising you could , you know , r uh run {vocalsound} the overall test set with a {disfmarker} with a few different uh pruning thresholds for both ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact1035	2747.3	2747.53	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	So .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1037	2755.17	2755.61	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1039	2757.38	2763.97	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and presumably he 's running at some pruning threshold that 's {disfmarker} that 's uh , you know {disfmarker} gets very few search errors
Bro018.E.dialogueact1038	2756.94	2757.14	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1040	2763.97	2765.69	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but is {disfmarker} is relatively fast
Bro018.E.dialogueact1041	2764.05	2764.35	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1042	2765.12	2769.42	E	PhD	fg|s^df	-1	0	Right . I mean , yeah , generally in these things you {disfmarker} you turn back pruning really far ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact1043	2765.69	2765.8	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact1044	2769.42	2772.13	E	PhD	s	-1	0	so I {disfmarker} I didn't think it would be that big a deal
Bro018.E.dialogueact1045	2772.13	2775.32	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	because I was figuring well you have it turned back so far that you know it {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact1046	2775.21	2778.09	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	But you may be in the wrong range for the P L P features for some reason .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1047	2776.31	2776.69	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1048	2776.82	2777.03	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1049	2777.69	2777.87	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1050	2778.48	2782.28	E	PhD	s	-1	0	And the uh the {disfmarker} the run time of the recognizer on the PLP features is longer
Bro018.E.dialogueact1051	2782.56	2784.91	E	PhD	s	-1	0	which sort of implies that the networks are bushier ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact1052	2785.05	2786.42	E	PhD	s	-1	0	you know , there 's more things it 's considering
Bro018.E.dialogueact1053	2786.8	2789.32	E	PhD	s	-1	0	which goes along with the fact that the matches aren't as good .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1054	2789.9	2794.25	E	PhD	s	-1	0	So uh , you know , it could be that we 're just pruning too much .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1056	2795.55	2795.91	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1055	2795.42	2795.75	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	So .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1057	2797.3	2799.43	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , maybe just be different kind of distributions
Bro018.C.dialogueact1058	2799.43	2800.12	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and
Bro018.E.dialogueact1059	2799.56	2800.01	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1060	2800.12	2800.33	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah
Bro018.C.dialogueact1061	2800.33	2802.33	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so that 's another possible thing .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1063	2803.01	2804.06	C	Professor	s	-1	0	They {disfmarker} they should {disfmarker} really shouldn't {disfmarker}
Bro018.E.dialogueact1062	2802.68	2803.01	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1064	2804.06	2808.94	C	Professor	s	-1	0	There 's no particular reason why they would be exactly {disfmarker} behave exactly the same .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1065	2808.47	2809.53	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm . Right .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1066	2810.2	2810.38	E	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Right .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1067	2811.16	2811.62	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1068	2811.87	2812.21	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1069	2812.51	2813.73	E	PhD	s	-1	0	There 's lots of little differences .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1071	2813.91	2814.24	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1070	2813.73	2813.95	E	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1072	2814.49	2814.62	E	PhD	x	-1	0	Uh .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1073	2815.54	2815.86	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1074	2816.32	2817.23	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Trying to track it down .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1075	2817.47	2817.69	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1076	2818.21	2820.16	C	Professor	s^ba^t	-1	0	I guess this was a little bit off topic , I guess ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact1078	2820.16	2830.17	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because I was {disfmarker} I was thinking in terms of th this as being a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a core {vocalsound} item that once we {disfmarker} once we had it going we would use for a number of the front - end things also .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1077	2819.91	2820.08	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah
Bro018.C.dialogueact1080	2830.24	2830.53	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1079	2829.93	2830.22	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1081	2833.36	2833.97	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	um
Bro018.C.dialogueact1082	2835.74	2835.97	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	Wanna {disfmarker}
Bro018.B.dialogueact1083	2837.23	2838.79	B	Grad	s^t^tc	+1	1	That 's {disfmarker} as far as my stuff goes ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact1084	2837.66	2838.21	C	Professor	qw^tc.%--	-1	0	What 's {disfmarker} what 's on {disfmarker}
Bro018.B.dialogueact1085	2838.84	2839.07	B	Grad	fg	-1	0	yeah ,
Bro018.B.dialogueact1087	2839.07	2842.13	B	Grad	s	+1	2	well I {vocalsound} tried this mean subtraction method .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1086	2838.88	2839.15	C	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1088	2842.13	2842.45	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1089	2842.45	2846.95	B	Grad	s	+1	2	Due to Avendano , {vocalsound} I 'm taking s um {vocalsound} six seconds of speech ,
Bro018.B.dialogueact1090	2847.13	2852.97	B	Grad	s	+1	1	um {vocalsound} I 'm using two second {vocalsound} FFT analysis frames , {vocalsound} stepped by a half second
Bro018.B.dialogueact1091	2853.34	2854.47	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so it 's a quarter length step
Bro018.B.dialogueact1092	2854.47	2857.91	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I take that frame and four f the four {disfmarker} I take {disfmarker}
Bro018.B.dialogueact1093	2857.91	2858.16	B	Grad	s^fa	-1	0	Sorry ,
Bro018.B.dialogueact1094	2858.16	2862.04	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I take the current frame and the four past frames and the {vocalsound} four future frames
Bro018.B.dialogueact1095	2862.04	2864.32	B	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and that adds up to six seconds of speech .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1096	2864.85	2871.71	B	Grad	s	+1	1	And I calculate um {vocalsound} the spectral mean , {vocalsound} of the log magnitude spectrum {pause} over that N .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1097	2872.13	2877.18	B	Grad	s	+1	1	I use that to normalize the s the current center frame {vocalsound} by mean subtraction .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1098	2877.51	2880.44	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And I then {disfmarker} then I move to the next frame and I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I do it again .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1099	2881.2	2882.74	B	Grad	s^bsc	-1	0	Well , actually I calculate all the means first
Bro018.B.dialogueact1100	2882.74	2883.82	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and then I do the subtraction .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1101	2884.39	2887.17	B	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	And um {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} I tried that with HDK ,

Bro018.B.dialogueact1104	2893.73	2896.17	B	Grad	s.%--	+1	1	um in a phony reverberation case

Bro018.B.dialogueact1106	2907.75	2917.74	B	Grad	s	+1	1	And on meeting rec recorder far mike digits , mike {disfmarker} on channel F , it went from um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} forty - one percent error to eight percent error .

Bro018.C.dialogueact1129	2971.16	2971.58	C	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	Is this {disfmarker}
Bro018.B.dialogueact1130	2972.3	2972.74	B	Grad	h	-1	0	Um .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1131	2973.47	2976.12	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I 'm g I 'm guessing it was the {disfmarker} the training data .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1132	2976.43	2980.38	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Uh , clean TI - digits is , like , pretty pristine {vocalsound} training data ,
Bro018.B.dialogueact1133	2980.38	2984.52	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and if they trained {vocalsound} the SRI system on this TV broadcast type stuff ,
Bro018.B.dialogueact1134	2984.52	2986.32	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I think it 's a much wider range of channels
Bro018.B.dialogueact1135	2986.32	2986.57	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	and it {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact1136	2986.59	2986.76	C	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	No ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact1137	2986.76	2987.27	C	Professor	s^co	-1	0	but wait a minute .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1138	2987.27	2989.61	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I th {disfmarker} I think he {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact1139	2991.31	2992.25	C	Professor	qo^t1	-1	0	What am I saying here ?
Bro018.C.dialogueact1140	2992.32	2992.49	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact1141	2992.49	2993.8	C	Professor	s^t1	-1	0	so that was the SRI system .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1142	2994.26	2994.71	C	Professor	s^am	-1	0	Maybe you 're right .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1143	2994.71	2994.84	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1144	2994.84	2997.95	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Cuz it was getting like one percent {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So it 's still this kind of ratio .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1145	2997.95	3001.3	C	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	It was {disfmarker} it was getting one percent or something on the near field .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1146	3001.3	3001.84	C	Professor	qy^g^rt	-1	0	Wasn't it ?
Bro018.E.dialogueact1147	3002.16	3002.47	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact1148	3002.47	3004.4	E	PhD	s	-1	0	or it wa a it was around one .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1149	3003.49	3003.79	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1150	3003.85	3007.28	C	Professor	fg|s^na	-1	0	Yeah . I think it was getting around one percent for the near {disfmarker} for the n for the close mike .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1151	3004.62	3004.82	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1152	3007.42	3007.66	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Huh ?
Bro018.B.dialogueact1154	3008.19	3008.48	B	Grad	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1153	3008.18	3009.35	C	Professor	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	So it was like one to five {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact1155	3009.35	3010.59	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So it 's still this kind of ratio .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1156	3010.59	3010.94	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	It 's just {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact1157	3011.08	3011.25	C	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact1158	3011.25	3012.25	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it 's a lot more training data .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1159	3013.97	3014.43	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So
Bro018.C.dialogueact1160	3015.57	3021.93	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So probably it should be something we should try then is to {disfmarker} is to see if {disfmarker} is {vocalsound} at some point just to take {disfmarker} i to transform the data
Bro018.C.dialogueact1161	3021.93	3025.91	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and then {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and then uh use th use it for the SRI system .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1162	3031.34	3033.12	B	Grad	qy^d.%-	-1	0	b You me you mean um ta
Bro018.C.dialogueact1163	3032.78	3036.0	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So you 're {disfmarker} so you have a system which for one reason or another is relatively poor ,
Bro018.B.dialogueact1164	3036.2	3036.55	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1165	3036.61	3039.89	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and uh you have something like forty - one percent error
Bro018.C.dialogueact1166	3040.55	3044.34	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh and then you transform it to eight by doing {disfmarker} doing this {disfmarker} this work .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1167	3044.97	3045.46	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1168	3045.81	3048.32	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So here 's this other system , which is a lot better ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact1169	3048.57	3049.96	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but there 's still this kind of ratio .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1170	3049.96	3053.67	C	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's something like five percent error {vocalsound} with the {disfmarker} the distant mike ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact1171	3053.67	3055.55	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and one percent with the close mike .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1172	3055.05	3055.24	B	Grad	b	-1	0	OK .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1173	3056.05	3061.8	C	Professor	qw	-1	0	So the question is {vocalsound} how close to that one can you get {vocalsound} if you transform the data using that system .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1174	3062.46	3067.45	B	Grad	h|s	-1	0	r Right , so {disfmarker} so I guess this SRI system is trained on a lot of s Broadcast News or Switchboard data .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1176	3068.31	3068.62	B	Grad	qy^g^rt	-1	0	Is that right ?
Bro018.C.dialogueact1175	3068.07	3068.29	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1177	3068.62	3069.67	B	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Do you know which one it is ?
Bro018.E.dialogueact1178	3069.54	3071.45	E	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's trained on a lot of different things .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1179	3071.45	3071.97	E	PhD	h	-1	0	Um .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1180	3072.11	3075.39	E	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's trained on uh a lot of Switchboard , Call Home ,
Bro018.B.dialogueact1181	3075.75	3076.34	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1182	3075.86	3078.04	E	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um a bunch of different sources ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact1183	3078.04	3078.78	E	PhD	s	-1	0	some digits ,
Bro018.E.dialogueact1184	3078.88	3080.24	E	PhD	s	-1	0	there 's some digits training in there .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1185	3079.53	3079.85	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bro018.A.dialogueact1187	3080.63	3081.47	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1186	3080.55	3086.97	B	Grad	s	-1	0	O one thing I 'm wondering about is what this mean subtraction method {vocalsound} um will do if it 's faced with additive noise .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1188	3087.72	3093.1	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Cuz I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} it 's cuz I don't know what log magnitude spectral subtraction is gonna do to additive noise .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1189	3093.51	3093.75	C	Professor	s^bk^rt	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro018.B.dialogueact1191	3094.1	3094.7	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker} that 's the {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact1190	3093.75	3095.98	C	Professor	s	-1	0	well , it 's {disfmarker} it 's not exactly the right thing
Bro018.B.dialogueact1192	3095.91	3096.68	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1193	3096.03	3099.84	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but {vocalsound} uh {vocalsound} but you 've already seen that cuz there is added noise here .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1194	3100.8	3102.17	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} Yeah , that 's true .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1196	3103.04	3103.53	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	That 's a good point .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1195	3102.64	3102.92	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1197	3104.39	3105.48	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So um {disfmarker}
Bro018.B.dialogueact1198	3107.52	3112.62	B	Grad	s^bk^rt|s^bu	-1	0	OK , so it 's then {disfmarker} then it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's reasonable to expect it would be helpful if we used it with the SRI system
Bro018.B.dialogueact1199	3112.62	3112.76	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	and
Bro018.C.dialogueact1200	3113.44	3113.62	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact1201	3113.62	3114.76	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , as helpful {disfmarker}
Bro018.C.dialogueact1202	3114.76	3114.97	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	I mean ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact1203	3115.03	3115.74	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so that 's the question .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1204	3116.16	3122.41	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , w we 're often asked this when we work with a system that {disfmarker} that isn't {disfmarker} isn't sort of industry {disfmarker} industry standard great ,
Bro018.B.dialogueact1205	3122.2	3122.48	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1206	3123.1	3126.07	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh and we see some reduction in error using some clever method ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact1207	3126.17	3129.39	C	Professor	qy	-1	0	then , you know , will it work on a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} on a {disfmarker} on a good system .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1208	3129.39	3131.38	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So uh
Bro018.C.dialogueact1209	3132.2	3133.84	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	you know , this other one 's {disfmarker} it was a pretty good system .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1210	3133.84	3141.15	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	I think , you know , one {disfmarker} one percent word error rate on digits is {disfmarker} uh digit strings is not {vocalsound} uh you know stellar ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact1211	3141.15	3145.64	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but given that this is real {vocalsound} digits , as opposed to uh sort of laboratory {disfmarker}
Bro018.B.dialogueact1212	3143.11	3143.28	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1213	3146.27	3146.57	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	Well .
Bro018.E.dialogueact1214	3146.32	3147.97	E	PhD	s	-1	0	And it wasn't trained on this task either .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1215	3147.79	3149.1	C	Professor	s^bk^m	-1	0	And it wasn't trained on this task .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1216	3149.1	3151.35	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Actually one percent is sort of {disfmarker} you know , sort of in a reasonable range .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1218	3151.42	3151.79	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1217	3151.35	3153.39	C	Professor	s	-1	0	People would say " yeah , I could {disfmarker} I can imagine getting that " .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1219	3154.16	3158.72	C	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	And uh so the {disfmarker} the four or five percent or something is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is quite poor .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1220	3158.76	3159.42	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1221	3159.5	3165.94	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	Uh , you know , if you 're doing a uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a sixteen digit uh credit card number you 'll basically get it wrong almost all the time .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1223	3166.07	3166.34	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1222	3165.94	3168.69	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So . So . Uh , {vocalsound} um
Bro018.C.dialogueact1224	3168.83	3171.21	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	a significant reduction in the error for that would be great .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1225	3171.52	3172.01	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Huh , OK .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1226	3171.65	3173.29	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and then , uh
Bro018.C.dialogueact1227	3173.29	3173.46	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1228	3173.64	3173.94	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1229	3174.87	3175.11	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1230	3175.79	3176.03	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Cool .
Bro018.B.dialogueact1231	3176.37	3176.81	B	Grad	s^ba^rt^tc	-1	0	Sounds good .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1232	3177.09	3177.29	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1233	3178.6	3181.38	C	Professor	s^bk|s^t	-1	0	Alright , um , I actually have to run .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1234	3181.71	3183.56	C	Professor	s^t	-1	0	So I don't think I can do the digits ,
Bro018.C.dialogueact1235	3183.56	3186.48	C	Professor	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	but um , {vocalsound} I guess I 'll leave my microphone on ?
Bro018.E.dialogueact1236	3187.5	3187.98	E	PhD	h|s^aa	-1	0	Uh , yeah .
Bro018.C.dialogueact1237	3188.32	3188.5	C	Professor	s^bk^m	-1	0	Yeah .
