In order for the digit recognition results to be more reliably comparable , it was suggested that the TI digit corpus is tested on SRI as well.
Additionally , results are going to be checked by examining the signal from different microphones.
Some modifications to the TI corpus may be needed to further consolidate this juxtaposition.
The ultimate purpose is to create a system that can be fed different features and will substitute HTK.
As regards the forced alignments , word-level alignments that have already been checked in Waves could be merged with transcripts and utterance-level representations produced in Transcriber , as both packages can use the CTM format.
More measurements and correspondence with data from other corpora ( CallHome , Switchboard ) are going to be carried out with respect to backchanneling and overlaps.
The intention is to write a paper with the results of this task.
Towards the end of the meeting the group discussed possible agenda topics for big meeting scheduled for the following Saturday.
