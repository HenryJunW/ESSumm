For next weeks meeting , speaker me018 will provide numbers on his experiments into adjusting insertion penalties.
Speaker me013 feels that mn007 and fn002 should just put together the coherent bare-bones of their report , and move back to experimenting , leaving the report for the end of the project.
He also feels that they should discuss some aspects of future work , for clarity's sake , with the visitor from OGI.
