Speaker me018 has done a little initial research into the next area he is to look at , adjusting the scaling and the insertion penalties.
Playing with the latter made little difference , though was coming from a different feature set.
Speakers mn007 and fn002 have been working on their report , logically writing up everything they have done so far.
Mn007 has also been working with a new dataset , preparing it for use as a more realistic source of noise , though it is not clear if this is allowed.
Speaker me006 has continued to look at phonetic events , and has come up with a plan for his future work.
