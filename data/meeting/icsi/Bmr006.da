Bmr006.B.dialogueact1	1.629	1.889	B	Grad	z	-1	0	OK ,
Bmr006.F.dialogueact0	1.296	2.126	F	PhD	z	-1	0	That 's looks strange .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact3	1.889	3.719	B	Grad	z	-1	0	now we 're on and it seems to be working .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact2	1.808	2.838	E	Postdoc	z	-1	0	Oh there we go .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact4	3.123	4.933	C	PhD	z	-1	0	One two three four five six
Bmr006.A.dialogueact6	5.989	6.609	A	PhD	z	-1	0	That is weird .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact5	5.631	6.381	E	Postdoc	z	-1	0	This looks good .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact7	6.829	8.959	A	PhD	z	-1	0	It 's like when it 's been sitting for a long time or something .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact8	6.857	7.407	B	Grad	z	-1	0	So , I mean {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact9	9.67	10.39	B	Grad	z	-1	0	I don't know what it is .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact10	10.39	17.5	B	Grad	z	-1	0	But all {disfmarker} all I know is that it seems like every time I am up here after a meeting , and I start it , it works fine .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact11	18.54	22.94	B	Grad	z	-1	0	And if I 'm up here and I start it and we 're all sitting here waiting to have a meeting , it gives me that error message
Bmr006.B.dialogueact12	22.94	29.15	B	Grad	z	-1	0	and I have not yet sat down with {disfmarker} been able to get that error message in a point where I can sit down and find out where it 's occurring in the code .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact13	28.133	29.593	A	PhD	z	-1	0	Next time you get it maybe we should write it down .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact14	29.958	30.698	B	Grad	z	-1	0	Yep , we will .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact17	31.374	32.304	B	Grad	z	-1	0	One of these days .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact15	31.049	31.299	D	Professor	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact16	31.097	32.077	E	Postdoc	z	-1	0	Was it a pause , or {disfmarker} ?
Bmr006.E.dialogueact18	32.247	32.477	E	Postdoc	z	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact19	32.477	33.627	E	Postdoc	z	-1	0	Was it on " pause " or something ?
Bmr006.B.dialogueact20	33.94	34.08	B	Grad	z	-1	0	No .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact21	34.247	34.457	E	Postdoc	z	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact22	35.274	35.584	E	Postdoc	z	-1	0	Don't know .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact23	36.31	44.64	D	Professor	fg|s^t^tc	-1	0	So uh {disfmarker} so the uh , the new procedural change that just got suggested , which I think is a good idea is that um , we do the digit recordings at the end .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact24	45.3	55.07	D	Professor	s	-1	0	And that way , if we 're recording somebody else 's uh meeting , and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and don't have the time , uh , then they can run off .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact25	55.58	58.27	D	Professor	s	-1	0	It 'll mean we 'll get somewhat fewer uh , sets of digits ,
Bmr006.D.dialogueact26	58.27	65.5	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	but um , I think that way we 'll cut into people 's time , um , if someone 's on strict time uh , less .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact27	66.443	68.583	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	So , I th I think {disfmarker} I think we should start doing that .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact28	70.2	78.83	D	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	Um , so , uh , let 's see , we were having a discussion the other day , maybe we should bring that up , about uh , the nature of the data that we are collecting .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact29	79.758	89.739	D	Professor	fh|s.%--	+1	0	uh @ @ that uh , we should have a fair amount of data that is um , collected for the same meeting , so that we can ,
Bmr006.D.dialogueact30	90.349	90.799	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact31	90.799	91.199	D	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I don't know .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact32	91.529	93.429	D	Professor	qw^rt	-1	0	Wh - what {disfmarker} what were some of the points again about that ?
Bmr006.D.dialogueact33	93.999	94.199	D	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	Is it {disfmarker}
Bmr006.F.dialogueact34	95.79	97.39	F	PhD	h|s	-1	0	Uh , well , OK , I 'll back up .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact36	97.713	98.003	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact35	97.7	104.83	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Um , at the previous {disfmarker} at last week 's meeting , this meeting I was griping {vocalsound} about wanting to get more data
Bmr006.F.dialogueact37	104.83	108.48	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and I {disfmarker} I talked about this with Jane and Adam ,
Bmr006.F.dialogueact38	108.68	119.2	F	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	um , and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on this data um , since we 'll have a new {disfmarker} this new student di does wanna work with us ,
Bmr006.A.dialogueact40	119.494	119.984	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Well , great .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact39	119.2	120.91	F	PhD	s	-1	0	th the guy that was at the last meeting .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact41	121.17	121.51	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Great .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact42	121.392	122.712	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And he 's already funded part - time ,
Bmr006.F.dialogueact43	122.712	125.942	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so we 'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part - time ,
Bmr006.A.dialogueact44	126.58	126.95	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	What a deal .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact45	126.72	127.82	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	uh {disfmarker} Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact46	127.927	129.417	B	Grad	qw^rt	-1	0	And what 's he interested in , specifically ?
Bmr006.F.dialogueact47	128.11	128.52	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	So
Bmr006.F.dialogueact48	129.473	131.573	F	PhD	s	+1	0	he 's {disfmarker} comes from a signal - processing background ,
Bmr006.F.dialogueact49	131.573	132.743	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but I liked him a lot
Bmr006.F.dialogueact50	132.743	140.6	F	PhD	s	+1	0	cuz he 's very interested in higher level things , like language , and disfluencies and all kinds of eb maybe prosody ,
Bmr006.B.dialogueact51	138.689	139.229	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact53	140.994	141.534	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Great .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact52	140.6	142.19	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so he 's just getting his feet wet in that .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact54	142.57	150.62	F	PhD	fh|s^cs^rt	-1	0	Anyway , I thought OK , maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts {disfmarker} he 'd be starting in January , next semester that we 'd have , you know , enough data to work with .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact55	150.987	151.177	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact56	151.78	166.53	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	But , um , Jane and Adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to Berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want , and so forth .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact57	167.04	170.12	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	So , I thought about that and I think it 's still possible ,
Bmr006.F.dialogueact58	170.28	180.83	F	PhD	fh|s^cs	+1	3	um , but I 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one {disfmarker} one - time {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact59	179.95	180.38	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	One offs ?
Bmr006.F.dialogueact60	181.238	185.26	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Yeah , just because it would be very hard to process the data in all senses ,
Bmr006.F.dialogueact61	185.26	194.88	F	PhD	s	-1	0	both to get the , um {disfmarker} to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it , like well , I was talking to Morgan about
Bmr006.F.dialogueact62	195.26	197.38	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	things like summarization , or what 's this meeting about .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact63	197.93	204.978	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	I mean it 's very different if you have a group that 's just giving a report on what they did that week , versus coming to a decision and so forth .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact64	204.978	226.63	F	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	So . Then I was um , talking to Morgan about some {pause} new proposed work in this area , sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on where I was thinking of doing some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues in both the utterances and in the utterance patterns ,
Bmr006.F.dialogueact65	226.69	229.3	F	PhD	s^e	+1	0	like in numbers of overlaps and amount of speech ,
Bmr006.F.dialogueact66	229.72	244.754	F	PhD	s	+1	1	sort of raw cues from the interaction that can be measured from the signals and from the diff different microphones that point to sort of hot spots in the meeting , or things where stuff is going on that might be important for someone who didn't attend to {pause} listen to .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact67	245.86	257.16	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	2	And in that uh , regard , I thought we definitely w will need {disfmarker} it 'd b it 'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data from a few different domains , or a few different kinds of meetings .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact68	257.16	258.79	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So this {disfmarker} this meeting is one of them ,
Bmr006.F.dialogueact69	258.79	261.17	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	although I 'm not sure I can participate if I {disfmarker}
Bmr006.F.dialogueact70	262.08	267.21	F	PhD	s	-1	0	You know , I would feel very strange being part of a meeting that you were then analysing later for things like summarization .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact71	266.293	266.813	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact72	267.977	271.087	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	Um , and then there are some others that menti that Morgan mentioned ,
Bmr006.F.dialogueact73	271.087	274.907	F	PhD	s^e^rt	+1	0	like the front - end meeting {pause} and maybe a networking {pause} group meeting .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact74	272.521	272.821	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact75	274.29	274.42	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact76	275.23	277.93	B	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , we 're {disfmarker} we 're hoping that they 'll let us start recording regularly .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact77	275.23	280.547	F	PhD	s	+1	0	So {disfmarker} So if that were the case then I think we 'd have enough .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact78	278.2	278.33	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact79	280.737	281.277	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact80	280.947	298.06	F	PhD	s	-1	0	But basically , for anything where you 're trying to get a summarization of some kind of meeting {disfmarker} {comment} {pause} meaning out of the meeting , um , it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings where we didn't really have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize ,
Bmr006.B.dialogueact81	295.917	296.187	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact82	298.06	303.73	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	but {disfmarker} rather we should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact83	304.65	308.48	F	PhD	s^co	-1	0	And then we need a couple that {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} {pause} We don't wanna just have one group
Bmr006.F.dialogueact84	308.48	313.793	F	PhD	s^co^e	-1	0	because that might be specific to that particular group , but @ @ three or four different kinds .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact86	312.57	317.69	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and the morning meeting .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact85	312.56	313.31	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	S So {disfmarker}
Bmr006.C.dialogueact88	318.399	318.839	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact87	317.902	321.542	F	PhD	s	-1	0	See , I 've never listened to the data for the front - end {pause} meeting .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact90	320.96	322.39	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , we {disfmarker} we 've only had three .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact89	320.806	321.086	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact91	322.49	322.72	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact92	322.512	322.932	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact93	323.81	324.79	F	PhD	s	-1	0	But maybe that 's enough .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact94	324.79	326.96	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So , in general , I was thinking more data
Bmr006.F.dialogueact95	326.96	332.546	F	PhD	s	+1	1	but also data where we hold some parameters constant or fairly similar ,
Bmr006.B.dialogueact97	332.593	333.083	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact96	332.546	339.69	F	PhD	s^e	+1	0	like a meeting about of people doing a certain kind of work where at least half the participants each time are the same .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact98	340.439	340.699	B	Grad	fg	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact99	340.58	342.94	D	Professor	fg|s^na	-1	0	Now , let {disfmarker} l l let me just give you the other side to that
Bmr006.D.dialogueact100	342.94	345.31	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	cuz I ca because I {disfmarker} I don't disagree with that ,
Bmr006.D.dialogueact101	345.66	347.62	D	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	but I think there is a complimentary piece to it too .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact102	348.28	355.71	D	Professor	fh|s^nd	+1	1	Uh , for other kinds of research , particularly the acoustic oriented research , I actually feel the opposite need .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact103	356.27	357.9	D	Professor	s^cs^nd	-1	0	I 'd like to have lots of different people .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact104	356.44	356.86	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact105	358.205	358.545	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact106	358.79	366.083	D	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	As many people here a a and talking about the kind of thing that you were just talking about it would have uh too few people from my point of view .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact107	366.083	367.563	D	Professor	s^cs^nd	+1	2	I 'd like to have many different speakers .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact108	368.32	378.0	D	Professor	fh|s.%--	+1	2	So , um I think I would also very much like us to have a fair amount of really random scattered meetings , of somebody coming down from campus , and {disfmarker} and uh ,
Bmr006.C.dialogueact109	375.769	376.549	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact110	378.0	380.35	D	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , sure , if we can get more from them , fine ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact111	378.17	378.76	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact112	378.952	379.412	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact113	380.35	388.3	D	Professor	s	+1	0	but if we only get one or two from each group , that still could be useful acoustically just because we 'd have close and distant microphones with different people .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact114	384.78	386.19	F	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yeah , I definitely agree with that .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact115	385.991	386.771	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact116	386.333	386.773	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact117	386.65	387.07	F	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	Definitely .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact118	388.416	388.976	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact119	388.721	395.811	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Can I {disfmarker} can I say about that {disfmarker} that the {disfmarker} the issues that I think Adam and I raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact120	396.49	397.95	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	Because I think if you just say {disfmarker}
Bmr006.E.dialogueact121	397.95	409.57	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	an And in particular , my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because there you 'd have so people who 'd have proficiency enough in English that {disfmarker} that uh , it would be useful for {disfmarker} for purposes {disfmarker} You know .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact122	403.462	403.802	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact123	409.84	414.59	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But you know , I think I 've been {disfmarker} I 've I {disfmarker} I 've gathered data from undergrads at {disfmarker} on campus
Bmr006.E.dialogueact124	414.59	424.369	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and if you just post randomly to undergrads I think you 'd get such a mixed bag that it would be hard to know how much conversation you 'd have at all . And {disfmarker} and the English you 'd have {disfmarker} The language models would be really hard to build
Bmr006.D.dialogueact125	420.942	421.822	D	Professor	fg|s.%-	-1	0	Well , you want to i
Bmr006.E.dialogueact126	424.369	427.749	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	because it would not really be {disfmarker} it would be an interlanguage rather than {pause} than a {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact127	427.248	433.11	D	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Well , OK , uh , first place , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I don't think we 'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another ,
Bmr006.D.dialogueact129	433.11	438.4	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	I think there should be a meeting that has some goal and point cuz I {disfmarker} I think that 's what we 're investigating ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact128	432.909	433.229	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact130	437.74	442.53	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	It has to be a {disfmarker} a pre - existing meeting , {pause} like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact131	438.4	438.73	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	so
Bmr006.B.dialogueact133	440.466	440.716	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact132	440.006	441.494	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .

Bmr006.D.dialogueact135	442.046	457.04	D	Professor	fg|s^cs	+1	1	So I was {disfmarker} I was thinking more in terms of talking to professors uh , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and uh , senior uh , uh , d and uh , doctoral students who are leading projects and offering to them that they have their {disfmarker} hold their meeting down here .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact137	442.53	444.78	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	That 's I think what we {disfmarker} and I agree with .

Bmr006.D.dialogueact142	457.52	458.44	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh , that 's the first point .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact143	458.44	459.78	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	The second point is
Bmr006.D.dialogueact144	460.4	460.72	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	um
Bmr006.D.dialogueact145	461.51	471.512	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	I think that for some time now , going back through BeRP I think that we have had speakers that we 've worked with who had non - native accents and I th I think that {disfmarker}
Bmr006.E.dialogueact146	469.413	470.543	E	Postdoc	fg|s^ng	-1	0	Oh , oh . I 'm not saying accents .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact147	471.348	472.478	E	Postdoc	s^nd	-1	0	u The accent 's not the problem .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact148	472.632	473.072	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact149	473.191	475.191	E	Postdoc	s^ar|s	-1	0	No , it 's more a matter of uh , proficiency ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact150	475.191	477.141	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	e e just simply fluency .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact152	477.756	478.106	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact151	477.371	489.55	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean , I deal with people on {disfmarker} on campus who {disfmarker} I think sometimes people , undergraduates um in computer science uh , have language skills that make , you know {disfmarker} that their {disfmarker} their fluency and writing skills are not so strong .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact153	488.601	488.721	D	Professor	s^fe	-1	0	Oh !
Bmr006.D.dialogueact154	488.721	490.561	D	Professor	s	-1	0	You 're not talking about foreign language at all .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact155	490.203	491.603	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Yeah . Yeah , just talking about .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact156	490.561	491.491	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	You 're just talking about {disfmarker}
Bmr006.E.dialogueact157	492.663	494.773	E	Postdoc	fg|s.%--	-1	0	Well , e I just think ,
Bmr006.B.dialogueact158	493.288	494.248	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	We all had the same thought .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact159	494.773	497.98	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but you know , it 's like when you get into the graduate level , uh , no problem .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact160	498.08	499.09	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	I mean , I 'm not saying accents .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact161	498.622	499.462	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact162	498.763	500.083	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah , then we 're completely gone .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact163	499.09	500.95	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	I 'm say I 'm saying fluency .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact165	500.264	500.994	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact164	500.133	504.64	D	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The {disfmarker} the habits are already burnt in .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact166	501.18	501.87	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Well , yeah .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact167	502.96	503.89	E	Postdoc	s^df^r	-1	0	I 'm just saying fluency .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact168	504.78	504.95	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact169	505.31	511.42	B	Grad	s^cs	+1	1	Well , I think that , um {disfmarker} I think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact171	512.725	523.758	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and I think if it 's a pre - existing meeting and it 's held in English , {comment} I {disfmarker} I think it 's probably OK if a few of the people don't have uh , g particularly good English skills .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact170	512.36	512.57	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact172	523.556	527.446	E	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	OK , now can I {disfmarker} can I say the other aspect of this from my perspective
Bmr006.E.dialogueact173	527.446	533.204	E	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	which is that um , there 's {disfmarker} there 's this {disfmarker} this issue , you have a corpus out there , it should be used for {disfmarker} for multiple things
Bmr006.E.dialogueact174	533.204	534.744	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	cuz it 's so expensive to put together .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact175	534.718	534.998	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact176	534.88	535.15	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact177	535.287	537.297	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And if people want to approach {disfmarker}
Bmr006.E.dialogueact178	537.696	538.056	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	Um ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact179	538.056	540.316	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	i so I know {pause} e e {pause} You know this {disfmarker}
Bmr006.E.dialogueact180	540.316	545.716	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	The idea of computational linguistics and probabilistic grammars and all may not be the focus of this group ,
Bmr006.D.dialogueact181	546.163	546.533	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact182	546.23	558.2	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but the idea of language models , which are fund you know generally speaking uh , you know , t t terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent or an hour invested in preparing the data ,
Bmr006.D.dialogueact183	555.626	555.976	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact184	557.183	557.833	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact185	558.806	570.56	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	if you have a choice between people who are pr more proficient in {disfmarker} {nonvocalsound} um , i more fluent , more {disfmarker} more close to being academic English , then it would seem to me to be a good thing .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact186	571.55	572.83	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	I guess {disfmarker} I maybe {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact187	573.3	573.53	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact189	573.53	574.11	D	Professor	%	-1	0	I
Bmr006.E.dialogueact188	573.43	575.63	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	Because otherwise y you don't have the ability to have {disfmarker}
Bmr006.E.dialogueact190	576.129	579.329	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Uh , so if {disfmarker} if you have a bunch of idiolects that 's the worst possible case .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact191	579.329	592.7	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	If you have people who are using English as a {disfmarker} as an interlanguage because they {disfmarker} they don't {disfmarker} uh , they can't speak in their native languages and {disfmarker} but their interlanguage isn't really a match to any existing , uh , language model ,
Bmr006.D.dialogueact192	587.345	587.765	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact193	593.303	594.603	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	this is the worst case scenario .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact194	594.108	594.188	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact195	594.188	594.248	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact196	594.663	597.473	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , that 's pretty much what you 're going to have in the networking group .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact197	595.293	595.553	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact198	598.419	598.709	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact199	598.463	602.513	D	Professor	s	-1	0	because {disfmarker} because they {disfmarker} most {disfmarker} the network group is almost entirely Germans and Spaniards .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact200	599.38	599.62	E	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	Well
Bmr006.E.dialogueact201	601.998	602.218	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact202	602.743	608.123	E	Postdoc	s^df.%--	-1	0	But the thing is , I think that these people are of high enough level in their {disfmarker} in their language proficiency that {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact203	607.914	608.204	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	I see .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact204	608.383	609.753	E	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	And I 'm not objecting to accents .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact206	610.088	610.538	D	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact205	609.753	620.867	E	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm just thinking that we have to think at a {disfmarker} at a higher level view , could we have a language model , a {disfmarker} a grammar {disfmarker} a grammar , basically , that um , wo would be a {disfmarker} a possibility .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact207	617.342	617.712	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact208	620.867	633.001	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So y so if you wanted to bring in a model like Dan Jurafsky 's model , an and do some top - down stuff , it {disfmarker} to help th the bottom - up and merge the things or whatever , uh , it seems like um , I don't see that there 's an argument {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact209	627.473	627.983	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact210	633.151	647.83	E	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	0	I 'm {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} what I think is that why not have the corpus , since it 's so expensive to put together , uh , useful for the widest range of {disfmarker} of central corp things that people generally use corpora for and which are , you know , used in computational linguistics .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact211	634.589	635.099	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact212	648.05	651.47	E	Postdoc	s^bs	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker} that 's my point . Which {disfmarker} which includes both top - down and bottom - up .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact214	649.192	650.332	C	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's difficult .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact213	649.191	649.511	D	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact215	652.07	652.71	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact216	652.48	654.76	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	OK , well , i i let 's {disfmarker} let 's see what we can get .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact217	654.87	667.02	D	Professor	s	+1	1	I mean , it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} I think that if we 're aiming at {disfmarker} at uh , groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together , and it 's from the Berkeley campus , probably most of it will be OK ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact218	660.01	661.68	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yes , that 's fine .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact219	662.09	662.58	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	That 's fine .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact220	666.13	666.49	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact221	666.49	671.36	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	And my point in m in my note to Liz was I think that undergrads are an iff iffy population .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact222	667.02	667.27	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact223	667.56	667.93	D	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact225	671.333	671.763	D	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact224	670.891	673.591	F	PhD	s^na	-1	0	I definitely agree with that , I mean , for this purpose .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact226	672.671	672.941	D	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact229	673.588	681.22	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Well , not to mention the fact that I would be hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen , probably even an anyone under twenty - one .

Bmr006.B.dialogueact233	683.26	683.67	B	Grad	qw^br^rt	-1	0	What 's that ?
Bmr006.B.dialogueact235	684.267	687.057	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Well , age - ist . {comment} The " eighteen " is because of the consent form .

Bmr006.C.dialogueact237	687.183	687.313	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact236	686.804	688.151	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right , Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact238	687.753	689.983	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	We 'd hafta get {disfmarker} find their parent to sign for them .

Bmr006.C.dialogueact240	689.499	690.949	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact241	690.158	690.598	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact242	690.188	690.768	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , that 's true .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact243	690.897	691.187	B	Grad	b	-1	0	So .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact244	691.567	693.997	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I have a {disfmarker} uh , um , question .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact245	693.997	705.797	F	PhD	s.%-	+1	0	Well , Morgan , you were mentioning that Mari may not use the k equipment from IBM if they found something else , cuz there 's a {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact246	701.39	708.52	D	Professor	s	-1	0	They 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} yeah , they 're d they 're uh {disfmarker} assessing whether they should do that or y do something else , hopefully over the next few weeks .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact247	708.425	717.0	F	PhD	qy^cs	+1	0	Cuz I mean , one remote possibility is that if we st if we inherited that equipment , if she weren't using it , could we set up a room in the linguistics department ?
Bmr006.F.dialogueact248	717.59	728.212	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	And {disfmarker} and I mean , there {disfmarker} there may be a lot more {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or in psych , or in comp wherever , in another building where we could um , record people there .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact249	728.212	729.422	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I think we 'd have a better chance
Bmr006.B.dialogueact250	729.86	733.59	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	I think we 'd need a real motivated partner to do that .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact252	733.66	735.96	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	We 'd need to find someone on campus who was interested in this .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact251	733.345	733.785	F	PhD	s^f	-1	0	Right ,
Bmr006.F.dialogueact253	733.985	734.285	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bmr006.F.dialogueact254	735.018	735.408	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact255	736.61	737.62	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But if there were such a {disfmarker}
Bmr006.F.dialogueact256	737.8	745.7	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	I mean it 's a remote possibility , then um , you know , one of us could you know , go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact257	743.491	743.691	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact258	745.7	750.443	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So it 's just a just a thought if they end up not using the {disfmarker} the hardware .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact259	746.73	755.094	D	Professor	fg|s	+1	0	Well , the other thing {disfmarker} Yeah , I mean the other thing that I was hoping to do in the first place was to turn it into some kind of portable thing so you could wheel it around .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact260	753.698	753.978	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact261	755.464	755.734	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact262	756.875	759.19	D	Professor	fh|s.%-	-1	0	But . Um , and {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact263	758.81	762.32	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , I know that space is really scarce on {disfmarker} at least in CS .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact265	762.97	766.4	B	Grad	s	-1	0	You know , to {disfmarker} to actually find a room that we could use regularly might actually be very difficult .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact264	762.935	763.385	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact266	765.793	766.063	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr006.B.dialogueact268	767.656	768.046	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	That 's true .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact270	767.811	768.201	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact269	767.731	776.32	F	PhD	s	-1	0	the idea is , if they have a meeting room and they can guarantee that the equipment will be safe and so forth , and if one of us is up there once a week to record the meeting or something {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact271	768.486	768.686	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	True .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact272	772.948	773.358	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact273	775.993	776.233	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact274	776.62	779.41	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , maybe John would let us put it into the phonology lab or something .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact275	777.661	778.121	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Huh .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact276	779.381	779.661	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact277	779.41	779.67	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	You know .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact278	780.056	781.766	F	PhD	s^na	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I think it 's not out of the question .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact280	782.033	785.053	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , I think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact279	781.876	782.186	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact281	782.046	782.546	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact282	782.931	783.311	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact284	786.072	787.69	B	Grad	s	-1	0	another type of meeting .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact283	786.063	786.583	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact285	787.762	788.092	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact287	788.44	801.2	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	But I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think you need , uh , another portable thing a another portable equipment to {disfmarker} to do , eh , more e easier the recording process , eh , out from ICSI .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact286	788.42	788.64	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact288	794.262	795.042	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact289	799.851	800.091	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact292	801.5	801.81	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact290	801.31	804.56	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	Eh and probably . I don't know .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact291	801.455	801.765	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact293	804.56	825.712	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Eh , if you {disfmarker} you want to {disfmarker} to record , eh , a seminar or a class , eh , in the university , you {disfmarker} you need {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It - it would be eh eh very difficult to {disfmarker} to put , {vocalsound} eh , a lot of , eh , head phones eh in different people when you have to {disfmarker} to record only with , eh , this kind of , eh , d device .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact294	809.738	810.018	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact295	819.61	820.19	B	Grad	fg	-1	0	Yeah , but {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact296	824.94	829.48	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I think if we {disfmarker} if we wanna just record with the tabletop microphones , that 's easy .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact297	828.302	829.142	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Oh - yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact299	830.082	830.352	B	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr006.B.dialogueact300	830.422	831.302	B	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's very easy ,
Bmr006.C.dialogueact298	830.031	830.591	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Ye - Yeah , yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact301	831.302	833.202	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but that 's not the corpus that we 're collecting .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact302	833.311	833.521	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact303	833.664	837.564	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Actually , that 's a int that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that 's maybe worth repeating .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact304	838.054	842.024	D	Professor	s	-1	0	We realized that , um , when we were talking about this that , OK , there 's these different things that we want to do with it .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact305	842.854	853.504	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	So , um , it 's true that we wanna be selective in some ways , uh , the way that you were speaking about with , uh , not having an interlingua and uh , these other issues .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact306	853.844	859.344	D	Professor	s	-1	0	But on the other hand , it 's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus to satisfy all of it .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact307	859.344	866.994	D	Professor	s	-1	0	So , a a as per the example that we wanna have a fair amount that 's done with a small n recorded with a small , uh , typ number of types of meetings
Bmr006.D.dialogueact308	867.5	871.85	D	Professor	s	-1	0	But we can also have another part that 's , uh , just one or two meetings of each of a {disfmarker} of a range of them
Bmr006.D.dialogueact309	871.85	872.83	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and that 's OK too .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact310	873.38	881.084	D	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	Uh , i We realized in discussion that the other thing is , what about this business of distant and close microphones ?
Bmr006.D.dialogueact311	881.524	884.554	D	Professor	s	+1	0	I mean , we really wanna have a substantial amount recorded this way ,
Bmr006.D.dialogueact312	884.554	885.304	D	Professor	s	-1	0	that 's why we did it .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact313	885.875	892.565	D	Professor	s	+1	0	But {pause} what about {disfmarker} For th for these issues of summarization , a lot of these higher level things you don't really need the distant microphone .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact314	893.77	894.0	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right ,
Bmr006.F.dialogueact315	894.0	895.23	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , I c I think there 's {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact317	894.67	896.58	B	Grad	s^nd	+1	0	And you don't really need the close microphone , you mean .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact316	894.511	895.181	D	Professor	s	-1	0	You actually don't .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact318	895.078	895.438	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact319	896.287	899.657	F	PhD	s^na	-1	0	Yea - yeah yeah , you actually don't really even need any fancy microphone .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact320	897.2	898.06	E	Postdoc	qw	-1	0	Which one did you mean ?
Bmr006.D.dialogueact321	897.822	900.877	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	You d You don't ne it doesn't {disfmarker} you just need some microphone , somewhere .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact323	899.738	900.528	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Ye - Yeah . Yep .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact322	899.657	902.047	F	PhD	s	-1	0	You can use found data .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact325	901.372	901.892	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Tape recorder .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact324	901.096	901.646	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact327	901.57	901.8	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact326	901.543	901.903	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact328	902.317	902.477	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact329	902.737	903.467	F	PhD	s	-1	0	You {disfmarker} you can .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact330	903.368	904.238	D	Professor	s	-1	0	You need some microphone ,
Bmr006.F.dialogueact331	903.597	903.907	F	PhD	s	-1	0	You can
Bmr006.B.dialogueact334	904.403	905.193	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact333	904.238	904.528	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	but I mean {disfmarker}
Bmr006.F.dialogueact332	903.907	909.152	F	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	use {disfmarker} Um , but I think that any {pause} data that we spend a lot of effort {nonvocalsound} to collect ,
Bmr006.D.dialogueact335	906.725	906.955	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact336	909.322	922.522	F	PhD	s^co	+1	0	you know , each person who 's interested in {disfmarker} I mean , we have a cou we have a bunch of different , um , slants and perspectives on what it 's useful for , um , they need to be taking charge of making sure they 're getting enough of the kind of data that they want .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact337	922.618	922.868	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact338	923.47	929.78	F	PhD	s	+1	0	And {disfmarker} So in my case , um , I think there w there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact339	928.918	930.148	B	Grad	s^2|s^aa	-1	0	Not enough for others , right .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact340	930.04	936.85	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And so {nonvocalsound} I 'm looking and thinking , " Well I 'd be glad to walk over and record people and so {nonvocalsound} forth if it 's {disfmarker} to help th in my interest . "
Bmr006.B.dialogueact341	936.2	936.79	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact342	936.85	941.9	F	PhD	s^co	+1	0	And other people need to do that for themselves , uh , h or at least discuss it so that we can find some optimal {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact343	939.459	940.159	D	Professor	s^bk|s.%-	-1	0	Right . So that {disfmarker}
Bmr006.C.dialogueact344	941.744	942.464	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact345	942.26	949.47	D	Professor	s	-1	0	But I think that {disfmarker} I 'm raising that cuz I think it 's relevant exactly for this idea up there that if you think about , " Well , gee , we have this really complicated setup to do , " well maybe you don't .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact347	950.48	950.67	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact348	950.67	951.27	B	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	For some of it .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact346	950.31	961.161	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Maybe if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} If really all you want is to have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a recording that 's good enough to get a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , a transcription from later , you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact349	951.758	952.218	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact350	961.43	961.56	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact351	961.441	964.421	D	Professor	s^cs.%-	-1	0	I mean , we {disfmarker} we could have a fairly {disfmarker} We could just get a DAT machine and {disfmarker}
Bmr006.F.dialogueact352	963.26	965.93	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Well , I agree with {nonvocalsound} Jane , though , on the other hand that {disfmarker}
Bmr006.C.dialogueact353	964.386	964.996	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact354	966.38	973.25	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So that might be true , you may say for instance , summarization , or something that sounds very language oriented .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact355	973.25	976.64	F	PhD	s	-1	0	You may say well , " Oh yeah , you just do that from transcripts of a radio show . "
Bmr006.F.dialogueact356	976.64	978.02	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , you don't even need the speech signal .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact357	977.196	977.416	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact358	978.57	985.78	F	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	But what you {disfmarker} what I was thinking is long term what would be neat is to be able to pick up on um {disfmarker}
Bmr006.F.dialogueact359	985.83	990.4	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to be able to determine this .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact360	990.4	991.85	F	PhD	s	-1	0	There 's lots of cues you 're not gonna have .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact362	991.961	992.191	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact363	992.195	992.465	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact361	991.85	1002.4	F	PhD	s	+1	0	So I {pause} do think that long term you should always try to satisfy the greatest number of {disfmarker} of interests and have this parallel information , which is really what makes this corpus powerful .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact364	993.033	993.173	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact365	1001.44	1001.86	B	Grad	qy^2^d^rt	-1	0	Special ?
Bmr006.B.dialogueact366	1002.37	1002.6	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact367	1002.45	1005.58	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I agree .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact368	1002.49	1006.53	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Otherwise , you know , lots of other sites can propose {disfmarker} individual studies , so {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact369	1005.67	1016.73	D	Professor	fh|s^co	+1	0	Uh but I {disfmarker} I think that the uh {vocalsound} i We can't really underestimate the difficulty {disfmarker} shouldn't really u underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact370	1016.92	1017.25	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact371	1017.7	1021.6	D	Professor	s	-1	0	And so , {disfmarker} uh it took quite a while to get that together and to say , " Oh , we 'll just do it up there , " {disfmarker}
Bmr006.F.dialogueact372	1018.18	1018.56	F	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact373	1021.6	1026.18	D	Professor	s	+1	1	If you 're talking about something simple , where you throw away a lot of these dimensions , then you can do that right away .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact374	1026.4	1029.72	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Talking about something that has all of these different facets that we have here ,
Bmr006.D.dialogueact375	1030.14	1037.53	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	it won't happen quickly , it won't be easy , and there 's all sorts of issues about th you know {vocalsound} keeping the equipment safe , or else hauling it around , and all sorts of o
Bmr006.F.dialogueact376	1036.59	1039.13	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	So then maybe we should {nonvocalsound} {pause} try to bring people here .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact378	1039.11	1039.34	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Here .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact377	1038.88	1042.74	D	Professor	s^na	+1	0	I think the first priority should be to pry {comment} to get {disfmarker} try to get people to come here .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact379	1039.3	1040.22	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , that 's that 's {disfmarker}
Bmr006.F.dialogueact380	1040.55	1041.27	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK , so
Bmr006.D.dialogueact381	1042.9	1043.92	D	Professor	s	-1	0	We 're set up for it .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact382	1043.0	1043.33	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact384	1044.36	1047.39	D	Professor	s	-1	0	The room is {disfmarker} is really , uh , underused .
Bmr006.F.dialogueact383	1044.17	1044.55	F	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact386	1048.27	1048.79	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker}
Bmr006.F.dialogueact385	1048.21	1048.47	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact387	1048.73	1050.73	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I thought the free lunch idea was a great idea .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact388	1050.29	1051.07	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , I thought so too .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact391	1051.39	1051.8	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr006.F.dialogueact389	1050.57	1053.99	F	PhD	s^aa|s^cs.%--	-1	0	Yeah , I {disfmarker} And I think we can get people to come here , that {disfmarker}
Bmr006.F.dialogueact392	1054.15	1058.18	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	But the issue is you definitely wanna make sure that the kind of group you 're getting is the right group
Bmr006.F.dialogueact393	1058.18	1061.89	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	so that you don't waste a lot of your time {nonvocalsound} and the overhead in bringing people down .

Bmr006.E.dialogueact572	1302.32	1302.83	E	Postdoc	qrr.%-	-1	0	Or did I {disfmarker} ?
Bmr006.B.dialogueact573	1303.02	1309.04	B	Grad	s^ar|s^nd	-1	0	No , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} these are the P - files from Broadcast News , which are regeneratable {disfmarker} regeneratable

Bmr006.B.dialogueact589	1335.29	1338.28	B	Grad	s	-1	0	The SUN , ha uh , takes more disks than the Andatico one did .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact591	1339.41	1348.29	B	Grad	s	-1	0	The SUN rack takes {disfmarker} {comment} Th - One took four and one took six , or maybe it was eight and twelve . Whatever it was , it was , {pause} you know , fifty percent more .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact590	1339.08	1339.57	D	Professor	qw^rt	-1	0	How many {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact592	1340.23	1340.78	D	Professor	qw.%-	-1	0	How much {disfmarker}
Bmr006.A.dialogueact593	1349.54	1350.77	A	PhD	qr^rt	-1	0	Is there a difference in price or something ?
Bmr006.B.dialogueact594	1350.79	1355.2	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , what happened is that we {disfmarker} we bought all our racks and disks from Andatico for years , according to Dave ,
Bmr006.B.dialogueact595	1355.2	1358.17	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and Andatico got bought by another company and doubled their prices .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact596	1358.27	1358.33	A	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	Oh !
Bmr006.C.dialogueact597	1358.79	1359.04	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact598	1359.73	1361.6	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And so , uh , we 're looking into other vendors .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact599	1361.6	1363.97	B	Grad	s	-1	0	" We " {disfmarker} By " we " of course I mean Dave .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact600	1361.79	1362.03	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Wow .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact602	1364.24	1364.65	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact601	1364.18	1364.35	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact603	1367.04	1378.32	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Hmm . I 've been looking at the , uh , Aurora data and , um , first {disfmarker} first look at it , there were basically three directories on there that could be moved .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact604	1378.8	1385.36	A	PhD	s	-1	0	One was called Aurora , one was Spanish , which was Carmen 's Spanish stuff , and the other one was , um , SPINE .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact605	1384.74	1385.26	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	SPINE .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact606	1386.17	1395.01	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	And so , um , I wrote to Dan and he was very concerned that the SPINE stuff was moving to a non - backed - up disk .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact607	1395.67	1403.27	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	So , um , I realized that well , probably not all of that should be moved , just {pause} the {pause} CD - ROM type data , the {disfmarker} {pause} the static data .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact608	1403.94	1408.28	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So I moved that , and then um , I asked him to check out and see if it was OK .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact609	1408.47	1412.16	A	PhD	s	-1	0	before I actually deleted the old stuff , um , but I haven't heard back yet .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact610	1412.19	1415.94	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I told him he could delete it if he wanted to , I haven't checked {pause} today to see if he 's deleted it or not .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact611	1416.47	1423.71	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And then Carmen 's stuff , I realized that when I had copied all of her stuff to XA , I had copied stuff there that was dynamic data .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact612	1424.04	1428.22	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And so , I had to redo that one and just copy over the static data .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact613	1428.86	1431.68	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And so I need to get with her now and delete the old stuff off the disk .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact614	1431.68	1433.53	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And then I lo haven't done any of the Aurora stuff .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact615	1433.53	1436.08	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I have to meet with , uh , Stephane to do that .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact616	1436.12	1436.36	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact617	1436.97	1443.98	D	Professor	s	-1	0	So , but , uh y you 're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you 're clearing up from the Broadcast News ,
Bmr006.D.dialogueact618	1444.68	1448.93	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but , we have some other disks , some of which you 're using for Aurora ,
Bmr006.D.dialogueact619	1448.93	1452.37	D	Professor	qy	-1	0	but are we g do we have some other {disfmarker} other space now ?
Bmr006.B.dialogueact620	1450.94	1451.23	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact621	1451.85	1457.0	B	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	So , so , uh , we have space on the current disk right now , where Meeting Recorder is ,
Bmr006.B.dialogueact623	1457.44	1459.33	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and that 's probably enough for about four meetings .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact622	1457.21	1457.65	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact625	1459.56	1461.46	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Is that the one that has {disfmarker} is that DC ?
Bmr006.D.dialogueact624	1459.4	1459.8	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact626	1459.96	1460.19	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact627	1461.56	1461.75	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact628	1462.12	1462.56	B	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	No , no ,
Bmr006.B.dialogueact629	1463.24	1465.49	B	Grad	s	-1	0	well , it 's wherever the Meeting Recorder currently is .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact630	1465.49	1466.31	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I think it 's DI .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact631	1467.18	1467.46	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK ,
Bmr006.A.dialogueact632	1467.46	1470.57	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I {disfmarker} but the stuff I 'm moving from Aurora is on the DC disk that we {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact633	1467.75	1468.46	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I don't remember .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact634	1470.42	1472.58	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Th - I think it 's DC - It 's whatever that one is .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact635	1472.43	1473.03	A	PhD	s	-1	0	OK , DC .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact636	1472.58	1474.26	B	Grad	s^am	-1	0	I just don't remember , it might be DC .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact637	1473.23	1473.4	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact638	1474.54	1477.46	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And that has enough for about four more meetings right now .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact640	1477.82	1482.05	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , I mean we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty - six for reasons I don't understand .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact639	1477.61	1477.93	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact641	1482.43	1484.45	B	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	Um , someone deleted something somewhere .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact642	1484.89	1486.22	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And so we have some room again .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact643	1486.75	1489.55	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And then with Broadcast News , that 's five or six more meetings ,
Bmr006.B.dialogueact644	1489.55	1490.85	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so , you know , we have a couple weeks .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact645	1491.78	1494.93	B	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , so , yeah , I think {disfmarker} I think we 're OK , until we get the new disk .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact646	1496.65	1496.75	C	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact647	1497.79	1508.38	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	So should , um {disfmarker} One question I had for you was , um , we need {disfmarker} {pause} we sh probably should move the Aurora an and all that other stuff off of the Meeting Recorder disk .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact648	1508.79	1511.8	A	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	Is there another backed - up {pause} disk that you know of that would {disfmarker} ?
Bmr006.B.dialogueact649	1511.46	1513.21	B	Grad	s	-1	0	We should put it onto the Broadcast News one .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact650	1513.75	1518.95	B	Grad	s	-1	0	That 's probably the best thing to do . And that way we consolidate Meeting Recorder onto one disk {pause} rather than spreading them out .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact651	1514.41	1514.83	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact652	1517.35	1517.88	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .

Bmr006.C.dialogueact947	2345.24	2352.15	C	PhD	s	-1	0	but eh {disfmarker} If you use a neural net is {disfmarker} is a good idea , but eh you don't know what happened in the interior of the neural net .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact948	2352.4	2359.08	D	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	Well , actually , you can do sensitivity analyses which show you what the importance of the different parce pieces of the input are .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact949	2358.43	2358.63	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact950	2359.48	2364.41	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	It 's hard to {disfmarker} w w what you {disfmarker} It 's hard to tell on a neural net is what 's going on internally .

Bmr006.D.dialogueact961	2378.64	2379.91	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	Yeah , then a decision tree is really good ,
Bmr006.D.dialogueact962	2379.91	2389.12	D	Professor	s	+1	0	but the thing is here he 's {disfmarker} he 's not {disfmarker} he 's not like he has one you know , a bunch of very distinct variables , like pitch and this {disfmarker} he 's talking about , like , a all these cepstral coefficients , and so forth ,

Bmr006.D.dialogueact975	2398.79	2403.2	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I mean , I think the other thing that one {disfmarker} I mean , this is , I think a good thing to do , to sort of look at these things at least {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact976	2403.43	2405.02	D	Professor	s	-1	0	See what I 'd {disfmarker} I 'd {disfmarker} Let me tell you what I would do .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact977	2405.48	2411.19	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	2	I would take just a few features . Instead of taking all the MFCC 's , or all the PLP 's or whatever , I would just take a couple .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact978	2409.41	2409.94	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact979	2412.01	2412.27	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	OK ?
Bmr006.D.dialogueact980	2412.27	2415.5	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	Like {disfmarker} like C - one , C - two , something like that , so that you can visualize it .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact982	2416.26	2416.53	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact981	2416.2	2418.91	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	and look at these different examples and look at scatter plots .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact983	2419.2	2419.39	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact984	2419.61	2426.81	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	OK , so before you do {disfmarker} build up any kind of fancy classifiers , just take a look in two dimensions , at how these things are split apart .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact986	2427.5	2427.89	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact985	2427.47	2433.11	D	Professor	s	-1	0	That I think will give you a lot of insight of what is likely to be a useful feature when you put it into a more complicated classifier .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact987	2433.13	2433.41	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact988	2433.89	2441.04	D	Professor	s	-1	0	And the second thing is , once you actually get to the point of building these classifiers , {vocalsound} @ @ what this lacks so far is the temporal properties .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact989	2441.43	2457.15	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	So if you 're just looking at a frame and a time , you don't know anything about , you know , the structure of it over time , and so you may wanna build @ @ {disfmarker} build a Markov model of some sort uh , or {disfmarker} or else have features that really are based on um on {disfmarker} on some bigger chunk of time .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact990	2446.75	2447.54	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact991	2447.83	2448.53	B	Grad	x	-1	0	Context window ?
Bmr006.C.dialogueact992	2450.44	2451.01	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr006.D.dialogueact994	2457.53	2458.92	D	Professor	s	-1	0	But I think this is a good place to start .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact995	2459.23	2471.47	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	But don't uh anyway , this is my suggestion , is don't just , you know , throw in twenty features at it , the deltas , and the delta del and all that into some classifier , even {disfmarker} even if it 's K - nearest - neighbors , you still won't know
Bmr006.C.dialogueact996	2460.59	2461.36	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact997	2464.68	2465.35	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact998	2472.03	2475.85	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	what it 's doing , even {disfmarker} You know it 's
Bmr006.D.dialogueact999	2476.16	2482.95	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Uh , I think to know what it 's {disfmarker} to have a better feeling for what it 's
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1000	2483.26	2483.44	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1001	2483.45	2492.57	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	look at {disfmarker} at som some picture that shows you , " Here 's {disfmarker} These things uh , uh are {disfmarker} offer some separation . " {vocalsound} And , uh , in LPC , uh , the thing to particularly look at is , I think {disfmarker} is something {vocalsound} like , uh , the residual {disfmarker}
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1002	2492.95	2493.13	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1003	2493.66	2495.5	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um So .

Bmr006.E.dialogueact1005	2495.22	2495.61	E	Postdoc	qy^cs^rt	-1	0	Can I ask ?
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1006	2495.61	2500.56	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It strikes me that there 's another piece of information um , that might be useful and that 's simply the transition .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1008	2500.91	2509.43	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So , w if you go from a transition of silence to overlap versus a transition from silence to speech , there 's gonna be a b a big informative area there , it seems to me .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1009	2504.0	2505.06	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	Yeah , because {disfmarker}

Bmr006.B.dialogueact1013	2510.38	2510.97	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	So , some sort of {disfmarker}

Bmr006.C.dialogueact1016	2516.3	2524.2	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} eh the {disfmarker} the Meeting Recorder project , for me , has eh , two {vocalsound} eh , w has eh several parts , several p {vocalsound} objective

Bmr006.C.dialogueact1018	2524.2	2525.96	C	PhD	s	-1	0	eh , because it 's a {disfmarker} a great project .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1019	2525.96	2534.96	C	PhD	s	-1	0	But eh , at the first , in the acoustic , eh , eh , parts of the project , eh I think {pause} you eh {disfmarker} we have eh {vocalsound} {pause} two main eh objective .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1020	2535.63	2540.23	C	PhD	s	-1	0	One {disfmarker} one of these is to {disfmarker} eh to detect the change , the acoustic change .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1021	2541.22	2563.02	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	And {vocalsound} for that , if you don't use , eh , {vocalsound} eh , a speech recognizer , eh broad class , or not broad class to {disfmarker} to try to {disfmarker} to {pause} {pause} {vocalsound} to label the different frames , I think {pause} the Ike criterion {pause} or BIC criterion eh will be enough to detect the change .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1022	2558.6	2559.17	E	Postdoc	x	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1023	2563.11	2566.56	C	PhD	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} Probably . {comment} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would like to {disfmarker} to t prove .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1024	2567.16	2589.19	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Uh , probably . When you you have , eh , eh s eh the transition of speech or {disfmarker} or silence eh to overlap zone , this criterion is enough with {disfmarker} {pause} probably with , eh , this kind of , eh , eh the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the more eh use eh {disfmarker} use eh {disfmarker} used eh em {pause} normal , regular eh parameter MF - MFCC .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1025	2590.13	2594.55	C	PhD	s	-1	0	you {disfmarker} you have to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to find {disfmarker} you can find the {disfmarker} the mark .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1026	2594.55	2596.58	C	PhD	s	-1	0	You can find the {disfmarker} nnn , the {disfmarker} the acoustic change .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1027	2597.06	2614.77	C	PhD	s	+1	0	But eh eh I {disfmarker} I understand that you {disfmarker} your objective is {pause} to eh classify , to know that eh that zone {pause} not is only {comment} a new zone in the {disfmarker} in the file , that eh you have eh , but you have to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to know that this is overlap zone .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1028	2615.71	2625.89	C	PhD	s	+1	0	because in the future you will eh try to {disfmarker} to process that zone with a non - regular eh eh speech recognizer model , I suppose .

Bmr006.D.dialogueact1056	2752.03	2757.57	D	Professor	s^df	+1	0	Because what we had before for {disfmarker} for uh , speaker change detection did not include these overlaps .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1057	2757.99	2758.38	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1058	2758.02	2761.28	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	2	So the first thing is for you to {disfmarker} to build up something that will detect the overlaps .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1059	2761.51	2761.66	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1060	2761.63	2761.75	D	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1061	2762.39	2769.68	D	Professor	fh|s^co.%--	-1	0	So again , I think the first thing to do to detect the overlaps is to look at these uh , in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1063	2768.51	2769.05	B	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	Features ?
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1062	2768.08	2768.22	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1064	2769.79	2773.86	D	Professor	fh|s^nd	-1	0	Well , I {disfmarker} again , the things you 've written up there I think are way too {disfmarker} way too big .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1065	2772.62	2772.84	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1066	2774.5	2779.34	D	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	OK ? If you 're talking about , say , twelfth {disfmarker} twelfth - order uh MFCC 's or something like that it 's just way too much .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1068	2779.83	2780.07	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1067	2779.34	2780.24	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	You won't be able to look at it .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1069	2780.8	2783.4	D	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	All you 'll be able to do is put it into a classifier and see how well it does .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1070	2783.51	2783.7	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1071	2784.04	2797.92	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Whereas I think if you have things {disfmarker} if you pick one or two dimensional things , or three of you have some very fancy display , uh , and look at how the {disfmarker} the different classes separate themselves out , you 'll have much more insight about what 's going on .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1072	2797.64	2798.3	C	PhD	s^na	-1	0	It will be enough .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1073	2798.97	2801.56	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , you 'll {disfmarker} you 'll get a feeling for what 's happening , you know ,
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1075	2801.8	2802.04	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1074	2801.56	2816.85	D	Professor	s	+1	0	so if you look at {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Suppose you look at first and second - order cepstral coefficients for some one of these kinds of things and you find that the first - order is much more effective than the second , {vocalsound} and then you look at the third and there 's not {disfmarker} and not too much there , {vocalsound} you may just take first and second - order cepstral coefficients ,
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1076	2811.14	2811.57	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1078	2817.22	2817.55	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1077	2816.85	2817.28	D	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right ?
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1079	2817.28	2823.13	D	Professor	s	+1	0	And with LPC , I think LPC per se isn't gonna tell you much more than {disfmarker} than {disfmarker} than the other , maybe .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1080	2823.66	2839.77	D	Professor	fh|s	+1	2	Uh , and uh on the other hand , the LPC residual , the energy in the LPC residual , {vocalsound} will say how well , uh {vocalsound} the low - order LPC {vocalsound} model 's fitting it , which should be {vocalsound} pretty poorly for two two or more {vocalsound} people speaking at the same time , and it should be pretty well , for w for {disfmarker} for one .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1081	2836.2	2836.41	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1082	2838.05	2838.36	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1084	2840.04	2840.36	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1083	2839.87	2855.47	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	And so {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} i again , if you take a few of these things that are {disfmarker} are {vocalsound} prob um {comment} {pause} promising features and look at them in pairs , {vocalsound} uh , I think you 'll have much more of a sense of " OK , I now have {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , doing a bunch of these analyses ,
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1085	2855.47	2858.17	D	Professor	s^cs^e	-1	0	I now have ten likely candidates . "
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1086	2858.25	2861.25	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	And then you can do decision trees or whatever to see how they combine .

Bmr006.C.dialogueact1112	2905.12	2911.56	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	fff ! {comment} Because the n the noise eh to sp the signal - to - noise relation is eh {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is low .

Bmr006.B.dialogueact1114	2911.93	2913.97	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , I think that that 's a good way to start .

Bmr006.B.dialogueact1118	2924.99	2927.11	B	Grad	s	-1	0	It would be interesting in itself to see .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1120	2930.49	2932.0	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , I think that would be an interesting result .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1119	2930.39	2940.71	C	PhD	qw.%-	-1	0	eh What , I {disfmarker} I mean , what what is the effect of the low ' signal to {disfmarker} to {disfmarker} to noise relation , you know , eh with {disfmarker}

Bmr006.D.dialogueact1122	2938.73	2942.41	D	Professor	fg|s^aap	-1	0	Well , I think {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I think it 's not a {disfmarker} it 's not at all unreasonable .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1123	2942.41	2944.82	D	Professor	s	-1	0	It makes sense to start with the simpler signal
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1124	2945.38	2955.2	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because if you have features which don't {disfmarker} aren't even helpful in the high signal - to - noise ratio , then there 's no point in putting them into the low signal ratio , one would think , anyway .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1125	2955.13	2955.32	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1126	2955.95	2977.18	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	And so , if you can get {disfmarker} @ @ {comment} Uh again , my prescription would be that you would , with a mixed signal , you would take a collection of possible uh , features {vocalsound} look at them , look at how these different classes that you 've marked , separate themselves , {comment} {vocalsound} and then collect , uh in pairs , {vocalsound} and then collect ten of them or something , and then proceed {vocalsound} with a bigger classifier .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1127	2970.67	2970.86	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1128	2975.72	2975.99	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1129	2977.62	2980.81	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	And then if you can get that to work well , then you go to the other signal .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1130	2981.42	2985.07	D	Professor	s	-1	0	And then , and you and you know , they won't work as well , but how m you know , how much {disfmarker}

Bmr006.D.dialogueact1134	2985.6	2987.32	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	And then you can re - optimize , and so on .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1135	2987.13	2989.94	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	Yeah . But it I think it would be interesting to try a couple with both .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1136	2990.22	2996.55	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	Because it {disfmarker} I think it would be interesting to see if some features work well with close mixed , and {disfmarker} And don't {disfmarker}

Bmr006.C.dialogueact1150	3036.34	3044.13	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I have seen the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the speech file from eh PDA , and s some parts is {comment} very difficult
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1151	3044.13	3047.66	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because you {disfmarker} you don't see the spectrum {disfmarker} the spectrogram .

Bmr006.D.dialogueact1179	3105.63	3114.19	D	Professor	s	+1	0	I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} it 's an additional interesting question .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1180	3108.29	3110.19	A	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	I mean , is {disfmarker} is that violation of the {disfmarker}

Bmr006.D.dialogueact1184	3114.66	3116.94	D	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , I think you wanna know whether you can do it with one ,
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1185	3116.94	3123.52	D	Professor	s	-1	0	because you know it 's not necessarily true that every device that you 're trying to do this with will have two .

Bmr006.C.dialogueact1187	3124.07	3124.45	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1188	3124.08	3128.42	D	Professor	fh|s^rt	-1	0	Uh , if , on the other hand , we show that there 's a huge advantage with two , well then that could be a real point .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1189	3129.1	3129.37	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1190	3129.22	3134.01	D	Professor	s	-1	0	But , we don't n even know yet what the effect of detecting {disfmarker} having the ability to detect overlaps is .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1191	3134.01	3135.3	D	Professor	s	-1	0	You know , maybe it doesn't matter too much .

Bmr006.C.dialogueact1225	3169.54	3176.44	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think because the the the distance between the two microph eh , microphone , eh , in the PDA is very near .

Bmr006.A.dialogueact1227	3184.95	3185.44	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I would guess {disfmarker}

Bmr006.E.dialogueact1234	3195.62	3197.22	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean , I know {disfmarker} I n I know that 's a very important cue .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1235	3196.25	3196.45	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .

Bmr006.E.dialogueact1237	3197.53	3204.95	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But I 'm just {disfmarker} I 'm just saying that the way we 're seated around a table , is not the same with respect to each {disfmarker} to each person with respect to the PDA ,
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1238	3203.43	3203.67	C	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .

Bmr006.E.dialogueact1241	3204.95	3208.06	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so we 're gonna have a lot of differences with ref respect to the speaker .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1242	3205.94	3208.04	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker} That 's fine .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1243	3207.17	3208.7	A	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	But th I don't think that matters , though .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1244	3207.53	3207.71	C	PhD	%	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1245	3208.63	3215.27	D	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} so i @ @ {comment} I think the issue is , " Is there a clean signal coming from only one direction ? "
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1246	3214.1	3214.34	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1247	3216.7	3222.95	D	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	If it 's not coming from just one direction , if it {disfmarker} if th if there 's a broader pattern , it means that it 's more likely there 's multiple people speaking ,
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1248	3223.5	3223.73	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1249	3223.82	3224.65	D	Professor	s	-1	0	wherever they are .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1250	3224.78	3228.25	A	PhD	s^bs^na	-1	0	So it 's sort of like how {disfmarker} how confused is it about where the beam is .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1251	3225.74	3226.63	D	Professor	qy.%-	-1	0	Is it a {disfmarker} is it {disfmarker}
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1253	3227.39	3227.85	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1252	3226.92	3231.47	D	Professor	qr	-1	0	Yeah , is there a narrow {disfmarker} Is there a narrow beam pattern or is it a {disfmarker} a distributed beam pattern ?
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1254	3231.47	3236.02	D	Professor	s	+1	0	So if there 's a distributed beam pattern , then it looks more like it 's {disfmarker} it 's uh , multiple people .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1257	3236.95	3237.35	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr006.E.dialogueact1258	3238.47	3243.88	E	Postdoc	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah . OK , it just {disfmarker} it just seemed to me that {disfmarker} uh , that this isn't the ideal type of separation .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1259	3244.0	3246.59	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , I {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} I can see the value o
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1260	3245.47	3247.4	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Oh , ideal would be to have the wall filled with them ,
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1261	3247.4	3255.28	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but I mean {disfmarker} {vocalsound} But the thing is just having two mikes {disfmarker} If you looked at that thing on {disfmarker} on Dan 's page , it was {disfmarker} When {disfmarker} when there were two people speaking , and it looked really really different .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1263	3248.21	3248.43	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr006.A.dialogueact1269	3256.27	3257.02	A	PhD	qw	-1	0	What looked different ?
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1268	3256.05	3256.57	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1270	3256.42	3256.61	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1271	3257.41	3259.25	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh , well , basic he was looking at correlation .

Bmr006.D.dialogueact1273	3259.47	3261.07	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	Just cross - correlation between two sides .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1276	3261.83	3267.27	A	PhD	s^fa|s^bu.%-	-1	0	Did - Sorry , b uh I 'm not sure what Dan 's page is that you mean . He was looking at the two {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1275	3261.39	3263.0	D	Professor	s	-1	0	So cross - correlation is pretty sensitive .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1277	3265.2	3265.95	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Uh , his a web page .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1278	3266.56	3271.25	D	Professor	s	-1	0	You take the signal from the two microphones and you cros and you cross - correlate them with different lags .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1279	3268.09	3268.64	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Subtract them .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1280	3270.37	3270.73	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .

Bmr006.B.dialogueact1285	3272.29	3277.59	B	Grad	x	-1	0	And you find {disfmarker} They get peaks .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1284	3271.83	3272.24	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1286	3272.56	3280.6	D	Professor	s	-1	0	So when one person is speaking , then wherever they happen to be at the point when they 're speaking , {vocalsound} then there 's a pretty big maximum right around that point in the l in {disfmarker} in the lag .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1288	3280.71	3281.76	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK . OK .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1287	3280.6	3289.77	D	Professor	s	-1	0	So if {disfmarker} at whatever angle you are , {vocalsound} at some lag corresponding to the time difference between the two there , you get this boost in the {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in the cross - correlation value {disfmarker} function .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1289	3282.38	3283.27	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so if there 's two {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1290	3288.94	3291.61	B	Grad	s	+1	0	And if there are multiple people talking , you 'll see two peaks .

Bmr006.E.dialogueact1309	3306.42	3311.64	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Versus you {disfmarker} versus {disfmarker} you know , and we 're catty - corner across the table , and I 'm farther away from this one and you 're farther away from that one .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1311	3311.14	3316.4	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Or {disfmarker} or even if , like , if people were sitting right across from each other , you couldn't tell the difference either .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1312	3311.3	3311.54	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1313	3311.79	3312.04	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1316	3312.83	3313.07	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1315	3312.4	3314.31	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah . Oh , yeah .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1314	3312.06	3313.43	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It seems like that would be pretty strong .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1317	3314.8	3315.2	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1318	3314.89	3317.75	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Across {disfmarker} the same axis , you don't have as much to differentiate .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1320	3317.9	3318.48	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1321	3317.96	3321.27	D	Professor	s^na.%-	-1	0	Well , we d yeah , we don't have a third dimension there . Yeah , so it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1319	3317.75	3322.43	E	Postdoc	s^bs	-1	0	And so my point was just that it 's {disfmarker} it 's gonna be differentially {disfmarker} differentially varia valuable .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1322	3320.38	3320.64	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1323	3322.81	3329.46	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean , it 's not to say {disfmarker} I mean , I certainly think it 's extremely val {comment} And we {disfmarker} we humans {pause} n n depend on {pause} you know , these {disfmarker} these binaural cues .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1324	3327.66	3329.05	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1325	3328.03	3333.26	D	Professor	s	-1	0	But it 's almost {disfmarker} but it 's almost a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think what you 're talking about i there 's two things .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1326	3329.68	3329.83	E	Postdoc	%	-1	0	But .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1327	3331.42	3337.24	B	Grad	x	-1	0	Must do . {comment} Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1328	3333.26	3336.86	D	Professor	s	-1	0	There 's a sensitivity issue , and then there 's a pathological error uh issue .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1329	3337.18	3340.82	D	Professor	s	-1	0	So th the one where someone is just right directly in line is sort of a pathological error .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1330	3339.86	3341.5	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yes . Yeah .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1332	3341.25	3341.5	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1331	3340.82	3344.02	D	Professor	s	-1	0	If someone just happens to be sitting right there then we won't get good information from it .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1333	3343.87	3344.13	E	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1334	3344.13	3347.45	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	and i and if there {disfmarker} So it {disfmarker} And if it 's the two of you guys on the same side {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1335	3344.87	3348.92	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh , if they 're {disfmarker} if they 're close , it 's just a question of the sensitivity .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1336	3348.5	3348.75	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1339	3349.56	3354.76	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	So if the sensitivity is good enough {disfmarker} and we just {disfmarker} we just don't have enough , uh , experience with it to know how {disfmarker}
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1337	3349.19	3349.27	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr006.E.dialogueact1343	3355.16	3363.74	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	Oh I 'm not {disfmarker} I 'm not trying to argue against using it , by any means . I just wanted to point out that {disfmarker} that weakness , that it 's topo topologically impossible to get it perfect for everybody .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1344	3355.78	3356.22	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1345	3357.03	3357.51	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1346	3360.5	3361.96	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And I think Dan is still working on it .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1347	3362.39	3366.21	B	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	So . He actually {disfmarker} he wrote me about it a little bit ,
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1348	3366.21	3366.44	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	so .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1349	3366.52	3366.81	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Great .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1350	3366.92	3368.35	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	No , I don't mean to discourage that at all .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1351	3367.75	3375.01	D	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , the other thing you can do {disfmarker} uh , if {disfmarker} I mean , i We 're assuming that it would be a big deal just to get somebody {disfmarker} convince somebody to put two microphones in the PDA .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1352	3375.36	3382.1	D	Professor	s^cs.%-	-1	0	But if you h put a third in , {vocalsound} you could put in the other axis . And then you know {disfmarker} then you 're sort of {disfmarker} Yeah , then {disfmarker} then you pretty much could cover {disfmarker}
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1353	3378.48	3379.23	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Once you got two {disfmarker}
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1354	3379.14	3379.53	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Interesting .

Bmr006.C.dialogueact1361	3385.71	3390.55	C	PhD	s	-1	0	It will be more interesting to study the PZM because the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the separation {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1362	3388.38	3396.47	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh @ @ {comment} {vocalsound} But - but that 's {disfmarker} I mean , we can we 'll be {disfmarker} all of this is there for us to study .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1363	3392.06	3393.05	B	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	Then they 're much broader .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1364	3396.35	3397.98	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Yeah , we can do whatever we want .

Bmr006.D.dialogueact1366	3397.18	3408.17	D	Professor	s	+1	0	But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but {disfmarker} but the thing is , uh , one of the {disfmarker} at least one of the things I was hoping to get at with this is what can we do with what we think would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a PDA .

Bmr006.B.dialogueact1448	3520.63	3522.99	B	Grad	s	-1	0	But if {disfmarker} if he 's not , that 's great too .

Bmr006.B.dialogueact1456	3532.65	3534.67	B	Grad	s^nd^tc	-1	0	Well , I had a couple things that I did wanna bring out .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1457	3534.04	3534.39	D	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1458	3534.67	3537.72	B	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	One is , do we need to sign new {disfmarker} these again ?
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1459	3536.92	3539.49	E	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	Well , it 's slightly different . So I {disfmarker} I would say it would be a good idea .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1461	3540.57	3540.94	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Are they new ?
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1460	3540.09	3541.25	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Cuz {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it 's slightly different .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1462	3541.3	3541.58	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1463	3541.88	3542.0	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1464	3542.54	3547.22	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Oh , this morning we didn't sign anything cuz we said that if anybody had signed it already , we didn't have to .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1465	3546.52	3550.12	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , I {disfmarker} I should 've checked with Jane first , but the ch the form has changed .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1466	3547.51	3548.36	E	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	It 's slightly different .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1468	3550.84	3553.27	B	Grad	s^co	-1	0	So we may wanna have everyone sign the new form .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1467	3550.6	3551.08	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	Ah - oh .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1469	3552.53	3552.91	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1471	3553.83	3558.39	B	Grad	fg|s^tc	-1	0	Um , I had some things I wanted to talk about with the thresholding stuff I 'm doing .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1470	3553.43	3554.05	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	I had to make one {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1472	3558.92	3561.03	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	But , if we 're in a hurry , we can put that off .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1473	3561.58	3565.41	B	Grad	fh|s^t	+1	2	Um and then also anonymity , how we want to anonymize the data .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1475	3566.1	3566.36	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1474	3566.03	3570.51	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Well , should I {disfmarker} I mean I have some results to present , but I mean I guess we won't have time to do that this time .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1476	3570.87	3577.01	E	Postdoc	s^cs^na	-1	0	But it seems like um the anonymization is uh , is also something that we might wanna discuss in greater length .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1477	3579.07	3580.25	D	Professor	fg|qw.%-	-1	0	Um . I mean , wha what {disfmarker}
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1478	3579.63	3585.46	E	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	If {disfmarker} if we 're about to wind down , I think {disfmarker} what I would prefer is that we uh , delay the anonymization thing till next week ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1479	3585.46	3588.5	E	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	and I would like to present the results that I have on the overlaps .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1480	3588.26	3589.66	A	PhD	s^bu|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	We still have to do this , too , right ?
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1481	3590.21	3590.48	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1482	3591.05	3591.39	A	PhD	qy^cs^d^rt	-1	0	Digits ?
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1483	3592.75	3593.08	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1484	3593.56	3595.1	B	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	No - well , we don't have to do digits .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1485	3597.65	3598.81	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Well , why don't we {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1486	3602.46	3608.72	D	Professor	fh|s^t^tc	-1	0	Uh , so @ @ OK . @ @ {comment} It sounds like u uh , there were {disfmarker} there were a couple technical things people would like to talk about .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1487	3608.72	3613.53	D	Professor	s^co.%-	-1	0	Why don't we just take a couple minutes to {disfmarker} to briefly {comment} do them , and then {disfmarker} and then {disfmarker} and then {disfmarker} and then {disfmarker} and then we {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1488	3611.59	3612.56	B	Grad	s^co	-1	0	OK , go ahead , Jane .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1489	3613.35	3615.52	E	Postdoc	s^nd	-1	0	I 'd {disfmarker} Oh , I 'd prefer to have more time for my results .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1490	3615.52	3616.93	E	Postdoc	qy^cs^rt	-1	0	e Could I do that next week maybe ?
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1491	3616.21	3616.47	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1492	3617.07	3617.78	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Oh , yeah . Sure .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1493	3617.58	3618.64	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	OK , that 's what I 'm asking .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1494	3618.85	3619.32	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Oh yeah , yeah .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1495	3619.3	3627.62	E	Postdoc	s^cs^nd	-1	0	And I think the anonymization , if y if you want to proceed with that now , I just think that that 's {disfmarker} that 's a discussion which also n really deserves a lo a {disfmarker} you know , more that just a minute .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1496	3625.38	3626.19	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	We could s
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1498	3627.79	3628.22	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1497	3627.62	3628.46	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I really do think that ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1499	3628.46	3630.33	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	because you raised a couple of possibilities yourself ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1500	3630.56	3632.04	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you and I have discussed it previously ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1501	3632.5	3635.93	E	Postdoc	s^cs.%-	-1	0	and there are different ways that people approach it , e and I think we should {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1502	3635.1	3635.33	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Alright .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1503	3635.33	3641.62	B	Grad	s^cs^nd	-1	0	We 're {disfmarker} we 're just {disfmarker} We 're getting enough data now that I 'd sort of like to do it now , before I get overwhelmed with {disfmarker} once we decide how to do it
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1504	3641.8	3642.42	E	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	Well , OK .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1505	3642.41	3643.45	B	Grad	s	-1	0	going and dealing with it .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1506	3643.49	3643.98	E	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	It 's just {disfmarker}
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1507	3644.02	3646.31	E	Postdoc	s^cc^df	-1	0	Yeah . OK . I {disfmarker} I 'll give you the short version ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1508	3646.37	3649.52	E	Postdoc	s^nd	-1	0	but I do think it 's an issue that we can't resolve in five minutes .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1509	3649.36	3649.75	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1510	3649.95	3657.82	E	Postdoc	h|s	-1	0	OK , so {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the short thing is um , we have uh , tape recording uh , uh , sorry , digitized recor recordings .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1511	3657.98	3659.51	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Those we won't be able to change .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1512	3659.51	3661.59	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	If someone says " Hey , Roger so - and - so " .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1513	3660.9	3661.19	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1514	3661.59	3663.2	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So that 's gonna stay that person 's name .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1515	3662.87	3663.07	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1516	3663.66	3665.3	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Now , in terms of like the transcript ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1517	3665.58	3669.12	E	Postdoc	qw	+1	2	the question becomes what symbol are you gonna put in there for everybody 's name ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1518	3669.46	3674.86	E	Postdoc	qr	+1	2	and whether you 're gonna put it in the text where he says " Hey Roger " or are we gonna put that person 's anonymized name in instead ?
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1519	3675.31	3678.44	B	Grad	s^ar|s^nd	-1	0	No , because then that would give you a mapping , and you don't wanna have a mapping .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1520	3677.28	3685.03	E	Postdoc	s^co	-1	0	OK , so first decision is , we 're gonna anonymize the same name for the speaker identifier and also in the text whenever the speaker 's name is mentioned .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1522	3685.4	3685.74	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I don't {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1521	3684.99	3685.26	B	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1523	3685.43	3690.04	B	Grad	s^df^nd.%-	+1	0	Because that would give you a mapping between the speaker 's real name and the tag we 're using , and we don't want {disfmarker}
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1524	3689.05	3690.79	E	Postdoc	s^ng	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I don't think you understood what I {disfmarker} what I said .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1525	3690.51	3690.79	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1526	3690.79	3695.87	E	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	So {disfmarker} uh , so in {disfmarker} within the context of an utterance , someone says " So , Roger , what do you think ? "
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1527	3697.83	3698.23	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1528	3698.72	3709.04	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	Then , uh , it seems to me that {disfmarker} Well , maybe I {disfmarker} uh it seems to me that if you change the name , the transcript 's gonna disagree with the audio , and you won't be able to use that .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1530	3707.81	3709.65	A	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Right , you don't wanna do that .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1529	3707.65	3710.41	B	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	We don't {disfmarker} we wanna {disfmarker} we ha we want the transcript to be " Roger " .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1532	3711.05	3711.43	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1531	3710.8	3720.6	B	Grad	s^df	+1	1	Because if we made the {disfmarker} the transcript be the tag that we 're using for Roger , someone who had the transcript and the audio would then have a mapping between the anonymized name and the real name , and we wanna avoid that .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1533	3719.55	3742.37	E	Postdoc	fg|s^df^ng	+1	1	OK , well , but then there 's this issue of if we 're gonna use this for a discourse type of thing , then {disfmarker} and , you know , Liz was mentioning stuff in a previous meeting about gaze direction and who 's {disfmarker} who 's the addressee and all , then to have " Roger " be the thing in the utterance and then actually have the speaker identifier who was " Roger " be " Frank " , that 's going to be really confusing and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1534	3731.62	3731.99	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1535	3742.39	3742.55	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Ugh !
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1536	3742.61	3743.21	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	That 's a good point .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1537	3743.06	3754.26	E	Postdoc	s.%	-1	0	Now , if you want to , you know , I mean , in some cases , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I know that Susan Ervin - Tripp in some of hers , uh , actually did do uh , um , a filter of the s signal where the person 's name was mentioned , except
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1538	3761.93	3827.18	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	Yeah Yeah , once you get to the publication you can certainly do that .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1539	3762.25	3765.43	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and I {disfmarker} cer and I {disfmarker} So , I mean , the question then becomes one level back .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1540	3765.82	3770.04	E	Postdoc	qw	+1	1	Um , how important is it for a person to be identified by first name versus full name ?
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1541	3770.51	3773.82	E	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	Well , on the one hand , uh , it 's not a full identity ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1542	3773.82	3782.31	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	we 're taking all these precautions , um and they 'll be taking precautions , which are probably even the more important ones , to {disfmarker} they 'll be reviewing the transcripts , to see if there 's something they don't like {disfmarker} {comment} OK .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1543	3782.71	3785.59	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So , maybe , uh , maybe that 's enough protection .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1544	3785.59	3796.75	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	On the other hand , this is a small {disfmarker} this is a small pool , and people who say things about topic X e who are researchers and well - known in the field , they 'll be identifiable and simply from the {disfmarker} from the first name .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1545	3796.93	3801.39	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	However , taking one step further back , they 'd be identifiable anyway , even if we changed all the names .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1546	3800.98	3801.29	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1548	3801.94	3802.45	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1547	3801.93	3804.03	E	Postdoc	qy.%--	-1	0	So , is it really , um {disfmarker} {comment} You know ?
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1549	3803.89	3803.95	B	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	Ugh !
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1550	3804.16	3810.72	E	Postdoc	fh|s^cc	-1	0	Now , in terms of like {disfmarker} so I {disfmarker} I did some results , which I 'll report on n next time , which do mention individual speakers by name .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1551	3810.67	3811.04	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1552	3810.94	3813.92	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Now , there , the Human Subjects Committee is very precise .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1553	3814.21	3818.17	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	You don't wanna mention subjects by name in published reports .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1554	3818.17	3824.85	E	Postdoc	s	+1	2	Now , it would be very possible for me to take those data put them in a {disfmarker} in a study , and just change everybody 's name for the purpose of the publication .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1555	3824.85	3825.68	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	And someone who looked {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1556	3827.18	3830.15	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	You can go , you know , uh , " Z " {vocalsound} uh , for instance .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1557	3829.32	3830.14	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , exactly .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1558	3830.26	3830.8	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	Doesn't matter if {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1559	3830.82	3835.83	D	Professor	fh|s^bd	-1	0	Uh . Um , yeah , I mean , t it doesn't {disfmarker} I mean , I 'm not knowledgeable about this ,
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1561	3835.83	3839.7	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	but it certainly doesn't bother me to have someone 's first name in {disfmarker} in the {disfmarker} in the transcript .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1560	3835.81	3836.61	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	That 's the same thing you saw .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1562	3836.92	3837.13	B	Grad	b	-1	0	OK .

Bmr006.D.dialogueact1564	3839.84	3843.79	D	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	Uh , I think {disfmarker} you don't wanna have their full name to be uh , listed .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1565	3843.23	3848.28	E	Postdoc	s^aa|s^df	-1	0	Yeah , and {disfmarker} and in the form that they sign , it does say " your first name may arise in the course of the meetings " .

Bmr006.A.dialogueact1568	3845.94	3846.26	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1569	3848.74	3849.01	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1570	3849.47	3858.88	D	Professor	s^bu	+1	0	So again , th the issue is if you 're tracking discourse things , you know , if someone says , uh , uh , " Frank said this " and then you wanna connect it to something later , you 've gotta have this part where that 's " Frank colon " .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1571	3849.54	3850.21	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Or " your name " .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1572	3853.96	3854.58	B	Grad	s^fe^t1	-1	0	Yeah , shoot !
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1573	3859.1	3859.35	D	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1574	3859.4	3873.58	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	Yeah , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} you know , even more i i uh , immediate than that just being able to , uh {disfmarker} Well , it just seems like to track {disfmarker} track from one utterance to the next utterance who 's speaking and who 's speaking to whom , cuz that can be important .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1575	3873.48	3873.82	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1576	3873.58	3878.59	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	S i You know , " You raised the point , So - and - so " , it 's be kind of nice to be able to know who " you " was .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1578	3877.17	3877.79	B	Grad	s^fe^t1	-1	0	Shoot !
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1577	3876.72	3876.92	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1579	3878.56	3879.66	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I 'm thinking too much .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1580	3878.59	3884.73	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And ac {comment} and actually you remember {disfmarker} furthermore , you remember last time we had this discussion of how you know , I was sort of avoiding mentioning people 's names ,
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1581	3884.9	3885.87	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	Yeah , I was too . Yeah .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1582	3885.29	3888.37	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and it was {disfmarker} and we made the decision that was kind of artificial .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1583	3888.37	3893.75	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Well , I mean , if we 're going to step in after the fact and change people 's names in the transcript , we 've basically done something one step worse .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1584	3893.51	3893.72	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1587	3894.54	3897.1	B	Grad	s^nd	+1	0	Well , I would sug I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} don't wanna change the names in the transcript ,
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1586	3894.52	3894.89	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1585	3894.33	3894.73	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1589	3897.1	3902.89	B	Grad	s^df	+1	0	but that 's because I 'm focused so much on the acoustics instead of on the discourse , and so I think that 's a really good point .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1588	3896.68	3897.18	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Misleading .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1590	3900.1	3900.66	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1591	3903.51	3905.16	B	Grad	s^aa|s^na	+1	1	You 're right , this is going to require more thought .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1592	3905.53	3905.74	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1593	3906.09	3911.23	D	Professor	s^cs^t^tc	-1	0	L let me just back up this to make a {disfmarker} a brief comment about the , uh , what we 're covering in the meeting .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1594	3911.23	3916.17	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh I realize when you 're doing this that uh {disfmarker} I mean , I didn't realize that you had a bunch of things that you wanted to talk about .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1595	3916.66	3922.45	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , and so , uh {disfmarker} and so I was proceeding some somewhat at random , frankly .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1596	3922.84	3940.87	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	So I think what would be helpful would be uh , i and I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll mention this to {disfmarker} to Liz and Andreas too , that um , before the meeting if anybody could send me , any {disfmarker} any , uh , uh , agenda items that they were interested in and I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll take the role of organizing them uh , into {disfmarker} into the agenda ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1597	3935.86	3936.18	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1598	3936.96	3937.14	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Sure .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1599	3941.14	3945.15	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	but I 'd be very pleased to have everyone else {vocalsound} completely make up the agenda .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1600	3945.15	3947.01	D	Professor	s	-1	0	I 've no desire to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} to make it up ,
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1601	3947.01	3962.15	D	Professor	s^fa	-1	0	but if {disfmarker} if no one 's told me things , then I 'm just proceeding from my {disfmarker} my guesses , and {disfmarker} and uh , and i ye yeah , I {disfmarker} I 'm sorry it ended up with your out your time to {disfmarker} I mean , I 'm just always asking Jose what he 's doing , you know , and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and so it 's {disfmarker} {pause} There 's uh , there 's obviously other things going on .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1602	3953.6	3954.25	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1603	3953.65	3955.27	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , it 's not a problem . Not a problem . Yeah .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1604	3956.68	3958.3	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	I just {disfmarker} I just couldn't do it in two minutes .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1605	3962.49	3968.49	B	Grad	qw^tc	+1	0	How will we {disfmarker} how would the person who 's doing the transcript even know who they 're talking about ?
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1606	3970.35	3971.2	B	Grad	qy^f^rt	-1	0	Do you know what I 'm saying ?
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1607	3971.42	3973.49	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	" The person who 's doing the transcript {disfmarker} " {comment} The IBM people ?
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1608	3973.97	3974.21	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1609	3974.96	3978.25	B	Grad	qw	+1	0	I mean , so so {disfmarker} how is that information gonna get labeled anyway ?
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1610	3978.36	3980.17	E	Postdoc	qw^bu	-1	0	How do you mean , who {disfmarker} what they 're {disfmarker} who they 're talking about ?
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1612	3980.34	3984.62	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , so if I 'm saying in a meeting , " oh and Bob , by the way , wanted {disfmarker} wanted to do so - and - so " ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1611	3980.25	3981.15	E	Postdoc	qw^r	-1	0	How do you mean ?
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1613	3986.81	3988.27	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	They 're just gonna write " Bob " on it or do @ @ {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1614	3987.11	3987.67	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	if you 're doing {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1615	3988.33	3989.82	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Yeah , @ @ they 're just gonna write " Bob " .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1616	3990.19	3995.71	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	And so . If you 're {disfmarker} if you 're doing discourse analysis ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1617	3990.93	3992.22	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	They won't be able to change it themselves .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1618	3995.69	3997.38	D	Professor	qw	-1	0	What ar how are they gonna do any of this ?
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1620	3997.72	3998.2	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , really .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1619	3997.68	4002.74	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Well , I {disfmarker} I 'm betting we 're gonna have huge chunks that are just totally un untranscribable by them .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1621	4001.6	4004.79	D	Professor	s^bu.%-	-1	0	I mean , they 're gonna say speaker - one , or speaker - two or speaker I mean I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1625	4005.2	4006.12	A	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	They can't do that .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1623	4004.89	4006.42	C	PhD	fg|%-	-1	0	Yeah , I think {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1622	4004.89	4007.27	B	Grad	s	+1	1	Well , the current one they don't do speaker identity .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1624	4004.9	4005.22	C	PhD	x	-1	0	
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1626	4007.82	4012.1	B	Grad	s	+1	0	because in NaturallySpeaking , or , excuse me , in ViaVoice , it 's only one person .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1627	4012.87	4016.81	B	Grad	s	+1	1	and so in their current conventions there are no multiple speaker conventions .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1628	4016.77	4019.91	D	Professor	s	-1	0	So it may just be one long transcript of a bunch of words .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1630	4018.91	4019.08	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1629	4018.78	4021.29	E	Postdoc	fg|s.%--	-1	0	Oh . {vocalsound} I think that {disfmarker} My understanding from Yen
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1631	4021.79	4022.37	E	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	Is it Yen - Ching ?
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1632	4022.37	4023.31	E	Postdoc	qy	-1	0	Is that how you pronounce her name ?
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1633	4023.5	4025.77	D	Professor	s^bc^nd	-1	0	Uh {pause} Yu - Ching , Yu - Ching . Yeah .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1634	4023.54	4024.07	E	Postdoc	qy^bu^d	-1	0	Oh , uh Yu - Ching ?
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1635	4024.07	4025.06	E	Postdoc	qy^bu^d	-1	0	Yu - Ching ?
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1636	4024.69	4025.89	B	Grad	s^bc^na	-1	0	y Yu - Ching .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1637	4025.41	4033.0	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	was that um , they will {disfmarker} that they will adopt the {disfmarker} part of the conventions that {disfmarker} that we discussed , where they put speaker identifier down .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1638	4033.31	4035.51	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But , you know , h they won't know these people ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1639	4035.51	4038.0	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so I think it 's {disfmarker} Well , they 'll {disfmarker} they 'll adopt some convention
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1640	4038.0	4039.65	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but we haven't specified to them {disfmarker}
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1641	4039.65	4041.98	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So they 'll do something like speaker - one , speaker - two , is what
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1642	4041.98	4046.07	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I bet , but I 'm betting there 'll be huge variations in the accuracy of {disfmarker} of their labeling the speakers .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1643	4046.07	4048.05	E	Postdoc	s^co	-1	0	We 'll have to review the transcripts in any case .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1644	4047.99	4061.33	D	Professor	s	-1	0	And it {disfmarker} and it may very well be {disfmarker} I mean , since they 're not going to sit there and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and worry ab about , uh , it being the same speaker , they may very well go the {disfmarker} eh the {disfmarker} the first se the first time it changes to another speaker , that 'll be speaker - two .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1645	4055.31	4055.61	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1646	4061.33	4064.54	D	Professor	s	-1	0	And the next time it 'll be speaker - three even if it 's actually speaker - one .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1647	4061.6	4061.84	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	You know {disfmarker}
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1648	4061.84	4062.25	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1649	4064.49	4066.69	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	You know , that would be a very practical solution on their part .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1650	4066.8	4067.37	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1653	4067.37	4067.98	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	It 's a good idea .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1652	4067.04	4067.45	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1651	4066.91	4068.62	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} but then we would need to label it .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1655	4068.81	4072.2	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah we {disfmarker} we can probably regenerate it pretty easily from the close - talking mikes .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1656	4068.87	4069.78	C	PhD	fg|%-	-1	0	Yeah . Yeah , I think {disfmarker}
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1654	4068.62	4069.68	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And that 's OK .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1657	4069.25	4069.46	C	PhD	x	-1	0	
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1658	4071.83	4074.96	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Yes , I was thinking , the temp the time values of when it changes .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1659	4072.7	4073.2	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1660	4072.79	4073.58	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1661	4073.38	4077.81	B	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	So . But I mean that doesn't {disfmarker} This doesn't answer the {disfmarker} the question .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1662	4073.75	4074.32	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1663	4075.74	4075.97	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	But that {disfmarker}
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1664	4075.78	4076.74	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	That 'd be very efficient .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1665	4078.61	4081.31	B	Grad	s	-1	0	The p It 's a good point , " which {disfmarker} what do you do for discourse tracking ? "
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1666	4079.53	4088.73	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Because y y you don't know to know , eh {disfmarker} you don't need to know what i what is the iden identification of the {disfmarker} of the speakers . You only eh want to know {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1667	4082.34	4082.77	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1668	4088.06	4091.02	B	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	For {disfmarker} for acoustics you don't but for discourse you do .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1669	4088.85	4089.76	D	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	Well , you do .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1670	4091.26	4093.46	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Ah , for discourse , yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1671	4091.98	4092.35	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1672	4092.45	4100.52	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	If {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if someone says , uh , " what {disfmarker} what is Jose doing ? " and then Jose says something , you need to know that that was Jose responding .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1673	4094.51	4094.87	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1674	4096.07	4096.22	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1675	4097.03	4098.6	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah . Yeah , yeah ,
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1676	4098.6	4098.81	C	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1677	4099.49	4100.98	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah . Yeah ,
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1680	4102.23	4103.43	B	Grad	s	-1	0	Ugh , {comment} that 's a problem .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1679	4101.75	4103.14	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh , so .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1678	4101.67	4102.29	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1681	4102.31	4102.52	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1682	4103.0	4110.83	E	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	Unless we adopt a different set of norms which is to not id to make a point of not identifying people by name , which then leads you to be more contextually ex explicit .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1683	4111.45	4112.03	A	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	That would be hard .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1684	4112.69	4131.54	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	Well , people are very flexible . You know ? I mean , so when we did this las last week , I felt that you know , now , Andreas may , uh , @ @ {comment} uh , he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} i sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they miss a sentence or something , and {disfmarker} and because he missed something , then he missed the r the initial introduction of who we were talking about , and was {disfmarker} was unable to do the tracking .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1685	4129.86	4130.3	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1686	4131.54	4136.51	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	But I felt like most of us were doing the tracking and knew who we were talking about and we just weren't mentioning the name .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1687	4136.51	4138.31	E	Postdoc	s^bs	-1	0	So , people are really flexible .

Bmr006.A.dialogueact1689	4138.25	4147.14	A	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	But , you know , like , at the beginning of this meeting {disfmarker} Or , you I think said , {pause} you know , or s Liz , said something about um , uh , " is Mari gonna use the equipment ? "
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1691	4147.74	4148.94	A	PhD	qw^ng	-1	0	I mean , how would you say that ?

Bmr006.A.dialogueact1696	4156.28	4157.1	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1697	4156.36	4157.57	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1698	4156.53	4157.02	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	Right ? Use the {disfmarker}
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1699	4157.96	4163.34	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I think it would be really hard if we made a policy where we didn't say names , plus we 'd have to tell everybody else .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1700	4159.6	4160.09	B	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	Yeah , darn !
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1701	4160.09	4164.07	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	I mean , what I was gonna say is that the other option is that we could bleep out the names .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1702	4161.1	4161.59	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	Well , it
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1703	4163.07	4163.5	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1704	4164.4	4166.91	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but then , again that kills your discourse analysis .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1705	4165.99	4166.43	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1706	4166.25	4166.67	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .

Bmr006.A.dialogueact1713	4168.89	4181.92	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I think the {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I don't know , my own two cents worth is that you don't do anything about what 's in the recordings , you only anonymize to the extent you can , the speakers have signed the forms and all .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1712	4168.52	4169.35	E	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker} that 's the issue .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1714	4180.28	4186.15	B	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	Well , but that but that {disfmarker} as I said , that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that works great for the acoustics , but it {disfmarker} it hurts you a lot for trying to do discourse .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1715	4181.57	4181.84	E	Postdoc	%	-1	0	Well .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1718	4186.57	4186.77	A	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	Why ?
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1716	4186.08	4186.43	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1720	4187.2	4192.96	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Because you don't have a map of who 's talking versus {pause} their {pause} name that they 're being referred to .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1719	4186.76	4187.0	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1717	4186.42	4186.54	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr006.A.dialogueact1723	4191.53	4193.93	A	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	I thought we were gonna get it labelled speaker - one , speaker - two {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1724	4193.89	4197.15	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	Sure but , h then you have to know that Jose is speaker - one and {disfmarker}
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1725	4196.79	4197.84	A	PhD	qw	-1	0	Why do you have to know his name ?
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1726	4197.71	4204.3	D	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	OK , so suppose someone says , " well I don't know if I really heard what {disfmarker} uh , what Jose said . "
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1727	4204.6	4204.8	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1728	4205.04	4205.54	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1729	4205.14	4207.39	D	Professor	s	-1	0	And then , Jose responds .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1730	4207.53	4207.86	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1731	4207.63	4210.91	D	Professor	s	-1	0	And part of your learning about the dialogue is Jose responding to it .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1732	4210.91	4213.2	D	Professor	s	-1	0	But it doesn't say " Jose " , it says " speaker - five " .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1733	4214.02	4214.33	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1734	4214.16	4214.38	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1736	4214.86	4215.08	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1735	4214.71	4216.84	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {pause} uh {pause} u
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1737	4216.54	4222.39	A	PhD	s^bk|s^bs	-1	0	Oh , I see , you wanna associated the word " Jose " in the dialogue with the fact that then he responded .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1738	4222.43	4222.8	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1740	4223.31	4225.15	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Someone who 's doing discourse would wanna do that .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1739	4223.26	4232.02	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	And so , if we pass out the data to someone else , and it says " speaker - five " there , we also have to pass them this little guide that says that speaker - five is Jose ,
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1742	4232.12	4233.92	B	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	And that violates our privacy .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1741	4232.02	4235.05	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and if were gonna do that we might as well {comment} give them " Jose " {disfmarker} say it was " Jose " .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1743	4232.65	4233.1	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1744	4234.51	4234.92	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1746	4235.6	4237.35	B	Grad	s^na^r	-1	0	And that violates our privacy issue .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1747	4235.8	4236.17	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1745	4235.57	4235.94	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1748	4235.94	4236.2	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1749	4236.91	4237.4	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1750	4237.15	4244.14	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Now , I {disfmarker} I think that we have these two phases in the {disfmarker} in the data , which is the one which is o our use , University of Washington 's use , IBM , SRI .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1751	4239.7	4240.01	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1752	4244.5	4254.7	E	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	2	And within that , it may be that it 's sufficient to not uh change the {disfmarker} to not incorporate anonymization yet , but always , always in the publications we have to .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1753	4251.44	4252.15	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1754	4255.03	4259.07	E	Postdoc	s^co	-1	0	And I think also , when we take it that next step and distribute it to the world , we have to .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1755	4259.35	4264.78	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But I {disfmarker} but I don that 's {disfmarker} that 's a long way from now and {disfmarker} and it 's a matter of {disfmarker} between now and then of d of deciding how {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1756	4264.1	4265.14	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Making some decisions ?
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1757	4265.37	4274.25	E	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	i i it {disfmarker} You know , it may be s that we we 'll need to do something like actually X out that part of the um {disfmarker} the audio , and just put in brackets " speaker - one " .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1758	4268.39	4268.66	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1759	4270.62	4271.52	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	For the public one .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1760	4271.63	4272.0	C	PhD	x	-1	0	the ? ?
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1763	4274.49	4277.22	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	You know , what we could do also is have more than one version of release .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1762	4274.48	4274.96	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1761	4274.41	4274.87	E	Postdoc	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	You know .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1764	4277.22	4280.44	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	One that 's public and one {disfmarker} one that requires licensing .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1765	4281.11	4284.75	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	And so the licensed one would {disfmarker} w we could {disfmarker} it would be a sticky limitation .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1766	4283.73	4284.29	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1767	4285.58	4286.08	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	You know , like {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1769	4286.69	4287.83	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	Well , we can talk about that later .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1768	4286.33	4288.82	E	Postdoc	s^nd	-1	0	I think that 's risky . I think that the public should be the same .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1770	4288.91	4291.41	E	Postdoc	s^cs^nd	-1	0	I think that when we do that world release , it should be the same .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1771	4289.55	4290.76	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I agree .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1772	4291.94	4293.15	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I agree with Jane .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1773	4292.41	4293.82	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	For a bunch of reasons , legal .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1774	4293.15	4298.39	D	Professor	s^cs^na.%-	+1	0	I {disfmarker} I think that we {disfmarker} we have a {disfmarker} need to have a consistent licensing policy of some sort , and {disfmarker}
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1775	4297.26	4299.73	E	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	But I also think a consistent licensing policy is important .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1777	4298.85	4309.47	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Well , one thing to to take into consideration is w are there any um {disfmarker} For example , the people who are funding this work , they want this work to get out and be useful for discourse .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1776	4298.75	4299.4	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1778	4309.47	4313.32	A	PhD	s	-1	0	If we all of a sudden do this and then release it to the public and it 's not longer useful for discourse ,
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1779	4314.3	4314.72	A	PhD	qy^d^g	-1	0	you know {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1780	4314.41	4318.47	B	Grad	s^arp	-1	0	Well , depending on how much editing we do , you might be able to {pause} still have it useful .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1781	4319.11	4321.02	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	because for discourse you don't need the audio .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1782	4321.99	4322.12	B	Grad	qy^d^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1783	4322.12	4324.03	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	So you could bleep out the names in the audio .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1784	4324.28	4324.67	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1785	4324.42	4326.52	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	and use the anonymized one through the transcript .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1788	4326.88	4327.79	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	But if you release both {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1787	4326.75	4327.7	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1786	4326.51	4328.4	E	Postdoc	s^nd	-1	0	Excuse me . We {disfmarker} we do need audio for discourse .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1789	4329.48	4331.93	B	Grad	s^aap^df	-1	0	But , n excuse me , but you could bleep out just the names .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1790	4329.49	4329.72	D	Professor	x	-1	0	She {disfmarker}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1791	4332.08	4340.43	D	Professor	s^bs^nd	-1	0	No , but she 's saying , from the argument before , she wants to be able to say if someone said " Jose " in their {disfmarker} in their thing , and then connect to so to what he said later , then you need it .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1792	4338.82	4339.14	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1793	4339.61	4346.73	B	Grad	s^cs^df	-1	0	But in the transcript , you could say , everywhere they said " Jose " that you could replace it with " speaker - seven " .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1794	4347.24	4347.64	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh I see .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1796	4349.74	4350.22	D	Professor	s^bk^r	-1	0	I see .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1795	4349.29	4351.19	E	Postdoc	s^bk|s.%-	-1	0	Yeah . But I {disfmarker} {pause} I also wanna say that people {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1797	4350.4	4352.52	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And then it wouldn't meet {disfmarker} match the audio anymore .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1799	4352.83	4354.48	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	But it would be still useful for the {disfmarker}
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1798	4352.57	4352.82	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1800	4353.72	4355.44	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But if both of those are publically available {disfmarker}
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1801	4353.97	4354.89	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Yeah . That 's good .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1802	4356.12	4356.41	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	But they {disfmarker}
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1803	4357.61	4357.82	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1804	4358.77	4366.35	D	Professor	s	+1	0	And th and the other thing is if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if Liz were here , {vocalsound} what she might say is that she wants to look if things that cut across between the audio and the dialogue ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1805	4358.78	4359.9	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	Well , you see ? So , it 's complicated .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1806	4366.35	4368.31	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	and so , {vocalsound} uh ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1807	4368.21	4368.96	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1809	4369.22	4369.84	D	Professor	s^bk|s^fa	-1	0	yeah . Sorry .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1808	4369.17	4373.2	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	I think we have to think about w @ @ {comment} how . I think that this can't be decided today .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1810	4373.03	4374.21	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Yeah , OK , good point .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1811	4373.47	4378.49	E	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	But it 's g but I think it was good to introduce the thing and we can do it next time .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1812	4375.9	4376.17	D	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1814	4377.68	4381.83	B	Grad	s	-1	0	I didn't think {disfmarker} when I wrote you that email I wasn't thinking it was a big can of worms , but I guess it is .

Bmr006.B.dialogueact1819	4384.75	4385.84	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah , ab absolutely .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1821	4389.24	4389.96	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Oh , yeah , sure .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1820	4388.84	4392.64	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It 's gonna be looking at a t You know , and prosod prosodic stuff is involved ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1822	4392.64	4394.35	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and that means you 're going to be listening to the audio ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1823	4394.35	4396.79	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and then you come directly into this {disfmarker} confronting this problem .

Bmr006.E.dialogueact1825	4398.05	4398.28	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1826	4400.0	4401.69	A	PhD	s^j	-1	0	and then , we wouldn't have to worry about it .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1827	4402.56	4403.06	C	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1828	4403.19	4405.91	E	Postdoc	s^cs^j	-1	0	Yeah , we should just market it to non - English speaking countries .
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1830	4407.89	4408.62	C	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1829	4407.57	4412.62	D	Professor	s^cs^j	-1	0	Uh , maybe we should only have meetings between people who don't know one another and who are also amnesiacs who don't know their own name .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1831	4413.43	4415.24	B	Grad	qy	-1	0	Did you read the paper on Eurospeech ?
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1832	4414.12	4415.45	E	Postdoc	s^cs^j	-1	0	We could have little labels .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1833	4415.59	4422.1	E	Postdoc	s^cs^j	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I wanna introduce my Reservoir Dogs solution again , which is everyone has like " Mister White " , " Mister Pink " , {vocalsound} " Mister Blue " .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1834	4418.67	4419.28	A	PhD	s^cs^j	-1	0	Mister White .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1835	4419.46	4419.73	B	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1836	4421.22	4425.33	B	Grad	qy	-1	0	Did you read the paper a few years ago where they were reversing the syllables ?
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1837	4426.3	4429.1	B	Grad	s	-1	0	They were di they they had the utterances .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1838	4429.35	4432.28	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and they would extract out the syllables and they would play them backwards .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1839	4434.61	4438.74	A	PhD	s^bu.%-	-1	0	But {disfmarker} so , the syllables were in the same order , with respect to each other , but the acous
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1840	4436.56	4440.2	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Everything was in the same order , but they were {disfmarker} the individual syll {comment} syllables were played backwards .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1841	4440.52	4442.45	B	Grad	s	-1	0	And you could listen to it , {pause} and it would sound the same .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1842	4441.16	4442.09	A	PhD	qw	-1	0	What did it sound like ?
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1843	4443.34	4445.18	B	Grad	s	-1	0	People had no difficulty in interpreting it .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1844	4445.45	4451.57	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	So what we need is something that 's the reverse , that a speech recognizer works exactly the same on it but people can't understand it .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1845	4452.73	4454.79	D	Professor	s^j^na	-1	0	Oh , well that 's {disfmarker} there 's an easy way to do that .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1846	4456.28	4457.74	D	Professor	s^cs^j	-1	0	Jus - jus just play it all backwards .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1847	4458.15	4460.86	B	Grad	s^bk|s^j	-1	0	Oh right . The speech recognizer 's totally symmetric , isn't it .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1848	4460.11	4461.69	D	Professor	qw^j	-1	0	What , what does the speech recognizer care ?
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1849	4461.61	4462.2	B	Grad	fg	-1	0	Ah , anyway .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1850	4463.16	4463.93	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	Um ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1851	4463.71	4464.68	E	Postdoc	qr^bu.%--	-1	0	Oh , do we do digits ? Or {disfmarker} ?
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1852	4464.74	4465.19	E	Postdoc	qw	-1	0	What do we do ?
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1854	4465.42	4467.26	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker} OK , we 'll quickly do digits .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1853	4465.41	4466.1	D	Professor	s^co^t^tc	-1	0	Let 's do digits .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1856	4466.1	4467.45	D	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah , we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we already missed the party .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1855	4465.75	4466.31	E	Postdoc	qy^bu	-1	0	Or do we just quit ?
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1858	4467.67	4467.96	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1857	4467.45	4467.71	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1859	4468.81	4469.22	E	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1860	4661.38	4663.01	B	Grad	z	-1	0	OK , go off here .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1861	4662.88	4666.34	A	PhD	z	-1	0	I think it would be fun sometime to read them with different intonations .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1862	4667.12	4671.05	A	PhD	z	-1	0	like as if you were talking like , " nine eight six eight seven ? "
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1863	4672.49	4682.56	E	Postdoc	z	-1	0	Well , you know , in the {disfmarker} in the one I transcribed , I did find a couple instances {disfmarker} {pause} I found one instance of contrastive stress , where it was like the string had a {disfmarker} li So it was like " nine eight two four , nine nine two four " .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1864	4682.71	4683.34	A	PhD	z	-1	0	Oh , really .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1865	4683.34	4686.12	A	PhD	z	-1	0	So they were like looking ahead ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1866	4685.27	4685.71	E	Postdoc	z	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1867	4686.12	4686.3	A	PhD	z	-1	0	huh ?
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1868	4686.19	4686.84	E	Postdoc	z	-1	0	Well , they differed .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1869	4686.84	4689.88	E	Postdoc	z	-1	0	I mean , at that {disfmarker} that session I did feel like they did it more as sentences .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1870	4690.36	4700.84	E	Postdoc	z	-1	0	But , um , sometimes people do it as phone numbers . {comment} I mean , I 've {disfmarker} I {pause} am sort of interested in {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} And sometimes , you know , I s And I {disfmarker} I never know . When I do it , I {disfmarker} I ask myself what I 'm doing each time .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1872	4693.85	4694.86	A	PhD	z	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1871	4693.81	4694.05	B	Grad	z	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1873	4699.81	4704.56	A	PhD	z	-1	0	Well , I was thinking that it must get kind of boring for the people who are gonna have to transcribe this
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1874	4700.97	4701.42	E	Postdoc	z	-1	0	and I {disfmarker}
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1876	4705.08	4707.51	A	PhD	z	-1	0	They may as well throw in some interesting intonations .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1875	4704.97	4705.73	B	Grad	z	-1	0	Well , except ,
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1877	4706.05	4707.47	E	Postdoc	z	-1	0	I like your question intonation .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1878	4706.9	4707.18	B	Grad	z	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1879	4707.47	4708.33	E	Postdoc	z	-1	0	That 's very funny .
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1880	4708.33	4709.08	E	Postdoc	z	-1	0	I haven't heard that one .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1881	4709.1	4710.2	B	Grad	z	-1	0	We have the transcript .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1882	4710.2	4713.74	B	Grad	z	-1	0	We have the actual numbers they 're reading , so we 're not necessarily depending on that .
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1883	4713.74	4714.54	B	Grad	z	-1	0	OK , I 'm gonna go off .
