Everyone must be sure and use the high-pass filtering option on the groups software , to deal with irregularities between mics.
In order to coordinate better with OGI , some sort of source code control is required and me018 has offered to investigate , but only minimal progress can be made until after the upcoming deadline for Eurospeech.
When he returns me026 will help.
Also , in two weeks one of the OGI members will return , and meetings should be arranged with him before the next big project meeting.
OGI seem to be having some good results with voice activation detection , so the group need to find out which is the best VAD and start using it.
