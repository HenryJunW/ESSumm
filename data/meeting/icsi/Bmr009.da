Bmr009.D.dialogueact4	1.085	1.785	D	PhD	z	-1	0	That 's a different thing .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact5	1.816	2.206	C	Professor	z	-1	0	There 's another {disfmarker}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact6	2.206	2.596	C	Professor	z	-1	0	I don't know .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact7	2.596	3.666	C	Professor	z	-1	0	It starts with a P or something .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact8	3.666	5.566	C	Professor	z	-1	0	I forget the word for it , but it 's {disfmarker} it 's um
Bmr009.D.dialogueact9	4.125	4.555	D	PhD	z	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact10	6.54	9.52	C	Professor	z	-1	0	Typically when you {disfmarker} you 're ab r starting around forty for most people ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact11	9.66	13.398	C	Professor	z	-1	0	it starts to harden and then it 's just harder for the lens to shift things
Bmr009.D.dialogueact12	10.629	10.969	D	PhD	z	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact13	13.398	19.657	C	Professor	z	-1	0	and th the {disfmarker} the symptom is typically that you {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you have to hold stuff uh uh further away to {disfmarker} to see it .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact14	14.164	14.544	E	PhD	z	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact15	19.167	19.337	E	PhD	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact16	20.008	23.828	C	Professor	z	-1	0	In fact , uh m my brother 's a {pause} gerontological psychologist
Bmr009.C.dialogueact17	23.828	33.442	C	Professor	z	-1	0	and he {disfmarker} he uh {vocalsound} came up with an {disfmarker} an uh {disfmarker} a uh body age test which uh gets down to sort of only three measurements that are good enough st statistical predictors of all the rest of it .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact18	33.91	37.438	C	Professor	z	-1	0	And one of them is {disfmarker} is the distance {vocalsound} that you have to hold it at .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact19	35.816	40.551	D	PhD	z	-1	0	Give someone a piece of paper and then they {disfmarker} Oh .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact20	36.792	36.982	E	PhD	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact21	37.574	37.764	C	Professor	z	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact22	38.342	40.732	A	Grad	z	-1	0	We 're {disfmarker} we 're live by the way , so we 've got a good intro here
Bmr009.C.dialogueact23	41.25	42.04	C	Professor	z	-1	0	Oh . Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact24	42.11	42.89	C	Professor	z	-1	0	About how old I am .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact26	43.305	43.605	A	Grad	z	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact25	42.89	43.2	C	Professor	z	-1	0	OK .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact27	44.105	45.355	A	Grad	z	-1	0	We can edit that out if you want .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact28	44.497	45.347	D	PhD	z	-1	0	Oh , that 's optional .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact29	45.357	45.947	C	Professor	z	-1	0	No , that 's OK .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact31	46.096	46.346	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact33	46.596	51.17	A	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	So . This time the form discussion should be very short ,
Bmr009.D.dialogueact32	46.181	46.821	D	PhD	z	-1	0	You know .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact30	45.811	46.831	E	PhD	z	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact34	51.17	51.47	A	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr009.C.dialogueact35	51.707	52.967	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	It also should be {pause} later .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact36	53.49	53.69	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact37	53.721	56.051	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	Because Jane uh is not here yet .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact38	56.173	56.513	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Good point .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact39	57.01	58.79	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And uh she 'll be most interested in that .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact40	59.42	62.24	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Uh , she 's probably least involved in the signal - processing stuff
Bmr009.C.dialogueact41	62.24	63.87	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so maybe we can just {disfmarker} just uh ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact42	63.87	65.58	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	I don't think we should go though an elaborate thing ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact43	66.251	73.986	C	Professor	s	+1	1	but um uh Jose and I were just talking about {vocalsound} the uh {nonvocalsound} uh , speech e energy thing ,
Bmr009.E.dialogueact44	72.621	72.741	E	PhD	s^2.%--	-1	0	The @ @ {disfmarker}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact46	74.446	75.176	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and I uh {disfmarker}
Bmr009.E.dialogueact45	73.949	74.149	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact47	75.176	76.236	C	Professor	s	-1	0	We didn't talk about the derivatives .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact48	76.236	77.896	C	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	But I think , you know , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} i
Bmr009.C.dialogueact49	77.896	81.69	C	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	if I can {disfmarker} if you don't mind my {disfmarker} my speaking for you for a bit , um {vocalsound} Uh .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact50	81.69	85.24	C	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	Right now , that he 's not really showing any kind of uh distinction , but uh {disfmarker}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact51	85.24	88.51	C	Professor	s^rt	+1	0	but we discussed a couple of the possible things that uh he can look at .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact52	89.067	92.347	C	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	Um . And uh one is that uh this is all in log energy
Bmr009.C.dialogueact53	92.347	97.004	C	Professor	s	+1	0	and log energy is basically compressing the distances {vocalsound} uh {pause} between things .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact54	97.395	102.788	C	Professor	s	+1	1	Um {pause} Another is that he needs to play with the {disfmarker} the different uh {pause} uh temporal sizes .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact55	102.788	105.698	C	Professor	s	+1	1	He was {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he was taking everything over two hundred milliseconds
Bmr009.C.dialogueact56	106.31	111.03	C	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	uh , and uh he 's going to vary that number and also look at moving windows , as we discussed before .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact57	111.774	124.77	C	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	Um And uh {disfmarker} and the other thing is that the {disfmarker} yeah doing the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} subtracting off the mean and the variance in the {disfmarker} {pause} uh and dividing it by the {pause} standard deviation in the log domain , {vocalsound} may not be {pause} the right thing to do .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact59	125.24	125.57	A	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	Hi Jane !
Bmr009.E.dialogueact58	125.145	125.385	E	PhD	s^t3	-1	0	Hi .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact61	125.87	126.52	A	Grad	s	-1	0	We just started .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact60	125.385	125.535	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact62	127.34	128.27	A	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Could you take that mike there ?
Bmr009.D.dialogueact63	127.482	128.752	D	PhD	qy^bu^rt	+1	0	Are these the long term means ?
Bmr009.D.dialogueact64	128.992	129.892	D	PhD	s^e.%--	-1	0	Like , over the whole {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact65	130.032	131.942	D	PhD	qy^d	-1	0	I mean , the means of {pause} what ?
Bmr009.A.dialogueact68	132.243	132.723	A	Grad	s^ft	-1	0	Thanks .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact66	131.992	133.292	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	Uh B Between {disfmarker} between {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact67	132.012	133.582	D	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	All the frames in the conversation ?
Bmr009.C.dialogueact70	133.966	134.196	C	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact69	133.582	134.502	D	PhD	qrr^d.%--	-1	0	Or of things that {disfmarker}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact71	134.196	134.676	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Between {disfmarker}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact72	134.676	135.096	C	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	Neither .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact74	135.096	137.826	C	Professor	s	+1	0	It 's uh between the pauses {pause} uh for some segment .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact73	134.708	134.888	E	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact75	135.586	135.976	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact76	137.826	141.696	C	Professor	s	+1	1	And so i i his {disfmarker} his {disfmarker} He 's making the constraint it has to be at least two hundred milliseconds .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact77	138.16	138.41	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact78	142.319	143.059	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And so you take that .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact79	143.059	145.909	C	Professor	s	+1	0	And then he 's {disfmarker} he 's uh measuring at the frame level {disfmarker}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact80	145.909	147.477	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	still at the frame level , of what {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact81	146.962	147.362	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact82	147.557	150.207	C	Professor	s	+1	0	and then {disfmarker} and then just uh normalizing with that larger amount .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact83	150.91	158.05	C	Professor	s^rt	+1	1	um and {disfmarker} But one thing he was pointing out is when he {disfmarker} he looked at a bunch of examples in log domain , it is actually pretty hard to see {vocalsound} the change .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact84	158.17	166.318	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	And you can sort of {pause} see that , because of j of just putting it on the board that {vocalsound} if you sort of have log - X plus log - X , that 's the log of X plus the log of two
Bmr009.E.dialogueact85	160.887	161.077	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact86	163.864	165.324	D	PhD	fg|s^cs	-1	0	Yeah , maybe it 's not log distributed .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact87	165.356	165.516	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact88	165.516	165.866	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact89	166.318	169.318	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and it 's just , {pause} you know , it {disfmarker} it diminishes the {pause} effect of having two of them .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact90	169.532	169.972	E	PhD	x	-1	0	
Bmr009.C.dialogueact92	170.268	170.898	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact91	170.057	172.147	D	PhD	qy	-1	0	But you could do like a C D F there instead ?
Bmr009.D.dialogueact93	172.147	175.163	D	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	I mean , we don't know that the distribution here is normally .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact94	174.5	174.93	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yes , right .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact95	174.93	177.24	C	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	So {disfmarker} So what I was suggesting to him is that {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact96	175.163	176.403	D	PhD	s^cs.%-	-1	0	So just some kind of a simple {disfmarker}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact97	177.32	178.15	C	Professor	s^bc	+1	0	Actually , a PDF .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact98	178.45	179.93	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But , you know , uh But , either way .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact99	178.92	179.29	D	PhD	s^bk^m	-1	0	PDF
Bmr009.C.dialogueact100	179.93	180.13	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact103	180.765	184.3	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	Yeah , eith eith uh {vocalsound} B
Bmr009.D.dialogueact101	180.331	180.571	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact102	180.388	180.668	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact104	181.709	183.539	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Something like that where it 's sort of data driven .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact105	184.3	199.911	C	Professor	s^bk|s^arp.%--	+1	0	Yeah , but I think {pause} also u I think a good first indicator is when the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the researcher looks at {vocalsound} examples of the data and can not see a change {pause} in how big the {disfmarker} the signal is , {vocalsound} when the two speaker {disfmarker}
Bmr009.E.dialogueact106	199.143	202.345	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact107	199.911	201.991	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Then , that 's a problem right there .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact108	202.091	203.701	C	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	So . I think you should at least be able ,
Bmr009.D.dialogueact109	202.105	202.385	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Oh yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact110	203.946	206.446	C	Professor	s^cs:s	-1	0	doing casual looking and can get the sense , " Hey , there 's something there . "
Bmr009.C.dialogueact111	206.446	207.826	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and then you can play around with the measures .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact114	208.325	210.365	C	Professor	s^df	+1	1	And when he 's looking in the log domain he 's not really seeing it .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact112	208.094	208.424	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Oh yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact113	208.142	208.502	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact115	210.365	210.745	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	So .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact116	210.745	212.695	C	Professor	s^df^rt	+1	1	And when he 's looking in straight energy he is ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact117	213.3	214.36	C	Professor	s	+1	0	so that 's a good place to start .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact118	214.548	214.818	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact119	215.06	217.13	C	Professor	fh|s^tc	-1	0	Um . So that was {disfmarker} that was the discussion we just had .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact120	217.35	218.531	C	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Um . {vocalsound} The other thing
Bmr009.C.dialogueact121	218.91	220.94	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Actually we ca had a question for Adam in this .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact122	221.399	235.014	C	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Uh , when you did the {vocalsound} sampling ? uh {pause} over the {pause} speech segments or s or sampling over the {disfmarker} the individual channels in order to do the e uh the {pause} amplitude equalization , {vocalsound} did you do it over just the entire {disfmarker} everything in the mike channels ?
Bmr009.E.dialogueact123	221.411	221.671	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	How {disfmarker}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact124	235.014	236.444	C	Professor	qy^d	-1	0	You didn't try to find speech ?
Bmr009.A.dialogueact125	236.582	239.442	A	Grad	s^ar|s	-1	0	No , I just took over the entire s uh entire channel
Bmr009.A.dialogueact126	239.952	242.032	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um {pause} sampled ten minutes randomly .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact127	242.35	242.86	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right , OK .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact128	242.86	247.71	C	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	So then that means that someone who didn't speak {pause} very much {vocalsound} would be largely represented by silence .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact129	246.787	247.037	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact130	248.17	249.64	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And someone who would {disfmarker} who would be {disfmarker}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact131	249.64	253.49	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	So the normalization factor probably is {pause} i i i {pause} is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker}
Bmr009.A.dialogueact132	252.929	256.229	A	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , this was quite quick and dirty , and it was just for {pause} listening .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact133	253.512	253.832	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact134	254.388	254.618	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact136	256.659	258.379	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	And for listening it seems to work really well .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact135	256.516	256.806	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact137	256.771	257.021	E	PhD	s^bk^rt	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact138	258.502	258.712	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact139	258.837	259.027	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact140	259.649	259.809	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact141	259.706	259.866	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact142	260.405	261.015	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But that 's {disfmarker}
Bmr009.A.dialogueact144	261.539	264.25	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	But , it 's not {disfmarker} Not a good measure .

Bmr009.C.dialogueact148	265.093	273.683	C	Professor	s^bs.%--	+1	1	So yeah there {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} There 's a good chance then given that different people do talk different amounts {pause} that there is {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there is still a lot more to be gained from gain norm normalization with some sort

Bmr009.C.dialogueact158	289.37	294.56	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Uh , I think uh Liz has a very good point , that in fact it would be much more graphic just to show {disfmarker}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact160	295.148	298.31	C	Professor	s	+1	0	Well , actually , you do have some distributions here , uh for these cases .

Bmr009.C.dialogueact212	375.305	375.815	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK . Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact213	375.815	376.765	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So she {disfmarker} she 's right .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact214	375.978	378.278	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but it 's the {disfmarker} it 's the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the following .

Bmr009.C.dialogueact219	379.812	383.346	C	Professor	s	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker} That 's uh {pause} cuz I 'd mentioned scatter plots before but she 's right ,

Bmr009.E.dialogueact220	379.871	380.131	E	PhD	qw^br	-1	0	Huh ?
Bmr009.C.dialogueact221	383.346	389.825	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , even before you get the scatter plots , just looking at a single feature {vocalsound} uh , looking at the distribution , is a good thing to do .

Bmr009.E.dialogueact224	394.42	401.77	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the scatter plot {pause} combining eh different {pause} n two combination .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact225	402.118	404.928	C	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah , but {disfmarker} but what she 's saying {pause} is , which is right , is {pause} le

Bmr009.C.dialogueact227	405.903	406.743	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean , let 's start with the {disfmarker}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact228	406.743	421.47	C	Professor	s	+1	0	Before we get complicated , let 's start with the most basic wh thing , which is {pause} we 're arguing that if you take energy {disfmarker} uh if you look at the energy , that , when two people are speaking at the same time , usually {vocalsound} {pause} there 'll be more energy than when one is
Bmr009.C.dialogueact230	421.47	421.73	C	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	right ?
Bmr009.E.dialogueact229	421.442	421.672	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact231	422.056	423.236	C	Professor	s^e	+1	0	That 's {disfmarker} that sort of hypothesis .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact232	422.339	422.849	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	That 's right .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact233	423.236	426.229	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And the first way you 'd look at that , uh s she 's , you know , absolutely right ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact234	426.229	429.226	C	Professor	s	+1	0	is that you would just take a look at the distribution of those two things ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact236	429.671	430.911	C	Professor	s	-1	0	much as you 've plotted them here ,
Bmr009.E.dialogueact235	429.219	429.419	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact237	431.33	433.38	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	You know , but just {disfmarker} but just {disfmarker} {pause} just uh do it {disfmarker}
Bmr009.E.dialogueact238	431.42	431.59	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact239	433.95	434.8	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Well in this case you have three .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact240	434.8	436.24	C	Professor	s	-1	0	You have the silence , and that {disfmarker} that 's fine .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact241	435.623	435.853	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact242	436.34	439.056	C	Professor	s	-1	0	So , uh with three colors or three shades or whatever ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact243	439.056	440.676	C	Professor	s	-1	0	just {disfmarker} just look at those distributions .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact244	439.489	439.669	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact245	441.112	449.373	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And then , given that as a base , you can see if that gets improved , you know , or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} {pause} or worsened {pause} by the {disfmarker} looking at regular energy , looking at log energy ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact246	449.373	452.763	C	Professor	s^cs^rt	-1	0	we were just proposing that maybe it 's {disfmarker} you know , it 's harder to {pause} see with the log energy ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact248	453.56	459.52	C	Professor	fh|qh^rt	-1	0	um and uh also these different normalizations , does a particular choice of normalization make it better ?
Bmr009.E.dialogueact247	453.336	453.476	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact249	460.007	464.834	C	Professor	s	+1	0	But I had maybe made it too complicated by suggesting early on , that you look at scatter plots
Bmr009.C.dialogueact250	464.834	467.254	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because that 's looking at a distribution in two dimensions .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact251	467.758	470.56	C	Professor	s^co	+1	0	Let 's start off just in one , uh , with this feature .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact252	467.788	468.178	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact253	469.279	469.609	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact255	471.06	474.13	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I think that 's probably the most basic thing , before anything very complicated .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact254	471.052	471.402	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact257	474.805	482.615	C	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	Um And then we w I think we 're agreed that pitch - related things are {disfmarker} are {disfmarker} are going to be a {disfmarker} a really likely candidate to help .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact256	474.5	474.85	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact258	474.839	475.009	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact259	476.869	477.379	E	PhD	b	-1	0	I agree , yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact260	481.816	482.446	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact261	483.028	499.162	C	Professor	s	+1	1	Um {pause} But {pause} since {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh your intuition from looking at some of the data , is that when you looked at the regular energy , that it did in fact usually go up , {vocalsound} when two people were talking , {vocalsound} that 's {disfmarker} eh you know , you should be able to come up with a measure which will {pause} match your intuition .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact262	483.351	483.721	E	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact263	492.328	492.668	E	PhD	b.x	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr009.E.dialogueact265	494.468	494.988	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact266	499.8	510.17	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	And she 's right , that a {disfmarker} that having a {disfmarker} having {disfmarker} {comment} having this table , with a whole bunch of things , {pause} with the standard deviation , the variance and so forth , it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's harder to interpret than just looking at the {disfmarker} the same kind of picture you have here .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact267	501.395	501.665	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr009.E.dialogueact268	504.618	504.948	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact269	507.924	508.014	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact270	508.565	525.133	E	PhD	s	-1	0	But {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it 's curious but uh I f I found it in the {disfmarker} in the mixed file , in one channel {vocalsound} that eh in several {disfmarker} oh e eh several times eh you have an speaker talking alone with a high level of energy
Bmr009.C.dialogueact271	523.434	523.894	C	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	Mm - hmm .

Bmr009.C.dialogueact276	538.26	538.71	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact277	538.35	541.77	E	PhD	s	-1	0	and the overlapping zone has eh less energy .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact278	542.28	544.41	C	Professor	fg|s.%-	-1	0	Yeah . So there 'll be some cases for which {disfmarker}

Bmr009.C.dialogueact282	547.423	549.613	C	Professor	s	-1	0	This is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I w want to point {pause} to visual things ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact283	550.046	553.087	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But I mean they {disfmarker} there 'll be time {disfmarker} There 'll be overlap between the distributions ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact284	553.289	557.4	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but the question is , " If it 's a reasonable feature at all , there 's some separation . "
Bmr009.E.dialogueact285	553.499	553.629	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact286	557.759	557.969	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact287	558.486	560.296	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	Especially locally .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact288	561.311	561.831	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact289	561.37	562.06	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So . Locally .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact290	561.43	562.02	E	PhD	s^aa^m	-1	0	just locally , yeah .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact291	562.091	566.876	A	Grad	s	+1	0	And {disfmarker} I was just going to say that {disfmarker} that {pause} right now we 're just exploring .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact292	562.18	563.12	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And the other thing is I
Bmr009.D.dialogueact293	563.41	563.74	D	PhD	s^fa	-1	0	Sorry .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact294	563.89	564.12	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	I {disfmarker}
Bmr009.A.dialogueact296	567.526	572.176	A	Grad	s	+1	0	What you would imagine eventually , is that you 'll feed all of these features into some {pause} discriminative system .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact295	567.452	567.642	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact297	572.324	572.624	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact299	573.09	580.18	A	Grad	s	+1	0	And so even if {disfmarker} if one of the features does a good job at one type of overlap , another feature might do a good job at another type of overlap .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact298	573.003	573.273	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact300	577.449	577.799	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact301	579.072	579.382	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact303	580.128	587.679	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Right . I mean the {disfmarker} the reason I had suggested the scatter f p features is I used to do this a lot , when we had thirteen or fifteen or twenty features {pause} to look at .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact302	579.836	580.636	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Yeah , this is the {disfmarker}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact304	588.76	594.74	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	um Because something is a good feature uh by itself , you don't really know how it 'll behave in combination
Bmr009.C.dialogueact305	594.74	600.466	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and so it 's nice to have as many {disfmarker} as many together at the same time as possible in uh in some reasonable visual form .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact306	600.466	604.915	C	Professor	s	-1	0	There 's cool graphic things people have had sometimes to put together three or four in some funny {disfmarker} funny way .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact307	605.237	612.323	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But it 's true that you shouldn't do any of that unless you know that the individual ones , at least , have {disfmarker} have some uh {disfmarker} some hope
Bmr009.E.dialogueact308	610.91	611.25	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact309	611.633	613.553	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , especially for normalizing .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact311	613.742	613.992	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact310	613.553	619.34	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	I mean , it 's really important to {pause} pick a normalization that matches the distribution for that feature .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact312	618.7	619.07	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact313	619.908	626.899	D	PhD	s	-1	0	And it may not be the same for all the types of overlaps or the windows may not be the same .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact314	627.879	637.152	D	PhD	s	-1	0	e Actually , I was wondering , {vocalsound} right now you 're taking a {disfmarker} all of the {pause} speech , from the whole meeting , and you 're trying to find points of overlap ,
Bmr009.D.dialogueact315	637.152	639.992	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but we don't really know which speaker is overlapping with which speaker ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact317	640.297	640.597	C	Professor	s^aa^m	-1	0	Right .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact316	639.992	640.232	D	PhD	qy^d^g	-1	0	right ?
Bmr009.D.dialogueact319	641.037	648.6	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	So I mean another way would just be to take the speech from just , say , Morgan , And just Jane and then just their overlaps ,
Bmr009.E.dialogueact318	640.631	640.841	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact320	648.81	649.96	D	PhD	s	-1	0	like {disfmarker} but by hand ,
Bmr009.D.dialogueact321	650.02	650.54	D	PhD	s	-1	0	by cheating ,
Bmr009.D.dialogueact322	651.18	653.58	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	and looking at you know , if you can detect something that way ,
Bmr009.D.dialogueact323	653.58	657.57	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because if we can't do it that way , there 's no good way that we 're going to be able to do it .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact324	656.025	656.465	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	No prayer .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact325	657.57	666.194	D	PhD	s	-1	0	That {disfmarker} You know , there might be something helpful and cleaner about looking at just {pause} individuals and then that combination alone .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact326	665.968	666.128	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact327	666.6	670.541	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Plus , I think it has more elegant {disfmarker} e
Bmr009.C.dialogueact328	667.662	668.062	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact329	670.631	673.421	D	PhD	s	-1	0	The m the right model will be {pause} easier to see that way .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact330	673.9	680.883	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So if {disfmarker} I don't know , if you go through and you find Adam , cuz he has a lot of overlaps and some other speaker who also has e enough speech
Bmr009.E.dialogueact331	676.071	676.221	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact332	680.883	686.264	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	and just sort of look at those three cases of Adam and the other person and the overlaps ,
Bmr009.E.dialogueact333	683.203	683.393	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact334	686.264	686.774	D	PhD	%--	-1	0	maybe {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact335	687.65	691.2	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and just look at the distributions , maybe there is a clear pattern
Bmr009.E.dialogueact336	689.384	689.664	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact338	691.2	696.97	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but we just can't see it because there 's too many combinations of {disfmarker} of people that can overlap .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact337	690.745	691.135	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact339	695.891	696.261	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact340	697.8	700.21	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I had the same intuition last {disfmarker} last {disfmarker} last week .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact341	698.418	698.818	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact343	699.769	701.319	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Just seems sort of complex .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact342	699.348	699.518	E	PhD	qy^bh^rt	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact344	700.38	703.23	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I think it 's {disfmarker} to start with it 's s your {disfmarker} your idea of simplifying ,
Bmr009.B.dialogueact345	703.34	707.69	B	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	starting with something that {pause} you can see {pause} eh you know without the {pause} extra {pause} layers of {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact346	708.081	708.331	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	Right .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact347	708.331	710.181	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Cuz if energy doesn't matter there , like {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact348	710.524	711.974	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I don't think this is true , but what if

Bmr009.B.dialogueact354	715.04	717.16	B	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	Well , you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you don't have to study everybody individually
Bmr009.D.dialogueact355	715.055	719.095	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Well , to study the simplest case to get rid of extra {disfmarker}

Bmr009.D.dialogueact360	720.936	723.396	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Cuz what if it 's the case and I don't think this is true {disfmarker}
Bmr009.A.dialogueact361	722.62	724.25	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	That was a great overlap by the way .

Bmr009.A.dialogueact372	738.97	742.13	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , but {disfmarker} But I think that 's what I was saying about different types of overlap .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact373	739.186	739.536	B	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .

Bmr009.D.dialogueact375	743.029	745.52	D	PhD	s	-1	0	There are {disfmarker} there are different types ,

Bmr009.D.dialogueact377	747.35	750.1	D	PhD	s	-1	0	like as Jose was saying , that {pause} sounded like a backchannel overlap ,
Bmr009.D.dialogueact378	750.1	753.17	D	PhD	s:s	-1	0	meaning the kind that 's {pause} a friendly encouragement , like " Mm - hmm . " ,

Bmr009.D.dialogueact383	757.797	762.795	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Um , but , some of those , as you showed , I think can be discriminated by the duration of the overlap .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact384	763.317	763.497	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact385	763.82	764.2	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact386	765.472	771.121	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	It {disfmarker} Actually the s new student , Don , who um Adam has met , and he was at one of our meetings {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact387	771.121	775.241	D	PhD	s	-1	0	He 's {pause} getting his feet wet and then he 'll be starting again {pause} in mid - January .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact388	775.241	778.101	D	PhD	s	-1	0	He 's interested in trying to distinguish the types of overlap .

Bmr009.D.dialogueact391	780.016	782.606	D	PhD	s	-1	0	But in sort of honing in on these different types
Bmr009.E.dialogueact390	779.84	780.11	E	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact392	780.552	783.112	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I don't consi Now I don't consider that possibility .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact393	782.606	784.423	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and {disfmarker} So maybe {disfmarker}
Bmr009.E.dialogueact394	783.458	790.644	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	This is a s a general studio of the overlapping we 're studying the {disfmarker} i

Bmr009.D.dialogueact396	787.556	793.458	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	So it might be something that we can {pause} help by categorizing some of them and then , you know , look at that .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact398	796.062	798.412	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because {pause} it would be the quickest thing for him to do .

Bmr009.C.dialogueact401	800.823	802.183	C	Professor	s	-1	0	he has the histogram mechanism ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact402	802.536	803.616	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	he has the stuff that subtracts out {disfmarker}

Bmr009.C.dialogueact404	810.927	812.804	C	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	And then he should go on and do the other stuff bec
Bmr009.C.dialogueact406	812.804	813.612	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	but {disfmarker} But this will {disfmarker}

Bmr009.D.dialogueact407	813.132	815.782	D	PhD	fg|s^ar	-1	0	Yeah , no . I didn't mean that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} for you to do that ,
Bmr009.D.dialogueact408	815.782	819.526	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	but I was thinking if {disfmarker} if Don and I are trying to get {pause} categories

Bmr009.D.dialogueact420	829.371	831.951	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	Yeah , that we would be working on anyway .

Bmr009.D.dialogueact423	832.361	836.811	D	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	Then maybe {pause} you can try some different things for those three cases , and see if that helps , or {disfmarker}
Bmr009.E.dialogueact422	832.137	832.537	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact424	834.602	834.992	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact425	836.068	841.675	E	PhD	s	+1	0	This is the thing I {disfmarker} I comment with you before , that uh we have a great variation of th situation of overlapping .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact426	842.097	842.817	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact427	842.184	847.919	E	PhD	s	-1	0	And the behavior for energy is , uh log energy , {vocalsound} is not uh the same all the time .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact428	848.15	848.67	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact429	848.398	848.828	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact430	849.179	863.661	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But I guess I was just saying that {disfmarker} that right now uh from the means that you gave , I don't have any sense of whether even , you know , there are any significant number of cases for which there is distinct {disfmarker}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact431	863.661	870.051	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and I would imagine there should be some {disfmarker} you know , there should be {disfmarker} The distributions should be somewhat separated .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact432	865.343	865.633	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact433	870.388	870.568	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact434	871.03	879.44	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Uh and I {disfmarker} I would still guess that if they are not separated at all , that there 's some {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's most likely something wrong in the way that we 're measuring it .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact435	875.976	876.216	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact436	879.086	879.326	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact438	880.205	891.941	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	Um , but {pause} um For instance , I mean I wouldn't expect that it was very common overall , that when two people were talking at the same time , that it would {disfmarker} that it really was lower ,
Bmr009.E.dialogueact437	879.98	880.14	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact440	891.941	893.691	C	Professor	s	-1	0	although sometimes , as you say , it would .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact439	891.812	891.892	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact443	894.394	895.224	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	So . So .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact442	894.383	896.073	D	PhD	fg|s^df.%--	-1	0	Yeah , no , that was {disfmarker} That was a jok
Bmr009.E.dialogueact441	894.044	894.204	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact445	896.284	896.524	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact444	896.073	903.811	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	or a sort of , a case where {disfmarker} where you would never know that unless you actually go and look at two individuals .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact446	898.143	898.383	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean .

Bmr009.C.dialogueact448	898.513	899.923	C	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	It could {disfmarker} it probably does happen sometimes .

Bmr009.A.dialogueact451	902.559	902.769	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact450	902.351	902.621	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact452	902.943	903.133	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact454	903.563	904.653	A	Grad	qy	-1	0	Mind if I turned that light off ?
Bmr009.E.dialogueact453	903.415	903.595	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact455	903.931	904.061	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	So .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact456	904.653	905.953	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	The flickering is annoying me .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact457	906.13	906.5	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact458	907.299	912.799	D	PhD	s	-1	0	It might the case , though , that the significant energy , just as Jose was saying , comes in the non - backchannel cases .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact459	913.24	918.24	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Because in back Most people when they 're talking don't change their own {pause} energy when they get a backchannel ,
Bmr009.D.dialogueact460	918.24	919.97	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	cuz they 're not really predicting the backchannel .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact461	919.728	920.078	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact462	920.3	922.41	D	PhD	s	-1	0	And sometimes it 's a nod and sometimes it 's an " mm - hmm " .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact463	921.851	922.091	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact464	922.83	925.87	D	PhD	s	-1	0	And the " mm - hmm " is really usually very low energy .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact465	925.621	925.821	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact466	926.351	929.331	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	So maybe those don't actually have much difference in energy .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact467	929.331	931.501	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	But {pause} all the other cases might .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact469	931.851	939.71	C	Professor	s	-1	0	e {vocalsound} e and {disfmarker} and again what they {disfmarker} what difference there was would kind of be lost in taking the log ,
Bmr009.D.dialogueact468	931.691	934.831	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and the backchannels are sort of easy to spot s in terms of their words or {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact470	935.041	936.131	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , just listen to it .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact471	935.19	935.45	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact472	936.131	936.281	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact473	939.71	939.99	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact476	941.153	941.533	C	Professor	s	-1	0	as well .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact474	940.68	942.71	D	PhD	s^aap	-1	0	Well , it would be lost {pause} no matter what you do .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact475	940.7	941.2	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr009.E.dialogueact477	941.771	942.101	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact478	942.71	942.95	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	It just {disfmarker}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact479	943.699	944.369	C	Professor	s^ar^rt	-1	0	Mmm , no ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact480	944.369	945.779	C	Professor	s^df.%-	-1	0	if it 's {disfmarker} if i if it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr009.A.dialogueact481	945.798	946.138	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	Tone
Bmr009.C.dialogueact482	945.859	946.699	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , it won't be as big .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact483	946.418	950.928	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , even if you take the log , you can {disfmarker} your model just has a more sensitive {pause} measures .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact484	948.124	948.554	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact485	949.935	951.845	A	Grad	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	Sure , but tone might be very
Bmr009.D.dialogueact486	950.928	951.008	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact487	952.563	954.713	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Yeah , you 're " mm - hmm " tone is going to be very different .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact488	952.603	952.963	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact489	953.962	955.288	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right . Right .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact490	956.082	961.332	A	Grad	s	-1	0	You could imagine doing specialized ones for different types of backchannels , if you could {disfmarker} if you had a good model for it .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact491	962.47	963.53	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Your " mm - hmm " detector .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact492	962.706	969.346	C	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	If {disfmarker} if you 're {disfmarker} a I guess my point is , if you 're doing essentially a linear separation , taking the log first does in fact make it harder to separate .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact493	969.047	969.297	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact495	970.215	975.015	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	So it 's {disfmarker} So , uh if you i i So i if there {disfmarker} if there close to things it does
Bmr009.E.dialogueact494	969.962	970.102	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact496	973.52	973.97	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact497	975.464	977.854	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it 's a nonlinear operation that does in fact change the distinction .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact498	977.854	980.124	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	If you 're doing a non if you 're doing some fancy thing then {disfmarker} then
Bmr009.C.dialogueact499	980.124	980.284	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact500	980.697	984.827	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And right now we 're essentially doing this linear thing by looking across here and {disfmarker} and saying we 're going to cut it here .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact501	985.613	987.903	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Um and that {disfmarker} that 's the indicator that we 're getting .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact502	988.225	990.095	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But anyway , yeah , we 're not {pause} disagreeing on any of this ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact503	990.095	999.914	C	Professor	s	-1	0	we should look at it more uh {disfmarker} more finely , but uh uh I think that {disfmarker} This often happens , you do fairly complicated things , and then you stand back from them and you realize that you haven't done something simple .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact504	999.914	1011.7	C	Professor	s	+1	0	So uh , if you generated something like that just for the energy and see , and then , a a a as {disfmarker} as Liz says , when they g have uh uh smaller um , more coherent groups to look at , that would be another interesting thing later .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact505	1007.64	1008.05	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact507	1012.2	1018.46	C	Professor	s^rt	+1	1	And then that should give us some indication {disfmarker} between those , should give us some indication of whether there 's anything to be achieved f from energy at all .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact506	1012.12	1012.57	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact508	1019.11	1022.29	C	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	And then you can move on to the uh {pause} uh more {nonvocalsound} pitch related stuff .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact509	1021.03	1021.41	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact510	1022.12	1023.6	E	PhD	s^ba	+1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think this is a good idea .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact511	1024.1	1024.31	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact513	1024.76	1025.33	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact512	1024.41	1026.02	E	PhD	s	+1	1	Not consider the log energy .

Bmr009.C.dialogueact515	1026.8	1027.17	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But then the {disfmarker}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact516	1027.17	1029.51	C	Professor	qy	-1	0	Have you started looking at the pitch related {pause} stuff at all ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact517	1029.51	1029.54	C	Professor	qr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bmr009.C.dialogueact519	1030.16	1031.12	C	Professor	s^r^rt	-1	0	Pitch {pause} related ?

Bmr009.C.dialogueact530	1052.06	1056.12	C	Professor	s	-1	0	I certainly wasn't saying this was better than the harmonicity and pitch related things
Bmr009.C.dialogueact531	1056.12	1056.96	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	I was just saying
Bmr009.E.dialogueact532	1056.8	1058.52	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I go on with the {disfmarker} with the pitch ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact533	1057.97	1058.35	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact534	1058.52	1059.24	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	aha ! {pause} OK .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact535	1059.76	1060.69	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	Yeah , I was just saying {disfmarker}
Bmr009.E.dialogueact536	1059.9	1069.16	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I understood uh that eh {pause} I {disfmarker} I had to finish {pause} by the moment with the {vocalsound} and {disfmarker} and concentrate my {disfmarker} my energy in that problem .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact537	1067.79	1068.16	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact538	1068.67	1069.97	C	Professor	fg	-1	0	OK . {vocalsound} OK .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact539	1069.97	1073.58	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But I think , like , all these derivatives and second derivatives and all these other very fancy things ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact540	1073.58	1078.3	C	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	I think I would just sort of look at the energy {pause} and then get into the harmonicity as {disfmarker} as a suggestion .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact541	1076.73	1077.21	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact542	1077.21	1079.26	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I go on with the pitch .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact543	1079.42	1081.43	C	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	Uh OK .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact544	1081.43	1084.78	C	Professor	s^t	-1	0	So maybe uh since w we 're trying to uh compress the meeting ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact545	1085.35	1088.56	C	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	um , I know Adam had some form stuff he wanted to talk about
Bmr009.C.dialogueact546	1088.83	1089.68	C	Professor	qo^rt.%--	-1	0	and did you have some ?
Bmr009.B.dialogueact547	1089.98	1092.4	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I wanted to ask just s something on the end of this top topic .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact548	1092.4	1099.55	B	Postdoc	s	+1	0	So , when I presented my results about the uh distribution of overlaps and the speakers and the profiles of the speakers , at the bottom of that I did have a proposal ,
Bmr009.E.dialogueact549	1097.71	1097.99	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact550	1099.55	1107.44	B	Postdoc	s	+1	2	and I had plan to go through with it , of {disfmarker} of co coding the types of overlaps that people were involved in s just with reference to speaker style so , you know , with reference {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact551	1106.28	1106.69	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact553	1107.44	1109.26	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and you know I said that on my {disfmarker} in my summary ,
Bmr009.D.dialogueact552	1107.2	1107.8	D	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That 'd be great .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact555	1109.26	1114.18	B	Postdoc	s^rt	+1	0	that {pause} you know so it 's like people may have different amounts of being overlapped with or overlapping

Bmr009.D.dialogueact556	1109.6	1109.89	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact557	1114.54	1118.61	B	Postdoc	s	+1	0	but that in itself is not informative without knowing what types of overlaps they 're involved in
Bmr009.B.dialogueact558	1118.61	1122.42	B	Postdoc	s	+1	2	so I was planning to do a taxonomy of types overlaps with reference to that .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact559	1121.14	1121.98	D	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That would be great .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact562	1122.87	1127.23	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So , but it you know it 's like it sounds like you also have uh something in that direction .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact561	1122.42	1123.38	D	PhD	s^ba^r	-1	0	That would be really great .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact560	1122.28	1122.68	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact563	1123.38	1123.82	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact564	1127.23	1127.86	B	Postdoc	qy.%-	-1	0	Is {disfmarker} is it {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact565	1127.43	1128.52	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	We have nothing {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact566	1128.52	1131.37	D	PhD	s	-1	0	You know , basically , we got {pause} his environment set up .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact567	1131.37	1133.85	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	He 's {disfmarker} he 's a double - E {comment} you know .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact568	1133.85	1140.63	D	PhD	s^df^rt	-1	0	So . It 's mostly that , {pause} if we had to {pause} label it ourselves , we {disfmarker} we would or we 'd have to , to get started ,
Bmr009.D.dialogueact569	1140.63	1143.29	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	but if {disfmarker} {pause} It {disfmarker} it would be much better if you can do it .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact570	1143.29	1145.13	D	PhD	s	-1	0	You 'd be much better {comment} at doing it also
Bmr009.D.dialogueact571	1145.13	1150.94	D	PhD	s	-1	0	because {vocalsound} you know , I {disfmarker} I 'm not {disfmarker} I don't have a good feel for how they should be sorted out ,
Bmr009.B.dialogueact572	1148.1	1148.42	B	Postdoc	s^ba^t1	-1	0	Interesting .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact573	1150.94	1154.01	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and I really didn't wanna go into that if I didn't have to .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact574	1154.05	1156.46	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So if {disfmarker} If you 're w willing to do that or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker}
Bmr009.A.dialogueact576	1155.8	1161.47	A	Grad	s	-1	0	It would be interesting , though , to talk , maybe not at the meeting , but at some other time about what are the classes .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact575	1155.48	1156.09	B	Postdoc	s^cs.%-	-1	0	Well maybe we can
Bmr009.B.dialogueact577	1156.09	1156.3	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact578	1157.16	1157.34	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact579	1158.61	1158.82	B	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact580	1158.98	1159.47	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact582	1161.8	1162.14	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact583	1162.21	1164.2	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I think that 's a research {pause} effort in and of itself ,
Bmr009.E.dialogueact581	1161.74	1161.93	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact584	1164.16	1164.95	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Yeah , it would be interesting .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact585	1164.2	1167.38	D	PhD	s	-1	0	because you can read the literature , but I don't know how it 'll {pause} turn out
Bmr009.E.dialogueact586	1165.01	1165.28	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact587	1167.38	1169.87	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and , You know , it 's always an interesting question .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact589	1168.24	1172.35	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It seems like we also s with reference to a purpose , too , that we we 'd want to have them coded .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact588	1167.77	1169.33	E	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	I would think it 's interesting , yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact590	1170.48	1170.83	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact591	1171.51	1172.25	D	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That 'd be great .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact593	1172.37	1172.6	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact592	1172.16	1172.39	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact595	1173.52	1173.89	B	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact594	1173.08	1173.67	D	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That 'd be really great .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact597	1174.03	1174.73	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I can do that .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact596	1173.67	1177.11	D	PhD	s	-1	0	And we 'd still have some {pause} funding for this project ,
Bmr009.E.dialogueact598	1174.93	1175.48	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	uh uh
Bmr009.D.dialogueact599	1177.11	1183.95	D	PhD	s	-1	0	like probably , if we had to hire some {disfmarker} like an undergrad , because uh Don is being covered half time on something else {disfmarker}
Bmr009.B.dialogueact600	1183.23	1183.69	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact601	1184.15	1188.57	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , he {disfmarker} we 're not paying him {pause} the full RA - ship for {disfmarker} all the time .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact602	1188.57	1192.96	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So . {vocalsound} um If we got it to where we wanted {disfmarker} we needed someone to do that {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact603	1192.96	1195.58	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I don't think there 's really enough data where {disfmarker} where {disfmarker}
Bmr009.B.dialogueact604	1194.74	1194.92	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact605	1195.18	1199.54	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Yeah , I see this as a prototype , to use the only the {disfmarker} the already transcribed meeting as just a prototype .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact606	1195.2	1195.69	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact607	1196.59	1197.24	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact608	1198.51	1203.11	E	PhD	s	+1	0	I {disfmarker} I think a a another parameter we c we {disfmarker} we can consider is eh the {pause} duration .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact609	1200.07	1200.32	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	But {disfmarker}
Bmr009.A.dialogueact610	1203.74	1204.01	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact611	1204.12	1208.37	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Another e e m besides eh the {disfmarker} the class of overlap , the duration .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact612	1208.69	1214.76	E	PhD	s	+1	0	Because is possible {vocalsound} eh some s s um eh some classes eh has eh {pause} a type of a duration ,
Bmr009.E.dialogueact613	1214.76	1221.32	E	PhD	s	-1	0	eh , {pause} a duration very short uh when we have {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we have overlapping with speech .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact614	1215.82	1216.31	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact615	1217.98	1218.62	D	PhD	s^bk^t1	-1	0	Yeah , definitely .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact616	1218.6	1220.06	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Yeah , maybe {disfmarker} It may be correlated .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact618	1221.94	1222.33	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact617	1221.86	1223.26	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Is possible to have .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact619	1223.59	1229.1	E	PhD	s	-1	0	And it 's interesting , {pause} I think , {pause} to consider the {disfmarker} the window of normalization ,
Bmr009.E.dialogueact620	1229.73	1230.54	E	PhD	s	-1	0	normalization window .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact621	1231.34	1241.46	E	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	Eh {pause} because eh if we have a type of , {pause} a kind of eh overlap , eh backchannel overlap , with a short duration , is possible {pause} eh to normali
Bmr009.E.dialogueact622	1241.46	1255.66	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i i that if we normalize eh with eh {pause} eh consider only the {disfmarker} the eh window eh by the left eh ri eh {pause} side on the right side overlapping with a {disfmarker} a very {pause} eh oh a small window
Bmr009.E.dialogueact623	1257.55	1265.91	E	PhD	s	-1	0	eh the {disfmarker} if the fit of normalization is eh mmm bigger eh in that overlapping zone eh very short
Bmr009.B.dialogueact624	1267.15	1267.5	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact625	1267.53	1268.19	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , that 's true .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact626	1268.3	1270.51	D	PhD	s^bs	-1	0	The window shouldn't be larger than the backchannel .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact627	1269.48	1271.16	E	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I me I {disfmarker} I understand .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact628	1271.39	1277.26	E	PhD	s	+1	0	I mean that you have eh you have a backchannel , eh , eh {disfmarker} you have a overlapping zone very short
Bmr009.D.dialogueact629	1272.07	1272.39	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact630	1277.93	1285.42	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and you consider eh n eh all the channel to normalize this very short eh {disfmarker}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact631	1282.96	1283.46	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact632	1285.07	1285.61	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact633	1285.42	1288.13	E	PhD	s:s	-1	0	for example " mmm mm - hmm hmm " eh
Bmr009.E.dialogueact634	1288.56	1290.48	E	PhD	s	-1	0	And the energy is not eh height
Bmr009.E.dialogueact635	1291.24	1301.56	E	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	eh I think if you consider all the channel to normalize and the channel is {pause} mmm bigger {pause} eh eh eh compared with the {disfmarker} with the overlapping eh duration ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact636	1296.44	1296.8	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact637	1301.56	1304.97	E	PhD	s	-1	0	eh the effect is mmm stronger
Bmr009.E.dialogueact638	1304.97	1319.68	E	PhD	s	+1	0	eh {pause} that I {disfmarker} I mean the {disfmarker} the e effect of the normalization eh with the mean and the {disfmarker} and the variance eh is different that if you consider {pause} only a {pause} window compared eh with the n the duration of overlapping .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact639	1311.53	1311.99	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact641	1321.12	1323.45	C	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	You {disfmarker} you want it around the overlapping part .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact640	1320.93	1321.18	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	Not {disfmarker}
Bmr009.E.dialogueact643	1323.45	1323.67	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact642	1323.45	1325.64	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	You want it to include something that 's not in overlapping
Bmr009.E.dialogueact644	1324.37	1324.66	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact647	1326.02	1326.62	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact645	1325.73	1326.6	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but uh
Bmr009.E.dialogueact646	1325.79	1325.99	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact648	1326.63	1327.31	E	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I don't know .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact650	1327.48	1327.77	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact649	1327.36	1329.22	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	Is {disfmarker} s If {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact651	1328.35	1329.54	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Well it 's a sliding window ,
Bmr009.D.dialogueact652	1329.54	1329.8	D	PhD	qy^d^g	-1	0	right ?
Bmr009.D.dialogueact653	1329.8	1335.58	D	PhD	s	-1	0	So if you take the {disfmarker} the measure in the center of the overlapped {pause} piece , you know , there 'd better be some something .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact654	1330.83	1331.4	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact655	1331.42	1331.73	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact656	1332.9	1333.15	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact657	1335.58	1337.9	D	PhD	s	-1	0	But if your window is really huge then yeah you 're right
Bmr009.D.dialogueact658	1337.9	1338.53	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	you won't even {disfmarker}
Bmr009.E.dialogueact659	1338.19	1347.06	E	PhD	s	-1	0	Yeah , This is the {disfmarker} This is the {disfmarker} the idea , {vocalsound} to consider only the {disfmarker} the small window near {disfmarker} near {disfmarker} near the {disfmarker} the overlapping zone .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact660	1338.93	1343.01	D	PhD	s	-1	0	The portion of the {disfmarker} {comment} of the backchannel won't {disfmarker} won't effect anything .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact661	1343.33	1343.66	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	But you {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact662	1343.66	1344.88	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact663	1345.12	1345.52	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	So .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact664	1346.99	1348.24	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	You know , you shouldn't be more than
Bmr009.D.dialogueact665	1348.61	1352.99	D	PhD	s	-1	0	like {disfmarker} {pause} You should definitely not be three times as big as your {disfmarker} as your {pause} backchannel .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact666	1352.16	1352.45	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact668	1353.02	1353.5	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact667	1352.99	1354.29	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Then you 're gonna w have a wash .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact669	1354.29	1356.39	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And hopefully it 's more like on the order of {disfmarker}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact670	1355.23	1357.06	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I 'm not sure that 's {pause} necessarily true .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact671	1356.67	1356.89	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah ?
Bmr009.B.dialogueact672	1357.59	1359.33	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	It is an empirical question , it seems like .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact674	1358.54	1363.63	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Because {disfmarker} because it {disfmarker} because um again if you 're just compensating for the gain ,
Bmr009.D.dialogueact673	1358.32	1358.69	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	Yea
Bmr009.E.dialogueact675	1358.89	1359.09	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact676	1359.85	1360.07	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact677	1363.63	1365.7	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you know , the fact that this {disfmarker} this gain thing was crude ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact678	1366.3	1374.26	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	and the gain wh if someone is speaking relatively at consistent level , just to {disfmarker} to give a {disfmarker} an extreme example , all you 're doing is compensating for that .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact679	1375.08	1381.38	C	Professor	s	-1	0	And then you still s And then if you look at the frame with respect to that , it still should {disfmarker} should uh change
Bmr009.D.dialogueact680	1382.1	1385.8	D	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , it depends how different your normalization is , as you slide your window across .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact682	1385.84	1386.28	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact681	1385.8	1386.99	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean . That 's something we don't know .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact683	1387.42	1388.74	B	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	It 's possible to try it both ways ,
Bmr009.A.dialogueact684	1387.98	1390.49	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Well , I mean we 're also talking about a couple of different things .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact685	1388.74	1389.09	B	Postdoc	qy^g	-1	0	isn't it ?
Bmr009.B.dialogueact686	1389.09	1390.0	B	Postdoc	s^t1.%--	-1	0	in this small
Bmr009.A.dialogueact687	1390.49	1394.79	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , one is your analysis window and then the other is any sort of normalization that you 're doing .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact688	1394.42	1396.45	D	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah I was talking about the n normalization window .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact689	1395.54	1397.36	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And the {disfmarker} And they could be quite different .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact691	1397.86	1398.06	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact690	1397.4	1397.65	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr009.C.dialogueact693	1398.49	1400.55	C	Professor	s	-1	0	This was sort of where {disfmarker} where we were last week .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact696	1399.53	1399.7	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact694	1399.09	1399.36	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact695	1399.43	1400.74	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	That 's true . Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact697	1400.55	1402.95	C	Professor	s^co^t	-1	0	But , anyway We {disfmarker} we 'll have to look at some core things .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact700	1402.25	1402.51	B	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact698	1402.04	1402.32	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	Um .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact701	1402.6	1404.67	D	PhD	s^ba.%--	-1	0	But that 'd be great if {disfmarker} if you 're marking those
Bmr009.E.dialogueact699	1402.18	1402.57	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact703	1405.0	1405.19	B	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Great .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact702	1404.76	1405.79	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker} um .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact704	1405.5	1405.7	B	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact706	1406.17	1409.07	D	PhD	s	+1	1	But it is definitely true that we need to have the time marks ,
Bmr009.E.dialogueact705	1405.71	1405.89	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact707	1409.17	1409.46	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact708	1409.57	1423.39	D	PhD	s	+1	1	and I was assuming that will be inherited because , if you have the words and they 're roughly aligned in time via forced alignment or whatever we end up using , then you know , this {pause} student and I would be looking at the time marks
Bmr009.B.dialogueact709	1411.84	1412.56	B	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yep , I agree .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact710	1414.76	1415.06	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact712	1423.52	1424.74	B	Postdoc	s^2.%-	-1	0	Coming off of the other {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact711	1423.39	1427.58	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and classifying all the frames inside those as whatever labels Jane gave
Bmr009.E.dialogueact713	1424.64	1424.9	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact714	1426.51	1426.74	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Good .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact715	1426.74	1429.46	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So , it wouldn't be {pause} I wasn't planning to label the time marks .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact716	1428.0	1430.0	D	PhD	s	-1	0	
Bmr009.E.dialogueact717	1429.14	1431.24	E	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	I can give you my transcription file ,
Bmr009.B.dialogueact718	1429.76	1432.36	B	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	I was thinking that that would come from the engineering side ,
Bmr009.D.dialogueact719	1430.57	1431.75	D	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I don't think you need to .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact720	1431.35	1431.52	E	PhD	qy^d^g	-1	0	no ?
Bmr009.B.dialogueact721	1432.36	1432.6	B	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact722	1432.63	1436.03	D	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah . That should be linked to the words which are linked to time somehow ,
Bmr009.B.dialogueact723	1435.68	1436.05	B	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	There you go .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact725	1436.23	1438.74	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Well we 're not any time soon going to get a forced alignment .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact724	1436.04	1436.25	D	PhD	qy^d^g	-1	0	right ?
Bmr009.D.dialogueact726	1437.74	1438.47	D	PhD	s^aap	-1	0	Not now .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact727	1438.84	1439.35	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact728	1439.44	1439.61	E	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact729	1440.32	1443.76	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Um If it 's not hand - marked then we 're not going to get the times .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact730	1441.53	1442.41	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Well , it 's something that w
Bmr009.D.dialogueact731	1444.48	1447.73	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	Well , we {disfmarker} we wouldn't be able to do any work without a forced alignment anyway ,
Bmr009.E.dialogueact732	1444.93	1445.16	E	PhD	%-	-1	0	Yes
Bmr009.D.dialogueact733	1447.73	1451.65	D	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	so somehow if {disfmarker} once he gets going we 're gonna hafta come up with one
Bmr009.C.dialogueact735	1451.68	1451.95	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact734	1451.65	1451.91	D	PhD	%--	-1	0	and
Bmr009.D.dialogueact736	1452.13	1452.28	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact738	1452.93	1456.18	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean w I guess we could do a very bad one with Broadcast News .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact737	1452.92	1453.93	B	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Good . Good .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact739	1453.21	1456.29	D	PhD	s	-1	0	So whatever you would label would be attached to the words , I think .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact740	1456.09	1456.38	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Great !
Bmr009.B.dialogueact741	1456.47	1456.82	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Good , good .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact743	1457.01	1457.17	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact742	1456.69	1456.87	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact744	1457.45	1464.03	C	Professor	s	-1	0	Well again for the close {pause} mike stuff , we could come up {disfmarker} take a s take the Switchboard system or something ,
Bmr009.A.dialogueact745	1460.0	1460.82	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	That might be good enough .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact746	1463.49	1463.75	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact747	1464.03	1465.7	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker} Um
Bmr009.A.dialogueact748	1466.18	1466.83	A	Grad	s	-1	0	It 'd be worth a try .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact749	1466.83	1468.21	A	Grad	s	-1	0	It would be interesting to see what we get .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact750	1468.48	1470.35	C	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	Just , you know , low - pass filter the speech and {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact751	1469.04	1471.25	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Cuz there 's {disfmarker} there 's a lot of work you can't do without that ,
Bmr009.D.dialogueact752	1471.25	1472.8	D	PhD	qh.%--	-1	0	I mean , how {disfmarker} how would you {disfmarker}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact753	1472.25	1472.44	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact754	1473.37	1477.12	D	PhD	s	-1	0	You 'd have to go in and measure every start and stop point next to a word
Bmr009.A.dialogueact757	1477.3	1477.55	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact756	1477.16	1478.27	B	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	It would be very inefficient .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact755	1477.12	1478.99	D	PhD	s	-1	0	is y if you 're interested in anything to do with words .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact758	1477.96	1478.42	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact760	1479.15	1479.42	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .

Bmr009.D.dialogueact761	1479.88	1481.03	D	PhD	s^tc|s^ba	-1	0	Anyway {pause} So that 'd be great .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact762	1481.26	1481.74	B	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Good . OK .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact763	1482.36	1482.42	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact764	1483.93	1486.39	C	Professor	s^t^tc	-1	0	There 's something we should talk about later
Bmr009.C.dialogueact765	1486.39	1487.67	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but maybe not just now .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact766	1488.88	1495.04	C	Professor	s^co	-1	0	But , uh , should talk about our options as far as the uh uh {pause} transcription

Bmr009.B.dialogueact787	1518.11	1519.62	B	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	How {disfmarker} So it 's two pages per person ?
Bmr009.A.dialogueact788	1519.77	1519.97	A	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	Nope .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact789	1520.51	1521.31	A	Grad	s	-1	0	One 's a digit form ,
Bmr009.A.dialogueact790	1521.31	1522.11	A	Grad	s	-1	0	one 's a speaker form .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact791	1522.66	1522.88	B	Postdoc	s^bk^fe^rt	-1	0	Oh !
Bmr009.A.dialogueact792	1523.47	1526.83	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So one is a one time only {pause} speaker form and the other is the digits .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact793	1523.57	1524.21	B	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , I see .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact794	1525.03	1525.69	E	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	Oh it 's the same .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact795	1525.89	1526.31	E	PhD	s^t1	-1	0	Oh no no .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact796	1526.31	1527.43	E	PhD	s^t1	-1	0	Is {disfmarker} is new Is OK .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact797	1527.03	1528.01	A	Grad	s^co	-1	0	So don't fill these out .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact798	1529.13	1529.46	B	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Alright .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact799	1529.67	1533.37	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	This is just the suggestion for uh what the new forms would look like .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact800	1534.98	1537.56	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So , they incorporate the changes {pause} that we talked about .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact801	1539.69	1540.4	B	Postdoc	s^t1	-1	0	Date and time .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact802	1541.13	1543.8	B	Postdoc	qw^rt	-1	0	Uh why did you switch the order of the Date and Time fields ?
Bmr009.B.dialogueact803	1543.8	1545.08	B	Postdoc	s^bd.%-	-1	0	This is rather a low - level , but
Bmr009.A.dialogueact804	1544.45	1545.04	A	Grad	qw^d	-1	0	On which one ?
Bmr009.B.dialogueact805	1545.7	1548.1	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	On {disfmarker} on the new one , Time comes first and then Date ,
Bmr009.B.dialogueact806	1548.52	1549.11	B	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	but I thought {disfmarker}
Bmr009.A.dialogueact807	1549.47	1550.57	A	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Oh you mean on the digit form ?
Bmr009.B.dialogueact808	1549.94	1554.85	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	This is {disfmarker} this is rather a low level question , but {disfmarker} but it used {disfmarker} used to be Date came first .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact809	1551.66	1556.33	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Uh , because the user fills out the first three fields and I fill out the rest .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact810	1557.1	1557.64	B	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh I see .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact811	1558.24	1559.16	A	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	So it was intentional .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact812	1558.29	1562.86	B	Postdoc	qw	-1	0	Well , how would the {disfmarker} How would the user know the time if they didn't know the date ?
Bmr009.A.dialogueact813	1559.16	1560.42	A	Grad	s^ba^rt	-1	0	It 's an interesting observation ,
Bmr009.A.dialogueact814	1560.46	1561.4	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	but it was intentional .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact815	1563.68	1567.23	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	Because the date is when you actually read the digits and the time and ,
Bmr009.A.dialogueact816	1567.29	1567.67	A	Grad	s^fa	-1	0	excuse me ,
Bmr009.A.dialogueact817	1567.67	1570.92	A	Grad	s^bsc	-1	0	the time is when you actually read the digits , but I 'm filling out the date beforehand .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact818	1570.92	1576.55	A	Grad	s	-1	0	If you look at the form in front of you ? that you 're going to fill out when you read the digits ? you 'll see I 've already filled in the date but not the time .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact819	1572.65	1572.99	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact820	1576.8	1577.64	B	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	I always assumed {disfmarker}
Bmr009.B.dialogueact821	1577.72	1579.35	B	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	So the time is supposed to be pretty exact ,
Bmr009.B.dialogueact822	1579.35	1581.64	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	because I 've just been taking beginning time {disfmarker} time of the meeting .

Bmr009.E.dialogueact826	1582.5	1582.7	E	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact827	1583.09	1591.43	A	Grad	s	-1	0	The {disfmarker} the reason I put the time in , is so that the person who 's extracting the digits , meaning me , will know where to look in the meeting , to try to find the digits .

Bmr009.C.dialogueact987	1814.99	1827.99	C	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	You know , I think if you 're talking {disfmarker} if you 're thinking in terms of places , {pause} as opposed to {pause} names different peop names people have given to {pause} different ways of talking , {pause} I would think North Midwest , and South Midwest would be more common than saying Midland ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact988	1827.99	1828.3	C	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact989	1828.3	1829.93	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , I {disfmarker} I went to s
Bmr009.D.dialogueact990	1829.13	1830.54	D	PhD	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah . Now {pause} the usage {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact991	1830.77	1832.79	D	PhD	s^cs^rt	-1	0	Maybe we can give them a li {pause} like a little map ?
Bmr009.D.dialogueact992	1833.32	1834.39	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	with the regions and they just {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact993	1834.99	1835.61	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	No , I 'm serious .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact994	1835.92	1836.57	B	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	No , that 's not bad .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact997	1837.08	1837.29	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact995	1836.77	1839.68	D	PhD	s^df^rt	-1	0	Because it takes less time , and it 's sort of cute
Bmr009.E.dialogueact996	1836.95	1842.0	E	PhD	s^bu^ng	-1	0	i at this {disfmarker} {vocalsound} in that side {disfmarker} in that side of the {disfmarker} the paper .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact998	1839.68	1840.51	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	there 's no figure .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact999	1841.67	1842.07	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	Well .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1000	1841.7	1842.6	D	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	Well just a little {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1001	1842.6	1844.34	D	PhD	s	-1	0	You know , it doesn't have all the detail ,
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1002	1844.34	1845.0	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but you sort of {disfmarker}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact1003	1845.28	1847.81	C	Professor	qw^ng.%--	-1	0	But what if you moved five times and {disfmarker} and uh
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1004	1847.19	1850.88	B	Postdoc	s^cs.%--	-1	0	Well , I was thinking you could have ma multiple ones and then the amount of time {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1005	1847.64	1848.78	D	PhD	s^ar|s	-1	0	No , but you 're categorized .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1006	1849.12	1849.76	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	That 's the same {disfmarker}
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1007	1851.03	1851.71	B	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	so , roughly .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1008	1851.81	1856.43	B	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	So . You could say , {pause} you know " ten years {pause} on the east coast , five years on the west coast " or something or other .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1009	1854.16	1860.49	A	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	Well , We {disfmarker} I think we don't want to get that level of detail at this form .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1010	1860.49	1862.16	A	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	I think that 's alright if we want to follow up .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1011	1863.95	1864.21	A	Grad	%--	-1	0	But .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact1012	1865.05	1866.08	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I guess we don't really know .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1013	1865.66	1869.95	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	I mean I {disfmarker} As I said , I don't think there 's a huge {pause} benefit to this region thing .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1014	1869.95	1870.58	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	It {disfmarker} it gets {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1015	1871.55	1877.83	D	PhD	s	-1	0	The problem is that for some things it 's really clear and usually listening to {comment} it you can tell right away if it 's a New York or Boston accent ,
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1016	1877.84	1879.17	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but New York and Boston are two {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1017	1879.55	1880.67	D	PhD	s	-1	0	well , I guess they have the NYC ,
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1018	1880.67	1884.2	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but New England has a bunch of very different dialects
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1019	1884.2	1884.48	D	PhD	%--	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1020	1885.18	1885.49	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1021	1885.54	1889.56	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and {pause} so does um S So do other places .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1022	1888.15	1890.78	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	Yeah , so I picked these regions cuz we had talked about TIMIT ,
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1024	1890.78	1891.93	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and those are right from TIMIT .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1023	1890.32	1890.88	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1025	1890.88	1897.96	D	PhD	s	-1	0	And so these would be {pause} satisfying like a speech {pause} research {pause} community if we released the database ,
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1026	1892.78	1893.01	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1027	1898.17	1905.19	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but as to whether subjects know where they 're from , I 'm not sure because um I know that they had to fill this out for Switchboard .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1028	1905.19	1908.58	D	PhD	s	-1	0	This is i almost exactly the same as Switchboard regions
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1029	1908.24	1908.66	B	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh . OK .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1030	1908.58	1910.04	D	PhD	s	-1	0	or very close .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1031	1910.04	1910.33	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1032	1911.81	1914.2	D	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	Um And I don't know how they filled that out .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1033	1915.66	1916.77	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But th if Midland {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1034	1917.98	1921.35	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Yeah , Midland is the one that 's difficult I guess .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1035	1921.98	1922.66	B	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	I think a lot of people {disfmarker}
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1037	1922.66	1923.03	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1036	1922.38	1928.43	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Also Northwest you 've got Oreg - Washington and Oregon now which uh y people don't know if it 's western or northern .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1038	1928.73	1929.51	A	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Yeah , I certainly don't .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1039	1929.51	1931.21	A	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I mean , I was saying I don't even know what I speak .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1040	1930.05	1930.87	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	It 's like Northwest
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1042	1932.1	1934.74	A	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Am I speaking {disfmarker} Am I speaking Western ?

Bmr009.C.dialogueact1043	1936.4	1937.53	C	Professor	qw^r	-1	0	Well and what {disfmarker} and what 's Northern ?
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1044	1938.0	1942.37	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I think originally it was North {disfmarker} Northwest

Bmr009.D.dialogueact1279	2257.42	2257.8	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1281	2258.21	2259.99	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	because it is easier to have it open ended .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1280	2258.09	2259.06	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	It just {disfmarker} And we {disfmarker}

Bmr009.C.dialogueact1287	2271.27	2272.17	C	Professor	s	-1	0	But then it says " Region " ,
Bmr009.C.dialogueact1288	2272.17	2275.64	C	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	but Region actually just applies to uh , US ,

Bmr009.C.dialogueact1289	2275.64	2275.94	C	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1291	2277.19	2278.34	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean that 's why I put the " Other " in .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1292	2278.67	2279.47	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Well , we thought about it .

Bmr009.B.dialogueact1297	2282.98	2288.08	B	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	At the last meeting , my recollection was that {pause} we felt people would have uh less {disfmarker}
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1298	2288.08	2291.51	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that {disfmarker} that there are so many types and varieties of {pause} these other languages

Bmr009.B.dialogueact1300	2294.39	2297.8	B	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	and that it 's a huge waste of {disfmarker} of space .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact1302	2298.91	2299.15	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1303	2299.43	2302.81	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So I mean , I {disfmarker} I mean the way I had it last time {pause} was Region was blank ,
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1304	2299.48	2300.24	B	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	That 's what I thought .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1305	2302.81	2303.79	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	it just said Region colon .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1306	2304.0	2304.12	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1308	2305.05	2306.88	A	Grad	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and I think that that 's the best way to do it ,
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1307	2304.99	2305.24	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1309	2307.19	2308.87	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because {disfmarker} because of the problems we 're talking about
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1310	2308.87	2310.89	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	but what we said last week , was no , put in a list ,
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1311	2310.89	2311.68	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so I put in a list .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1313	2312.13	2313.04	A	Grad	qy.%-	-1	0	So should we go back to {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1312	2312.03	2314.18	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Maybe we can make the list a little smaller .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1314	2314.58	2318.19	A	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	Well , certainly dropping " Northern " I think is right , because none of us know what that is .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1315	2315.97	2316.64	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Cuz , I mean {disfmarker}

Bmr009.D.dialogueact1534	2599.14	2601.33	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	And it 's useful to have the {disfmarker}
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1535	2600.15	2604.73	A	Grad	s^cs.%--	-1	0	Why don't we {disfmarker} we see how Dan 's works and if it {disfmarker} If we really need the display {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1536	2602.11	2602.62	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1537	2605.89	2609.01	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean . I wonder {disfmarker} I 'm just wondering if we can display things other than the wave form .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1538	2609.01	2611.57	D	PhD	s	-1	0	So . Suppose we have a feature {disfmarker} a feature stream .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1539	2612.05	2616.56	D	PhD	s	-1	0	And it 's just , you know , a {disfmarker} a uni - dimensional feature , varying in time .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact1540	2612.15	2612.34	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1541	2617.62	2619.83	D	PhD	s	-1	0	And we want to plot that , instead of the whole wave form .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1542	2619.41	2619.57	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	I mean .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1544	2619.94	2620.91	D	PhD	s	-1	0	That might be faster .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact1543	2619.74	2620.09	E	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1545	2620.91	2621.09	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1548	2621.97	2624.67	A	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	We {disfmarker} we could do that but that would mean changing the code .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1547	2621.58	2621.72	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	So .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact1546	2621.28	2621.44	E	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1549	2625.2	2626.42	A	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean this isn't a program we wrote .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact1550	2625.39	2625.59	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1551	2626.49	2629.78	A	Grad	s	-1	0	This is a program that we got from someone else , and we 've done patches on .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1552	2628.71	2629.3	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1554	2630.41	2630.76	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1553	2630.17	2632.17	D	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	OK . Well , I 'll talk to you about it and we can see
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1557	2630.92	2631.17	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact1556	2630.77	2632.93	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	Cou - i e I mean , y
Bmr009.E.dialogueact1555	2630.5	2630.72	E	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1558	2631.6	2631.75	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1559	2632.17	2634.19	D	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	but it 's definitely {pause} great to have the other one .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact1561	2634.67	2642.57	C	Professor	s^bu^cs^rt	-1	0	If there was some {disfmarker} Is there some way to {pause} have someone write patches in something faster and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} link it in , or something ?
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1560	2634.19	2634.31	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	That 's {disfmarker}
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1563	2642.65	2643.33	A	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	Not easily .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact1562	2642.57	2643.01	C	Professor	qrr.%-	-1	0	Or is that {disfmarker}
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1564	2643.33	2644.66	A	Grad	s^aap^df	-1	0	I mean y yes we could do that .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1565	2644.66	2646.92	A	Grad	s	-1	0	You could {disfmarker} you can write widgets in C .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1567	2647.54	2649.65	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	And try to do it that way but I just don't think {disfmarker} it {disfmarker}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact1566	2647.3	2647.55	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1568	2650.03	2654.08	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	Let 's try it with Dan 's and if that isn't enough , we can do it otherwise .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1569	2653.2	2653.29	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1570	2654.08	2657.55	A	Grad	s|s^df	-1	0	I think it is , cuz when I was playing with it , the mixed signal has it all in there .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1571	2658.54	2663.94	A	Grad	s	+1	0	And so it 's really {disfmarker} It 's not too bad to find places in the {disfmarker} in the stream where things are happening .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1572	2662.44	2662.77	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1575	2664.43	2665.59	A	Grad	s	-1	0	So I {disfmarker} I don't think it 'll be bad .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1573	2664.33	2671.24	B	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And it 's also {disfmarker} also the case that {disfmarker} that uh this multi - wave thing {pause} is proposed to the {disfmarker}
Bmr009.E.dialogueact1574	2664.42	2664.96	E	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Hmm ?
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1576	2671.32	2673.96	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So . Dan proposed it to the Transcriber central people ,
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1577	2674.43	2675.79	B	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and it 's likely that uh {disfmarker}
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1578	2675.94	2677.87	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So . And {disfmarker} and they responded favorably
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1579	2677.87	2680.01	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	looks as though it will be incorporated in the future version .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1580	2677.98	2678.35	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1581	2680.26	2686.41	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	They said that the only reason they hadn't had the multi the parallel uh stream one before was simply that {pause} they hadn't had time to do it .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1582	2687.16	2691.3	B	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	And uh {pause} so it 's likely that this {disfmarker} this may be entered into the ch this central @ @ .
Bmr009.E.dialogueact1583	2687.23	2687.63	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1585	2691.56	2691.96	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	And if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker}
Bmr009.C.dialogueact1584	2691.5	2693.42	C	Professor	s	-1	0	They may well have not had much demand for it .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1586	2693.71	2694.85	B	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Well that 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that 's true , too .
Bmr009.C.dialogueact1587	2694.58	2694.99	C	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1588	2695.14	2696.76	B	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	This is a {disfmarker} {pause} a useful thing for us .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1589	2695.45	2699.66	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	So . You mean they could {disfmarker} they could do it and it would be {pause} fast enough if they do it ?
Bmr009.E.dialogueact1590	2695.57	2695.81	E	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1592	2699.39	2700.61	A	Grad	s	-1	0	Depends on how much work they did .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1591	2699.0	2701.66	B	Postdoc	s^ar|s.%--	-1	0	Oh . No . I just mean {disfmarker} I just mean that it 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that his {disfmarker}
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1593	2699.66	2699.89	D	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	Or {disfmarker} ?
Bmr009.E.dialogueact1594	2700.21	2700.47	E	PhD	b.x	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1595	2701.9	2710.78	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So . {pause} This one that we now have does have the status of {pause} potentially being incorporated l likely being incorporated into the central code .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1596	2705.02	2705.33	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1597	2710.03	2710.41	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1598	2710.78	2714.54	B	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	Now , tha Now , if we develop further then , y uh , I don't {disfmarker}
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1600	2715.59	2722.02	A	Grad	s	+1	0	I think if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if one of us sat down and coded it , so that it could be displayed fast enough I 'm sure they would be quite willing to incorporate it .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1599	2715.2	2718.05	B	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean it 's {disfmarker} I think it 's a nice feature to have it {disfmarker} set that way .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1601	2721.98	2722.24	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1602	2722.56	2723.86	A	Grad	s	+1	0	But it 's not a trivial task .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1604	2723.95	2724.48	B	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Bmr009.D.dialogueact1603	2723.63	2724.04	D	PhD	s	-1	0	OK .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1605	2727.32	2732.2	B	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	I just like the idea of it being something that 's , you know , tied back into the original , so that other people can benefit from it .
Bmr009.A.dialogueact1606	2729.79	2729.96	A	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1607	2733.14	2733.36	B	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr009.B.dialogueact1608	2734.44	2740.49	B	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	However . I also understand that you can have {pause} widgets that are very useful for their purpose and that you don't need to always go that w route .
