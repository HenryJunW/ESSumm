There was a recent video conference meeting discussing the cellular project , but no one from the group attended and so do not know if it has any implications for their work , if any important decisions were made.
This includes decisions on the desired latency for the system , since the group is currently at the limit.
Spectral subtraction , which the group is currently investigating as a method of dealing with noise , may add to the delay time , but also it is hard to do with non-linear noise.
