Bmr010.G.dialogueact71	98.5	98.72	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	prank but 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact73	99.089	104.28	B	PhD	h|s^t	-1	0	well uh i guess the work that's been done it's like with recently i think that would be a good thing to start with 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact72	98.767	99.027	C	PhD	b	-1	0	well uh i guess prank but 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact74	103.659	105.159	F	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	with recently i think that would be a good thing to start with okay 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact75	104.63	104.82	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	would be a good thing to start with 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact76	105.482	105.792	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact77	106.431	109.651	G	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	um and um the other thing it which i'll just 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact78	109.651	112.401	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it which i'll just say very briefly that maybe relates to that little bit which is that 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact79	112.401	113.841	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	bit which is that um 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact80	114.921	120.601	G	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh one of the suggestions that came up and um brief me i had the other day when i was in spain with 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact81	120.993	127.933	G	Professor	s^e	-1	0	in spain with um l. a part so and how they're uh for us who's here before 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact82	128.552	139.166	G	Professor	s^e	-1	0	was um why not start with what they had before but had in the non silence boundaries so 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact83	139.666	143.756	G	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	so in what have you heard did before when they were doing um 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact84	144.257	147.987	G	Professor	s	-1	0	he was looking for uh speaker change points 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact85	148.061	148.421	D	PhD	b	-1	0	um 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact86	148.922	149.432	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact87	150.429	160.946	G	Professor	s	-1	0	as a simplification he originally did this only using silence has uh a putative uh speaker change point 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact88	161.28	161.47	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact89	161.603	168.703	G	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and uh he did not say look at points where you were changing broads uh that class for instance 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact90	169.507	172.237	G	Professor	s	-1	0	and four broadcast news that was fine 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact91	173.32	174.38	G	Professor	s	-1	0	here obviously not 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact92	175.137	175.407	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and um 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact93	175.382	181.562	G	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	and um so one of the things that they were pushing and in discussing with me is um 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact94	182.258	187.77	G	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	why are you spending so much time uh on the other seat you're issue 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact95	188.81	193.22	G	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh when perhaps if you sort of deal with what you were using before and then 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact96	193.502	193.782	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and then 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact97	193.824	198.814	G	Professor	s	-1	0	and then just broadened it'd be instead of just using silences putative change point also 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact99	199.311	199.811	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	so then you've got your you 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact98	199.223	204.413	G	Professor	s	-1	0	so then you've got your you have the super structure with kyle scenes in nation you know simple each a man's and so forth and 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact100	204.996	206.076	G	Professor	%--	-1	0	and you you might so there was that there's a 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact101	206.266	210.947	G	Professor	s	-1	0	so there was that there's a little bit of uh uh uh a difference of opinion because 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact102	210.947	214.857	G	Professor	s^df	-1	0	difference of opinion because i i thought that it was it's interesting to look at what teachers are useful 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact103	215.571	215.821	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	but uh 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact104	215.598	219.448	G	Professor	s	-1	0	but uh on the other hand i saw that that they had a good point that uh 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact105	219.448	224.828	G	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	that uh if we had something that worked for many cases before maybe starting from there a little bit because 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact106	224.828	228.787	G	Professor	s^df	-1	0	there a little bit because ultimately we're going to end up with some so kind of structure like that where you 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact107	226.93	227.15	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	up with some so kind of structure 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact108	228.787	230.317	G	Professor	s	-1	0	like that where you have some kind of simple each mound you're testing 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact109	230.317	234.412	G	Professor	s	-1	0	mound you're testing the hypothesis that uh there is a change so 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact110	233.03	233.31	D	PhD	b	-1	0	uh there is a change 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact111	234.592	234.992	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact112	235.522	237.022	G	Professor	s	-1	0	anyway just reporting that but uh 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact114	237.327	237.767	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	but uh 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact113	237.102	238.322	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	but uh uh 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact115	239.155	242.095	G	Professor	qh^t^tc	-1	0	yeah you so yeah when we do the speech in speech 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact116	241.58	241.78	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact117	242.357	243.877	F	Postdoc	qy.%--	-1	0	speech it's you you

Bmr010.G.dialogueact123	251.444	251.974	G	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	to to 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact124	256.009	261.484	C	PhD	fh|s^rt	+1	0	what i did so far is i just used to power olds munich system which is a nation 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact125	261.484	266.794	C	PhD	s^e^rt	+1	1	system which is a nation them but based system with caution mixtures first speech and non speech 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact126	267.526	273.146	C	PhD	s	+1	0	and it was a system which used only one goshen for saddam's and one goshen for speech and now i had 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact127	273.146	279.977	C	PhD	s	+1	0	and now i had it's uh multi mixture plus ability for the speech and on speech and

Bmr010.C.dialogueact147	319.763	321.203	C	PhD	s^na	-1	0	yeah that that was on one one thing uh 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact148	321.848	325.739	C	PhD	h|s	-1	0	uh why it it's more or make stressful for the speech so 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact149	325.739	331.957	C	PhD	s	+1	0	for the speech so i started they were without lousy speaking speakers and quietly speaking speakers and 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact150	326.366	326.906	G	Professor	b	-1	0	i started they were 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact151	331.957	336.617	C	PhD	s	+1	1	and did do hand label speaking speakers and so i did too mixed with wonderful allowed because someone something quiet because 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact152	336.139	338.729	A	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	and did do hand label who was loud and who was quiet or because i did that 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact154	338.729	339.119	A	Grad	qrr.%-	-1	0	who was quiet or i did that for a false five 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact153	338.59	341.26	C	PhD	s	-1	0	who was quiet or i did that for a false five minutes of one dialogue and that was 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact155	341.19	341.49	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	and that was 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact156	341.26	343.41	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	but with and that was enough to to train the system and so it it 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact158	342.413	343.816	B	PhD	qw.%-	-1	0	but with enough to to train the system and so it it 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact157	342.254	342.614	D	PhD	b	-1	0	enough to to train the 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact159	343.41	346.581	C	PhD	s	-1	0	but with system and so it it it that uh on why running so 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact160	346.581	346.851	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	running so 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact161	347.44	350.13	B	PhD	qw	-1	0	what kind of uh funding processing fifty two hopefully it's 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact162	347.467	347.867	C	PhD	s^am	-1	0	what kind of hopefully 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact163	347.671	348.081	D	PhD	b	-1	0	what kind of uh funding processing hopefully 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact164	350.905	356.055	C	PhD	s	+1	0	it's just saw horowitz munich uh out in space spectrum 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact165	356.578	361.628	C	PhD	s	+1	0	miss scales plenty plenty of bands and i'm about enough 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact166	362.123	362.553	B	PhD	b	-1	0	and for 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact167	362.268	367.498	C	PhD	s	+1	0	and for additional features which is energies out enough money fight robinson's at work or something 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact168	368.256	370.496	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so it's funny for technical features 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact170	370.735	370.985	B	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact169	370.666	370.936	G	Professor	b^rt	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact171	372.049	374.349	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and he also provided me with several different versions of compared 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact173	374.801	374.961	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	of compared 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact172	374.349	375.079	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	of compared and so you change 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact174	375.311	375.571	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	and so you change 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact175	375.478	376.868	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and so you change parameters what 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact176	376.868	377.018	F	Postdoc	qw.%-	-1	0	yeah parameters what do us is another 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact177	377.018	378.968	F	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	yeah do us is another person or she change 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact178	378.006	378.416	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	person or she change 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact179	379.243	385.361	C	PhD	s^na	+1	1	you can specify uh minimum length of speech or and sounds portions that you want and so i did 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact180	385.511	388.741	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	and so i did some some of the sketches in those promises basically 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact181	388.741	394.68	C	PhD	s^e	+1	1	basically changing the minimum minimum thankful for items 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact182	395.235	396.385	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	to have or to 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact183	396.925	397.975	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	or to have um yeah 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact184	397.975	398.275	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	have um yeah 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact185	399.775	403.455	C	PhD	s	+1	0	have more all less uh silence portions and searched so 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact186	403.455	404.095	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	so this searched so 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact187	404.059	409.726	A	Grad	fg|s^bu	+1	1	so this would work well for uh pauses and i its boundaries and things like that before overlap 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact188	404.322	404.502	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	so this 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact189	408.067	408.197	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and i its boundaries 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact190	409.026	409.166	C	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	and things like that before overlap 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact191	409.726	411.926	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and things like that before overlap i imagine that doesn't work at all that 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact192	410.5	410.65	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	i imagine 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact193	411.142	411.492	D	PhD	b	-1	0	that doesn't work at all that 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact194	411.926	413.786	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	that doesn't work at all that you love playing sections that are yeah 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact195	412.6	412.76	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	you love playing sections yeah 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact196	412.619	413.159	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	you love playing sections that are yeah 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact197	413.375	413.705	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	that are 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact199	413.995	414.135	C	PhD	b	-1	0	that are that's true but um 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact198	413.552	414.252	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	that are that's true but um 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact200	414.346	414.646	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	that's true but um 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact204	415.001	415.201	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	like it save so much 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact201	414.522	414.922	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	that's true but um 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact203	414.922	417.012	F	Postdoc	s^arp	+1	2	like yeah that's true but it save so much time they just asked are just enormous enormous um 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact202	414.87	415.17	G	Professor	fg	-1	0	like that's true but it save so much um 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact205	416.33	416.55	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah time they just asked are just 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact206	417.012	418.682	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	enormous enormous savings that's great 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact208	418.872	419.512	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	savings testing that's great um 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact207	418.642	419.082	G	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	savings testing that's great um 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact209	419.803	422.113	G	Professor	fg|s^t	-1	0	testing um just one quickly uh still in the future so you have these 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact210	422.113	424.252	G	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	so you have these twenty four features uh a lot of my spec 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact211	424.159	424.409	C	PhD	b	-1	0	uh a lot of my spec 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact212	424.252	425.872	G	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh a lot of my spec for features is their 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact213	425.872	429.662	G	Professor	qy	+1	0	yeah this no for features is their transformation uh the principal components transformation or something just 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact214	429.003	429.153	C	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	yeah this no or something just 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact216	429.835	430.915	A	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah this was that too no what what or something just 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact215	429.824	432.524	C	PhD	s^ar|s	+1	0	yeah this was that too no what what we originally we did that but or something just 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact217	429.842	430.132	G	Professor	%-	-1	0	yeah this was that too no what what or something just 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact218	432.901	434.071	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	did that but we saw uh but we used to go for 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact219	434.071	436.881	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but we used to go for all close talking microphone which 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact220	437.221	438.651	C	PhD	s.%--	+1	0	you have proper recognize the munich it's 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact221	438.895	441.265	C	PhD	s	+1	0	the munich it's other than well it's it's not so not so necessary that you works so 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact222	441.265	445.785	C	PhD	s^df	+1	0	that you works so twelve with but without the uh l. e. a. or something okay 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact223	442.912	443.182	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	twelve with but without 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact224	445.873	447.523	G	Professor	s^bk|s	-1	0	e. a. or something okay i was true yeah i 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact225	447.667	447.767	C	PhD	b	-1	0	true yeah i 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact227	447.929	448.189	F	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	true yeah i think it's a big deal for this application 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact226	447.693	449.523	G	Professor	s	-1	0	true yeah i think it's a big deal for this application but 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact229	449.733	449.883	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	but 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact230	449.799	450.059	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	but yeah 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact228	449.523	450.643	G	Professor	%-	-1	0	but yeah 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact231	450.959	451.229	F	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact232	452.46	454.8	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	okay that's another thing that also too is involved in which 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact233	454.8	455.44	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	is involved in which is um okay 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact234	455.818	457.928	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	is um okay and also dictates guilt part so 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact235	457.928	459.438	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	guilt part so this is this problem uh and and so 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact236	459.438	460.778	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	uh and and so we had this meeting but 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact237	460.778	464.698	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	we had this meeting but also adam before that but for you one way and 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact238	465.008	467.798	F	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	we um regarding the representation of overlaps because 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact239	467.798	472.7	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	of overlaps because the present um because of limitations of the interface reusing overlaps 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact240	472.98	482.086	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	reusing overlaps are um not being encoded by the trans garbage in is complete and uh detailed away as might be and this might be desired 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact241	482.146	485.566	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and this might be desired i think would be desired and the corpus ultimately so we 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact242	485.176	485.536	G	Professor	b	-1	0	so we 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact243	485.847	488.607	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	so we don't have start points each point where there's an overlap we just 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact244	488.607	491.947	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	an overlap we just have that go relax encoded in a simple been 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact245	492.471	505.977	F	Postdoc	fh|s^cs	+1	0	well okay so @reject@ does i said be over of the of the interface are such that we were at this meeting we were entertaining how we might either expand d. b. interface or find other tools which already do what would be useful 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact246	506.157	509.761	F	Postdoc	s.%--	+1	0	because what would ultimately be um ideal in my mind you and i think 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact247	509.761	511.841	F	Postdoc	s.%--	+1	0	mind you and i think in that sense it was consensus is 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact248	511.841	516.301	F	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	0	it was consensus is that thorough going musical corner taste would be the best way to go because 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact249	516.788	518.908	F	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	to go because you can have multiple channels there's 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact250	518.908	520.078	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	channels there's a single timeline is very clear flexible 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact251	520.078	522.408	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	is very clear flexible all those nice things okay 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact252	521.1	521.47	G	Professor	b	-1	0	all those nice 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact253	522.97	523.97	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	things okay so um 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact254	524.562	533.62	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	um i smoke i had a meeting with dave gilbert on on and he had uh excellent ideas on how the interface could be modified to to do this kind of representation 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact255	534.029	542.014	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but um eat in the meantime you were checking into these systems of already um existing interfaces which my already have these properties you want to see some 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact256	542.124	543.324	F	Postdoc	fh|qy	-1	0	yeah you want to see some of that 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact257	543.58	544.26	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah um of that 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact258	544.26	554.057	C	PhD	fh|s^rt	-1	0	um i'm talked with uh many guys from from looking really much of the answer is jeeze what lot love transcribing on considerations and 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact259	551.575	551.905	G	Professor	b	-1	0	what lot 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact260	554.63	560.282	C	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	and they basically set they have they have uh a tool they developed themselves and they kind 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact261	560.598	563.168	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and they kind of give away if it's hour a problem um that's 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact262	563.168	565.458	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	um that's that's not supported and and 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact263	565.458	566.228	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	and and but 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact264	565.949	566.199	G	Professor	b	-1	0	and and but

Bmr010.F.dialogueact275	590.679	591.089	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	we can use it she said she would give it to us 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact277	592.204	593.324	C	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	it wouldn't be a problem and 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact278	593.982	597.122	C	PhD	s	-1	0	well maybe we should get it and i've got some some kind of manual down in my office 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact279	596.965	597.945	A	Grad	s^cs	+1	1	well maybe we should get it down in my office 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact280	598.125	602.631	A	Grad	s	+1	0	and if it's good enough well arrange windows machines to be available uhhuh 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact281	598.794	598.944	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and if it's good 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact282	602.84	604.23	F	Postdoc	fg|s^am	-1	0	available uhhuh could potentially so i also wanted to be sure 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact283	603.505	603.745	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	could potentially 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact284	604.29	605.29	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	so i also wanted to be sure i mean i i've seen 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact285	605.29	606.33	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	i mean i i've seen this this call

Bmr010.G.dialogueact308	629.2	629.9	G	Professor	fh|%--	-1	0	uh i mean 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact309	630.863	633.193	G	Professor	s	-1	0	we've been very concerned to get all this rolling so that we would actually 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact310	633.193	634.763	G	Professor	s	-1	0	so that we would actually have data 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact311	634.578	635.038	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	have data but um 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact312	635.281	639.341	G	Professor	s	-1	0	but um i think our outside sponsor is actually going to kick and and 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact313	639.246	639.486	F	Postdoc	b^rt	-1	0	and 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact314	639.421	641.861	G	Professor	s	-1	0	and ultimately that has to be smoothed out so 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact315	641.861	647.652	G	Professor	s	-1	0	to be smoothed out so i don't know if we have a long term need to do lots and lots of transcribing i think we had 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact316	647.652	649.822	G	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	i think we had a very quickly to get something out 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact317	650.554	652.154	G	Professor	s	-1	0	and we'd like to be able to some later because just attention 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact318	652.154	654.034	G	Professor	s^ba^df	-1	0	because just attention it's interesting but it's hard 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact319	654.641	659.571	G	Professor	s	-1	0	what but it's hard you know with with any luck will be able to wine down the larger project 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact320	658.757	658.937	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	down the larger 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact321	659.304	662.124	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	what our decision was it is that will go ahead with what we have it just project 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact322	659.925	666.275	A	Grad	s	+1	2	what our decision was it is that will go ahead with what we have with and not very fine time scale on neo relapse and it just project right 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact323	663.337	663.497	C	PhD	b	-1	0	with and not very right 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact324	663.449	663.719	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	with and not very right 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact325	666.369	666.669	G	Professor	b	-1	0	and 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact326	667.02	670.98	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and do week and later to clean that up if we need to 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact327	669.702	669.982	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	to clean 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact328	671.329	671.659	G	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact329	672.08	677.727	F	Postdoc	s^cs^tc.%--	+1	0	and and i was just thinking that um if it were possible to bring that in like you know this week 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact331	678.517	686.989	F	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	2	then when they're in coding be overlaps it would be nice for them to be able to specify one you know start points and points of overlaps 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact330	678.338	678.748	G	Professor	b	-1	0	then when 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact333	687.369	689.239	F	Postdoc	s^ba	+1	1	making really quick progress 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact332	687.138	687.368	G	Professor	b	-1	0	making 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact334	689.701	690.151	G	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	and um 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact335	690.57	695.29	F	Postdoc	fg|s	-1	0	and um so my my goal is my charge was to get eleven hours by the end of the month and it it'll be i'm 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact336	695.29	697.97	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	month and it it'll be i'm i'm i'm that will be able to do that 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact337	698.155	698.565	G	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	that's great 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact339	699.245	703.59	A	Grad	qy^rt^tc	-1	0	and did you uh ford morgan brian's i

Bmr010.F.dialogueact340	703.738	704.788	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	i sent it to um 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact341	704.848	705.158	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	sent it to um i sent that to 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact342	705.238	706.068	F	Postdoc	qo^t1	-1	0	i sent that to i send it to a list 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact343	706.068	707.098	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i send it to a list and i sent it to 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact344	707.098	709.538	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	oh yeah meeting recorder and i sent it to a local lis you saw 
Bmr010.E.dialogueact345	708.711	709.451	E	PhD	s	-1	0	oh yeah meeting recorder a local lis you saw 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact346	709.653	710.043	A	Grad	qy^bh	-1	0	oh yeah okay so you probably didn't get recorder lis you saw that so bryant 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact348	710.043	711.243	A	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	okay so you probably didn't get that that so bryant did tell me 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact347	709.678	710.358	F	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	oh yeah okay so you probably didn't get recorder lis you saw that so bryant 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact349	710.716	715.016	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	okay so you probably didn't get that that so bryant did tell me that in fact what you said that uh that are that they 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact350	715.665	717.475	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that they are making progress and that 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact351	717.475	722.885	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and that he's going going he's going to check this the output of the first transcription 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact352	722.885	723.125	F	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	transcription i mean 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact354	723.688	724.048	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	i mean basically it's it's 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact353	723.646	726.076	G	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean basically it's it's all the difference in the world i mean basically he's 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact355	726.076	727.736	G	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean basically he's he's on 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact356	727.84	728.07	A	Grad	b	-1	0	oh that's he's on so 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact357	728.318	729.138	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	oh that's development so so so 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact359	729.138	730.158	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	development okay so so this is so 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact358	728.673	732.003	G	Professor	s	-1	0	oh that's development okay super super okay so so so this is so it'll happen 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact360	730.218	730.578	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	okay this is so 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact361	731.237	731.727	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	super it'll happen 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact362	732.197	732.817	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	super okay 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact363	732.877	733.987	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	super okay great yeah i mean basically 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact364	733.197	736.387	G	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	great yeah i mean basically assisting whenever whenever best people was on it you know just doesn't 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact366	736.67	736.82	F	Postdoc	b^rt	-1	0	on it you know just doesn't 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact365	736.557	738.117	G	Professor	s	-1	0	on it you know just doesn't have to be here anymore someone else pays him so 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact367	738.117	738.897	G	Professor	s	-1	0	someone else pays him so 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact368	738.897	739.117	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	someone else pays him so 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact370	740.315	741.835	B	PhD	s	-1	0	but about the need for transcription i mean isn't that great so 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact369	740.196	740.786	F	Postdoc	qy^bh	-1	0	but about the need isn't that great so 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact371	741.835	750.272	B	PhD	qy^bu^df^rt	-1	0	for transcription i mean don't we didn't we previously decide that the i b. m. transcripts would have to be checked anyway and possibly augment it so i think having yes that's true 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact372	742.355	742.575	G	Professor	b	-1	0	don't we didn't we 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact373	748.876	749.666	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	checked anyway and possibly augment yes that's true 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact374	750.272	753.552	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	it so i think having a good tool this was something no matter what yeah okay that's 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact375	750.425	750.765	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	it so i think having 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact376	752.538	752.718	G	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	something no yeah 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact377	752.848	754.708	G	Professor	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	something no matter what yeah okay that's that's a good point 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact378	756.44	758.51	A	Grad	fg|s^tc	-1	0	yeah and they help part did volunteer and since he's not 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact379	756.608	756.798	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	yeah and they 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact380	758.51	760.29	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and since he's not here all repeat it to at 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact381	760.731	762.481	A	Grad	s	-1	0	it to at least modify transcriber which if we don't 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact382	762.481	765.811	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	which if we don't have something else that works i think that's a pretty good way of going 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact383	764.174	764.454	C	PhD	b	-1	0	works i think that's a pretty 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact384	765.427	765.677	F	Postdoc	b^rt	-1	0	good way of going 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact385	766.172	767.842	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and we discussed on some methods do it my 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact386	767.842	769.242	A	Grad	s^rt.%--	-1	0	some methods do it my approach originally and i've already hacked 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact387	769.382	770.922	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and i've already hacked on a little bit 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact388	771.295	773.835	A	Grad	s	-1	0	it was too slow because i was trying to display all the way for us but he 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact389	773.835	775.545	A	Grad	s	-1	0	all the way for us but he pointed out that you don't really have to think 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact392	775.975	776.825	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	have to think it's a good point 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact390	775.72	775.94	F	Postdoc	b^rt	-1	0	have to think 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact391	775.869	776.459	G	Professor	b	-1	0	have to think it's a good point 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact394	777.48	784.03	A	Grad	s	-1	0	that if you just display the mix way form and then have a user interface for editing the different channels that's perfectly sufficient yeah exactly 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact393	777.107	777.447	G	Professor	b	-1	0	that if you just 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact395	784.36	785.03	F	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	yeah exactly and keep things separate 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact396	785.21	786.28	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and keep things separate and and um 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact397	786.28	793.255	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and then they can only and and um dan ellis is hack already allows them to be able to display different ways forms to clarify overlapping thinks that's already 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact399	793.416	794.816	A	Grad	s^ar|s	+1	0	and then they can only display one but they that's already oh 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact398	793.255	793.915	F	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	and then they can only that's already 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact400	794.866	796.206	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	display one but they can listen to different ones oh yes but well 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact401	794.93	795.91	F	Postdoc	s^bk|%-	-1	0	display one but they can listen to different ones oh yes but 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact402	796.316	803.256	F	Postdoc	s	+1	0	well uh yes but what i mean is that uh the transcribers perspective uh inspections or something and down else's 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact403	803.256	810.961	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and down else's hack handles the um choice the ability to choose different way forms from moment to moment 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact404	811.222	812.102	A	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	only to listen to not to look at

Bmr010.A.dialogueact498	976.792	976.982	A	Grad	b	-1	0	ago so there 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact497	976.47	980.08	G	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	fantastic because ago so there it's you the techniques work pretty well 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact499	980.101	980.621	F	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	fantastic because 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact501	980.892	985.704	F	Postdoc	s	+1	1	fantastic because there's one thing that we don't have right now and that's the automatic uh channel it down a fire 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact500	980.832	981.112	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	fantastic because there's one thing that we don't 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact503	986.249	989.729	F	Postdoc	s^rt	+1	1	that that you know that would help in terms of a coating of overlaps

Bmr010.F.dialogueact504	990.119	995.122	F	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	by the transcribers would have less dangling to do if that were you know yeah so i mean 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact505	995.419	1001.09	G	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	yeah so i mean you basically you can look at so you have to play around a little bit uh to figure what the right statistic is but you compare each mike

Bmr010.G.dialogueact613	1170.7	1171.34	G	Professor	s^na	-1	0	yes you know something happened i don't know what 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact614	1171.34	1171.87	G	Professor	s^no	-1	0	yes happened i don't know what 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact615	1171.95	1172.98	B	PhD	s^j	-1	0	yes for more work happened i don't know what season uh 
Bmr010.E.dialogueact616	1171.98	1172.29	E	PhD	b	-1	0	yes for more work happened i don't know what season uh 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact617	1172.07	1172.62	G	Professor	s	-1	0	for more work season uh 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact618	1174.42	1175.71	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	would be like that he's like he's great 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact619	1175.71	1176.23	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	that he's like he's great 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact620	1176.99	1177.28	G	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact621	1178.18	1179.34	G	Professor	fg	-1	0	so uh 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact622	1181.45	1181.75	G	Professor	qw^t^tc	-1	0	where would maybe 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact623	1181.95	1184.62	G	Professor	s^cs^rt.%--	-1	0	where would maybe uh um 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact624	1185.73	1187.29	G	Professor	qo^cs	+1	1	yeah i'd well it was talking about furnishings that was 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact625	1187.47	1188.47	F	Postdoc	s^aa|s^ba	-1	0	yeah i'd be great that was that was uh 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact626	1187.67	1188.44	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah i'd be great that was that was uh 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact627	1188.89	1189.27	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	be great that was uh 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact628	1190.14	1195.17	A	Grad	s	+1	0	so one thing is that i did look on sony for replacement for the mike's for the hadn't had worn runs because they're so uncomfortable 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact629	1195.17	1196.31	A	Grad	s^df	+1	0	because they're so uncomfortable but i think 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact630	1196.74	1198.97	A	Grad	s	-1	0	but i think i need someone who knows more about mike's and i do because 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact631	1198.97	1204.73	A	Grad	s	-1	0	mike's and i do because i couldn't find a single other immortal seems like it would fit the connector which 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact632	1205.05	1206.49	A	Grad	s	-1	0	seems really unlikely to me does 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact633	1207.02	1209.53	A	Grad	qy	-1	0	anyone like no stores or 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact634	1209.53	1213.39	A	Grad	qrr	-1	0	or know about mike's who who would know the right questions to ask oh 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact635	1213.84	1214.8	G	Professor	s^na	-1	0	oh i probably would i mean 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact636	1214.8	1216.86	G	Professor	s	-1	0	i probably would i mean my knowledge is twenty years out of date but 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact637	1216.86	1217.88	G	Professor	s	-1	0	years out of date but some of it's still the same 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact639	1218.16	1218.53	A	Grad	b	-1	0	so 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact638	1218.04	1218.24	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact640	1219.44	1221.63	G	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	you couldn't you couldn't find the right of to uh it's very and things like that 
Bmr010.E.dialogueact641	1220.47	1222.97	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	you couldn't you couldn't find the right of to go into these things very and things like that 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact642	1222.59	1222.79	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	go into these things 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact644	1223.56	1226.29	A	Grad	s	-1	0	when i looked it they listed one microphone and that's it that having 
Bmr010.E.dialogueact643	1223.49	1223.61	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	when i looked 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact645	1226.79	1228.14	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	it that having that type of connector but my guess 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact646	1228.14	1233.68	A	Grad	s	-1	0	but my guess is that sony maybe uses a different number for their connector than everyone else does 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact647	1234.38	1235.36	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	and and so goes 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact648	1234.4	1234.82	G	Professor	b	-1	0	and and 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact649	1235.69	1236.77	G	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so it seems it seems goes okay it together and 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact650	1236.41	1239.04	A	Grad	s	-1	0	it seems it seems really unlikely to me that there's only one additionally doctor okay it together and 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact651	1236.77	1236.93	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	it seems it seems okay it together and 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact652	1239.34	1240.57	F	Postdoc	qy^d^rt	-1	0	additionally doctor for it 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact654	1241.3	1241.54	C	PhD	b	-1	0	like that yeah 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact653	1240.89	1241.67	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	for it like that yeah 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact655	1242.15	1242.39	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr010.A.dialogueact656	1243.19	1243.94	A	Grad	s:qh^rt	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr010.F.dialogueact657	1244.6	1244.88	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	who 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact658	1245.04	1246.44	G	Professor	qw^rt	-1	0	um who are we buying these from 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact659	1246.74	1247.31	A	Grad	h	-1	0	um these from 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact660	1246.83	1247.04	G	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	um these from 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact661	1248.41	1249.16	A	Grad	s	-1	0	i have a downstairs i don't remember if the top 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact662	1249.16	1250.47	A	Grad	s^no	-1	0	i don't remember if the top of my head 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact663	1249.75	1249.92	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	i don't remember if the top 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact664	1249.92	1250.24	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	i don't remember if the top of my head 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact665	1251.1	1252.73	G	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	yeah we've been trying to connect again 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact666	1253.92	1254.53	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	and then uh 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact667	1256.2	1257.72	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	just in terms of how you wear um 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact668	1258.12	1259.49	A	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah i had thought about this before i mean when when 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact669	1259.49	1265.57	A	Grad	s	-1	0	before i mean when when when you use a product like dragon dictate they have a very extensive description about how to where the microphone and so on but 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact670	1265.33	1265.6	F	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	so on but 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact671	1265.99	1271.39	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so on but i felt that in a real situation we were very seldom can get people to really do it and maybe it wasn't 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact672	1271.39	1273.32	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	do it and maybe it wasn't worth concentrating on 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact673	1274.83	1275.07	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	well i think 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact674	1275.64	1278.41	G	Professor	s	-1	0	well i think that that's that's a good back off position that's what i was saying 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact675	1278.41	1279.54	G	Professor	s	-1	0	that's what i was saying earlier that big that 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact676	1279.54	1283.81	G	Professor	s	-1	0	earlier that big that you know we are going to get some recordings that are are imperfect and 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact677	1283.81	1284.97	G	Professor	s:s	-1	0	are imperfect and hey that's life but 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact678	1285.06	1296.19	G	Professor	s	+1	2	i i think that it it doesn't hurt uh the natural most of the situation to try to have people where the microphones properly if possible because 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact679	1296.19	1296.59	A	Grad	b	-1	0	because 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact680	1296.19	1302.55	G	Professor	s	-1	0	oh that's because um thee natural situation is really what we have was the microphones on the table i mean i think 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact682	1302.76	1303.36	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	oh that's true the table i mean i think you know in the target 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact681	1302.67	1307.62	G	Professor	s	-1	0	oh that's true the table i mean i think you know in the target applications we're talking about people aren't going to be wearing head on mike's anyway so this is just 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact684	1304.25	1304.49	C	PhD	b	-1	0	applications 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact683	1303.94	1304.02	D	PhD	b	-1	0	true you know in the target applications 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact685	1307.62	1310.54	G	Professor	s	-1	0	mike's anyway so this is just free these had my my just reuse with research 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact686	1310.61	1310.9	A	Grad	b	-1	0	research 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact688	1311.36	1311.6	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and uh it's 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact687	1311.27	1312.66	G	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	and uh it's going to make 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact689	1313.3	1319.76	G	Professor	s	-1	0	right you know if if and and this place around language modeling he's not going to be wannabe messed up by people breathing into the microphone so 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact690	1317.6	1317.91	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right wannabe messed up by 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact691	1319.76	1322.26	G	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	well i'll pick through the documentation the microphone so it's it's uh 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact692	1322.0	1327.17	A	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	i'll pick through the documentation to dragon dictate to secede they still have a little form but it does happen right i mean 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact693	1326.38	1327.22	G	Professor	s	-1	0	form but it does happen right i mean 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact696	1327.81	1328.25	D	PhD	b	-1	0	right i mean and any

Bmr010.B.dialogueact699	1331.74	1336.21	B	PhD	s	-1	0	i talked to some i. b. m. guys uh last january i think it was there and 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact700	1336.21	1336.35	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	and 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact701	1337.56	1341.72	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	so people working on the on their via voice dictation product 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact702	1340.73	1340.93	G	Professor	b	-1	0	dictation 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact703	1342.28	1347.4	B	PhD	s	-1	0	and they said uh the everything thing is really uh a terrible problem for them to 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact704	1347.58	1351.24	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	them to to not recognize breathing of speech 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact705	1351.86	1352.3	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	so 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact706	1352.65	1357.86	B	PhD	s	+1	2	well that's uh it so anything to reduce beatings as as a good thing

Bmr010.G.dialogueact759	1441.52	1445.0	G	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and you can do some you know first order thing about it which is to have people 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact760	1445.0	1449.55	G	Professor	s^cs^e	-1	0	is to have people move it uh away from being just directly in front of the middle but 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact761	1449.0	1449.46	D	PhD	b	-1	0	of the middle but 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact762	1449.24	1449.39	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	of the middle but

Bmr010.F.dialogueact764	1451.61	1452.0	F	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	and then you know i think there's 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact765	1451.71	1453.93	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and then you know i think there's not much 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact766	1454.04	1455.89	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	because you can't you know interfere we 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact767	1456.47	1458.59	G	Professor	s	-1	0	right can't find too in the meeting that much i think 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact768	1458.23	1458.5	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right i think 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact770	1458.84	1459.0	D	PhD	b	-1	0	right that's true it just i think 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact769	1458.66	1459.51	G	Professor	%-	-1	0	right that's true it just i think 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact771	1459.29	1459.82	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	that's true it just 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact772	1459.82	1469.09	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and then also the position of that's true it just seems like if if something simple like that can be tweaked and the quality goes you know dramatically uh then it might be worth 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact773	1465.11	1465.4	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	dramatically 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact774	1468.66	1470.64	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and then also the position of the michael so if it's 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact775	1470.63	1472.81	A	Grad	s	-1	0	the michael so if it's more directly you'll get better volume 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact777	1473.73	1477.39	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	so something like yours is pretty far down below your mouth my my feedback 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact776	1473.41	1473.56	D	PhD	b	-1	0	so something

Bmr010.F.dialogueact850	1594.61	1596.11	F	Postdoc	s^co	-1	0	on a feature and mean if i'm going to ask you one thing about that so um if 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact851	1595.49	1595.65	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	to ask you one thing about that 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact853	1596.22	1596.56	B	PhD	b	-1	0	and so um if 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact852	1596.11	1596.71	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and so um if 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact854	1596.91	1601.25	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and huh so um if they last between two words you you get it in between the two words but if they laugh 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact855	1599.1	1599.64	B	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	huh you you get it 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact857	1601.45	1601.71	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	but if they laugh 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact856	1601.25	1604.82	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but if they laugh across three or four words you get it after this forwards just a 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact858	1604.82	1605.43	F	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	this forwards just a matter 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact859	1605.81	1606.0	D	PhD	b	-1	0	well the thing matter 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact860	1606.39	1611.39	B	PhD	s	+1	1	well the thing that it's hard to do with his with when they speak why laughing 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact861	1612.24	1617.23	B	PhD	s	-1	0	right um and that's uh i think that we can do very well with that so 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact862	1617.02	1617.32	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	so 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact863	1617.23	1617.59	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	so

Bmr010.A.dialogueact881	1648.18	1650.05	A	Grad	qw	-1	0	how would we do that with a hybrid system 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact882	1651.81	1652.13	G	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	so train a phone same thing okay 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact884	1652.53	1654.64	A	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	so train a phone and then they're on that same thing yeah yeah 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact883	1652.31	1652.94	B	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	so train a phone same thing 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact885	1653.78	1654.02	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and then they're on that yeah yeah 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact886	1654.82	1658.06	B	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	they're on that oh yeah yeah yeah oh and each of these words has a dedicated phone so the 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact887	1656.21	1656.7	G	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	and each of these words has 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact888	1658.49	1658.96	A	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	oh yeah so the 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact889	1658.56	1663.59	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	oh yeah so the so the the mouse noise uh word has just single phone 
Bmr010.B.dialogueact890	1664.33	1666.45	B	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	right so in the hybrid system we could train um that is for that 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact891	1665.13	1670.23	A	Grad	fg|s^cs	-1	0	right so in the hybrid system we could train the that with a last or phone and i pressed down so that is for that yeah yeah i mean it's it's it's always

Bmr010.F.dialogueact976	1812.35	1814.75	F	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	because i think people can raise questions you know 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact978	1815.22	1815.79	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	it is if they think 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact977	1814.9	1817.14	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	questions you know it is if they think about different things and they think of different 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact979	1817.14	1818.21	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and they think of different and um

Bmr010.F.dialogueact981	1819.4	1824.89	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i trained them to uh on about a minute or two up the one that was already transcribe this 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact982	1824.97	1826.29	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	already transcribe this also gives me a sense of you know 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact983	1826.69	1830.92	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	of you know i can i can use that later with reference to undercut reliability kind of she's 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact984	1831.32	1834.2	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but main thing was to get them used to the conventions and you know 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact985	1834.2	1839.55	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and you know the idea besides the unit versus how long it takes place back so it

Bmr010.F.dialogueact1020	1904.04	1906.49	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you put a little chick at the beginning of the word and that just

Bmr010.G.dialogueact1044	1953.74	1962.37	G	Professor	s	+1	1	to oh that'd be so super the other thing we could do actually uh is uh um use them for a more detailed analysis of the over 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1045	1954.29	1954.67	F	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	thing we could do actually

Bmr010.F.dialogueact1047	1963.52	1965.18	F	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	mean this is something that we were talking about they'd they'd be so so terrific 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1049	1964.04	1966.04	A	Grad	s	-1	0	mean this is something that we were talking about we could get a very so terrific 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1048	1963.62	1963.97	G	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	they'd they'd be so 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1050	1966.04	1971.17	A	Grad	s	-1	0	we could get a very detailed overlap if they were really to transcribe each meeting four or five times right one for each participant 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1051	1971.35	1971.52	A	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right one for each participant

Bmr010.A.dialogueact1053	1973.91	1974.96	A	Grad	s^cs.%--	-1	0	so they could by hand 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1054	1975.53	1976.55	G	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	well that's one way to do it but i would take 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1055	1976.35	1976.57	A	Grad	b	-1	0	way to do it but i would take 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1056	1976.55	1979.22	G	Professor	s^cs^ng	-1	0	that's right way to do it but i would take the other thing is just go through for the overlaps right 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1057	1979.14	1979.39	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	that's right right 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1058	1979.43	1980.04	F	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	that's right and with the right into interface right given that you and and 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1059	1979.43	1979.7	G	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	that's right right 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1060	1980.04	1981.44	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and with the right into interface given that you and and do so instead of 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1061	1980.04	1985.24	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and with the right into interface given that you and and do so instead of doing phonetic uh uh transcription for the whole thing which we 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1063	1985.39	1985.59	D	PhD	b	-1	0	which we 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1062	1985.24	1990.67	G	Professor	s	-1	0	which we know from the the steve's experience with us for transcription is very very time consuming and 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1064	1990.66	1995.13	G	Professor	s^df	-1	0	consuming and and you know it took some i don't know how many months to do to get four hours and so 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1065	1995.2	1998.77	G	Professor	s	-1	0	and so that hasn't been really our focus 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1066	1999.73	2000.79	G	Professor	s	-1	0	uh we can consider it but 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1067	2000.88	2008.62	G	Professor	s	-1	0	can consider it but i mean the other thing is since we've been spending so much time thinking about overlaps is as maybe get a much more detailed analysis of the overlaps 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1068	2007.35	2007.53	D	PhD	b	-1	0	of the overlaps

Bmr010.F.dialogueact1149	2137.0	2139.76	F	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	think i i'm under is was leading to this topic the idea 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1150	2139.82	2145.33	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	to this topic the idea that um we haven't yet seen that that type of transcript that we get from i. b. m. and it may just be

Bmr010.F.dialogueact1152	2147.91	2150.73	F	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	you know pristine but on the other hand given the lesser interface because 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1153	2150.73	2152.36	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	interface because just you know it's got a good interface with got

Bmr010.G.dialogueact1156	2155.46	2160.25	G	Professor	s	-1	0	something like that it could be that they will there's one that being the kind of for first pass or something every 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1157	2160.27	2161.04	F	Postdoc	s^m^na	-1	0	something like that every lot because again they 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1158	2160.88	2161.51	G	Professor	s	-1	0	something like that every lot because again they 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1159	2161.51	2163.53	G	Professor	s	-1	0	lot because again they probably are going to do these ones which were also 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1160	2163.53	2165.55	G	Professor	s	-1	0	that's that's true which were also christening so 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1161	2165.0	2166.3	F	Postdoc	s^aap^rt	-1	0	that's true um although so 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1162	2166.3	2173.42	F	Postdoc	qy^bu.%-	-1	0	um although you have just don't have to start with uh close approximation of though uh the verbal part to be able to well that's that's 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1163	2172.85	2174.56	G	Professor	s^am	-1	0	verbal part to be able to well that's that's debatable right i mean so 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1166	2175.04	2175.36	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	the so the argument 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1164	2174.56	2174.76	G	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	debatable right i mean so 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1165	2174.76	2181.85	G	Professor	s	-1	0	debatable right i mean so the so the argument is that if you're statistical system is good it will in fact uh clean things up right 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1168	2182.14	2182.46	F	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	so it 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1167	2182.0	2182.3	G	Professor	qy^d^f	-1	0	so it 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1169	2182.48	2184.82	G	Professor	s	-1	0	so it it's got its own objective criterion 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1170	2183.19	2183.32	D	PhD	b	-1	0	it's got its own objective 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1171	2185.62	2190.16	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and uh so do in principle you could start with something that was kind of rough i mean 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1172	2190.79	2197.39	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i mean even example of um something we used to do uh at one point uh back back when purpose here other times we 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1173	2197.39	2197.87	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	here other times we 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1174	2197.87	2198.6	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	here other times we would take 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1175	2200.29	2204.74	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	take a word and uh have economic comical plantation 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1176	2205.21	2212.43	G	Professor	s	-1	0	and uh if there's five phones and the word any break up the word uh into to five equal length pieces which is completely 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1177	2212.7	2213.94	G	Professor	s	-1	0	wrong which is completely gross 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1178	2213.72	2214.01	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	wrong yeah gross right i mean is timing 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1180	2214.4	2214.65	D	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah right i mean is timing 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1179	2214.19	2214.47	G	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	yeah right i mean is timing 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1181	2214.47	2218.03	G	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah right i mean is timing is off all over the place in just about any word but it's 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1182	2216.07	2217.19	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	all over the place in just about any word 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1183	2218.12	2218.39	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	but it's 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1184	2218.75	2219.4	G	Professor	s^ba^df^rt	-1	0	but it's okay you start 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1185	2219.72	2221.7	G	Professor	s	-1	0	okay you start off with that in the statistical system the minds 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1186	2221.7	2222.66	G	Professor	s	-1	0	system the minds things eventually 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1187	2222.66	2224.95	G	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	things eventually get something that doesn't really look too bad 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1188	2225.17	2225.67	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	oh okay so 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1189	2225.67	2225.93	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	oh okay so 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1190	2225.75	2230.99	G	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	oh okay so so i think using uh good a liner um actually can can help a lot 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1191	2231.37	2233.63	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	but uh you know they both 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1192	2233.7	2234.82	G	Professor	s	-1	0	uh you know they both help each other if you 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1193	2234.82	2237.79	G	Professor	s	-1	0	help each other if you have a if you have a better starting point then it helps the line or 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1194	2238.4	2244.1	G	Professor	s	-1	0	okay if you have a good line and it helps uh uh the human in taking less time to correct things so 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1196	2244.21	2244.5	F	Postdoc	x	-1	0	okay so 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1195	2244.1	2245.51	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	okay so 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1197	2245.85	2246.13	F	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	i guess 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1198	2246.89	2248.44	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i guess is another aspect too and i don't know 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1199	2248.44	2249.14	F	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	too and i don't know uh this this 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1200	2249.48	2252.87	F	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	uh this this is very possibly different uh topic 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1201	2253.27	2258.7	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but uh just let me say with references idea of um higher order are going to say she station in meeting so like

Bmr010.D.dialogueact1275	2412.42	2418.51	D	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	i eat i. e. chained just cook um week and she did the audience okay but the bottom line 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1276	2417.55	2417.89	G	Professor	fg	-1	0	did the audience okay 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1277	2418.26	2421.03	G	Professor	s	+1	1	but the bottom line is it's still not uh separating out very well right okay 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1278	2420.55	2420.65	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	separating out very well right 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1280	2421.38	2421.44	D	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	okay 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1279	2421.03	2421.28	G	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	okay 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1282	2421.75	2424.25	D	PhD	s	-1	0	okay so that's that's that's enough 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1281	2421.72	2422.08	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay so that's 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1283	2422.57	2423.1	G	Professor	%-	-1	0	so that's that's 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1284	2423.57	2425.22	G	Professor	s^co^tc	-1	0	that's that's enough then okay 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1285	2425.33	2425.64	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	then okay 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1286	2426.5	2426.61	D	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1287	2427.29	2429.95	G	Professor	s^df	-1	0	down here there's a plane going through all of that that's the bottom line really so 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1288	2428.85	2429.16	D	PhD	b	-1	0	going through all of that that's the bottom line really so 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1289	2429.24	2429.56	F	Postdoc	b	-1	0	the bottom line really so 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1291	2430.27	2430.49	D	PhD	b	-1	0	i i think we 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1290	2429.95	2431.81	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	the bottom line really so i i think we have to start 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1292	2432.47	2434.8	G	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh i mean there's there's two suggestions really which 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1293	2434.8	2437.14	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	really which is uh we said before is that um 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1294	2435.31	2435.48	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	is uh 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1295	2435.48	2435.71	D	PhD	b	-1	0	is uh 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1296	2437.84	2438.41	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	um it looks 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1297	2438.79	2439.42	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it looks like 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1298	2440.95	2443.58	G	Professor	s	-1	0	at least that you haven't found an obvious way to normalize so that 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1299	2443.58	2449.21	G	Professor	s	-1	0	so that the energy is anything like a reliable uh indicator of the over a lot um 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1300	2448.0	2448.31	D	PhD	b	-1	0	of the over a lot 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1302	2450.04	2450.43	D	PhD	b	-1	0	i i'm 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1301	2449.98	2455.47	G	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um i i'm i'm still a little think that's a little funnies things seems like it should be but 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1303	2455.22	2455.43	D	PhD	b	-1	0	it should be but 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1304	2455.47	2461.42	G	Professor	s	+1	0	it should be but but you don't want to keep uh keep knocking at it if it's if you're not getting any any results of that but 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1305	2461.96	2469.34	G	Professor	s	+1	2	of that but i mean the other things that we talked about is uh pitch related things and harm in the city related things uh which 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1306	2467.53	2467.75	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	and harm 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1307	2469.35	2472.67	G	Professor	s	-1	0	uh which thought also should be some kind of a reasonable indicator 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1308	2473.45	2474.02	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1309	2475.49	2476.33	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	but uh 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1310	2477.51	2483.28	G	Professor	s	+1	0	a completely different tack on it we'd is the one that was suggested uh by your colleagues in spain which is 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1311	2480.42	2480.79	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	is the one that was 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1312	2483.76	2487.19	G	Professor	s	+1	1	which is to say don't worry so much about the features 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1313	2488.18	2488.34	D	PhD	b	-1	0	that is to say use 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1314	2488.19	2493.02	G	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	that is to say use as as you during the speech uh non speech some very general features and 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1315	2493.36	2493.52	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1317	2493.73	2494.11	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and uh then 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1316	2493.71	2498.27	G	Professor	s^cs^e	+1	0	and uh then uh look at it more from the aspect of modeling i have 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1319	2498.85	2499.09	D	PhD	b	-1	0	i have a i have a couple mark 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1318	2498.69	2500.75	G	Professor	s^e	+1	1	i have a i have a couple mark off models and 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1320	2500.75	2500.89	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	off models and 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1321	2501.5	2507.26	G	Professor	s	+1	1	and uh try to and they try to determine you know when there's when are you in an overlap a when you're not an overlap and let's 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1322	2502.44	2502.68	D	PhD	b	-1	0	to and they try 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1323	2507.81	2512.47	G	Professor	s	+1	1	and let's see uh as the school system determine what's the right way to look at the data i 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1325	2513.49	2513.66	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	i um 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1324	2513.02	2514.35	G	Professor	%--	-1	0	i um i 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1326	2514.98	2518.45	G	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	i think would be interesting to find individual teachers and put them together i think that you'd 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1327	2518.45	2520.79	G	Professor	s^df	-1	0	together i think that you'd end up with a better system overall 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1329	2521.41	2521.71	D	PhD	b	-1	0	given the limitations 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1328	2521.21	2527.25	G	Professor	s	-1	0	given the limitations in time given the fact that have your system already excess doing this sort of thing uh 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1330	2523.49	2523.99	D	PhD	b	-1	0	given the fact 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1331	2527.85	2529.75	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh but uh 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1332	2530.83	2534.52	G	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it's main limitation is that again it's only looking at sinuses which one 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1333	2532.65	2532.81	D	PhD	b	-1	0	again it's only looking 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1335	2535.13	2535.49	D	PhD	b	-1	0	maybe that's a better 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1334	2535.05	2536.94	G	Professor	s	-1	0	maybe that's a better place to go

Bmr010.D.dialogueact1415	2668.06	2670.83	D	PhD	s	-1	0	a hobby into to us and what we some of my calls 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1416	2671.06	2671.84	A	Grad	s^na	-1	0	yeah i didn't think so you already oh okay so 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1417	2671.48	2672.57	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	yeah i didn't think so you already trained oh okay so he's just he just compute 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1418	2671.51	2674.9	G	Professor	s^bu.%--	-1	0	yeah i didn't think so you already trained yeah it was on oh okay so he's just he just compute suggestion over ten show oh 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1419	2674.14	2674.4	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah it was on ten show oh 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1420	2674.28	2675.63	D	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah it was on us ten show oh i see i see 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1421	2674.9	2675.79	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah it was on us ten show oh i see i see 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1424	2676.43	2679.18	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and so i i think it would work fine for detecting overlap it's just 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1423	2676.22	2677.12	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and so i i think it would work fine for 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1422	2676.13	2676.55	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	and so i i think 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1425	2679.68	2681.98	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	it's just uh that it 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1426	2682.09	2683.66	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	yes that you pass issue that 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1427	2684.47	2691.85	A	Grad	s^bs	-1	0	he does is as a first pass he he he does um i guess at where the divisions might be any over estimates 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1428	2692.17	2693.92	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and that's just the data reduction step 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1429	2694.31	2696.15	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so that you're not trying it every time interval and so those 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1430	2696.18	2696.51	C	PhD	s^bk^rt	-1	0	and so those 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1431	2696.72	2699.4	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and so those are the putative places where he tries and right yeah okay 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1432	2696.82	2697.33	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and so those are the putative 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1433	2698.35	2698.49	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	places where he tries yeah okay 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1434	2698.77	2699.02	C	PhD	s^bk^rt	-1	0	places where he tries and right yeah okay 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1435	2699.65	2701.53	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and right now he's doing that with silence and that 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1436	2701.74	2702.62	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and that doesn't work 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1437	2703.14	2704.25	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	with the meeting recorder so 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1439	2704.95	2709.28	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	so if we use another method to get this first past i think it would probably work it's a good method yeah sure yeah yeah okay 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1438	2704.74	2704.88	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	so 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1440	2705.36	2705.9	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	if we use another yeah sure 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1441	2706.58	2706.74	C	PhD	b	-1	0	method to get yeah yeah okay 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1442	2706.85	2707.24	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	method to get this first past yeah yeah okay 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1443	2709.28	2710.02	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	it's a good method the like 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1444	2710.42	2712.41	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	the like as long as the segments along enough that's the 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1445	2712.09	2712.31	D	PhD	b	-1	0	enough that's the 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1446	2712.78	2713.58	A	Grad	s	-1	0	enough that's the other problem so okay so let me go 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1448	2713.06	2713.42	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	other problem so okay so let me go 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1447	2712.79	2715.65	G	Professor	s^co^t	-1	0	enough that's the other problem so okay so let me go back to what you had though um 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1449	2715.71	2716.01	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	had though um the other thing 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1450	2715.75	2716.15	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	had though um the other thing 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1452	2716.66	2717.01	D	PhD	b	-1	0	the other thing one could do 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1451	2716.56	2719.8	G	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	the other thing one could do is good is 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1453	2719.8	2721.91	G	Professor	s	-1	0	good is so you have two categories 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1455	2722.51	2722.7	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and you mark 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1454	2722.46	2724.02	G	Professor	s	-1	0	and you mark off models for good and you 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1456	2724.74	2725.9	G	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	good and you have a third category 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1457	2727.37	2732.55	G	Professor	qy^d^e^rt	+1	0	he has his own they have uh you have uh non speech single person speech in multiple person speech 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1458	2732.54	2733.8	F	Postdoc	s	-1	0	he has his own for it actually does help speech 
Bmr010.F.dialogueact1459	2733.8	2737.23	F	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	for it actually does help like this this several different categories on the board and then you have a mark 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1460	2736.2	2736.55	G	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	categories on the board 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1461	2737.15	2738.96	G	Professor	qy^d^rt	+1	0	and then you have a mark off afraid 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1462	2739.7	2740.29	C	PhD	h	-1	0	um 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1463	2742.43	2742.94	C	PhD	s^no	-1	0	and look for 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1464	2743.16	2746.13	C	PhD	s	+1	0	i i thought about adding uh not the class too but it's not 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1465	2746.13	2753.71	C	PhD	s	-1	0	but it's not too easy i think uh the transition between the different cost to model them in in the system i have now but 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1466	2753.71	2756.69	C	PhD	s^am	-1	0	i have now but it it it could be possible i think 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1467	2754.35	2754.75	G	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	it it it 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1468	2756.77	2757.12	G	Professor	s^bk^r	-1	0	i think 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1469	2757.45	2757.98	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1470	2758.57	2759.23	G	Professor	%--	-1	0	yeah i mean i this is 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1471	2759.79	2760.93	G	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	this is all pretty gross i mean 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1473	2761.4	2761.63	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	there there's a reason why 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1472	2760.93	2767.16	G	Professor	s	-1	0	all pretty gross i mean there there's a reason why uh i was suggesting originally we look at features because i thought well we're doing something we haven't done before we should at least 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1474	2767.13	2767.33	C	PhD	b	-1	0	we should at least 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1475	2767.56	2770.34	G	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	we should at least look at the space understand it seems 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1477	2769.54	2769.73	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	understand 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1476	2769.4	2769.7	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	understand 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1478	2770.61	2774.56	G	Professor	s	-1	0	it seems like if two people two or more people talk it once she got louder 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1479	2774.92	2775.13	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	louder uh and 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1480	2775.47	2779.99	G	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	i had the impression uh and uh uh there should be some dis continuity in pitch con tours 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1481	2776.84	2777.63	C	PhD	s^na	-1	0	i had the impression uh uh there should be some dis 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1482	2780.54	2780.88	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1484	2781.08	2781.24	C	PhD	b	-1	0	uh there should 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1483	2780.65	2791.95	G	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and uh there should overall be um smaller proportion of the total energy that is explained by any particular harmonic sequence in the spectrum 
Bmr010.A.dialogueact1486	2791.08	2791.31	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	in the spectrum 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1485	2790.66	2790.88	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	sequence 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1487	2792.51	2794.67	G	Professor	s	-1	0	so those are all things that should be there so far 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1490	2795.14	2795.36	C	PhD	b	-1	0	um 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1489	2795.04	2795.4	D	PhD	b	-1	0	um 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1488	2794.67	2798.81	G	Professor	s.%--	+1	2	be there so far um uh let's say has has been 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1491	2799.42	2801.08	G	Professor	s^t3	-1	0	but i was totally should be calling you pay pay but 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1492	2801.13	2801.25	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	but 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1494	2803.27	2803.56	D	PhD	b	-1	0	but your friends but 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1493	2803.1	2803.66	G	Professor	s^e	-1	0	but your friends but 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1495	2803.66	2803.72	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	but your friends but 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1496	2804.32	2804.52	G	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	um 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1498	2805.06	2805.5	D	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1497	2804.95	2805.48	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1499	2805.92	2812.1	G	Professor	s	+1	1	has has uh been exploring uh largely the energy issue and um 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1500	2812.1	2812.41	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1501	2812.96	2813.57	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	and um that's a lot 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1502	2813.75	2816.89	G	Professor	s	+1	0	that's a lot of things is not like this it's not as simple as it sounds and 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1504	2817.08	2817.25	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	and there's you know 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1503	2816.89	2824.74	G	Professor	s:qy	+1	0	simple as it sounds and and there's you know it's is energy is log energies l. p. c. residual energy is it is it is it uh delta of those things uh what 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1505	2824.74	2825.5	G	Professor	s.%--:qw.%--	-1	0	things uh what is it north obviously 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1506	2825.5	2829.27	G	Professor	s	-1	0	is it north obviously just a simple number absolute numbers and going to work so 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1507	2829.28	2831.75	G	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	so it should be with compared to what you there'd 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1508	2831.75	2837.74	G	Professor	qy^rt	+1	0	to what you there'd be a long window for the normalized in factor a short window for what you're looking at or 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1509	2835.64	2835.84	C	PhD	b	-1	0	a short window 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1510	2837.74	2839.27	G	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	at or you know helping short should they be so 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1511	2839.27	2839.54	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	they be so 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1513	2840.36	2840.72	D	PhD	b	-1	0	he's been playing around a 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1512	2840.11	2842.25	G	Professor	s	-1	0	he's been playing around a lot of these different things and and so 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1514	2842.25	2847.56	G	Professor	s	+1	1	and and so far at least it's not come up with any combination that really gave you an indicator so 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1515	2846.35	2846.63	D	PhD	b	-1	0	really gave you an indicator 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1516	2847.56	2847.98	G	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1517	2848.58	2851.77	G	Professor	s	-1	0	i i still have a hunch that there's these in there someplace but it may 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1518	2851.77	2858.28	G	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	in there someplace but it may be given that you've limited time here it it just may not be the best thing to to to focus on for the man and so it's related 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1519	2856.32	2856.48	D	PhD	b	-1	0	to to focus 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1520	2857.52	2858.18	D	PhD	s^2	-1	0	on for the man and so it's related 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1521	2858.28	2863.7	G	Professor	s	-1	0	and so it's related and harmonic related 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1522	2860.44	2860.65	D	PhD	b	-1	0	related 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1523	2863.79	2864.01	D	PhD	b	-1	0	but it seems like 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1524	2864.31	2866.85	G	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	but it seems like if we just want to get something to work 
Bmr010.C.dialogueact1525	2866.7	2866.9	C	PhD	b	-1	0	to work 
Bmr010.D.dialogueact1526	2867.7	2867.89	D	PhD	b	-1	0	that 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1527	2867.88	2870.09	G	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	that uh their suggestion of of who they were suggesting 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1528	2870.54	2872.86	G	Professor	s	+1	1	who they were suggesting going to mark off models 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1529	2873.32	2876.46	G	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	uh but in addition there's an expansion of what heavier did in one 
Bmr010.G.dialogueact1530	2876.46	2879.47	G	Professor	s	+1	0	did in one of those things looking at the statistical component
