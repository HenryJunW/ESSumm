Within the piloting of data collection ideas , it was decided that CrossPads are going to be used for detection of "hot points" during the meeting.
Other ideas to be tested are the use of summaries or minutes -if a group normally produce them- and the recording of oral summaries by individual participants after the meeting.
Photographing the contents of the board and the positions of the meeting participants will provide extra information.
For query generation purposes , all participants will also be asked for their highlight of the meeting.
The general goal regarding the corpus is to investigate the acquisition of further appropriate data through public sources or available collections of other institutions.
As to recordings at ICSI , the group agreed that imposing rules of participation  in order to avoid speaker overlaps was not desirable.
Instead , they will aim for collecting stylistically varied data ( different group dynamics and types of meeting ).
Further action will also be taken to close other pending issues: the web pages will be organised , the recording room will be finalised and UW will also test their recording infrastructure.
