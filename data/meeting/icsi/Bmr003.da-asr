Bmr003.A.dialogueact158	454.443	455.273	A	Grad	z	-1	0	because uh before the the meter as you said turn out the what 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact157	454.16	455.27	E	Postdoc	z	-1	0	because uh before the the meter as you said turn out the what 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact159	455.543	458.623	A	Grad	z	-1	0	the the meter which tells you what the levels on the various mikes are and there was 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact160	458.673	466.875	A	Grad	z	-1	0	are and there was one hypothesis that perhaps that the active recording of the there was one of the things that contributed to the errors oh 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact161	458.867	459.307	E	Postdoc	z	-1	0	are and there was one hypothesis 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact162	467.02	467.63	E	Postdoc	z	-1	0	mm i see 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact163	467.97	470.63	D	Undergrad	z	-1	0	that was me mm erica you into goes regional hypothesis right i see i see

Bmr003.A.dialogueact169	473.57	476.3	A	Grad	z	-1	0	well the only reason that could be as if the driver has about 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact170	477.157	477.317	A	Grad	z	-1	0	right because the machine just isn't 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact171	477.317	479.027	A	Grad	z	-1	0	right because the machine just isn't very heavily edited no chance of that no chance of that 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact172	478.302	479.272	D	Undergrad	z	-1	0	very heavily edited no chance of that no chance of that 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact173	479.217	480.057	A	Grad	z	-1	0	no chance of that just because it's data 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact174	480.057	480.837	A	Grad	z	-1	0	just because it's data 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact176	482.27	482.61	A	Grad	z	-1	0	yeah that that that was 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact175	482.2	484.27	B	PhD	z	-1	0	yeah that that that was that was a that was about it was a glitch 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact177	484.43	486.55	B	PhD	z	-1	0	it was a glitch last time you're in 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact178	488.008	490.198	D	Undergrad	z	-1	0	no are you recording or the table like a runaway you know chance 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact180	490.95	491.24	B	PhD	z	-1	0	yeah no uh you know chance 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact179	490.618	491.248	D	Undergrad	z	-1	0	yeah no uh you know chance 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact181	491.93	492.87	A	Grad	z	-1	0	yeah we usually do that uh 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact182	493.352	494.092	B	PhD	z	-1	0	no we done 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact183	495.194	495.324	A	Grad	z	-1	0	why 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact185	496.223	497.863	B	PhD	z	-1	0	so we we'll just be offended i i think not 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact184	496.0	496.26	D	Undergrad	z	-1	0	so we we'll just not 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact186	497.863	501.657	B	PhD	z	-1	0	be offended i i think uh i suspect uh somebody's smoking about that did just 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact188	502.036	504.436	B	PhD	z	-1	0	yeah so we've done before i think i knew ship them up well no we we can do that i know what that do this 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact187	501.9	502.75	D	Undergrad	z	-1	0	about that i think i knew ship them did just do this 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact189	503.21	504.12	A	Grad	z	-1	0	yeah so we've done before up well no we we can do that i know what that 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact190	504.636	506.136	B	PhD	z	-1	0	can do that i know what that their their full three you want four 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact191	506.67	507.43	B	PhD	z	-1	0	four 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact192	506.72	507.01	D	Undergrad	z	-1	0	four

Bmr003.B.dialogueact196	511.044	513.134	B	PhD	z	-1	0	but i think i think we should kind of position finish something shalala month 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact197	513.134	514.974	B	PhD	z	-1	0	something shalala month on the tabletop 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact199	516.16	520.95	A	Grad	z	-1	0	which means we need to move this thing and sorter decide how we're actually going to do things so they can put them 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact200	516.217	517.617	B	PhD	z	-1	0	which means we need to move this thing so they can put them

Bmr003.B.dialogueact201	521.79	522.67	B	PhD	z	-1	0	i guess that's the point a lot 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact202	522.345	522.505	A	Grad	z	-1	0	that's the point a lot 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact203	522.67	525.91	B	PhD	z	-1	0	that's the point a lot easier if we have a have sometimes in place like that 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact204	525.88	526.05	A	Grad	z	-1	0	place like that i do wish they were 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact205	526.4	528.88	E	Postdoc	z	-1	0	i do wish they were big booms coming down from the ceiling

Bmr003.A.dialogueact233	556.127	559.177	A	Grad	s^rt^t	+1	1	topic of this meeting is i want to talk a little about transcription um 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact234	559.684	563.734	A	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	um i've looked a little bit into commercial transcription services and jane 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact235	563.734	565.794	A	Grad	s	+1	0	services and jane has been working on doing transcription 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact236	566.49	569.71	A	Grad	fh|s^t	-1	0	uh answer on want to decide what we're going to do with that and 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact237	570.0	571.89	A	Grad	s^t	+1	1	then get an update on the electronics 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact238	572.337	577.347	A	Grad	s^cs^t	-1	0	and then uh maybe also talk a little bit about some infrastructure and tools and so on um you 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact239	577.607	580.197	A	Grad	fh|s^df	+1	0	on um you know eventually we're probably going to want to distribute this thing and we should decide how we're 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact240	580.197	584.167	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	and we should decide how we're going to how we're going to handle some of these factors 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact241	585.288	585.758	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	ship 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact242	585.79	586.57	B	PhD	qw^d	-1	0	ship that they

Bmr003.A.dialogueact247	591.3	592.76	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and so we're we're collecting corpus and i think 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact248	592.76	594.49	A	Grad	s	-1	0	corpus and i think it's going to be generally useful it seems 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact249	594.49	599.28	A	Grad	s	+1	0	it seems like it's not the corpus which is uh has been done before and so i think 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact251	599.68	602.16	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and so i think people will be interested in having having it so using like all your d. 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact250	599.48	599.95	B	PhD	b	-1	0	and so i think 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact253	602.22	602.66	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	it so using like all your d. 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact252	601.784	604.004	D	Undergrad	qy^d	-1	0	in having having it so susan using like all your d. v. d.'s or something like that 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact255	604.94	605.63	A	Grad	qw^br	-1	0	susan audio d. v. d.'s

Bmr003.D.dialogueact256	605.31	606.25	D	Undergrad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	well or something audio d. v. d.'s 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact257	606.34	607.12	A	Grad	h|s^aap	-1	0	well or something you 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact258	607.998	608.948	A	Grad	s^na	-1	0	you know the d. v. d.'s c.

Bmr003.A.dialogueact264	612.48	614.43	A	Grad	s	+1	1	and and so how do we distribute the transcript i we distribute 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact265	614.43	616.04	A	Grad	s	+1	1	i we distribute the audio files how do we 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact266	616.04	619.018	A	Grad	s	-1	0	how do we and we just do all that infrastructure well 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact267	619.73	628.61	C	PhD	h|s	-1	0	right well i think i mean for that particular issue there there are known sources for people go to to find these kind of things like the l. d. c. for instance 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact268	628.395	628.665	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	right instance 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact270	628.95	629.13	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right but but so instance 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact271	629.13	631.89	A	Grad	qy	+1	1	but but so should be doing in the same me l. d. c. and 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact269	628.665	628.965	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	right instance 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact272	631.89	634.03	A	Grad	qw	-1	0	me l. d. c. and what does that mean to what we've done already right the it's not so much catch 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact273	632.612	632.952	B	PhD	b	-1	0	what does that mean to what right the 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact274	632.952	633.302	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	what does that mean to what we've done already right the 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact275	634.23	641.11	B	PhD	s	+1	0	it's not so much catch the logistics of distribution uh secondary to preparing to take a simple fourth description

Bmr003.A.dialogueact279	644.419	649.089	A	Grad	s	-1	0	as it is it's sort of uh ad hoc combination of stuff and up and stuff i set up that we 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact280	649.759	651.659	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	that we may want to make a little more formal 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact281	652.793	652.963	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	and 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact282	652.91	659.75	B	PhD	s	+1	0	and the thing is that um university of washington they want to stop recording meetings as well in which case 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact283	659.08	659.27	A	Grad	b	-1	0	meetings as well in which case 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact284	659.75	665.776	B	PhD	s	+1	0	meetings as well in which case will have to decide i guess caught so that we can give them a copy field 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact286	666.041	666.451	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	trip 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact285	665.872	666.512	D	Undergrad	s	-1	0	them a copy field trip 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact287	668.071	668.161	A	Grad	b	-1	0	i was actually 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact288	668.731	670.811	A	Grad	s	-1	0	i was actually thinking i wouldn't mind spending the some 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact289	670.811	671.631	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	the some oh 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact290	671.95	672.36	B	PhD	qy^bh	-1	0	oh really

Bmr003.B.dialogueact292	673.34	674.13	B	PhD	s	-1	0	it my friends and different yeah yeah 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact294	674.52	675.03	B	PhD	b	-1	0	friends and yeah 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact295	676.802	679.552	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and sometimes well and then also i have a bunch of stuff for doing this digits so i have 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact296	679.822	687.132	A	Grad	s^df	+1	1	so i have a bunch of scripts with x. ways in some pearl scripts and other things that make it really easy to extract out an online where the digits are and if you'd 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact297	687.61	692.69	A	Grad	s^cs	+1	0	and if you'd you'd obvious going to do the same thing i think it's worthwhile for them to do these digits tasks as well

Bmr003.A.dialogueact460	909.96	910.3	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	into so i can i can actually 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact459	909.88	914.14	C	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	into so i can i can actually arrange for it to arrive in short order for 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact461	915.61	916.82	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	well it's really do i think too it's temperament 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact462	916.14	918.44	A	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	well it's really do unless we're going to someone to work on it so maybe we need it's temperament 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact463	918.44	921.366	A	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	on it so maybe we need to think about it a little bit i think too said 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact465	921.435	921.795	C	PhD	b	-1	0	bit i think too said 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact464	921.24	926.25	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	bit i think too said that they just the transcription format is really nice and simple in in the discourse to maine but they also 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact466	926.567	929.177	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but they also mention that they have time aligned massive i 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact467	929.347	930.897	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	maybe i should maybe massive i i saw that it 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact468	929.92	930.05	C	PhD	b	-1	0	maybe i should maybe massive i i saw that it 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact469	930.44	933.18	C	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	yeah yeah absolutely maybe i should maybe i should get a copy of it just to see what they did so so we i saw that it very nice 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact470	932.58	932.75	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah absolutely just to see what they did 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact471	932.75	933.27	B	PhD	s^na	-1	0	yeah yeah absolutely just to see what they did so so we very nice 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact474	933.85	934.0	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah so so we can we can compare very nice

Bmr003.E.dialogueact491	954.698	955.448	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	well there's apparently well this is clever 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact492	955.57	957.75	C	PhD	s	-1	0	apparently this was like phase one clever custody 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact493	956.74	957.46	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	this was like phase one custody 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact494	958.06	961.53	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and they there's still more that they're going to do apparently or something like that unless 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact496	961.7	963.57	C	PhD	s	-1	0	like that unless of course they're funding issues and then 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact495	961.655	961.925	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	like that unless 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact497	962.881	963.221	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	of course they're funding issues and then 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact498	963.57	966.32	C	PhD	s	-1	0	issues and then and i mean they may not toothpaste too but 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact499	966.32	970.341	C	PhD	s^df:s^bk	-1	0	too but from all the web documentation to look like oh this is phase one whatever 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact501	970.891	971.621	C	PhD	s	-1	0	one whatever that means 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact500	970.77	971.2	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	one whatever that means 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact502	972.18	972.52	E	Postdoc	s^ba^r	-1	0	super great 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact503	972.89	973.11	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	super great yeah that's i mean they're really 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact504	973.24	977.89	E	Postdoc	s^bk|s	-1	0	yeah that's i mean they're really well respected in the linguistics to decide to underscores very 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact506	978.03	978.32	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact505	977.89	978.11	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	very so 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact507	978.825	980.485	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	but it it would also maybe so this is a very good purpose 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact508	979.921	988.601	C	PhD	s^df.%--	+1	0	but it it would also maybe help be helpful for liz if she wanted to start work and some discourse issues you know looking at some of the state and then this is a very good purpose 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact510	989.76	990.15	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	so when she gets 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact509	989.461	989.701	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr003.C.dialogueact511	990.54	992.58	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	actually that's another thing i was thinking so when she gets here maybe that might be good thing for her 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact512	992.14	1001.98	A	Grad	s^cs	+1	0	actually that's another thing i was thinking about is that maybe jane should talk to liz to see if there are any transcription issues related to discourse that she needs to get unmarked thing for her 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact513	1003.91	1004.23	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	maybe 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact514	1004.97	1006.5	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	maybe we should have a big meaning meaning 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact515	1008.5	1008.69	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	so close that would 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact516	1008.69	1009.38	B	PhD	s^na	-1	0	so close that would be a meeting mimi 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact517	1008.84	1010.72	D	Undergrad	qy^d^j^rt	-1	0	i mean i mean so close that would be a meeting mimi 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact518	1010.42	1011.28	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	i mean i mean well this is 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact519	1011.19	1011.4	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	well this is 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact520	1011.72	1013.5	A	Grad	s^j	-1	0	well this is the meeting about the meeting innings 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact521	1013.5	1013.58	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	innings

Bmr003.A.dialogueact524	1015.53	1015.82	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	but 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact523	1015.15	1015.31	C	PhD	b	-1	0	but 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact525	1016.02	1019.82	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	maybe should it fine sunday that lives i live in seemed to be around more often 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact526	1019.78	1020.14	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	more often so to find 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact527	1020.43	1024.75	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	so to find a day when they're going to be here and and morgan is going to be here and 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact528	1024.94	1025.9	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	is going to be here and we can meet at least 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact529	1025.9	1026.87	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	we can meet at least elisa sub group i mean 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact530	1026.87	1030.13	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	well i was even thinking elisa sub group i mean not necessarily have d. u. dub people now 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact531	1030.29	1035.07	A	Grad	s^cs.%-	-1	0	well i was even thinking that maybe we need to at least paying the you've got to see you know we need we need to talk to them some more 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact532	1034.37	1035.86	C	PhD	s	-1	0	to see you know we need we need to talk to them some more 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact533	1035.91	1039.27	A	Grad	s:s	-1	0	you know say this is what we're thinking about for our transcription if nothing else so well uhhuh talk to them some more 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact535	1039.51	1042.06	A	Grad	qy^rt^t	+1	1	so well so we move on talk a little about transcription transcriptionist uhhuh yeah 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact534	1039.18	1039.51	B	PhD	b	-1	0	so well uhhuh 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact537	1042.05	1042.48	B	PhD	s^na	-1	0	transcriptionist 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact536	1041.97	1042.18	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	about transcription transcriptionist yeah 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact538	1042.59	1042.84	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	transcriptionist 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact539	1042.84	1044.92	A	Grad	s	-1	0	transcriptionist okay so sometimes that's we're talking about 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact540	1045.46	1050.32	A	Grad	s	+1	2	what we're using right now as a tool um from this french group called transcriber that seems to work very 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact541	1050.32	1051.54	A	Grad	s	-1	0	that seems to work very well 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact542	1052.19	1052.54	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr003.A.dialogueact543	1053.96	1057.47	A	Grad	s^e	+1	0	so has a uh nice useful tickle t. k.'s are in their face 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact544	1057.91	1058.59	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	this 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact545	1058.78	1061.49	D	Undergrad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	right this is the process of converting audio to text 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact546	1061.53	1061.74	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right text 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact547	1062.17	1066.08	D	Undergrad	qy^d	-1	0	right right so and just requires human just like the just to p. stuff 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact548	1063.55	1063.82	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	just like the 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact549	1064.14	1064.33	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	just to 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact550	1066.1	1066.99	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right right so 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact551	1066.99	1069.99	A	Grad	s	+1	1	right right so we're we're at this point only looking for word levels 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact552	1069.99	1076.34	A	Grad	s	-1	0	for word levels so all also what you have to do is just identify segments of speech in time and then write down what was said within it and identify 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact553	1076.66	1077.8	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	it and identify the speaker 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact554	1078.94	1084.93	A	Grad	s	+1	0	and to the things we that we know that i know i want our the tax to the start and and and the speaker 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact555	1085.52	1087.99	A	Grad	s	+1	1	but other people are interested in for example stress marking and 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact556	1087.99	1092.31	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	stress marking and so jane is doing primary stress um stretch marks as well i'm 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact557	1092.9	1101.53	A	Grad	s	+1	1	i'm and then things like repairs and false starts and filled pauses and all that other sort of stuff we decide how much of that we want to do i did 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact558	1101.82	1104.42	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	to do i did include caught uh a certain first passed my my 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact559	1104.73	1109.94	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	passed my my view on it once when you have every pair then uh it seems i 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact560	1110.08	1113.94	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	mean we saw there was this presentation of the speech meetings about how 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact561	1112.79	1113.44	A	Grad	b	-1	0	of the speech meetings about how 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact562	1114.34	1119.76	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and i think list on some stuff too on that that it uh that you get it bracket is in terms of like 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact563	1120.18	1126.8	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	well it's parent that which i know this is worked on then uh you do after because i like aspects 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact564	1126.56	1126.94	A	Grad	b	-1	0	like aspects 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact565	1126.75	1126.97	B	PhD	b	-1	0	like aspects 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact566	1127.19	1135.82	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and then also if it's a if it's a repair where there's like what i just did then it's nice to have sort of a sense of the comedy the outer it's the start 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact567	1135.82	1137.28	E	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	the outer it's the start to be to finish and uh 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact568	1137.28	1142.0	E	Postdoc	fh|s^ba	-1	0	and uh it's a little bit deceptive if you go that different protecting pre repair part 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact569	1143.38	1144.49	E	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	sometimes surfs the middle anyway 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact570	1144.59	1148.13	E	Postdoc	fg|s	-1	0	the middle anyway so i was doing was bracket and them to indicate that they were repairs which isn't 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact571	1148.53	1151.02	E	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	is which isn't very time consuming 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact572	1151.09	1151.71	A	Grad	b	-1	0	is 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact573	1152.03	1155.48	D	Undergrad	qy^rt	-1	0	already some sort of plan in place for how this is going to be staffed are done or is 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact574	1155.48	1157.25	D	Undergrad	qrr	-1	0	well that's part of the are done or is real that we're talking about here 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact575	1156.55	1156.77	A	Grad	h	-1	0	well real that we're talking about 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact576	1157.31	1158.98	A	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	that's part of the thing we're talking about so here 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact577	1158.98	1162.9	A	Grad	s^df	+1	1	thing we're talking about so what we wanted to do is have jane do basically one meetings worth 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact579	1163.42	1164.75	A	Grad	s^e	+1	1	you know forty minutes to an hour 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact578	1163.09	1163.35	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	you know forty minutes 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact581	1165.12	1165.5	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	and yourself sprouts 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact580	1165.02	1165.75	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and yourself sprouts 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact582	1165.71	1166.16	D	Undergrad	qy^d	-1	0	and yourself and this sprouts yeah that's part 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact583	1166.44	1166.66	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	and this yeah that's part 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact586	1166.82	1170.38	D	Undergrad	s^bu	-1	0	ten times about and this is this is like five times real time or ten times real time yeah that's part city 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact584	1166.44	1166.65	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	and this yeah that's part 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact585	1166.81	1167.59	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	and this is this is like yeah that's part city 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact587	1169.85	1170.68	A	Grad	s	-1	0	ten times about real time or ten times real time 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact588	1171.3	1174.45	A	Grad	s	+1	1	is and so one of the things was to get an estimate of how long it would take and also 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact589	1174.72	1176.48	A	Grad	s^e	+1	1	take and also what tools we use and so the next 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact590	1176.48	1181.56	A	Grad	s	+1	1	use and so the next decision which has to be made actually pretty soon is how are we going to do it until 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact592	1182.3	1182.57	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	so you make changes the first 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact591	1181.97	1183.24	D	Undergrad	s	-1	0	going to do it so until you make changes the first one so that she can decide 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact593	1183.24	1185.31	D	Undergrad	s:s	-1	0	one so that she can decide oh we don't need all this stuff just the worst are fine 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact594	1185.31	1186.29	D	Undergrad	s:s	-1	0	stuff just the worst are fine circuits 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact595	1186.54	1186.93	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	circuits 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact596	1186.93	1187.44	E	Postdoc	s^aa^r	-1	0	circuits right 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact597	1188.07	1188.88	B	PhD	b	-1	0	right i would 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact598	1188.9	1193.45	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	right so so one of one option right i would hear about these used to be a big ears continue maybe transcription conventions hurst 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact599	1192.3	1192.64	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right so so conventions hurst 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact600	1192.64	1197.84	A	Grad	s	-1	0	right so so one of one option is to get linguistics grad students and undergrads to do it and apparently conventions hurst 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact601	1197.84	1199.62	A	Grad	s^df	+1	0	undergrads to do it and apparently that's happened in the past and 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact602	1199.95	1202.03	A	Grad	s^ba	+1	0	the past and i think that's probably the right way to do it um it 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact603	1202.63	1204.78	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um it will require a post pass i mean 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact604	1204.97	1209.07	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	pass i mean people have to look at it more than once to make sure that that's been done correctly but i just can't 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact605	1209.4	1214.22	A	Grad	s	+1	0	but i just can't imagine that we're going to get anything that much better from a commercial one and the commercial 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact606	1214.53	1217.07	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and the commercial once i'm sure will be much more expensive could joy to do at all 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact607	1216.82	1217.81	D	Undergrad	qy^rt	-1	0	more expensive could joy to do at all 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact609	1218.58	1219.09	A	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	yeah right that that was that yeah 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact608	1218.29	1218.95	E	Postdoc	s^ar|%--	-1	0	yeah right yeah 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact611	1219.99	1221.8	A	Grad	s^j	-1	0	we'll just get joy n. j. and to do everything that that was that was for it 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact610	1219.55	1220.72	D	Undergrad	qy^df	-1	0	we'll just get joy n. j. that that was that was for it 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact612	1221.41	1221.69	D	Undergrad	s^aa^j	-1	0	and to do everything 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact613	1221.76	1222.44	D	Undergrad	s^aa^j	-1	0	and to do everything but 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact614	1223.1	1226.4	A	Grad	s	-1	0	you know that's what we're talking about is getting some slaves who who need money and uh 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact615	1225.35	1225.51	D	Undergrad	b	-1	0	who who need money 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact616	1226.4	1226.99	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	and uh 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact617	1227.54	1228.88	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	uh i can talk i detected that character's 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact618	1228.2	1229.89	E	Postdoc	s^fe	-1	0	i can talk i detected that character's 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact619	1230.42	1230.87	B	PhD	qy^bh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr003.A.dialogueact620	1231.19	1231.69	A	Grad	s^j	-1	0	i'm enjoying 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact621	1232.08	1234.17	A	Grad	s:qy	-1	0	it so again i have to say are we recording and then say uh thank you okay 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact622	1232.18	1232.67	E	Postdoc	s^ft	-1	0	it so again i have to say thank you okay 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact623	1232.67	1233.07	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	it so again i have to say are we recording thank you okay 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact624	1234.17	1239.68	A	Grad	s:s	-1	0	and then say uh morgan has has consistently resisted telling me how much money we have right well 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact625	1239.83	1239.93	D	Undergrad	b	-1	0	money we have right well 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact626	1239.93	1240.93	D	Undergrad	s	-1	0	money we have so right well the answer zero there's 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact627	1240.61	1240.83	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	so the answer zero there's 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact628	1240.93	1242.23	D	Undergrad	s^j	-1	0	so well i've had zero the answer zero there's reason she sits and 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact630	1242.57	1244.53	A	Grad	s	-1	0	well i've had zero then we can't do any chance corruption because and 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact629	1242.23	1242.45	D	Undergrad	fh	-1	0	well i've had zero and 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact632	1244.53	1245.55	A	Grad	s^df.%--	-1	0	corruption because we're we 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact631	1244.46	1244.66	D	Undergrad	s^bk	-1	0	corruption because 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact633	1245.96	1246.88	B	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	we're we job man 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact634	1247.35	1249.57	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	mean i i can't imagine us doing it ourselves @reject@ well we 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact636	1250.06	1250.36	A	Grad	qy^d^g	-1	0	already we are you 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact635	1249.78	1252.52	D	Undergrad	s	-1	0	@reject@ right well we already we are you already of a plan in place the first meeting 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact638	1252.63	1253.16	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right meeting well they there 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact637	1252.59	1252.89	D	Undergrad	qy^d^g	-1	0	right meeting 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact639	1252.89	1253.17	D	Undergrad	%	-1	0	right meeting well they there 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact640	1253.71	1254.45	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	well they there is also here 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact641	1254.45	1255.06	E	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	is also here there's also 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact642	1255.65	1267.47	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	well it be a bit seriously i i mean morgan there's also the other possibility which is if you can provide not money but instructional experience or some other perks and you could get people to to do it in exchange 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact644	1265.59	1265.86	A	Grad	b	-1	0	well it 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact643	1265.57	1269.55	D	Undergrad	s^ng|s	-1	0	well it be a bit seriously i i mean morgan so obviously in a bind over this and the thing to to do it in exchange 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact645	1269.55	1272.05	D	Undergrad	s^cs	-1	0	over this and the thing to do is to just do the field of dreams theory which is we 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact646	1272.52	1275.45	D	Undergrad	s^df	-1	0	which is we go ahead and so there will be money sometimes we need the money and 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact647	1275.06	1275.49	A	Grad	b	-1	0	the money and 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact649	1275.99	1276.21	B	PhD	b	-1	0	the money and if that's the best we can do 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact648	1275.97	1277.17	D	Undergrad	s^ba	-1	0	right the money and if that's the best we can do it but you could not 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact651	1277.26	1277.72	A	Grad	b	-1	0	right it but you could not 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact652	1277.35	1277.61	B	PhD	b	-1	0	right it but you could not 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact650	1277.17	1280.27	D	Undergrad	s^ba	-1	0	right it but you could not do anything until we get money is is ridiculous but i can do it 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact653	1280.45	1280.65	A	Grad	b	-1	0	but i can do it 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact654	1280.52	1281.91	D	Undergrad	s^df	-1	0	but i can do it and if we could 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact655	1281.77	1282.07	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	so and if we could 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact656	1282.48	1282.66	B	PhD	b	-1	0	so 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact657	1283.06	1287.46	A	Grad	fg|s^rt	-1	0	at any rate game was looking into the possibility of getting students that that 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact658	1287.54	1288.27	A	Grad	qy^g^rt	-1	0	that that right talking to people i'm afraid 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact659	1288.36	1289.47	A	Grad	qy^d	-1	0	right talking to people about that i'm afraid i haven't made any person 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact660	1288.51	1290.64	E	Postdoc	s^ng	-1	0	right talking to people about that i'm afraid i haven't made any person that front she just 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact661	1290.44	1290.62	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	that front she just 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact662	1290.64	1292.26	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	that front she just should you know i 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact663	1292.4	1292.65	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr003.A.dialogueact664	1292.96	1293.46	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	do it so 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact665	1293.12	1299.43	D	Undergrad	s.%-	-1	0	do it so it until you actually have a little experience with what this this french thing does we don't even have and i do 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact666	1299.72	1300.25	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	she's already have and i do have a 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact667	1300.53	1301.92	A	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	she's already done quite a bit oh yeah i'm sorry have a bunch of 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact669	1301.33	1301.66	D	Undergrad	s^bk	-1	0	done quite a bit oh yeah i'm sorry bunch of 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact668	1300.85	1302.29	E	Postdoc	s^nd	-1	0	she's already done quite a bit yeah oh yeah i'm sorry so that's have a bunch of hours yeah 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact671	1302.12	1302.33	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah so that's hours yeah 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact670	1301.66	1302.09	D	Undergrad	s^fa	-1	0	done quite a bit yeah oh yeah i'm sorry so that's bunch of hours yeah 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact673	1302.63	1304.46	D	Undergrad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	yeah so that's can over the fact that n. x. number hours yeah 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact672	1302.29	1302.53	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yeah so that's hours yeah 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact674	1305.42	1306.38	D	Undergrad	qrr	-1	0	or is that really just i guess actually that's the the one people 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact675	1305.58	1308.4	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	or is that really just i guess actually that's the the one people usually use ten x. 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact677	1309.74	1310.48	C	PhD	qw	-1	0	how fast are you and i haven't really calculated how fast

Bmr003.E.dialogueact678	1310.77	1311.44	E	Postdoc	qw^bk^rt	-1	0	are you calculated how fast to my 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact680	1312.05	1312.5	D	Undergrad	%-	-1	0	i haven't done 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact679	1311.64	1312.85	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	to my i haven't done 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact681	1313.02	1320.15	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	b. c. c. i. but at the same time doing kind of boot strapping a deciding transcription conventions that that are no and and stuff like you know how much there's 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact682	1317.03	1317.61	B	PhD	b	-1	0	that that are 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact683	1317.96	1318.22	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	that that are no and and 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact684	1320.87	1331.04	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	yeah there's some interesting human factors problems like yeah what's pan of uh of time is useful to segment thing into in order to uh transcribe at the most quickly because i know you get like 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact686	1331.48	1331.89	B	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah because i know you get like 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact685	1331.04	1333.85	E	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	yeah because i know you get like to go spend five words that's easy 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact688	1334.28	1334.62	B	PhD	b	-1	0	but then you have to take the 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact687	1334.17	1335.76	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but then you have to take the time to market and 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact689	1335.9	1343.2	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	uhhuh time to market and then there's the issue of it's easier to here at the right the first time if you've marketed the boundary instead of somewhere in the middle because i'm the words 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact691	1343.53	1344.18	B	PhD	b	-1	0	uhhuh because i'm the words by sectors or whatever 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact690	1343.2	1345.13	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	uhhuh because i'm the words by sectors or whatever and and 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact692	1345.13	1345.36	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and and 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact693	1345.86	1346.19	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and and so i mean i've 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact694	1346.49	1354.56	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	to visit it's so i mean i've been sort of playing with uh different ways of more because i think and you know i mean if you could get optimal instructions you could cut back on the number of hours it would take 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact696	1354.82	1355.02	B	PhD	b	-1	0	to visit it's just totally using is strictly it would take 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact695	1354.4	1356.66	D	Undergrad	qy.%--	-1	0	to visit it's just totally using is strictly it would take 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact697	1357.14	1358.57	D	Undergrad	s|qy^d^g	-1	0	it doesn't do any speech recognition doesn't no it doesn't 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact698	1358.51	1358.78	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	doesn't no it doesn't 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact699	1358.66	1359.05	E	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	doesn't no it doesn't but a super tool 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact700	1359.05	1360.02	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	but but a super tool it's a great environment 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact701	1360.02	1361.04	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	but but is there any way it's a great environment 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact702	1360.96	1363.42	D	Undergrad	qy	+1	1	but but is there any way dorsey trick our to it actually it's a great environment 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact703	1363.48	1364.68	D	Undergrad	s^e.%-	-1	0	to it actually run it through that's an interesting 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact704	1364.36	1365.36	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	we've we've run it through that's an interesting idea hey 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact706	1365.49	1367.16	A	Grad	s	-1	0	we've we've thought about doing that but the recognition quality idea hey 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact705	1365.36	1366.23	E	Postdoc	s^bk^fe	-1	0	we've we've thought about doing that idea hey 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact707	1367.16	1370.4	A	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	but the recognition quality is going to be horrendous 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact708	1371.16	1371.92	D	Undergrad	s	-1	0	well a couple of things first 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact710	1372.38	1372.9	B	PhD	s^ba.%	-1	0	of all the time working you

Bmr003.C.dialogueact727	1394.88	1400.26	C	PhD	h|s^cs^ng.%--	-1	0	i mean we talked about it but well i mean but sometimes it's easier to type out something instead of going through figuring out which is great i mean it depends on the 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact729	1395.56	1396.51	A	Grad	s	-1	0	i mean we talked about it but i mean but sometimes it's easier to type

Bmr003.C.dialogueact731	1400.26	1401.51	C	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean it depends on the error rates right but was but

Bmr003.D.dialogueact734	1404.29	1405.3	D	Undergrad	s.%-	-1	0	be we don't care the timing should be 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact735	1405.61	1406.88	C	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	be we don't care about that i mean it works oh 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact736	1407.0	1409.25	D	Undergrad	s^bu	-1	0	we don't care about the time the words just to because he's just that said that was a pretty much no i that the boundary 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact738	1408.61	1410.9	A	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	we don't care about the time the words just to be odder and we don't because that was a pretty much no i that the boundary

Bmr003.B.dialogueact741	1410.84	1412.15	B	PhD	s^no	+1	0	be odder and we don't we don't know actually we haven't decided which 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact742	1411.41	1411.77	E	Postdoc	s^r	-1	0	we don't know actually 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact743	1412.15	1413.85	B	PhD	s^df	+1	0	we haven't decided which which time we can around and 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact744	1413.85	1418.63	B	PhD	s^bs	+1	0	which time we can around and kind of one of the things you're saying it's like you have the oceans put in more or less timing pay 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact745	1419.62	1425.33	B	PhD	s	+1	0	yeah so so what what she's done and uh but in the absence of most specific instructions trying to figure out what the mystery things do is what would you 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact746	1424.57	1424.63	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah so so mystery things do is 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact747	1424.72	1431.82	A	Grad	fg|s	+1	0	yeah so so what what she's done so far is sort of more or less press not preference or phrases continuous phrases mystery things do is what would you 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact748	1429.66	1429.88	B	PhD	b	-1	0	or phrases 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact749	1432.35	1439.42	A	Grad	fh|s	+1	0	and so um that's nice because you you separate when you do an extract you get a little silence on either end so that seems to work 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact750	1439.42	1440.78	A	Grad	s	-1	0	end so that seems to work really well that's 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact751	1441.02	1441.44	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	yeah said deal although i 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact752	1441.69	1442.04	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	yeah said deal although i i you know the alternative 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact754	1441.87	1442.07	B	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah said deal although i i you know the alternative 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact753	1441.69	1452.8	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yeah said deal although i i you know the alternative which i sort of experimenting with before i run its time recently was um that you know even if it were like a arbitrary segment of time pre marked because 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact755	1452.8	1454.57	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	yeah pre marked because it does take time to put those markings and it's 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact756	1454.69	1455.72	B	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah really and it's really the the interface 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact757	1454.88	1456.84	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	yeah really and it's really the the interface wonderful because 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact758	1456.85	1460.72	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	wonderful because you know the time it takes as you listen to it and then you press return key 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact759	1461.12	1469.81	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	but then you know it's like um you press the tab key to stop the flow and and uh the return key to to put in a marking of the boundary 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact760	1470.18	1473.46	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	yeah but you know obviously there's a like between when you hear twenty compress return keesa slightly delayed 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact761	1473.22	1473.64	B	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah keesa slightly delayed 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact762	1473.46	1474.45	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yeah keesa slightly delayed so then you 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact763	1474.45	1476.96	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so then you listen to a second time and move over here 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact765	1477.86	1478.01	D	Undergrad	%	-1	0	so that's exciting i think i'll be 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact764	1477.52	1478.27	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so that's exciting i think i'll be 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact766	1478.48	1479.11	D	Undergrad	fg	-1	0	are i think i'll be pretty smart at some 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact767	1478.5	1481.75	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	are are those still plays just i think i'll be pretty smart at some we'll let you know good 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact768	1479.66	1479.96	D	Undergrad	fg	-1	0	are pretty smart at some 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact770	1481.19	1481.71	A	Grad	b	-1	0	those still plays just good

Bmr003.D.dialogueact771	1483.43	1484.42	D	Undergrad	qy^d^r	-1	0	this delays adjustable see a lot of people 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact772	1484.66	1489.12	D	Undergrad	s^df	-1	0	see a lot of people who actually build stuff human computer interface is understand that delay and

Bmr003.E.dialogueact861	1599.15	1600.01	E	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	right so i'm not sure it's that much but anyway enough to work 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact862	1600.01	1601.18	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	several minutes right um but anyway enough to work with 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact863	1600.99	1601.23	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	several minutes right um but anyway enough to work with 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact864	1601.61	1602.41	B	PhD	s	-1	0	several minutes um and with 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact865	1601.71	1602.15	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	several minutes um and with 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact866	1603.04	1604.43	C	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	and fraught the words but keep the time 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact867	1604.57	1605.68	C	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	but keep the time markings 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact868	1606.53	1613.48	C	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	and then go through i mean and go through and and try and re transcribe it given that we had perfect boundary detection and okay good idea okay 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact869	1606.58	1606.86	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	and then go through okay 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact870	1608.4	1608.81	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	and go through and and good idea 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact871	1613.93	1616.39	C	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	and see if it seems it seems feels easier to you okay and forgetting all the words okay 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact872	1614.0	1614.34	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	see if it seems it 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact873	1616.21	1617.97	D	Undergrad	s^cs.%-	-1	0	to you okay and forgetting all the words because you yeah i was thinking i'd 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact874	1617.26	1617.98	E	Postdoc	s^bk|s^na	-1	0	because you yeah i was thinking i'd 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact875	1617.98	1620.5	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yeah i mean that's that's part of the problem is is because you yeah i was thinking i'd be cheating a little bit familiarity but 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact876	1619.38	1623.23	C	PhD	s^bk|s^df^na	-1	0	when they should that you did it again yeah i mean that's that's part of the problem is is that what we really needed somebody else to come along bit familiarity but 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact877	1622.18	1625.19	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	when they should that you did it again from scratch and then there's the kind of somebody else to come along 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact878	1625.19	1626.26	B	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	and then there's the kind of actually developing three 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact879	1626.26	1627.53	B	PhD	s^cs^j	-1	0	actually developing three times yeah 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact880	1627.53	1627.89	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	times yeah

Bmr003.E.dialogueact883	1629.08	1629.89	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and then there's a plan 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact884	1629.69	1632.03	D	Undergrad	s^cs^j	-1	0	and then that would just need some statistics two or three more there's a plan 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact885	1632.42	1633.08	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr003.D.dialogueact886	1633.88	1637.47	D	Undergrad	s^df^j	-1	0	so you'll get you'll get down to one point two x. but i mean oh yeah well do that tomorrow 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact887	1634.18	1634.67	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	so oh yeah well do

Bmr003.D.dialogueact890	1639.93	1643.26	D	Undergrad	fg|s	-1	0	no but the thing is the fact that she's she did before just might give a lower bound that's all it's end of the day exactly

Bmr003.D.dialogueact896	1644.83	1645.03	D	Undergrad	%	-1	0	right fine it's and lower about 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact898	1645.41	1647.74	D	Undergrad	s^df	-1	0	and lower about as nynex sandwich waste of time 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact897	1644.98	1645.29	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	right fine it's and lower about 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact899	1648.27	1648.47	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	well 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact900	1649.04	1652.08	E	Postdoc	s.%--	+1	0	uhhuh i bet there's an extra promises that i didn't really keep accurate it wasn't a pure test 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact902	1652.5	1652.75	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	uhhuh it wasn't a pure test 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact901	1652.33	1653.88	E	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	uhhuh it wasn't a pure test the first time so 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact904	1654.31	1654.63	B	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah uh it's going 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact903	1653.88	1657.36	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yeah the first time so uh it's going to be an upper bound and in that case and 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact905	1657.69	1659.45	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	case and it's not really strict comparables i think those 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact906	1659.45	1666.79	E	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	1	that's right we would comparables i think those proposals to be used a new a new batch of text having it done yet in the same eating could on the next segment 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact907	1666.17	1669.83	B	PhD	qw	-1	0	that's right we would we got the the the oracle boundaries from 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact908	1670.4	1670.59	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	all 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact909	1670.92	1671.68	B	PhD	s^e	-1	0	yeah one all the boundaries 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact910	1671.83	1675.16	A	Grad	s^bk|s.%--	-1	0	yeah one person would have to assign the boundaries and then the other person would have to that's easy enough the boundaries we we we can what can they do for the next oh i see 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact911	1672.15	1673.46	E	Postdoc	qy.%-	-1	0	person would have to assign the boundaries and then what can they do for the next 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact912	1674.62	1676.4	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	the other person would have to that's easy enough i could do that we we we can say oh i see that they 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact914	1675.37	1676.08	A	Grad	s	-1	0	to that's easy enough i could do that we can say oh i see that they 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact913	1675.17	1675.78	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	to that's easy enough we can oh i see 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact915	1676.08	1676.69	A	Grad	s	-1	0	i could do that say that they 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact916	1676.64	1680.34	E	Postdoc	s|qy^g^rt	-1	0	i could do that say that automatic millionaire uh you that they oracle boundaries would come from volume on a specific channel with me 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact919	1680.6	1681.01	A	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	you know that automatic boundaries millionaire uh you want to know you given me

Bmr003.C.dialogueact920	1680.98	1685.78	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	you know that automatic boundaries millionaire uh you want to know you given given a perfect human segment asian i mean you want to know how well i mean me 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact921	1684.14	1684.39	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	i mean you want to 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact922	1685.88	1689.37	C	PhD	s	+1	0	know how well i mean the the question is is it worth giving you the second patient oh i see 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact923	1689.39	1689.89	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	patient oh i see 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact925	1690.44	1691.21	A	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah that's that's easy enough i can generate the segment 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact926	1690.59	1691.04	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah that's that's easy enough i can generate the segment 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact924	1690.28	1690.36	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	yeah that's that's easy 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact927	1691.21	1696.02	A	Grad	s	+1	1	enough i can generate the segment patient and you could do the words and time yourself on it so yeah a little double blind here kind 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact929	1696.26	1696.51	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	so yeah double blind here kind 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact928	1695.87	1697.52	D	Undergrad	s	-1	0	time yourself on it so yeah a little double blind here kind of i see 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact930	1697.07	1697.23	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	of i see 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact931	1697.35	1697.65	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	of i see 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact932	1698.16	1698.48	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	so it okay 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact933	1698.67	1700.02	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so it that might be worth doing okay that's good like that 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact934	1700.17	1700.56	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	that's good like that 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact935	1700.69	1701.14	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	that would at least that's good like that 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact936	1701.71	1707.76	A	Grad	s^df	+1	0	that would at least elsewhere it's worth spending a week or two trying to get a tool that will compute uh segment patients and i think 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact938	1707.7	1708.03	C	PhD	b	-1	0	patients and i think even mine too about this tool 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact937	1707.67	1713.13	D	Undergrad	s	+1	0	patients and i think even mine too about this tool guys is it sure you can do the competition for what we're going to do in the future but if if you'd 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact939	1713.13	1719.61	D	Undergrad	s	+1	1	but if if you'd always talking about doing two or three or five times as much stuff and they can use the same tools and obviously israel multiplier there the other 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact940	1718.17	1718.41	A	Grad	b	-1	0	and obviously israel multiplier 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact941	1719.83	1722.44	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	there the other thing too is with the speaker domestication if if i 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact942	1722.55	1726.16	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	well it it's pretty easy one was cause if if i could handle speaker unification is a big deal 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact943	1724.19	1724.99	B	PhD	%-	-1	0	well it is a big 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact945	1728.1	1728.56	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	is it okay 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact944	1728.02	1728.67	D	Undergrad	s^co	-1	0	is it okay 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact947	1728.67	1730.91	D	Undergrad	s^df	-1	0	yeah yeah is it probably like expensive microphone okay yeah i mean that's a nice beach 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact946	1728.29	1728.63	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	is it okay 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact948	1729.21	1730.95	E	Postdoc	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	yeah yeah probably like expensive microphone yeah i mean that's a nice beach

Bmr003.E.dialogueact951	1731.69	1733.49	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	yeah i mean it's good that there's going to be in the meetings as a major that's like one of the two things 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact952	1732.38	1737.7	C	PhD	s	-1	0	like i mean it's good that there's going to be in the meetings like the reading group meeting that we have the other day that this going to be a bit of a problem because that's like one of the two things 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact953	1733.75	1734.3	B	PhD	b	-1	0	like there's going to be in the meetings like the reading group things 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact954	1737.7	1740.37	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	a bit of a problem because like i wasn't wearing a microphone and there are other

Bmr003.A.dialogueact978	1768.16	1769.28	A	Grad	s|qy^d^g	-1	0	if you tell me where it is finished the the part of work already 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact977	1767.82	1771.03	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	easy if you tell me where it is we just finished the the part of work already completed on this to me i mean you 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact979	1771.34	1771.63	E	Postdoc	qy^g	-1	0	to me i mean you 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact980	1771.63	1775.09	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	to me i mean you you talked a little bit about the transcription conventions and 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact981	1775.13	1775.46	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	and 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact982	1775.63	1781.45	E	Postdoc	fh|s.%--	-1	0	and i guess you mentioned mentioning your progress report status report that you had written a script to converted into so 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact983	1781.91	1793.77	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	into so i when i it just quick quickest for me in terms of the transcription part to say something like you know if if adam spoke to um to just say eight colin 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact984	1794.17	1796.2	E	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	uhhuh the could be you know me at the beginning of the line and equal 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact985	1796.11	1796.51	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and equal 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact986	1796.5	1803.54	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and equal and instead of entering the interface for speaker that education and clicking on the thing and syndicated speak variety so 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact987	1803.96	1808.37	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	variety so and then he has a script that will conversion to the the thing that that would indicate speak right 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact989	1809.54	1810.19	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	it's pretty cute 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact988	1809.51	1810.15	E	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	it's pretty cute 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact990	1810.55	1810.82	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr003.A.dialogueact991	1812.0	1812.6	A	Grad	s	-1	0	at any rate so um pros

Bmr003.E.dialogueact992	1812.55	1813.19	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	at any rate so um pros 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact994	1814.71	1814.88	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right so 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact995	1814.88	1818.8	A	Grad	s	-1	0	right so so i think the gas at ten x. seems to be pretty standard 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact996	1819.26	1824.86	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	everyone's more or less everyone you talk to says about ten times for hard technical transcription using what using study using

Bmr003.A.dialogueact1033	1871.39	1871.61	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	is caffeine companies 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1035	1873.62	1873.71	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah so so interesting 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1036	1873.71	1876.47	A	Grad	fg|s^df	-1	0	yeah so so my my search was pretty cursory it was just in interesting 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1034	1873.55	1874.28	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	yeah so so my my search interesting 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1037	1876.47	1877.69	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	it was just in that search 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1038	1878.14	1883.36	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and uh so it was only people who have web pages and are doing stuff through that well he thing think thing about 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1039	1882.58	1887.86	D	Undergrad	fg|s	-1	0	stuff through that well he thing think thing about this is thinking kind of maybe a little more globally then they should here but 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1040	1887.86	1891.19	D	Undergrad	s^cs	-1	0	should here but did really this could be a big contribution i could make uh 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1041	1891.97	1893.5	D	Undergrad	s^df	-1	0	uh i mean we've been to d. s. t. p. thing we know what it was 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1042	1893.5	1896.72	D	Undergrad	s^df	-1	0	p. thing we know what it was like to to manage to manage the process and merely and 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1043	1896.72	1899.46	D	Undergrad	s^df	-1	0	the process and merely and merely might look for more detailed we're looking for here but 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1044	1899.46	1901.47	D	Undergrad	s	-1	0	for here but it was a it was a big hassle right i mean 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1045	1901.47	1901.8	D	Undergrad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	hassle right i mean 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1047	1902.09	1902.24	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah you know the they 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1046	1901.8	1905.24	D	Undergrad	s^df	-1	0	yeah hassle right i mean you know the they constantly reminding people going over and 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1048	1905.85	1908.75	D	Undergrad	fh|s	-1	0	over and clearly some new stuff needs to be done here 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1049	1909.5	1913.89	D	Undergrad	s	-1	0	and if it's only our time where are of course includes 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1050	1913.89	1914.99	D	Undergrad	s	-1	0	include me at all 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1051	1915.74	1916.16	D	Undergrad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1052	1917.27	1917.96	D	Undergrad	s.%-	-1	0	it just seems like 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1053	1918.66	1923.89	B	PhD	s^bk|s^no	-1	0	yeah i mean i don't know if we'd be able to things to help the t. p. type problems but some 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1054	1923.89	1925.88	B	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	problems but some for this problem we can do about it why because 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1055	1924.1	1924.46	D	Undergrad	%	-1	0	for this problem we can 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1056	1925.83	1925.94	D	Undergrad	qw	-1	0	do about it why because 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1057	1925.94	1927.14	D	Undergrad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	do about it not because they why because they want a lot more detail 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1059	1927.57	1927.71	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	not because they 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1058	1927.35	1927.57	B	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	not because they 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1060	1927.57	1929.61	B	PhD	s^df|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	not because they had and then had to speak it's right i mean 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1061	1929.61	1931.72	B	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	speak it's right i mean the the excitement the problem is 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1063	1933.96	1934.27	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	trivial they had oh here too 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1062	1933.72	1934.22	D	Undergrad	s	-1	0	trivial they had oh here too 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1064	1934.85	1936.72	A	Grad	s	-1	0	they had two speakers over the telephone too oh i see so what took him so 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1065	1935.81	1936.2	D	Undergrad	s^bk	-1	0	two speakers over the telephone oh i see so what took him so 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1066	1936.49	1937.36	D	Undergrad	qw^rt	-1	0	so what took him so long 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1067	1938.19	1940.95	A	Grad	h|s	-1	0	um mostly because they were doing much lower level time 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1068	1940.31	1940.54	B	PhD	b	-1	0	time 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1069	1941.36	1946.68	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	so they were doing phone and so little transcription as well as uh we're transcription 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1070	1944.31	1944.48	D	Undergrad	b	-1	0	transcription 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1071	1945.74	1945.93	D	Undergrad	b	-1	0	as well as uh we're 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact1072	1946.54	1946.73	C	PhD	b	-1	0	transcription 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1073	1946.81	1947.26	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	transcription and 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1074	1947.95	1951.12	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	and so we're we we decided early on that we were not going to do that i see 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1075	1950.82	1951.03	D	Undergrad	s^bk	-1	0	we were not going to do that i see 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1076	1952.38	1959.21	D	Undergrad	s	-1	0	yeah right and so so what but they're still the same issue of managing the process of reviewing and keeping the file straight and all this stuff which is clearly hassle 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1077	1954.58	1954.78	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah process of reviewing 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1078	1954.75	1955.01	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah process of reviewing and keeping 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1079	1959.05	1959.27	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	and so so what 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1080	1959.27	1964.43	A	Grad	fg|s^bs	+1	2	and so so what i'm saying is that if we hire an external service i think we can expect three hundred dollars an hour i think 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1081	1959.44	1959.72	B	PhD	b	-1	0	and so so what 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1082	1964.83	1966.01	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	an hour i think that's the ballpark there were several different 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1083	1966.32	1970.98	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	there were several different companies that and they're the range was very tight for technical documents twenty 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1084	1970.98	1972.64	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	technical documents twenty eight to thirty two dollars an hour who knows 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact1085	1971.07	1971.45	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	eight to thirty two dollars 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact1086	1972.77	1977.07	C	PhD	qw	+1	1	an hour they want will have to mix yeah they went over so if it's okay yeah who knows if they're going to be able them manage multiple multiple channel 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1087	1976.12	1976.71	B	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	they want yeah they went over channel 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1088	1976.75	1977.2	A	Grad	s	+1	1	they want will have to mix yeah they went over so if it's okay yeah channel 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1089	1976.75	1978.0	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	they want will have to mix yeah they went over so if it's okay yeah no i mean channel and then there's a problem also 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1091	1977.4	1978.16	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	will have to mix so if it's okay yeah no i mean and then there's a problem also 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1090	1977.05	1977.41	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	will have to mix so if it's okay yeah 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1093	1978.0	1978.19	B	PhD	b	-1	0	no i mean and then there's a problem also 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact1092	1977.7	1977.97	C	PhD	b	-1	0	will have to mix so if it's okay yeah 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1095	1978.73	1982.26	B	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	no i mean they would they were doing doing and they will fuse to transcribe this kind of material that's not what and then there's a problem also 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1094	1978.24	1979.43	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	no i mean they would they were doing doing and then there's a problem also 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1096	1982.65	1984.29	B	PhD	s|qy^d^g	-1	0	yes it is that's not what the question for eight well they might 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1098	1984.52	1985.08	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yes it is eight quite amazing well they might they might quota 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1097	1984.5	1985.8	D	Undergrad	s^am.%-	-1	0	yes it is eight quite amazing well they might they might quota 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1099	1985.51	1986.26	B	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	seven several of them quite amazing though they might quota 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1100	1986.18	1989.72	A	Grad	s	-1	0	seven several of them say that they'll do meetings and conferences and stuff and so on none of though 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1102	1989.72	1994.01	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	stuff and so on none of them specifically said that they would do speaker id or speaker change mark they all just the transcription yeah they're they're they're they're maybe this 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1101	1989.7	1990.22	B	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	stuff and so on none of them specifically said 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1103	1993.01	1993.4	B	PhD	b	-1	0	speaker change mark they they're they're 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1105	1994.01	1995.16	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	all just the transcription they're they're maybe this multiplier for five 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1104	1993.68	1998.92	D	Undergrad	s	-1	0	speaker change mark they all just the transcription they're they're they're they're maybe this multiplier for five people cost twice as much for ten people got something like that 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1106	1998.03	1999.18	B	PhD	b	-1	0	well the the way it something like that 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1107	1999.3	2001.25	A	Grad	s	-1	0	well the the way it worked is it was scale so what they had 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1108	2001.39	2005.52	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	so what they had is it's an easy task it cost twenty four dollars an hour and it will 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1109	2005.8	2008.15	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	an hour and it will take maybe five or six times real time and what they 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1110	2008.56	2015.41	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	and what they said is for the hardest tasks bad acoustics sticks meeting settings it's thirty two dollars an hour and it takes about ten 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1111	2015.41	2016.77	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	an hour and it takes about ten times real time i see 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1113	2017.17	2020.38	A	Grad	s	-1	0	so i think that we can count on that being about what they would do it would probably be a little yeah right 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1112	2017.14	2017.68	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so i think that we can count 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1114	2019.6	2019.9	B	PhD	b	-1	0	about what they yeah 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1116	2020.38	2021.57	A	Grad	s	-1	0	would do it would probably be a little more because we're going right 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1117	2020.65	2020.93	B	PhD	b	-1	0	would do it would probably be a little right 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1115	2020.23	2020.54	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	would do it would probably be a little right 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1118	2021.57	2023.59	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	more because we're going to want them to do speaker a lot 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1119	2023.83	2032.45	D	Undergrad	s	-1	0	so a lot of companies i work for you the uh the person leading the meeting the detected or whatever to go rent room and and mentally calculate how many dollars per hour this meeting is costing in 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1120	2024.51	2024.77	A	Grad	fh	-1	0	so of companies i work for you

Bmr003.C.dialogueact1165	2081.04	2083.36	C	PhD	s^bu|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	it's thirty dollars an hour isn't the rate but we can pay through that

Bmr003.C.dialogueact1168	2087.1	2088.63	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	that's and the question is what's the difference or 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1169	2088.84	2090.29	B	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	that's how much i don't think difference or eight dollars would do you know what the going rate it's it's 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact1170	2088.98	2089.94	C	PhD	s^bsc	-1	0	that's how much i don't think difference or eight dollars would

Bmr003.C.dialogueact1172	2091.0	2093.35	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	it's on the order of eight to ten i think that that would say is 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1173	2093.01	2095.56	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but think that that would say is a a good a good estimate 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact1174	2094.48	2094.94	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	a a good a good 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact1175	2096.08	2096.69	C	PhD	s^no	-1	0	i'm not sure i i'd say

Bmr003.B.dialogueact1177	2097.22	2097.62	B	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah i was going to say 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1178	2097.22	2098.12	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	let's yeah i was going to say you'd say ten 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1179	2098.26	2098.8	E	Postdoc	qy^bu^d	-1	0	let's you'd say ten 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact1180	2098.99	2099.46	C	PhD	s^co	-1	0	let's say ten because they did not you'd say ten 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1181	2099.59	2100.6	B	PhD	s^na	-1	0	say ten because easier they did not for engineering graduate 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact1183	2100.01	2100.83	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	easier for engineering graduate 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1182	2099.6	2101.52	D	Undergrad	s|qy^d^g	-1	0	say ten because easier they did not for engineering graduate students 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1184	2102.13	2102.29	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	i do the linguistics 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1185	2102.29	2103.68	A	Grad	s^df^na	+1	1	i do the linguistics grad students i 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1188	2104.05	2104.43	A	Grad	s^cs^j	-1	0	i i don't know 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact1187	2103.59	2105.94	C	PhD	s^no.%--	-1	0	grad students i i i don't know it i don't know at the where there 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1186	2103.48	2104.08	D	Undergrad	s^bk	-1	0	grad students i i i don't know 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact1189	2105.94	2107.16	C	PhD	s	-1	0	it i don't know at the where there is a standard pay scale i just don't know what it is yeah that's right 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1192	2107.34	2107.59	A	Grad	b	-1	0	i just don't know what it is yeah that's right 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact1190	2107.16	2107.94	C	PhD	s^no	-1	0	i just don't know what it is yeah that's right 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1191	2107.3	2107.83	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	i just don't know what it is yeah that's right 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1193	2108.05	2108.41	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	um that's right 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact1194	2108.82	2109.27	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	um so that that's right 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact1195	2109.9	2116.53	C	PhD	s^bs	+1	2	and that's what i said so that means that even if it takes in thirty times realtime it's cheaper too to do graduate student and there's another aspect 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1196	2115.82	2117.53	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and that's what i said originally that i couldn't to do graduate student and there's another aspect too 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1197	2116.47	2119.91	A	Grad	s	+1	3	and that's what i said originally that i couldn't imagine sending and that's going to be cheaper no student there's another aspect too 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1198	2119.92	2120.59	B	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	going to be cheaper no it isn't fun yeah the thing too 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1200	2120.69	2120.94	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	it isn't fun yeah the thing too 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1199	2120.64	2129.53	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	it isn't fun yeah the thing too is that uh if they were linguistics they'd be peace in terms of like the post editing yeah topic content wise they might be easier to handle because they 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1201	2129.63	2131.69	E	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	handle because they might get more right the first 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1202	2132.23	2135.86	A	Grad	s	+1	0	and also we would have control of me we could give them feedback whereas 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1203	2135.86	2138.16	A	Grad	s^df	+1	0	them feedback whereas if we do a service it's going to be limited amount i mean we can't yeah yeah 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1205	2138.15	2138.84	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	i mean we can't yeah yeah 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1204	2137.99	2138.23	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	going to be limited amount i mean we can't yeah yeah 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1207	2138.7	2143.1	A	Grad	s^df:s	-1	0	i mean we can't tell them you know for this meeting we really want to mark stress in for this meeting we want yeah yeah

Bmr003.E.dialogueact1285	2237.59	2240.31	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	well well you know what i thought was right now we have to so i gave 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1286	2240.53	2243.18	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	to so i gave him a proposal for the transcription conventions he made his uh suggestion 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1287	2243.18	2244.89	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	okay he made his uh suggestion prove it that 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1288	2244.13	2244.45	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay prove it that 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1289	2244.97	2246.34	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	okay prove it that that that's a good suggestion so as far 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1290	2246.62	2249.63	E	Postdoc	s	+1	2	so as far as i'm concerned those transcription conventions or fix right now 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1291	2250.2	2252.11	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	what what are they well they cover and so my next plan would be 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1292	2251.14	2253.04	B	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	what what are they well they cover plan would be they're very minimal so 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1293	2253.08	2253.78	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	they're very minimal so 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1294	2253.78	2255.49	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	they're very minimal so good just to summarize it so 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1295	2255.84	2259.66	E	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	yeah it so um one of them is the idea of how to indicate speaker change 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1296	2259.79	2259.99	B	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah change 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1297	2260.17	2264.57	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	and this is the way which meshes well it with a making it so that uh you know on that point such 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1298	2262.08	2262.34	B	PhD	b	-1	0	a making it 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1299	2264.57	2266.02	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	know on that point such a nice interface when you when you get thee 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1300	2266.02	2272.44	E	Postdoc	s^e.%--	-1	0	you when you get thee um you get to see signal you also get down beneath it an indication of uh if you have two speakers 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1301	2272.44	2277.48	E	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	uh if you have two speakers overlapping in this in a single segment you see them want display one above each other and 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1302	2277.79	2281.67	E	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	each other and then at the same time the tops part of the screen as the actual verbatim thing you can clip 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1303	2281.67	2286.35	E	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	thing you can clip click on individual orders is in it'll take you meet lead to that part of speech signal play for you and 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1304	2286.88	2289.85	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	their limits number speakers you and you can it you can work pretty well between those two things 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1305	2289.11	2290.33	D	Undergrad	qy^rt	-1	0	um their limits number speakers things 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1306	2290.96	2293.27	A	Grad	h|s^na	+1	1	um the user interface only last too and so 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1308	2293.81	2299.92	A	Grad	s^df	+1	1	too and so if if you are using their interface to specify overlapping speakers you can only do too 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1307	2293.54	2293.76	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	too and so 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1309	2300.36	2301.84	A	Grad	s	+1	1	but my script can handle any and 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1310	2301.95	2303.91	A	Grad	s	-1	0	can handle any and they're save format can handle any 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1311	2304.74	2310.81	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and so um using this the convention the chain i've discussed you can have as many overlapping speakers as you want is this a 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1312	2310.32	2312.21	D	Undergrad	qy^rt	-1	0	speakers as you want is this a uh university project 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1314	2313.39	2313.64	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah just the french supper

Bmr003.A.dialogueact1326	2320.16	2320.46	A	Grad	s^aa	+1	0	yes and they said that's 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1327	2320.46	2324.25	A	Grad	s^df	+1	0	yes and they said that's on in in the works for the next version also multi multi channel

Bmr003.A.dialogueact1332	2326.67	2333.48	A	Grad	s	-1	0	well they said they wanted to do it but that the code is really very organized around single channel so i think that's 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1334	2333.48	2335.49	A	Grad	s	-1	0	channel so i think that's an unlikely to have happen 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact1333	2333.44	2333.93	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	channel so i think that's 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact1335	2335.88	2336.16	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	happen you know what they're using

Bmr003.E.dialogueact1379	2395.3	2397.52	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	meal stops sheesh if you if you press a tap and 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1380	2398.0	2398.64	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1381	2399.34	2400.19	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and so uh 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1382	2400.84	2402.09	E	Postdoc	fh|s^ba	-1	0	uh that's a nice feature and then also 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1383	2402.34	2407.14	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and then also once you put a break and then you have the action uh cycling through the unit you could do it like multiple 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1384	2407.33	2408.32	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you could do it like multiple until you get 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1385	2408.55	2411.57	E	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	looping until you get crazy and decide to stop likely through that or 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1386	2410.72	2411.08	D	Undergrad	qy^cs^d^rt	-1	0	looping to stop likely through that or 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1388	2411.95	2414.94	D	Undergrad	s	-1	0	you you know there's also also the these interfaces missing is that or or or 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1387	2411.9	2412.34	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	you you know there's also that or or 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1389	2413.16	2413.48	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	also the these or 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1390	2414.94	2416.24	D	Undergrad	s^df	-1	0	interfaces missing is missing from all of our offices medicine some sort 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1391	2416.24	2418.32	D	Undergrad	s^df	-1	0	medicine some sort of like and put for something like that so what 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1392	2418.42	2420.43	D	Undergrad	s	-1	0	like that so what are you people actually use of course something that with 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1393	2420.43	2424.09	D	Undergrad	s^df	-1	0	of course something that with when you move your hand further the sound goes faster passes like fast ford 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1394	2424.09	2424.91	D	Undergrad	s^e	-1	0	like fast ford 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1395	2425.32	2426.23	D	Undergrad	s^e	-1	0	you know like a joystick or uh 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1396	2426.23	2429.58	D	Undergrad	fh|s^e	-1	0	or uh you could wire a mouse or track balls some it's not something i wanted to

Bmr003.D.dialogueact1402	2437.9	2443.62	D	Undergrad	s	-1	0	yeah we talked you need to do this and so you get very good at sort of jumping back and forth rather than hitting cabin back space in turned and or things like that

Bmr003.A.dialogueact1411	2449.61	2451.28	A	Grad	s^no	-1	0	i i just don't know how much it's worth doing and just going yeah yeah i i agree 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1413	2451.28	2452.21	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	and just going to have yeah i i agree they they have several 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1412	2450.87	2451.38	D	Undergrad	b	-1	0	don't know how much it's worth doing and just going yeah yeah i i agree

Bmr003.E.dialogueact1418	2452.28	2453.37	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	to have they they have several options so it's you know 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1419	2453.37	2455.16	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	options so it's you know i mentioned the looping option other option is it'll 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1420	2455.16	2457.78	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	other option is it'll cost me reaches into the boundary 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1421	2458.22	2459.86	E	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	and then to get to the next i just pressed happens 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1423	2460.24	2460.38	A	Grad	b	-1	0	on the next you know to 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1422	2459.86	2461.03	E	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	i just pressed happens on the next you know to me it's very nice they thought 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1425	2461.23	2461.45	D	Undergrad	s^ba	-1	0	me it's very nice they thought 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1424	2461.03	2462.22	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	me it's very nice they thought that they thought about and also 
Bmr003.C.dialogueact1427	2462.39	2462.69	C	PhD	b	-1	0	that they thought about and also 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1426	2462.22	2462.67	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	that they thought about and also 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1428	2462.67	2464.8	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	that they thought about and also it will go around of the um 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1429	2465.06	2465.76	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i want to say cursor but i'm not 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1430	2465.76	2467.59	E	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	i want to say cursor but i'm not sure if it's the right thing 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1431	2466.93	2467.33	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	sure if it's the right thing 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1432	2467.51	2467.88	A	Grad	s	-1	0	right thing 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1433	2468.08	2472.94	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	anyway you can so they thought about different ways of having windows that you i work with that 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1434	2473.11	2473.47	B	PhD	b	-1	0	and but 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1435	2473.41	2479.68	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and but so in terms of the cause the conventions then uh basically uh strictly or the graphic which means 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1436	2479.68	2485.09	E	Postdoc	s^df	+1	1	the graphic which means with some provisions for uh uh cloak will form so if person 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1437	2485.15	2494.48	E	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	so if person said because instead of because then i put up an apostrophe at the beginning of the word and then and double wide like angle brackets what the full of school i would be in this could be 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1438	2486.28	2486.96	B	PhD	b	-1	0	said because instead 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1439	2494.48	2497.07	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	would be in this could be something it was handled by table or something but i think to have a 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1440	2497.07	2505.09	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but i think to have a convention marking it as a non standard or what economy kind of i'm a non uh worth of course the graphic uh whatever going 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1441	2504.37	2504.8	B	PhD	b	-1	0	uh whatever 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1443	2505.82	2506.79	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	going to or want to

Bmr003.A.dialogueact1699	2949.14	2953.58	A	Grad	s^df	+1	1	it's just there's no user interface for specify multiple any more than two so you're

Bmr003.D.dialogueact1701	2953.66	2955.94	D	Undergrad	s^bu	+1	0	than two yeah so you're you're skips all's doesn't solve all our problems cause

Bmr003.D.dialogueact1704	2955.94	2958.71	D	Undergrad	s^df	-1	0	yeah solve all our problems cause we're always going to want to go through this preprocessing i'm assuming 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1705	2957.46	2957.65	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	through this preprocessing 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1706	2958.71	2959.72	D	Undergrad	s^e	-1	0	i'm assuming it works 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1707	2959.66	2959.83	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	it works 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1708	2960.35	2962.22	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and it works i said because it's so quick dinner so i wouldn't want to do 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1709	2962.31	2966.0	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	i see so i wouldn't want to do it through interface anyway i think which right with the speaker was 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1710	2964.3	2964.53	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	i see i think which right 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1711	2964.62	2964.89	D	Undergrad	s^bk	-1	0	i see i think which right 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1712	2965.07	2965.25	D	Undergrad	b	-1	0	with the speaker was 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact1713	2966.56	2966.74	D	Undergrad	s^ba	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1714	2967.3	2968.8	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and then uh let's see what else 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1715	2969.21	2969.81	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	oh yes i i 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1716	2969.81	2970.76	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	oh yes i i wanted to have so 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1717	2970.96	2972.78	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	wanted to have so sometimes the person i guess in 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1718	2972.78	2977.8	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	the person i guess in terms of like the continuity of thought for transcription is is just words coming out it's like 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1719	2977.8	2980.13	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	words coming out it's like there's some purpose for another in and sometimes 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1720	2980.13	2983.29	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and sometimes someone will do a back channel in the middle of it but you want to show 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1721	2983.61	2985.97	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	of it but you want to show that it's continued at a later point so 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1722	2985.97	2992.45	E	Postdoc	s	+1	2	at a later point so i have i have a convention of putting like a dash arrow just to indicate that this person's that are letters continues and then when 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1723	2992.45	2996.75	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and then when it catches back up again and this and they're dash me up 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1724	2996.75	3000.93	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and they're dash me up the opposite direction syndicate continuation of one's own daughter is versus 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1725	3001.37	3001.68	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	uh sometimes 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1726	3001.68	3008.13	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	uh sometimes we had situation which is you know what you what you get in conversations of someone continuing someone else's outer edge and 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1727	3008.83	3009.27	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and in that case it did it tilde 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1728	3008.83	3014.04	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	and in that case it did it tilde arrow versus a arrow tilde to indicate that it was continuation but it wasn't like i said 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1729	3014.04	3014.63	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	but it wasn't like i said 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1730	3014.63	3018.7	E	Postdoc	s^bk|s	-1	0	but it wasn't like i said equal arrow for this for the tone for yourself things because it's 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1731	3018.31	3019.04	B	PhD	b	-1	0	things because it's speakers the same 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1732	3018.7	3019.81	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	things because it's speakers the same 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1733	3020.3	3025.19	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and then tell there if it was a different if a different speaker uh continuation but as you know there is 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1734	3021.58	3022.49	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	if it was a different if a different 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1735	3023.21	3023.24	A	Grad	b	-1	0	speaker uh 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1736	3025.19	3027.96	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	but as you know there is showing continuation of and bought 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1737	3028.38	3028.71	B	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and then you could 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1738	3028.63	3031.1	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and then you could track weather was same secret not by knowing you know at the end of this unit 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1739	3031.19	3033.66	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know at the end of this unit you know what happened later and that 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1740	3033.86	3035.6	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	happened later and that was like this person continued and you'd 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1741	3034.79	3034.96	B	PhD	b	-1	0	was like this person 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact1742	3035.74	3038.05	E	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	but continued and you'd be able to look for the continuation 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact1744	3038.97	3039.4	A	Grad	fg	-1	0	but any time 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1743	3038.95	3044.75	B	PhD	s	-1	0	but any time that becomes ambiguous is if you have to speak because 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1745	3046.54	3054.2	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	like if you if any of one cousin of have one full discontinued across a ticket time boundary you just need i want to each and then it's picked up a difference 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1746	3054.2	3056.44	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	and then it's picked up a difference because picked up it's a 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1747	3057.01	3063.93	B	PhD	s^df	-1	0	time it comes on big is if you have more than one speaker and that and the of swamp 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact1748	3064.1	3068.28	B	PhD	s	-1	0	i can have one one track i menu you know and been hooked on it

Bmr003.A.dialogueact1761	3085.89	3094.94	A	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	but a lot of these issues i think that for uh from my point of view where i just want to do speech recognition and information retrieval it doesn't really matter

Bmr003.D.dialogueact2076	3488.43	3494.0	D	Undergrad	s	+1	0	that they important issue about the l. e. d. is the fact that we're talking about eight of these total which to be sixteen channels and 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact2077	3494.55	3499.52	D	Undergrad	fh|s	-1	0	and uh even though we have sixty channels back at the capture they're not all to be used for this so there should be a

Bmr003.D.dialogueact2079	3499.52	3504.67	D	Undergrad	s^df	-1	0	for this so there should be a subset of them used for obviously just use the ones that and for this may so 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact2080	3504.67	3504.88	D	Undergrad	fg	-1	0	this may so 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact2081	3505.86	3506.17	D	Undergrad	s^fa	-1	0	she's need like a a way 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact2082	3506.29	3509.75	D	Undergrad	s	-1	0	need like a a way to tell whether you're boxes life so the only wouldn't be so if you 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact2083	3508.64	3509.06	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	life so the only wouldn't be so if you 
Bmr003.B.dialogueact2084	3509.06	3510.17	B	PhD	s	-1	0	only wouldn't be so if you plug in doesn't work 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact2085	3509.75	3513.18	D	Undergrad	s^e	-1	0	only wouldn't be so if you plug in doesn't work and they will use off it's to tip off and then 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact2087	3513.66	3521.01	D	Undergrad	s	-1	0	and then the uh would wire though all the cables in a in a bundle come through here in uh obviously collect these cables at the same time uh so this 
Bmr003.E.dialogueact2086	3513.3	3513.8	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	and then 
Bmr003.D.dialogueact2088	3521.14	3528.11	D	Undergrad	fh|s	+1	0	right we want to do that uh so this this notion of putting got a peezie m.'s taken away would somehow have to be turned into leaving them on the table or want 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact2090	3528.2	3528.33	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right we want to do that or want 
Bmr003.A.dialogueact2091	3528.33	3529.67	A	Grad	s^na	+1	0	right we want to do that definitely so or want right right and
