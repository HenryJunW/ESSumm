The Berkeley Meeting Recorder group discussed research aims and corresponding concerns for future data collection.
It was agreed that a substantial amount of meeting data is required from different domains , and comprising several speakers , to perform the types of discourse and acoustic analyses desired.
Ongoing efforts by speaker mn005 to automatically  detect regions of speaker overlap were considered.
It was suggested that speaker mn005 focus on a small set of acoustic parameters , e.g . energy and harmonics-related features , to distinguish regions of overlap from those containing the speech of just one speaker.
Disk space issues were discussed.
And , finally , the problem of speaker anonymization was explored.
