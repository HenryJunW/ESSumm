Bmr011.B.dialogueact91	160.253	162.123	B	Professor	s	-1	0	guess the order we brought him up seems fine um 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact92	161.504	161.754	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	brought him up seems fine 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact93	162.553	163.173	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact94	164.14	166.18	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	so better quality close talking mike so the one issue 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact95	166.18	172.24	B	Professor	s	+1	0	so the one issue was that the of the uh the tell mike uh isn't as good as you would like and so 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact96	172.24	176.83	B	Professor	s^bu	+1	0	and so uh you'd be better if we had close talking makes perfect right right 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact97	176.83	177.1	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	makes perfect right right 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact99	178.491	179.031	A	PhD	h	-1	0	that that basically the point 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact98	178.09	179.78	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	that that basically the point 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact100	180.556	180.976	A	PhD	s^aa|%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact101	182.269	190.066	A	PhD	s	+1	1	and it actually in addition to that that they a close second mics or born in such a way as to best captured the signal and 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact102	190.941	194.451	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and the reason here is just that for the people doing work not on 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact103	194.451	197.701	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	not on microphones but i'm sort of like dialogue and so forth 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact104	198.345	199.735	A	PhD	h|s.%--	-1	0	uh weren't even on probably which 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact105	199.735	201.665	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	on probably which don donnas going to be work and soon it 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact106	202.015	208.435	A	PhD	s	+1	1	adds as extra you know very variable for each speaker to to deal with on the microphone parent 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact108	208.768	209.208	B	Professor	b	-1	0	so and 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact107	208.63	208.86	H	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr011.A.dialogueact109	209.577	211.337	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	so and i also talked to marry this morning and she also had a 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact110	211.337	213.767	A	PhD	s	-1	0	morning and she also had a strong preference for doing that and in fact 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact111	213.767	218.505	A	PhD	s	-1	0	for doing that and in fact she said that it's useful for them to know and started to collect their data too 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact112	217.259	217.629	B	Professor	b	-1	0	started to collect their data 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact113	219.72	220.4	B	Professor	fg|s.%-	-1	0	right so once well so 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact114	219.8	220.27	H	Grad	fg|%-	-1	0	right so once well so 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact115	221.89	229.633	B	Professor	s	+1	1	oh well one thing i was going to say was that um we could get more uh if they had mounted microphones even 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact116	229.983	232.563	B	Professor	s	-1	0	even beyond the number of radio channels we have because 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact117	232.563	237.506	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we have because i think weather's great hero wires probably second harder on the main thing 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact118	237.506	240.006	B	Professor	s	-1	0	harder on the main thing is having the microphone close too though not too 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact120	240.217	240.607	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	though not too 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact119	240.006	241.536	B	Professor	s^bd^df	-1	0	though not too close 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact121	242.456	242.626	H	Grad	b	-1	0	right so uh 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact122	242.626	247.556	H	Grad	s	-1	0	right so uh actually the way jose is wearing his is correct

Bmr011.H.dialogueact156	277.81	278.14	H	Grad	b	-1	0	well yeah 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact157	278.419	281.759	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	well yeah i mean it doesn't hurt to have a few extra microphones around so i 
Bmr011.D.dialogueact158	278.716	278.906	D	PhD	b	-1	0	well yeah 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact159	281.759	284.439	B	Professor	s^cs.%--	+1	1	around so i would just go out and get in order of of if this 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact160	284.729	286.569	B	Professor	s	-1	0	of if this microphone seems okay to people 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact161	287.159	288.939	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	uh just get a half dozen of the family well the only the only 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact162	288.287	293.157	H	Grad	s	-1	0	of the family well the only the only problem with that is right now um some legitimate start working 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact163	294.382	296.202	H	Grad	s^e	-1	0	that little the boxes under the table 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact164	296.7	297.15	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	and so we 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact165	297.11	300.42	H	Grad	s	-1	0	and so we uh i've only been able to find three jacks are working 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact166	301.047	301.467	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr011.E.dialogueact167	302.24	303.35	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	no but can we get these wireless so 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact168	302.66	303.05	H	Grad	fh	-1	0	no but can we get these wireless so 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact169	303.808	305.068	B	Professor	s^ar|s.%-	-1	0	but you could just record these single no but my point is 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact170	304.635	308.765	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but you could just record these single separately in time alignment with the stars my point is 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact171	309.08	310.42	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	right i i'm not sure i'm following 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact172	310.01	311.03	H	Grad	s^no	-1	0	right i'm not sure i'm following say that again 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact173	311.09	311.6	H	Grad	s^co^rt	-1	0	right say that again 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact174	311.955	318.072	B	Professor	s	-1	0	right now we've got uh two microphones in the room that are not quote unquote standard so why don't say that again 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact175	318.672	320.332	B	Professor	s^cs.%-	-1	0	so why don't we replace those they just too 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact176	320.291	320.971	H	Grad	s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	they just too 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact177	322.79	324.4	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well however many we can plug in africa plugging 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact179	324.4	326.21	B	Professor	s	-1	0	in africa plugging three that's in three also we've 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact178	324.341	324.621	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	in africa plugging 
Bmr011.D.dialogueact180	325.357	325.717	D	PhD	b	-1	0	three that's in three 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact181	326.54	329.55	B	Professor	s	-1	0	also we've talked before about getting another uh radio right 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact182	329.52	329.74	H	Grad	b	-1	0	radio right 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact183	330.48	333.75	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so then that would be you know three right okay 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact184	333.17	333.75	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right okay 
Bmr011.D.dialogueact185	333.88	334.11	D	PhD	b	-1	0	so uh right okay 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact186	334.466	338.096	B	Professor	s^co	+1	0	so uh so we should go out to our full complement of whatever we can do have them all be 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact187	338.402	339.882	B	Professor	s	+1	2	have them all be the same mike i think 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact188	339.962	345.498	B	Professor	s	+1	0	the same mike i think the no reason that it was done another way was because it was sort of experimental thing and i don't think 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact189	345.498	351.11	B	Professor	s	+1	0	thing and i don't think anybody knew whether people would rather have more variety or or uh more uniformity but but 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact190	346.923	347.093	A	PhD	b	-1	0	anybody knew whether people would rather have more variety 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact191	351.11	352.382	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but but uh 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact192	354.721	356.271	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	sounds sounds fun sounds like uniformity wince 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact193	355.52	356.83	H	Grad	s	-1	0	sounds fun sounds like uniformity wince 
Bmr011.D.dialogueact194	356.379	356.539	D	PhD	b	-1	0	wince 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact196	357.656	363.09	A	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	well for short term research it's just there's just so much effort that would have to be done upfront not so yeah you is it 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact195	357.307	357.637	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	well for 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact197	362.03	362.23	H	Grad	fg	-1	0	be done upfront not 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact198	363.2	365.03	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so yeah you for me would be great is it because you're you're saying 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact199	363.297	363.467	H	Grad	b	-1	0	so yeah you is it 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact200	363.83	364.49	E	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	so yeah you for me would be great is it because 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact201	365.45	367.72	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	you're you're saying the for dialogue purposes so 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact202	367.72	371.504	E	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	purposes so that means that the transcribers are having trouble with those mics is that what you mean 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact203	371.504	372.104	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	jane would know mics is that what you mean

Bmr011.B.dialogueact344	643.0	647.937	B	Professor	s	-1	0	or or maybe it's it's not a specific array microphone they want that that would be really neat 
Bmr011.D.dialogueact345	643.037	643.377	D	PhD	b	-1	0	or or that would be really neat

Bmr011.B.dialogueact347	647.937	654.007	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	microphone they want that they might want to just you know you could imagine taking the for signals from these these table mics and trying to do something with them 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact348	654.775	657.825	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	i also had a discussion so 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact349	657.825	664.895	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so we'll um we'll be over over there talking to him after class on friday 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact350	665.155	667.741	B	Professor	fh|s^cc	-1	0	um what you know what because some of that 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact351	668.081	676.832	B	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	also had a completely unrelated thing i had a uh discussion today with uh burger called myer was uh uh german uh scientist 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact352	677.452	680.732	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	it's got a for size group doing range of things sort of 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact353	680.732	683.602	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	of things sort of auditory related largely for hearing aids and so on but 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact354	683.602	683.742	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and so on but 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact355	684.458	693.535	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but uh does stuff auditory models and he's very interested in direction now d. and location and and uh had models and from things and so 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact356	693.535	697.295	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	things and so uh he's he and possibly student that there's uh

Bmr011.B.dialogueact361	710.716	712.986	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so on but anyway you might be interested in stuff that their minds they had 
Bmr011.D.dialogueact362	711.024	711.524	D	PhD	b	-1	0	you might be interested 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact363	712.09	718.108	E	PhD	s^cs^tc	+1	0	in stuff that their minds they had uh i thought of an interesting project that somebody could try to do with the data from here either using 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact364	718.108	724.006	E	PhD	s^cs^e	-1	0	either using you know the the mics on the table or using signal energies from they had worn mike's and that is to try to construct 
Bmr011.D.dialogueact365	721.387	721.667	D	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	using signal 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact366	724.006	726.436	E	PhD	s^cs^e	+1	1	and that is to try to construct a map of where people were sitting 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact367	726.84	727.05	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	sitting uh based on well that dan had worked

Bmr011.B.dialogueact440	841.304	847.094	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh he might be excited too and it might be very appropriate for him to uh or he might have no interest whatsoever i i just really don't 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact441	847.094	848.354	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	i i just really don't know is he 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact442	848.35	848.53	G	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	know is he 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact443	848.75	849.84	H	Grad	qy.%--	-1	0	know is he involved in uh 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact444	849.84	851.91	H	Grad	s	-1	0	involved in uh i'm blanking on the name of the project 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact445	852.379	859.472	H	Grad	s	+1	0	this is has done a big meeting room instrumented meeting room with video and microphone raise and very elaborate software is is he 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact446	859.472	860.942	H	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	well that's what they're starting up is is he doing working on that 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact447	860.115	861.125	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	well that's what they're starting up doing working on that

Bmr011.B.dialogueact449	862.58	866.14	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah no i mean that's what all this is about they they haven't done it yet okay 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact451	867.4	868.41	B	Professor	s^e	+1	0	they wanted to do i had read some papers that look like they've 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact450	867.03	867.28	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	they wanted to do i had read some 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact452	867.46	870.41	H	Grad	s	-1	0	they wanted to do uh i had read some papers that look like they've already done some work 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact453	870.75	873.18	B	Professor	s	+1	0	uh well i think they've instrumented the room but i don't work 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact454	873.63	876.72	B	Professor	s	+1	0	but i don't think they they haven't started recordings yet they don't 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact455	876.72	879.09	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yet they don't have the the transcription standards they don't have the are they going to do video as well 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact457	879.09	879.72	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	they don't have the are they going to do video as well 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact456	879.03	880.08	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	they don't have the are they going to do video as well 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact458	879.477	879.767	H	Grad	b.%	-1	0	they don't have the are they going to do video as well 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact459	880.446	880.746	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact461	881.47	881.8	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bmr011.B.dialogueact462	882.51	883.14	B	Professor	s^am^r	-1	0	because what what i had read was 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact463	882.655	889.04	H	Grad	s	-1	0	because what what i had read was um they had a uh a very large amount of sulphur infrastructure for coordinating all this both in 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact464	889.12	897.095	H	Grad	s^e	-1	0	well i'm i'm both in terms of recording also alive room where you're interacting dispenser interacting with computer and with the video and lots uh there's uh 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact465	897.351	898.661	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	well i'm i'm i'm not sure uh all 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact466	898.067	898.317	H	Grad	fh	-1	0	i'm not sure uh all 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact467	898.661	904.881	B	Professor	s	+1	0	i'm not sure uh all i know is that they've been talking me about a project that they're going to start up recorded people maybe in meetings well 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact468	902.412	903.332	H	Grad	fg	-1	0	up recorded people maybe well 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact469	905.351	907.411	B	Professor	s	+1	1	and uh it is related are as they were interested in 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact470	907.411	908.401	B	Professor	s	+1	1	are as they were interested in r.'s they want wanted to 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact471	908.401	912.571	B	Professor	s	+1	0	r.'s they want wanted to get some uniformity with us uh about the transcription and so on 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact472	910.49	910.72	H	Grad	b	-1	0	with us uh 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact473	913.272	915.542	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	in one one notable difference actually i 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact474	915.542	919.202	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	actually i can't remember where they were going to do routinely park city or not but one 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact475	919.262	925.744	B	Professor	s	+1	0	but one when uh difference from the audio side was that they are interested in using rain mikes 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact476	926.24	928.94	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	so um i mean i just tell you party line on that the reason 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact477	928.94	938.775	B	Professor	s^df	+1	0	you party line on that the reason i didn't go for that here was because uh the focus uh both of my interest and adams interest was uh in impromptu situations and 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact478	938.895	939.265	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact479	940.25	942.29	B	Professor	s	+1	0	we're not recording much impromptu situations but that's because it's 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact480	942.29	946.437	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but that's because it's different to get there for research than to actually apply it and so 
Bmr011.D.dialogueact481	945.633	945.843	D	PhD	b	-1	0	actually apply 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact482	946.437	950.317	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	it and so uh for scientific reasons was that was good instrument this room is we wanted it but 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact483	950.967	963.534	B	Professor	s	+1	0	it but the thing we ultimately wanted to aim at was a situation where you were talking with uh one or more other people uh in and i'm impromptu and we didn't didn't actually know what the situation is going to be and therefore 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact484	963.804	970.044	B	Professor	s	+1	0	going to be and therefore it would not be highly unlikely that room would be outfitted with with some very carefully designed array of microphones um 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact485	970.695	974.515	B	Professor	fh|s^df	-1	0	um so is only for that reason is just you know yet another piece of research and seemed like 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact486	974.515	976.685	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	and seemed like you had enough troubles just so there's no like portable 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact487	976.0	979.09	E	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	just also there's there's there's no like portable array of mikes 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact488	979.2	985.81	B	Professor	s^ar|s^ng	-1	0	also there's there's uh there's a whole range of things as a whole array of things that people do on this so 
Bmr011.D.dialogueact489	979.508	979.878	D	PhD	b	-1	0	also there's there's 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact490	985.81	986.72	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	do on this so um 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact491	987.39	990.19	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	d. uh the big a raise that place is 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact492	990.29	995.73	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	that place is uh like uh rutgers and brown and other other places 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact493	996.309	1000.259	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh they have uh big raise within a hundred hundred mike's or something and 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact494	997.722	998.282	H	Grad	s.%	-1	0	uh big raise within a hundred 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact495	1000.74	1002.65	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and it's a there's a wallaf mike's and 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact496	1002.81	1006.41	B	Professor	s	-1	0	mike's and you get really really good being point that sort of thing and 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact497	1002.9	1003.17	E	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	mike's and you get really 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact498	1007.0	1008.82	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it's and um 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact499	1009.27	1016.85	B	Professor	s	-1	0	in fact at one point we had a a proposal in with rutgers where are we were going to do some of the sort of perch and it's like the processing and they were 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact500	1016.85	1018.64	B	Professor	s	-1	0	like the processing and they were going to do the multi channel stuff but 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact501	1018.71	1020.66	B	Professor	s	-1	0	stuff but to to in it not doing it but i've 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact502	1020.66	1020.82	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	not doing it but i've 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact503	1020.95	1025.37	E	PhD	s	-1	0	not doing it but yeah it's it's really it's i've seen demonstrations of the microphone it's it's amazing how they can cut out noise and then they have little 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact504	1023.72	1026.3	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	yeah it's it's really it's uh and then they have amazing how they can cut out noise and then they have little ones too i mean 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact505	1025.38	1026.78	H	Grad	s	-1	0	it's really it's uh and then they have and then they have little ones too i mean 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact506	1026.59	1027.78	B	Professor	s^aa^m	-1	0	uh and then they have the little ones yeah ones too i mean but they don't 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact507	1026.78	1029.79	H	Grad	s	-1	0	uh and then they have the little ones yeah ones too i mean but they don't have or block of wood right 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact508	1029.79	1030.16	H	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	yeah our like what block of wood right 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact509	1030.34	1031.55	B	Professor	s^aa|s^j	-1	0	yeah our like what is unique but the 
Bmr011.D.dialogueact510	1030.81	1031.05	D	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah our like what is unique but the 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact511	1031.55	1033.58	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	is unique but the but 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact512	1034.02	1037.26	B	Professor	s	-1	0	these commercial things out and buy that have four mike's or something and and 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact513	1036.96	1037.41	A	PhD	b	-1	0	four mike's or something and and 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact514	1037.26	1038.73	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and and uh 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact515	1039.97	1040.55	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact516	1042.74	1045.31	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so yeah there's there's there's a range of things that people do um 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact517	1045.28	1045.68	E	PhD	b	-1	0	do um 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact518	1045.82	1050.86	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	do um so if we connect up with somebody who was interested in doing that sort of thing that's that's a good thing to do i 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact519	1050.86	1057.47	B	Professor	s	-1	0	a good thing to do i mean whenever i've described just the people who interested on the the the acoustic side that's invariably the question they asked if like someone 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact520	1057.47	1062.58	B	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	they asked if like someone who's interested in the general by locking what was asked um are you recording video 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact522	1063.62	1063.96	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	on right 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact521	1063.29	1063.89	B	Professor	fh|qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	on right 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact524	1064.25	1064.5	A	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	and and 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact523	1064.07	1068.49	B	Professor	s:qy	-1	0	and and because the people always say we're doing uh uh very microphone so it's 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact525	1068.49	1078.42	B	Professor	s	+1	0	so it's it's a good thing to do but doesn't solve the problem of how do you solve things when this one like we're it's best to mike's and in this imagined 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact526	1079.15	1080.76	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	so maybe it was this month one 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact527	1080.74	1082.45	G	Postdoc	s^cs.%--	-1	0	was this month one thing i mean i don't know i mean i know 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact528	1082.65	1087.79	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	don't know i mean i know that having read i mean i would imagine it would be more expensive to have uh uh a rape microphone but couldn't 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact529	1087.79	1095.23	G	Postdoc	qy^cs^rt	-1	0	microphone but couldn't chew kind of approximate the natural situation by just shutting off uh those channels one year later on i mean it seems 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact530	1095.23	1103.72	G	Postdoc	qy^cs^rt	-1	0	on i mean it seems like it's a microphone stoned affect each other than country just you know record them with an array and then just not use all the data it's it's just a 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact531	1103.33	1108.39	H	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	yeah it's ninety all the data i see it's it's just a lot of infrastructure that for our particular purpose we so we need to set 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact532	1105.64	1105.97	G	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	i see that for 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact534	1106.64	1107.03	A	PhD	b	-1	0	our particular purpose we so we need to set 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact533	1106.15	1106.29	G	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	our particular purpose 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact536	1108.57	1112.52	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah it's ninety nine percent what you're doing is good shutting off most of the my and going 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact535	1108.08	1108.36	G	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	yeah it's ninety 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact537	1113.48	1117.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but if you get some of his they had said the prime interest in that but then and that drives in that direction that's right i mean if someone if someone 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact538	1116.73	1119.56	H	Grad	s	-1	0	then and that drives in that direction that's right i mean if someone if someone came in and said we really want to do it 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact539	1117.52	1117.9	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	direction i mean if someone if someone 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact540	1120.15	1120.92	H	Grad	s	-1	0	and we don't care that 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact541	1120.92	1121.39	H	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	so to save and we don't care that 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact542	1121.68	1126.3	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	so to save that data you you have to have one channel recording per my can you ray by more disk space 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact543	1122.3	1123.16	H	Grad	s	-1	0	that data you you have to have one by more disk space 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact545	1127.21	1129.77	B	Professor	h|s^aap	-1	0	well at some level at some level but then so they usually do a mix 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact544	1127.13	1127.37	E	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	well at some so they usually 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact546	1127.83	1128.83	H	Grad	s	-1	0	well at some level so they usually do a mix 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact547	1129.77	1131.55	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	at some level but then you know there's that there's what you save i mean 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact548	1131.33	1133.75	E	PhD	s^e	-1	0	there's what you save i mean if you're going to do research with it 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact549	1134.71	1135.21	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	there's i i don't 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact550	1135.75	1138.37	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	i i don't know what they're going to do it i don't know how big their rate is obviously if you 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact551	1138.37	1143.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	is obviously if you were going to save all of those channels later research you do use up a lot of space and yeah well there's for 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact552	1142.85	1143.28	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	up a lot of space and yeah well there's for 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact555	1143.52	1143.98	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	and well there's for 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact554	1143.48	1143.67	E	PhD	b	-1	0	and well there's for 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact553	1143.47	1150.51	H	Grad	s	-1	0	and had well there's for infrastructure had a very elaborate designed for plugging in filters and mixers and all sorts of processing 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact556	1151.12	1154.88	H	Grad	s	-1	0	so that they can do stuff in real time and not say that each channel individual 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact557	1154.6	1154.95	B	Professor	b	-1	0	individual 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact559	1155.99	1156.24	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bmr011.B.dialogueact562	1157.46	1162.92	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	but i mean um for optimum flexibility later you're going to save each channel but 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact563	1162.92	1172.65	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	each channel but i think in practical situations you would have some engine of some sort doing some processing to reduces some to equivalent of a single microphone it was very direction

Bmr011.A.dialogueact570	1178.02	1183.64	A	PhD	s	+1	0	seems to me that there's you know they're good political reasons for for doing this just getting 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact571	1183.79	1184.67	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	doing this just getting the data because 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact572	1184.67	1186.73	A	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	the data because there's a number of sites like right 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact573	1186.73	1193.63	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	of sites like right now sri is probably going to invest a lot of internal funding into recording meetings also which is good 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact574	1194.34	1196.77	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	but they'll be recording with video and 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact575	1196.87	1197.42	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	with video and i'll be you 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact576	1197.95	1203.89	A	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	i'll be you it'd be nice if we can have at least uh make use of the data that we're recording as we go some 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact577	1203.89	1208.25	A	PhD	s^df	+1	0	as we go some sort of this is the first site that has really collected these really impromptu meetings um 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact578	1208.81	1211.59	A	PhD	s	+1	0	um and just have this other information available so 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact579	1211.68	1216.65	A	PhD	s^cs.%--	+1	0	available so if we can get the investing and just for the entrance infrastructure and then 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact580	1216.65	1217.14	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	and then i don't 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact581	1217.87	1218.26	A	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	i don't know save it out or 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact582	1218.26	1218.86	A	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	know save it out or 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact583	1218.86	1220.49	A	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	know save it out or have whoever's interested save 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact584	1220.89	1221.98	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	save that data out transfer 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact585	1221.98	1222.82	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	that data out transfer it there 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact586	1223.34	1227.4	A	PhD	s	+1	0	it would be really good to have you mean to to actually get 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact587	1226.63	1229.94	H	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	+1	0	you mean to to actually get a microphone array and

Bmr011.A.dialogueact590	1231.11	1231.99	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	even if we're not video and

Bmr011.A.dialogueact591	1232.45	1233.52	A	PhD	s^no^rt	-1	0	i'm not sure about video that sort of 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact592	1233.52	1236.43	A	PhD	s^df.%--	-1	0	video that sort of a video has a little different nature since right 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact593	1236.87	1239.74	A	PhD	s	-1	0	right right now we're all being recorded but we're not being taped 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact594	1240.33	1246.15	A	PhD	s.%-	+1	0	um but it definitely the case of microphone erases if there's a community interested in this well i think we need a researcher 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact595	1245.6	1249.54	H	Grad	fg|s^cs^ng	-1	0	see the well i think we need a researcher here is interested to push it along 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact596	1249.88	1261.33	B	Professor	s	-1	0	see the problem is it it took uh uh it took at least six months for dan to get together their hardware and the software and the buck stuff and and the microphones and the boxes and it was a really big it along 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact597	1261.33	1262.61	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	and it was a really big deal 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact598	1263.18	1268.04	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and so i think we could get aiding microphone rain here pretty easily and 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact599	1268.52	1272.55	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and uh have it fixed two two one channel of some sort 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact600	1272.12	1272.46	A	PhD	b	-1	0	sort 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact601	1273.32	1274.99	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	but i think for 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact602	1276.45	1278.2	B	Professor	qw.%--	-1	0	i mean how we're going to side 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact603	1280.13	1289.11	B	Professor	s	+1	0	for for maxwell flexibility later you really don't want to end up with just one channel that you pointed in the direction of the the the person with a maximum energy or something like that i mean you you want actually 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact604	1289.11	1295.39	B	Professor	s^cs.%--	+1	0	i mean you you want actually took you i actually they have multiple channels being recorded so that you can 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact605	1296.08	1300.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and to do that if we're going to end up greatly increased the the space that we use up we also 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact606	1300.87	1304.7	B	Professor	s	-1	0	up we also only have boards that will take up to sixteen channels and 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact607	1304.7	1308.37	B	Professor	s	-1	0	channels and this meeting we've got eight people and and six bikes and they're already using 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact608	1308.37	1309.74	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	bikes and they're already using fourteen and 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact609	1309.95	1311.13	H	Grad	s^bc	-1	0	fourteen and we actually only have fifteen one of them 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact611	1311.44	1311.64	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	one of them 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact610	1311.25	1311.95	H	Grad	%--	-1	0	one of them

Bmr011.H.dialogueact613	1313.09	1313.61	H	Grad	s	-1	0	details but fifteen 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact615	1313.67	1314.01	A	PhD	b	-1	0	details but fifteen or sixteen 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact616	1314.07	1314.33	B	Professor	b	-1	0	or sixteen 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact614	1313.61	1314.99	H	Grad	s	-1	0	details but fifteen or sixteen 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact618	1315.75	1319.59	A	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	well if was a way to save time to sort of solve each of these those 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact617	1315.47	1315.82	B	Professor	b	-1	0	well if 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact619	1320.23	1325.91	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so suppose you can get an array and because there's some person at berkeley's interested in some equipment 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact620	1326.34	1333.55	A	PhD	s	-1	0	uh and suppose we can has we say that we can you know transferred off to some other place that that holds this this data who's 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact621	1333.79	1334.51	A	PhD	s	-1	0	data who's interested in even if 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact622	1334.51	1337.08	A	PhD	s	-1	0	interested in even if exceeded itself isn't 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact623	1337.79	1343.75	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	and it it seems like as long as we can time align the beginning do we need to mix it with the rest i don't 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact624	1343.75	1344.35	A	PhD	s^no^rt	-1	0	it with the rest i don't know 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact625	1345.21	1346.2	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	you know so yes i think you'd be a separate separate 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact626	1345.24	1347.6	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	you know so yes i think you'd be a separate separate set up and the 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact627	1346.19	1346.72	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so a separate separate 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact629	1347.76	1348.34	A	PhD	b	-1	0	set up and the assumption that you could time 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact628	1347.6	1349.73	B	Professor	s	-1	0	set up and the assumption that you could time that too 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact631	1350.26	1352.8	A	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	i mean it's just it's worth considering as sort of it certainly gets skew 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact630	1350.2	1351.43	H	Grad	s	-1	0	i mean it's just it's worth considering it certainly gets skew 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact632	1353.53	1361.91	A	PhD	s	-1	0	once you make the up front investment and can sort of save it out each time and and not have to worry about that just states faster than it might it might be worth having that do i'm not 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact633	1361.87	1363.45	B	Professor	s^nd	+1	0	having that do i'm not so much worried about the specific mention that 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact634	1363.45	1365.15	B	Professor	s	-1	0	mention that but as a practical matter but the real issue is 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact635	1363.67	1363.85	H	Grad	%-	-1	0	mention that 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact636	1365.15	1372.07	B	Professor	s	+1	0	but the real issue is that uh there's no way to do a recording extended to what we have now with those q. 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact637	1373.43	1375.96	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so you would have a completely separate set up 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact639	1376.75	1377.0	A	PhD	b	-1	0	which would mean that the sampling times 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact638	1376.4	1380.42	B	Professor	s	-1	0	which would mean that the sampling times and so forth would be all over the place compared to this so 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact640	1380.85	1384.13	B	Professor	s	-1	0	this so the depend on the level of group process and you're doing later if you're it's 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact641	1384.45	1389.12	B	Professor	s	+1	1	if you're it's see kind of person is doing ray processing actually care about funny little times and 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact642	1389.73	1394.45	B	Professor	s^rt	+1	1	and and so you actually what would want to have a completely different set up and we have one that would go up 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact643	1390.42	1390.87	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and so 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact644	1394.45	1396.49	B	Professor	s	+1	0	have one that would go up to thirty two channels or something 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact645	1396.84	1397.27	A	PhD	b	-1	0	or something so basically four hundred thirty 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact646	1397.15	1397.91	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	so basically four hundred thirty 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact647	1397.42	1398.4	H	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	so basically we're you know four hundred thirty two 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact648	1398.49	1398.83	B	Professor	s^aa^m.%--	-1	0	we're you know two 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact649	1398.83	1399.28	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	we're you know it's so two 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact650	1399.28	1401.3	B	Professor	s	+1	0	it's so i'm kind of skeptical but 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact651	1401.75	1403.15	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but um i think that so 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact652	1403.01	1403.26	A	PhD	b	-1	0	so 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact653	1404.01	1406.63	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	i don't think we can share the resource in that way what 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact654	1406.63	1412.31	B	Professor	s	+1	0	that way what we could do is if there's someone else's interested they could have a separate set up with they wouldn't be trying to sync with hours which might 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact655	1412.83	1414.54	B	Professor	s	+1	0	they which might be useful for for them 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact656	1414.16	1417.32	A	PhD	s^bk|s^aap	-1	0	they they they'd have the data in the transcript for them and then they can offer up the room yeah uh 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact657	1415.07	1416.7	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	they they'd have the data in the transcript and then they can offer up the room 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact658	1417.35	1417.6	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah uh 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact660	1417.86	1418.29	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah uh for the meetings and 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact659	1417.48	1420.11	B	Professor	s^aa|s	+1	0	yeah uh for the meetings and the physical space and and uh 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact661	1420.11	1422.37	B	Professor	s	+1	0	right and it's just and and uh yeah the transcripts 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact662	1421.04	1421.26	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah the transcripts 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact663	1422.12	1426.59	A	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	right and it's just to be nice if we have more information on the same 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact664	1426.59	1427.0	A	PhD	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	but 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact666	1427.49	1427.78	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	but 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact665	1427.44	1427.66	B	Professor	b	-1	0	but 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact667	1427.98	1432.05	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but it's it's it's impossible or if it's a lot of efforts and have to just pound it well i think that 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact668	1432.57	1432.91	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	well i think that 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact670	1433.24	1433.35	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	the thing will be 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact669	1432.91	1438.92	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	well i think that the thing will be in in again talking to these other people to see what you know what what we can do 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact671	1439.33	1439.52	A	PhD	b	-1	0	is there an 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact672	1439.43	1439.9	B	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	is there an 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact673	1439.63	1442.44	E	PhD	qy^rt	+1	1	is there an interest in getting video recordings for these meaning 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact674	1443.0	1443.0	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	right so i mean 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact676	1443.77	1444.65	B	Professor	fg|%-	-1	0	right so we have i mean yeah absolutely yes absolutely 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact675	1443.3	1443.51	E	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	right so i mean 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact677	1444.19	1446.83	H	Grad	s^aa|s	+1	1	we have yeah absolutely it's exactly the same problem yes absolutely but it's exactly the same problem 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact678	1447.99	1450.11	H	Grad	s	+1	1	infrastructure probably people do you have an infrastructure probably have problem people 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact679	1450.11	1452.53	H	Grad	s	+1	0	people have problem people not wanting to be videotaping of the problem 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact680	1452.53	1456.98	H	Grad	s	+1	0	of the problem that no one was currently involved in the project is really hot to do it 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact681	1453.14	1453.47	E	PhD	b	-1	0	that no one 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact682	1458.0	1459.73	E	PhD	s^bs.%-	+1	0	right in turn there's not enough interest to overcome 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact683	1459.07	1459.56	H	Grad	b	-1	0	right in turn overcome 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact684	1459.58	1460.45	A	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	right in turn only but i know overcome 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact685	1460.45	1467.24	A	PhD	s	+1	0	only but i know there is interest from other places that are interested in looking at meeting data and having the video so it's just 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact686	1467.39	1467.97	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	so it's just 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact687	1468.34	1474.4	G	Postdoc	fg|s	-1	0	yeah well well i have to mention the human subjects problems that increase with video 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact688	1475.01	1475.91	A	PhD	s^bk|s^na	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact689	1476.18	1479.75	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	yeah so's uh people people getting shy about it there's 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact690	1477.68	1477.93	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	uh people 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact691	1479.75	1481.26	B	Professor	s	+1	0	about it there's there's human subjects problem is the fact 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact692	1481.63	1483.89	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	is the fact that then um if 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact693	1483.98	1485.86	B	Professor	s	-1	0	if i i've heard times about this one 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact694	1485.86	1487.42	B	Professor	s:qw	-1	0	times about this one she just put on a video camera but yeah 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact695	1487.42	1492.9	B	Professor	s	-1	0	camera but yeah it's sort of like saying uh well the primary interested in ins and dialogue things 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact696	1493.47	1496.45	B	Professor	qo^df	-1	0	uh but uh why like just throw microphone out there i mean 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact697	1496.45	1502.48	B	Professor	s	+1	0	out there i mean the thing is once you actually have serious interest in any of these things you actually have to put a lot of effort in 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact698	1502.49	1502.92	E	PhD	b	-1	0	in 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact699	1503.11	1505.56	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and uh you really want to do it right so i think

Bmr011.G.dialogueact754	1555.24	1559.24	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	um i thought about that maybe three aspect of this so first 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact755	1559.24	1562.68	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	of this so first of all um i've got a transcribers 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact756	1563.19	1564.83	G	Postdoc	s^rt	+1	0	uh seven of our linguists 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact757	1565.51	1567.98	G	Postdoc	s^rt	+1	0	one of them is a graduate student in psychology 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact758	1568.4	1571.33	G	Postdoc	s^rt	-1	0	um each i gave each of them at their own data set to them 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact759	1571.66	1573.65	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	to them up already finished the days sets 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact760	1574.17	1578.64	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	how big is data say and the meetings run you know say an hour sometimes is not as much as an hour and a half 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact761	1577.26	1578.18	E	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	how big is data say is not as much as an hour and a half 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact762	1579.07	1580.38	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	uh always uh what i mean is one meeting each each person 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact764	1580.69	1581.37	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	uh meeting each each person got their own meeting i don't 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact763	1580.55	1581.92	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	uh meeting each each person got their own meeting i don't 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact765	1581.92	1586.36	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	got their own meeting i don't have any conflicts of you know one just stop transcribing this one or just 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact766	1586.36	1586.57	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	one or just 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact767	1586.63	1589.27	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	one or just i wanted to keep it clear who's they were who's and and 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact768	1589.27	1590.82	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and and and so 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact769	1590.31	1590.54	E	PhD	b^rt	-1	0	and so 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact770	1591.29	1596.96	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and uh meetings you know i think that they they go as long as a almost two hours in some in some cases so 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact771	1596.95	1598.12	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	in some cases so yeah it means you know if we've 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact772	1598.44	1601.18	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	you know if we've got two already finished and they're working on it 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact773	1601.79	1609.66	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it right now all leave them have different uh uh additional data sets that means potentially as many as ten might be finished by the end of the month 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact775	1610.26	1610.55	E	PhD	s^ba^fe	-1	0	hope so that 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact774	1610.19	1610.69	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	hope so that 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact776	1610.92	1613.13	G	Postdoc	s	+1	1	hope so that the precipitation really helps a huge amount and um 
Bmr011.C.dialogueact777	1612.87	1613.09	C	PhD	b	-1	0	helps a huge amount and um 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact778	1613.47	1622.6	G	Postdoc	s	+1	2	and um also down else's innovation of the um the multi channel to hear really helped a lot terms of the court growing up earrings that involve overlaps 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact779	1623.09	1623.6	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	but um just 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact780	1623.99	1628.82	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	but um just out of curiosity i asked one of them how long it was taking or one of these two is already finished your data said she said 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact781	1628.82	1633.44	G	Postdoc	s	+1	1	your data said she said it takes about uh sixty minutes transcription for every five minutes of real time so it's about 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact782	1633.44	1634.53	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	time so it's about twelve to one which is what we 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact783	1634.53	1635.43	G	Postdoc	s^e	+1	1	twelve to one which is what we were thinking swell in yep 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact784	1635.01	1635.13	H	Grad	%--	-1	0	were thinking swell in yep 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact785	1635.13	1635.38	H	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	were thinking swell in yep 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact786	1635.73	1636.47	G	Postdoc	s	+1	1	were thinking swell in the range yep pretty good 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact787	1635.93	1636.47	H	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	were thinking swell in the range yep pretty good 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact788	1637.24	1643.4	G	Postdoc	s^bk|s	-1	0	um be still when they're finished um that means that they're finished with their pastor they still need to be added and all that but it's 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact789	1643.4	1646.23	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and all that but it's worth levels to change the things that were mentioned okay now 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact790	1646.61	1651.32	G	Postdoc	s^t^tc	+1	0	okay now i want to mention d. m. teleconference i had with uh jonathan just because we spoke 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact791	1651.76	1653.02	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	because we spoke for an hour and a half and 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact793	1653.83	1655.96	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and um had an awful lot of things in common 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact792	1653.42	1653.72	H	Grad	b	-1	0	and 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact794	1656.45	1661.96	G	Postdoc	s.%--	+1	0	he um he indicated to me that they that he spend 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact795	1662.28	1665.3	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	uh looking i uh spending a lot of time with i'm not quite sure 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact796	1665.3	1666.53	G	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	with i'm not quite sure the connection but spend a lot 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact797	1666.59	1668.44	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	the connection but spend a lot of time with the out with system and 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact798	1668.99	1672.55	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	system and i guess that's i mean i i need to read up on that and there's a 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact799	1672.55	1674.41	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	on that and there's a website that has lots of papers but looks to me like 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact800	1674.41	1682.42	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	papers but looks to me like that's the name of that has developed a system that burden lieberman developed for the annotated crafts approach so 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact801	1679.95	1680.29	H	Grad	b	-1	0	developed for the annotated 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact802	1682.61	1684.15	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	so what he wants me to do and what we what we 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact803	1684.15	1690.08	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and what we what we will do in uh is to provide them with the arty transcribe meeting for him to 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact804	1690.53	1694.28	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	for him to be able to experiment with in this atlas system and they do have some sir 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact805	1694.28	1695.53	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and they do have some sir soft raise my impression 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact806	1695.53	1697.43	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	soft raise my impression related to alison that he once 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact807	1697.43	1699.91	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	alison that he once to experiment with taking our data and 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact808	1699.91	1702.38	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	taking our data and putting men in that form and see how that works out i 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact809	1702.74	1711.57	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	out i i i explained to him in in detail be uh conventions that where you thing here in this and this word level transcript 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact810	1711.98	1712.7	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	transcript 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact811	1713.94	1717.87	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know i i explained you know the reasons that that that we were not putting more elaborately and 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact812	1717.87	1720.32	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	more elaborately and and the focus on reliability he expressed 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact813	1720.57	1722.87	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	he expressed a lot of interest in reliability it's 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact814	1722.87	1724.48	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	reliability it's like he's he's really up on these things he's he's very 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact815	1724.48	1725.34	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	on these things he's he's very um 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact816	1725.89	1728.17	G	Postdoc	s:qw	-1	0	um independently as well what about reliability so 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact817	1728.17	1732.07	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so he's interested in the consistency then coding in that sort of thing okay um 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact818	1732.57	1733.37	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	okay um 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact819	1734.77	1735.04	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	so can you explain what the atlas 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact820	1735.04	1736.4	A	PhD	qy^rt.%--	-1	0	you explain what the atlas 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact821	1736.81	1739.47	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	uh i well you know at this point i think 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact822	1737.88	1740.33	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	uh i well you know at this point i think 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact823	1741.15	1744.25	G	Postdoc	s^bd^df	-1	0	well adams read more in more detail than i have on this i need to be quite 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact824	1744.25	1745.86	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	this i need to be quite myself more that but 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact825	1745.86	1748.67	G	Postdoc	fh|s.%--	-1	0	myself more that but um they there's a way of viewing area 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact826	1748.99	1761.65	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	of viewing area whenever you have coding categories um and you're dealing with uh tax on to me then you can have branches that that have alternative uh choices that you could use for each each of them and 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact827	1761.91	1764.36	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	each of them and it just ends up looking like a graph corpus sensation is that let's see 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact828	1761.93	1762.58	H	Grad	qy.%-	-1	0	each of them and it just ends up looking 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact829	1764.34	1768.61	H	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	is that let's see his annotated transcription grass stuff 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact830	1769.39	1770.49	H	Grad	s^no.x	-1	0	i don't remember the acronym the one 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact831	1770.66	1777.22	H	Grad	s.x	+1	0	oh acronym the one the what i think your friend do they they have this concept of that annotated transcription graphic representation and that's basically 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact834	1777.81	1778.76	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh oh i and that's basically what i base 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact833	1777.41	1777.53	G	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	oh and that's basically 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact832	1777.22	1780.28	H	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	oh oh i and that's basically what i base the format that i did i base it on 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact835	1780.54	1784.87	H	Grad	s	-1	0	i base it on their work almost directly in combination with uh t. i. stuff 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact836	1785.38	1786.74	H	Grad	s	-1	0	and so it's very very similar and so 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact837	1786.74	1794.18	H	Grad	s	+1	0	is this the project similar and so it's it's a data representation and a set of tools friend manipulating transcription graphs of various types 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact838	1794.45	1801.36	E	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	is this the project it's sort of uh between uh missed in and uh couple of other places or including l. d. 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact839	1794.9	1795.17	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	is this the project it's sort

Bmr011.G.dialogueact846	1803.22	1804.86	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	okay okay then there's a website i lots the papers i look 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact848	1804.86	1805.46	G	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	i lots the papers i look through them and they mainly 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact849	1805.46	1812.78	G	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	through them and they mainly had to do with this um this uh cheese structure uh annotated tree diagram thing 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact850	1811.94	1812.16	A	PhD	b	-1	0	tree diagram thing 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact851	1813.3	1820.36	G	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	so um um and in terms of like the conventions that i'm at that i've adopted it there there's no conflict at all and he 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact852	1820.09	1820.37	H	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	at all and he 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact853	1820.75	1822.15	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	at all and he was you know was very interested in on how she 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact854	1822.15	1823.1	G	Postdoc	s:qw	-1	0	in on how she i said well you know this 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact855	1823.1	1824.35	G	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	i said well you know this way and and we 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact856	1824.35	1826.19	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	way and and we had a really nice conversation um 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact857	1826.69	1832.01	G	Postdoc	fh|s	+1	0	um okay now i also want to say a different a different direction is rankings very so um 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact858	1832.01	1834.83	G	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	so um i course my briefly with him 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact859	1835.14	1836.74	G	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	i like i he 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact860	1837.01	1838.4	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	still has an account here i told 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact861	1838.4	1844.11	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	here i told him he could at this say on you small to try us and have a look at the already done uh transcription he and he did and what he said 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact862	1844.45	1851.76	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	and what he said was that um what they'll be providing is will not be as fine grange in terms of the time information 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact863	1852.34	1860.54	G	Postdoc	fh|s^cc	-1	0	that the people and um that's uh you know i need to get back to him and i think uh you know explore that a little bit more and see what they'll be giving us specific that i have 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact864	1859.6	1859.81	A	PhD	b	-1	0	that be giving us specific

Bmr011.G.dialogueact899	1908.1	1913.29	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	brian himself downloaded so so um and something c. d. and brian himself downloaded uh 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact900	1913.81	1918.33	G	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	uh because you know i mean we wanted to have it so they weren't familiar terms with what they want to do he 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact901	1918.81	1921.36	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	to do he downloaded from c. d. on to audio tapes apparently he did 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact902	1921.36	1923.9	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	tapes apparently he did it one channel per audio tape so 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact903	1923.9	1927.19	G	Postdoc	s	+1	1	per audio tape so each of these people is transcribing from one channel 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact904	1924.25	1924.45	H	Grad	b.%	-1	0	each of these people 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact906	1928.68	1929.41	E	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	oh and then what he's going to do is check it 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact905	1928.35	1929.97	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	oh and then what he's going to do is check it 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact907	1930.49	1932.92	G	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	and before they go be beyond the first one 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact908	1933.15	1935.26	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so each person gets one of check it and you know adjusted all that 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact909	1934.62	1936.93	E	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	so each person gets one of these channels adjusted all that 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact910	1936.76	1937.0	H	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	so these channels okay 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact912	1937.84	1941.53	B	Professor	s^bu.%--	-1	0	so if they hear something off in the distance they don't they just go okay 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact911	1937.82	1938.35	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so if they hear something off okay 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact914	1942.91	1943.79	G	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	i i don't know but but that's okay because you 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact913	1942.9	1945.94	H	Grad	s^na	-1	0	i i don't know but but that's okay because you know you do all of them and then combine them 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact916	1947.11	1948.64	E	PhD	qy^d	+1	1	but there could be problems right with that i you know

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1026	2128.31	2135.72	A	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	but second of all uh in general because some of these channels i'd say 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1027	2135.78	2140.69	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	channels i'd say like i don't know at least half of them probably on every drug or have are have

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1030	2144.86	2150.44	A	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	it's good to get sort of short segments if you're going to do recognition especially forced 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1031	2150.44	2151.78	A	PhD	s^e	+1	0	especially forced alignment so 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1032	2151.94	2152.25	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	alignment so 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1033	2153.14	2159.14	A	PhD	s	-1	0	uh don husband been taken for stab actually using jeans first the first meeting the chain transcribe which we

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1035	2161.05	2164.09	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and to know uh i think me what it's was it that people were switching 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1036	2164.09	2166.84	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	it that people were switching microphones around in the very beginning so 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1037	2166.92	2167.2	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	very beginning so yes or 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1038	2167.68	2168.64	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	yes or i don't know and then you have enough 
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1039	2167.77	2171.25	C	PhD	s^ar|s^ng	-1	0	yes or i don't know they were not yeah and then you have enough bitching them but they would do about trusting them so just think you know 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1040	2168.64	2168.96	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	i don't know and then you have enough 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1041	2169.48	2169.88	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	they were not bitching them but they 
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1044	2171.33	2171.72	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah them so just think you know 
Bmr011.F.dialogueact1042	2170.84	2171.23	F	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah would do about trusting them so just think you know 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1043	2171.14	2172.09	H	Grad	s^m	-1	0	yeah them so and now stuff i mean just think you know 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1045	2172.01	2172.62	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	and now stuff i mean 
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1046	2172.24	2174.55	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and now stuff i mean it does so it's it's way better 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1048	2175.15	2180.35	A	PhD	fg|s	+1	0	so we have to sort of normalize the front and and so forth and had these small segments so we've taken 
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1047	2175.01	2175.19	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1049	2178.75	2178.91	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and and so forth and 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1050	2180.35	2188.83	A	PhD	s	+1	0	so we've taken that and chopped into pieces based always on your you are um cuts that you made on the mic signal 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1051	2189.62	2192.87	A	PhD	s	+1	0	and so that every every speaker has the same cuss and if 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1052	2192.87	2194.62	A	PhD	s	-1	0	the same cuss and if they have speech and that we run it through and if they don't 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1053	2194.62	2196.27	A	PhD	s	-1	0	run it through and if they don't have speech and we don't run it through we base 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1054	2196.27	2199.84	A	PhD	s	-1	0	it through we base that knowledge on the transcription i'm just on the marks

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1057	2200.53	2203.2	A	PhD	fh|s.%--	+1	0	um the problem is if we have no time mark 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1058	2204.18	2209.86	A	PhD	s	+1	1	then for slang that we actually don't know where you know in the single the transcriber heard that word and 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1059	2209.86	2210.55	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	that word and so oh i see 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1060	2210.65	2211.06	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	so i mean it if oh i see for blank i see 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1062	2211.37	2217.36	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i mean it if it's the whole conversation and we get along uh you know pick paragraph of of talk uh i don't know how for blank i see 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1061	2211.06	2211.77	H	Grad	s^bs	-1	0	i mean it if for blank i see 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1063	2211.77	2212.1	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	i mean it if it's the whole conversation for blank i see 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1064	2217.36	2218.85	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	uh i don't know how they do this 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1065	2219.47	2222.2	A	PhD	fh|s^no	-1	0	um we actually don't know which piece goes where and i understand

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1067	2222.7	2224.47	A	PhD	fh|s.%-	-1	0	and um i think well you need to like a 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1068	2224.12	2226.62	E	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	i think well you need to like a porcelain before you didn't topping thing

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1070	2227.96	2229.58	A	PhD	s^ar|s^ng.%--	-1	0	no we use the fact that so when 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1071	2229.66	2233.09	A	PhD	s	-1	0	fact that so when jane transcribed and the way she has transcribers doing this weather it's with the pre chuck 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1073	2233.2	2235.07	A	PhD	s	-1	0	weather it's with the pre segment taste or not they have a chuck 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1072	2233.02	2233.7	H	Grad	s^2	-1	0	weather it's with the pre chuck 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1074	2235.61	2238.48	A	PhD	s	-1	0	they have a chunk and then they transcribe the words in the checking that maybe 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1075	2238.48	2243.48	A	PhD	s	-1	0	the checking that maybe they choose the chunk are now they use uh pre segment patient incorrect necessary but there's 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1077	2243.48	2245.99	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but there's first chong and then a transcription 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1076	2243.07	2243.22	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	but there's 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1078	2245.99	2247.35	A	PhD	s	-1	0	then a transcription and a chunk of the transcription that's great 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1079	2247.35	2248.13	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	that's great because i recognize 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1080	2248.59	2249.72	A	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	because i recognize or can it's 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1081	2249.96	2252.55	H	Grad	s^2	-1	0	or can right it's all pretty good sized for the recognize are also 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1082	2252.73	2258.59	A	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	right and it it helps that it's made based on sort of curious sticks and human years think the are also 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1083	2253.34	2253.69	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	and it it helps 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1084	2253.84	2254.26	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	and it it helps that it's made based 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1085	2259.01	2261.24	A	PhD	s	+1	1	but there's going to be a real problem uh even 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1086	2261.76	2271.39	A	PhD	s	+1	1	uh even if we chop up based on speech silent these transcripts from i. b. m. we don't actually know where the words were which segment right 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1088	2271.47	2272.59	A	PhD	s^e	+1	1	were which segment they belong to so right

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1089	2272.66	2276.71	A	PhD	s	-1	0	they belong to so that's sort of why not do uh the forced alignment 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1090	2273.96	2277.09	E	PhD	qw	-1	0	that's sort of why not do uh the forced alignment that's what you're saying

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1096	2286.92	2290.55	A	PhD	s	-1	0	chop it up but you need to have a reference of which words went with which

Bmr011.H.dialogueact1100	2295.79	2296.19	H	Grad	s^aap.%-	-1	0	i yeah but 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1101	2297.01	2298.49	B	Professor	s^am	+1	0	i think that they are 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1102	2297.53	2298.42	H	Grad	s^co	-1	0	i think that they are 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1103	2299.36	2299.91	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1104	2301.52	2302.53	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah i'm sure they will and 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1105	2302.74	2305.25	B	Professor	s^co	+1	0	will and so we we have to have a dialogue with them about it sounds like with 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1106	2304.94	2305.33	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	a dialogue with them about it sounds like with 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1107	2305.25	2307.14	B	Professor	s	-1	0	maybe they have some you know maybe actually it sounds like with us and concerns and 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1108	2306.04	2311.86	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	maybe they have some you know maybe actually there is um even if they're not fine grain maybe the transcribers us and concerns and 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1109	2307.14	2307.34	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	you know maybe actually and 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1110	2312.72	2316.62	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	uh i don't maybe it's saved out in pieces or or something that would help but 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1111	2316.1	2316.4	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	that would help but 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1112	2316.68	2316.85	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	that would help but 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1113	2317.44	2318.78	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1114	2318.86	2320.84	G	Postdoc	fg|s^cc	-1	0	yeah i i need to to write him i just 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1115	2320.14	2320.49	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	to write him i just 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1116	2320.84	2323.15	G	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	but the to write him i just you know it's like got overtaxed at the time 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1117	2322.55	2327.75	A	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	but the it is true that the segments i haven't tried the segments the tivo gave you but the overtaxed at the time 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1118	2327.81	2330.52	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	gave you but the segments that in your first meeting are great i mean that's 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1119	2329.63	2329.92	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	first meeting are 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1120	2330.52	2332.59	A	PhD	s^ba^e	-1	0	great i mean that's that's a good good size could 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1121	2332.38	2332.88	G	Postdoc	s^bk^m	-1	0	good size could 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1122	2332.88	2333.08	G	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	right because good size could like 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1123	2333.44	2334.06	A	PhD	fg|%-	-1	0	right because yeah like i was thinking it would be fun 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1124	2333.61	2340.31	G	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	right because yeah like i was thinking it would be fun to to if if you would mind to give us a tree segment patient if you if maybe you have one 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1125	2334.52	2334.82	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah i was thinking it would be fun 
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1126	2338.83	2339.07	C	PhD	b	-1	0	to give us a tree segment patient 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1127	2340.4	2345.16	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	if you if maybe you have one already of that first at the meeting that uh that first transcribe meeting the one that i transcribed 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1128	2345.46	2346.44	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	um the one that i transcribed do you have 
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1130	2346.79	2348.76	C	PhD	h|s	-1	0	um i'm sure i have some but do you have uh could you generate percentage every sixteenth i think 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1129	2346.67	2348.67	G	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	um i'm sure i have some but do you have uh could you generate percentage every sixteenth i think 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1131	2347.69	2349.02	H	Grad	s	-1	0	i'm sure i have some but that that's the one lover uh could you generate percentage every sixteenth i think 
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1132	2348.76	2351.54	C	PhD	s	-1	0	i have some but that that's the one lover i'm truck training on so that percentage sixteenth i think 
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1133	2351.54	2352.44	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	on so that was that 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1134	2352.13	2352.28	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	was that 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1135	2353.44	2353.97	G	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	oh i see oh 
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1137	2354.17	2355.33	C	PhD	s^r.%-	-1	0	so those ought to darn of course of course of course yeah 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1136	2353.97	2354.52	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	so those ought to oh i see oh darn of course 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1138	2354.52	2355.9	G	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	so those ought to darn of course of course of course yeah

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1141	2358.03	2363.2	A	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	actually as you get transcripts um for new meetings um we can try 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1142	2361.47	2361.67	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	um 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1143	2363.54	2368.16	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	that the more data we have to try the the alignments on um the better so i'd be 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1144	2368.16	2373.82	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so i'd be good for just to know as transcription they're coming through the pipeline from the transcribers just 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1145	2373.82	2378.46	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	transcribers just to sort of we're playing around with her uh parameters on the recognize that that 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1146	2377.88	2378.14	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	parameters on the recognize that that 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1147	2378.77	2379.65	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	that that would be a excellent 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1149	2380.19	2381.96	A	PhD	s	-1	0	especially as you get in more voices the good 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1148	2379.78	2380.42	G	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	would be a especially as you get in excellent good 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1150	2381.96	2384.24	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	more voices the first meeting had i think just for think it's yeah yeah

Bmr011.B.dialogueact1162	2400.62	2401.34	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i guess the thing i i can't remember 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1163	2401.34	2406.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	thing i i can't remember if we discuss this meeting but uh i know you and i talked about this a little bit there was an 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1164	2406.68	2408.27	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	there was an issue of um suppose 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1165	2408.65	2410.78	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	um suppose we get in the uh 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1166	2411.07	2416.29	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	i guess it's and people position although it is just saying where the weakling because in the chain uh where 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1167	2416.84	2417.89	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh where we we uh 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1168	2417.89	2419.63	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	we we uh uh 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1169	2420.88	2422.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we have all the data transcribed and have 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1170	2422.86	2424.27	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	and have these transcribers and we're 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1171	2424.67	2426.26	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and we're we're tha we're still 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1172	2426.76	2428.32	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	we're still bit slow on feeding at that point 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1173	2428.76	2429.81	B	Professor	s	-1	0	at that point was caught up and 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1174	2429.93	2434.56	B	Professor	s	-1	0	was caught up and uh the the uh we clink is is recording meeting 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1175	2435.1	2435.45	B	Professor	s^f	-1	0	okay 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1176	2436.1	2436.68	B	Professor	h	-1	0	um 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1177	2437.49	2439.88	B	Professor	qw.%--	-1	0	two questions com is you know what how how do we 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1178	2440.54	2442.85	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it's not really problem moment because we haven't reached that point but 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1179	2442.85	2444.81	B	Professor	qw	+1	0	reached that point but how do we step up the recording meetings 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1180	2445.54	2451.99	B	Professor	qy	+1	2	and the other one is um uh there's some good used to be can make it the transcribers do other things 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1181	2452.82	2456.54	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so um i can't member how much we talked about this in this meeting but that there's and there we had with them 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1183	2456.54	2457.04	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	in this meeting but that there's and there is one use that that we had with them 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1182	2456.07	2457.35	H	Grad	s	-1	0	in this meeting but that there's and there is one use that that we had with them 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1184	2456.72	2461.65	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	in this meeting but that there's and there is one use that that also we discuss which was when um day finishes the we had with them 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1185	2462.06	2463.14	G	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	and maybe it's already finished the d. 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1186	2463.34	2469.0	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	the d. modification too small to trance which will allow fine grain and coating of overlaps um 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1187	2469.42	2475.84	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	um then it would be very these people be very good to shift over to finer grain coating of overlaps just 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1188	2475.84	2477.2	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	of overlaps just matter you know providing so over there right now 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1189	2477.26	2480.33	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	so over there right now you have two overlapping segments at the same time and well with with 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1190	2480.33	2493.9	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	time and well with with the improvement in the database and and the ass or any interface be possible to um and just do a quick drag thing and get thee that they specific place the of each of those of time tag associated with the beginning of of every segment 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1191	2495.14	2496.98	B	Professor	fg|s	+1	0	right so i think we talk retirement three level three things what 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1192	2495.86	2496.38	A	PhD	b	-1	0	right so i think we talk retirement three level three things what 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1194	2496.98	2503.0	B	Professor	s	+1	1	three level three things what one was uh we've had some discussion the past about some very high level labeling those types of overlaps and the types of overlaps 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1193	2496.55	2496.8	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	three level three things what 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1195	2501.64	2502.93	G	Postdoc	s^2.%-	-1	0	labeling those types the types of overlaps 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1196	2503.0	2505.68	B	Professor	s^bk^m	+1	0	of overlaps and so forth that someone could do 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1198	2506.1	2508.08	B	Professor	s	+1	0	second was uh somewhere or level just during these more precise 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1197	2505.8	2505.94	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	could do 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1199	2508.08	2509.94	B	Professor	s	+1	0	just during these more precise timing's 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1200	2510.5	2514.9	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and the third one is is is just completely wild hair brained idea that i have which 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1201	2514.9	2525.33	B	Professor	s	+1	1	idea that i have which is that um if uh if we have time and people are able to do it takes some subset of the data do some very fine grain analysis of the speech for instance 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1202	2525.64	2529.01	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	for instance um marking and some overlapping actually overlapping 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1203	2529.42	2534.51	B	Professor	s	+1	1	actually overlapping fashion uh the value of uh of articulate tori features 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1204	2534.44	2534.63	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1205	2534.99	2537.76	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	yeah that's sort of say okay it's voice from here to here there's 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1206	2537.76	2541.22	B	Professor	s	-1	0	to here there's nasal from here to here and so forth um 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1207	2541.22	2548.42	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um as opposed to doing fanatic uh if anything and the phonetic analysis and uh 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1208	2542.0	2542.0	H	Grad	b.%	-1	0	as opposed to doing 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1209	2548.41	2553.81	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and uh assuming uh articulate tory future values for those those things 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1210	2554.68	2557.5	B	Professor	fh|s^bd^df	-1	0	say it's extremely time consuming 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1211	2557.83	2558.29	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	that would be really valuable 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1212	2558.14	2559.36	E	PhD	s	-1	0	but uh that would be really valuable 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1213	2559.17	2559.95	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but uh 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1214	2560.06	2561.7	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	we could do it on some small subset 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1215	2562.08	2565.35	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you're dealing with constance that would be easier than women you know 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1216	2565.35	2565.75	G	Postdoc	qy^g^rt	-1	0	women you know 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1217	2565.75	2576.13	G	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	women you know would think that that is being able to code that there's a for fricken tips extending from here here would be a lot easier than classifying precisely which val that was i think they'll 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1218	2574.81	2575.26	H	Grad	qw	-1	0	precisely which val that was 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1219	2576.54	2576.89	A	PhD	b	-1	0	i think they'll 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1221	2576.74	2577.17	B	Professor	b	-1	0	i think they'll spells or i think 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1220	2576.73	2578.47	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i think they'll spells or i think harder 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1223	2580.26	2580.88	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	well yeah 
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1222	2580.24	2580.49	C	PhD	b	-1	0	well yeah 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1224	2581.17	2594.28	B	Professor	s^arp^ng	-1	0	but i think also it's just issue that that when you look at the you been you look at switchboard for instance very close up there places where whether it's a constant evolve you still have trouble calling it a particular phone uhhuh 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1225	2587.06	2587.45	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	very close

Bmr011.E.dialogueact1234	2600.62	2602.77	E	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	it's so i you're saying sort of remove the high-level constraint single bottom 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1236	2602.77	2603.55	E	PhD	s^bu^e	-1	0	constraint single bottom up and yep 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1239	2604.17	2605.7	B	Professor	s^aa|s^cs	-1	0	yeah described describe and now i'm just say just pictures 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1238	2603.97	2604.56	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	yeah described up and just say yep just pictures 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1237	2603.72	2604.91	H	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	yeah described up and just say yep just pictures 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1240	2605.15	2605.38	A	PhD	b	-1	0	describe and now i'm 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1241	2605.7	2607.3	B	Professor	s	-1	0	describe and now i'm suggesting a ticket or features maybe there's there's even 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1242	2607.3	2608.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	maybe there's there's even a better way to do it but 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1243	2608.88	2613.26	B	Professor	s	-1	0	a better way to do it but but but that's you know sort of a traditional way of describing these things um 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1244	2613.32	2613.87	E	PhD	b	-1	0	um 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1245	2613.88	2616.33	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um and uh i actually this might 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1247	2616.33	2618.7	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	i actually this might be a neat thing to talk to acoustic features versus psychological 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1246	2616.19	2616.51	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	i actually this might 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1248	2617.69	2620.73	E	PhD	s	-1	0	be a neat thing to talk to sort of may acoustic features versus psychological categories 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1249	2620.26	2620.65	B	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	sort of may categories 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1251	2620.96	2621.48	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	sort of may so categories 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1252	2621.24	2621.33	E	PhD	b	-1	0	so 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1250	2620.92	2621.11	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	sort of may so categories 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1253	2622.16	2623.13	B	Professor	s	-1	0	some sort of categories but but something that 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1254	2623.13	2627.29	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	but but something that allows for overlapping change of these things and then this would give 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1255	2627.29	2637.18	B	Professor	s^ba:s^fe	+1	0	and then this would give some more groundwork for people who were building statistical models allowed for overlapping changes different i mean changes as opposed to just click here now in the state uhhuh 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1256	2637.18	2640.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	this is like jest real here now in the state most of to the each sentence on uhhuh uhhuh 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1257	2637.34	2638.67	E	PhD	b	-1	0	here now in the state most of to the uhhuh uhhuh 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1258	2639.49	2642.01	A	PhD	s^bu.%--	-1	0	this is like jest real each sentence on yeah something like that they actually 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1259	2641.32	2642.26	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	yeah something like that they actually 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1260	2642.01	2642.16	A	PhD	b	-1	0	that they actually 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1262	2642.74	2642.88	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	that they actually 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1261	2642.26	2648.56	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	that they actually if we get into that might be good to uh uh hall john holland to this and ask 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1265	2648.92	2649.27	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	to this and ask his his views on 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1263	2648.56	2650.74	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	but is is to this and ask his his views on it 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1264	2648.71	2648.88	H	Grad	b	-1	0	to this and ask 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1266	2650.42	2653.55	A	PhD	qy^rt.%--	-1	0	but is is a go there to have this on meeting it like so it 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1267	2650.48	2650.91	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	but is is it 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1268	2653.55	2653.76	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	it like so 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1269	2653.99	2656.62	A	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	it like so that you can do far afield studies of those gestures or 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1270	2656.67	2658.25	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	gestures or 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1271	2659.31	2663.44	A	PhD	qrr^rt	-1	0	or is it because you think is a different kind of actual production in meetings that people no i think i think 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1273	2663.44	2663.65	A	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	no i think i think 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1272	2663.31	2670.76	B	Professor	s	+1	0	no i think i think it's for for for that purpose i'm just doing meetings as being uh neat way to get people talking naturally 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1274	2671.25	2674.06	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and then you have it then and then it's natural in all senses in the sense that you have microphones just the source of data 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1275	2671.48	2672.36	E	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	and then you have it then and then it's natural just the source of data 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1276	2672.94	2673.37	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and then it's natural in all senses data 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1277	2674.06	2677.58	B	Professor	s	+1	0	in the sense that you have microphones that are distance that you know mine might have and 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1278	2677.58	2679.54	B	Professor	s	+1	0	might have and give the coast mike's and 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1279	2679.87	2681.57	B	Professor	s	+1	0	mike's and you have people talking naturally and the overlaps 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1280	2681.57	2684.51	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and the overlaps just indicative of the fact that people are talking naturally right so 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1281	2682.77	2683.14	A	PhD	b	-1	0	just indicative of the fact that people are talking 
Bmr011.D.dialogueact1282	2683.73	2683.98	D	PhD	b	-1	0	the fact that people are talking 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1285	2684.98	2685.42	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	naturally right so so i think 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1283	2684.51	2684.77	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	naturally right so 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1284	2684.77	2688.31	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	naturally right so so i think that given that it's that kind of corpus if it's going to be a 
Bmr011.D.dialogueact1286	2685.6	2685.88	D	PhD	b	-1	0	so i think 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1287	2688.3	2690.19	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	if it's going to be a very useful corpus um 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1288	2690.89	2697.14	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	um if you say okay we've limited use by some of our uh uh censored choices you don't have 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1289	2697.59	2699.37	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you don't have video we'd and so forth but 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1290	2699.97	2705.32	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but there's a lot of use that we could think of it by expanding the imitation choices 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1291	2705.31	2705.64	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1292	2706.16	2709.67	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and um most of the things we talked about it in fairly high level and 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1293	2709.67	2714.0	B	Professor	s	-1	0	@reject@ high level and and bomb a person maybe we there's some of the others yeah it's a nice balance that would be really nice to offer 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1294	2712.19	2712.57	H	Grad	b	-1	0	@reject@ we it's a nice 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1296	2712.86	2714.57	A	PhD	fg|s^ba	-1	0	@reject@ we there's some of the others yeah it's a nice balance that would be really nice to offer 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1295	2712.72	2713.66	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	@reject@ we there's some of the others yeah it's a nice balance that 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1298	2714.0	2714.18	B	Professor	b	-1	0	would be really nice to offer 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1297	2713.96	2717.03	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	there's some of the others yeah hopefully someone to make balance that would be really nice to offer those things that wide range 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1299	2716.12	2716.48	A	PhD	b	-1	0	wide range 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1300	2716.84	2716.95	B	Professor	b	-1	0	wide range 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1301	2716.95	2718.55	B	Professor	s	-1	0	hopefully someone to make use of it i mean wide range 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1302	2717.23	2717.8	G	Postdoc	s^ba^r	-1	0	hopefully someone to make 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1303	2718.55	2719.73	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	use of it i mean people didn't 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1304	2719.25	2719.55	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	people didn't 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1305	2720.19	2722.61	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean people made a lot of use of of ten minutes and uh 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1306	2722.61	2724.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	ten minutes and uh dude it's markings and then 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1307	2724.43	2726.58	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then this which for transcription thing i think 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1308	2726.58	2729.1	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	thing i think it's been very useful for a lot of people so 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1309	2728.43	2728.62	H	Grad	b	-1	0	for a lot of people 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1310	2729.01	2729.41	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	so 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1311	2729.1	2729.37	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1312	2730.93	2738.4	A	PhD	s^rt^tc	+1	1	i guess i wanted to um make a pitch for trying to collect more meetings um 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1313	2731.35	2731.51	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	guess i wanted to 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1314	2738.64	2739.08	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1315	2738.93	2739.12	B	Professor	b	-1	0	um 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1316	2740.11	2741.91	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i actually i talked to chuck filmar and 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1317	2741.91	2745.45	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	chuck filmar and i think they've what vehemently said no before but this 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1318	2745.45	2750.39	A	PhD	s:s^co	-1	0	but this time he wasn't vehement and he said you know well liz come to a meeting trial and try to convince

Bmr011.H.dialogueact1354	2796.28	2798.64	H	Grad	s^df	-1	0	know so the problem is so much other stuff is confidential it would be 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1355	2797.25	2797.53	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so much other stuff is confidential 
Bmr011.D.dialogueact1358	2799.19	2799.7	D	PhD	b	-1	0	very hard for them

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1399	2857.42	2866.55	A	PhD	s	+1	2	um the other thing is that there's a number of things at the transcription side that um transcribers can do like dialogue act tagging fluency not that hard 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1400	2858.37	2858.91	H	Grad	s^ba^na	-1	0	is that there's not that hard 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1401	2866.61	2868.07	A	PhD	s	+1	1	fluency tagging um 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1402	2868.13	2874.3	A	PhD	s	+1	0	um things that are in the speech that are actually something where you work and for language modeling in mars also

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1404	2875.84	2876.75	A	PhD	s	-1	0	interested in andreas as well so if you 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1405	2876.75	2885.12	A	PhD	s	-1	0	as well so if you want to process of utter renting the first thing they say is well in that well as could it has some kind of interrupt 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1406	2885.33	2887.29	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and things like that um 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1407	2887.37	2887.78	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1409	2888.43	2888.68	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	course some of that can be like 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1408	2888.14	2889.87	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	course some of that can be like down mexico like 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1411	2890.51	2891.59	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	a lot of it can be done and also they are doing just fluency 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1410	2890.09	2893.63	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	a lot of it can be done great so and also they are doing just fluency taking to some degree 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1412	2893.38	2895.34	A	PhD	s^ba|s.%--	-1	0	great so a lot of that's kind of i think 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1413	2894.03	2894.27	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	a lot of that's kind 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1414	2895.83	2897.35	A	PhD	s	-1	0	of i think there's a second pass and i don't really know 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1415	2897.35	2898.88	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and i don't really know what would existed but 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1416	2898.88	2904.85	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	what would existed but there's definitely a second password doing too maybe in code some kinds of you know is it a question or not 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1417	2900.38	2900.69	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	doing

Bmr011.B.dialogueact1736	3331.76	3334.27	B	Professor	qrr	-1	0	it doesn't room acoustics or is it just is given that it's close it's not a problem 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1738	3334.84	3338.12	A	PhD	s	-1	0	it doesn't seem like big room because it's problems to my ear but i'm not an expert okay 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1737	3334.68	3335.24	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	it doesn't seem like 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1739	3338.12	3339.15	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	but i'm not an expert it seems like a problem okay so it's 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1741	3339.15	3341.25	A	PhD	s	-1	0	it seems like a problem with cross talk so it's yeah i bet 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1740	3338.91	3339.92	B	Professor	s^bk|%-	-1	0	but i'm not an expert it seems like a problem okay so it's 
Bmr011.C.dialogueact1743	3341.58	3342.09	C	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah i bet with the lapel mike there's 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1742	3341.53	3344.34	H	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	that that yeah i bet with the lapel mike there's plenty of room acoustic but 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1745	3344.67	3345.81	A	PhD	s^na	-1	0	that that may be true but i but i think the rest 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1744	3344.45	3346.76	H	Grad	fh|s^aap	-1	0	that that may be true but i don't know how good but i think the rest is cross talk 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1746	3345.85	3349.83	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	may be true but i don't know how good it can get there by those i think the rest is cross talk yeah 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1747	3347.71	3347.88	H	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	it can get there yeah 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1748	3349.89	3350.25	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	so i 
Bmr011.B.dialogueact1750	3350.86	3351.35	B	Professor	b	-1	0	so i i think it's just 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1749	3350.85	3351.65	H	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so i i think it's just 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1751	3351.56	3352.09	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	i think it's just yeah what you 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1752	3352.48	3353.89	H	Grad	s^na	-1	0	oh i meant it's yeah what you said cross talk 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1753	3353.4	3362.94	A	PhD	s^bs	+1	0	oh i meant it's just that as sort of as this pipeline of research and going on were also experimenting with different yes our techniques and said cross talk 
Bmr011.H.dialogueact1754	3361.72	3362.09	H	Grad	b.%	-1	0	our techniques and 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1755	3362.94	3365.19	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	techniques and so would be good to know about it so the problem is 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1756	3365.38	3373.05	E	PhD	qy^bu^rt	+1	1	it right right although if they're not talking so the problem is like uh on a microphone with somebody who's not talking they're taking up signals from other people and that's causing problems 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1757	3371.99	3378.14	A	PhD	s^aa|s	+1	0	right right although if they're not talking using the inhouse transcription we're sort of okay because and that's causing problems 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1758	3378.14	3380.69	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because no one transcribed any words there and we throw 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1759	3380.69	3381.71	A	PhD	s	-1	0	words there and we throw it out uhhuh 
Bmr011.E.dialogueact1760	3381.76	3382.33	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	it out but if they're talking uhhuh 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1761	3382.33	3384.95	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but if they're talking at all and they're not talking the whole time 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1762	3385.09	3387.65	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	so you get some speech and then not month more speech so that whole 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1763	3387.7	3389.07	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	more speech so that whole thing is one chalk and 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1764	3389.84	3394.0	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and the person the middle to said only a little bit is picking up the speech around it that's where

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1801	3501.55	3501.69	A	PhD	b	-1	0	talking to which is that 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1800	3501.5	3504.21	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	talking to which is that sounded to me was the so you and then maybe

Bmr011.G.dialogueact1803	3506.28	3512.52	G	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	but it sounds to me is so part of the analysis you're doing involves taking segments which are of a particular type and putting them together and 
Bmr011.D.dialogueact1805	3513.33	3513.5	D	PhD	b	-1	0	so if you have 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1804	3512.99	3519.11	G	Postdoc	s^bu^e	-1	0	together and so if you have like a it's you know speech from one speaker then you cut out the part that's not that speaker new combined 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1806	3516.82	3517.21	A	PhD	b	-1	0	speaker then you cut out the part 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1807	3519.11	3524.19	G	Postdoc	s^bu^e	-1	0	new combined segments from that same speaker to running through the recognizes that 
Bmr011.G.dialogueact1808	3524.19	3525.98	G	Postdoc	qy^bu^g^rt	-1	0	well we tried that 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1809	3525.36	3531.65	A	PhD	s	+1	0	well we tried to find as close of starting in time it would as a can't to the speech from an individual speaker because

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1813	3538.28	3541.72	A	PhD	s	+1	0	because from the time boundaries then the plan is to compute because i like feature

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1815	3542.54	3549.08	A	PhD	s	+1	0	and the sort of more space you have that isn't the thing you're trying to align the more errors we have um 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1817	3549.65	3558.76	A	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	um so that that it would help to have either preprocessing of a single that creates very good signal noise ratio which i

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1821	3561.77	3570.32	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um or to have very to have closer time you know think times basically around the speech that gets transcribed

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1823	3572.78	3576.58	A	PhD	s	-1	0	just sort of open world right now i've exploring so i just wanted 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1824	3576.58	3581.39	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	so i just wanted to see you know on the transcribing and from here and things look good um 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1825	3581.94	3584.69	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	good um the idea and one is more it's an open question right now 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1826	3585.05	3589.39	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and then the issue of like global processing of some signal and then 
Bmr011.A.dialogueact1827	3589.39	3594.27	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and then you know before we chop it up is is yet another way we can improve things what about increasing the flexibility

Bmr011.A.dialogueact1835	3605.3	3607.3	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	the problem is just that the acoustic when the signal
