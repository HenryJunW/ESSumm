The ICSI Meeting Recorder Group of Berkeley met for the first time in two weeks.
Group members reported their progress in the areas of spectral subtraction , Wiener filtering and noise estimation.
They also discusses topics relating to the rules and preferences of the project they are working on , including single vs multiple passes.
A number of the group also took time to explain the basics of their approaches to the group.
