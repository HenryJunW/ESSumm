The main topics discussed were the results of digit recognition and the forced alignment task.
Realisations as to the former included the surprisingly good results from the lapel microphones and the fact that the widely-used HTK-based systems performed worse than SRI , which , however , is specifically trained on digits.
For the results to be more closely comparable , it was suggested that the TI digit corpus is used on the same system , although the two corpora differ in recording conditions and amount of data per speaker.
Other methods to improve recognition results are comparing the signals of close and far-field microphones , or using the Switchboard model for channel adaptation before speaker adaptation is carried out.
On the other hand , there have been improvements on forced alignments , although some issues still need debugging.
Hand-marked word-level alignment data would be very useful for the fine-tuning of more parameters.
Finally , a paper on overlap identification is being prepared for Eurospeech.
This work can potentially be used for the planned research on prosodic features.
Another two papers ( on segmentation and on the Aurora system ) are also being submitted by ICSI staff.
