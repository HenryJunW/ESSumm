The possibility of incorporating language generation into the system will have to be discussed further.
Similarly , as no one could recall some of the points of the conference call , the group will have to meet again and define the exact structure and content of the paper they are going to submit.
The Bayes-net is going to be the focus of the presentation.
In order to complete a functioning prototype of the belief-net , it was decided to start expanding the Ontology and Discourse nodes by working with a simple construction , like "where is X?".
A robust analysis of such a basic utterance will indicate what the limits of the information derived from the construction are , as well as ways to design the whole module and fit other constructions in.
