Bro021.C.dialogueact54	109.138	115.958	C	PhD	s	+1	2	well i've been working on um mainly um online on my mission this week 
Bro021.C.dialogueact55	116.881	122.351	C	PhD	fh|s	+1	2	uh i'm trying different place it's actually different approaches 
Bro021.C.dialogueact56	123.988	130.218	C	PhD	fh|s^e^rt	-1	0	um the first thing is train tool they leonid big to begin with and um i'm constant 
Bro021.C.dialogueact57	132.076	138.636	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	the second thing is uh strain is uh oh and i know my addition we who different means one 
Bro021.C.dialogueact58	138.926	141.136	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	means one mean for the sinus and one from speech 
Bro021.C.dialogueact59	141.976	142.936	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.C.dialogueact60	143.965	149.925	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and so i strieker sums which are controlled by made um brother b. of those like taking a key factor 
Bro021.C.dialogueact61	151.563	152.113	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.C.dialogueact62	153.194	155.924	C	PhD	s	+1	1	this actually nuns doesn't seem to out 
Bro021.C.dialogueact63	156.861	157.861	C	PhD	s	+1	1	oh three doesn't hurt so 
Bro021.C.dialogueact64	157.861	158.111	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	three doesn't hurt so about what 
Bro021.C.dialogueact65	158.681	163.841	C	PhD	s	+1	1	about what both and i my nomination approach seems croissants 
Bro021.C.dialogueact67	164.882	165.132	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	or the means pretty different 
Bro021.F.dialogueact66	164.68	167.23	F	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	or the means pretty different for the two 
Bro021.C.dialogueact68	168.085	168.355	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah they 
Bro021.C.dialogueact69	168.525	170.105	C	PhD	s^na	-1	0	yeah they can be very different 
Bro021.C.dialogueact70	170.105	170.855	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.F.dialogueact71	170.15	170.43	F	PhD	qy^bh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.B.dialogueact72	171.64	174.32	B	Professor	qy^rt	+1	1	so do maybe make errors in different places different 
Bro021.B.dialogueact73	174.78	175.92	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	different kinds of or i 
Bro021.C.dialogueact74	175.85	178.28	C	PhD	s^df	+1	1	kinds of or i didn't look the uh more closely 
Bro021.C.dialogueact75	178.55	180.7	C	PhD	s^na	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.C.dialogueact76	181.17	181.28	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.C.dialogueact77	184.643	185.323	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.C.dialogueact78	186.307	194.837	C	PhD	s	-1	0	you have there is one thing that has become observe is that the mean i'm on the front for so she when she won unforgiven are christians 
Bro021.C.dialogueact79	195.844	196.854	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.C.dialogueact80	198.753	199.043	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.C.dialogueact81	200.939	202.689	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah i see one is 
Bro021.C.dialogueact82	203.519	214.65	C	PhD	s	-1	0	a strange strange thing happening but see one is that when you a different kind of nice i mean from uh sinus portions different 
Bro021.C.dialogueact84	216.269	216.999	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.F.dialogueact83	215.974	216.504	F	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.C.dialogueact85	218.523	221.463	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so when you look at the trajectory if she wanted as strange shape in 
Bro021.C.dialogueact86	221.463	221.753	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	shape in 
Bro021.C.dialogueact87	222.43	225.32	C	PhD	s	-1	0	i was expecting that that that just to mean abs especially 
Bro021.C.dialogueact88	225.65	229.751	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	especially because of the strange so you see one shape 
Bro021.C.dialogueact89	230.809	238.022	C	PhD	fh|s^e	-1	0	uh which can like you you can have the trajectory for speech and them when 
Bro021.C.dialogueact90	238.022	240.942	C	PhD	s^e^rt	-1	0	and them when you are in the sinus he'd go somewhere 
Bro021.C.dialogueact91	241.532	243.542	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	but he's been nice confronted go somewhere and 
Bro021.F.dialogueact92	244.336	244.756	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so 
Bro021.C.dialogueact93	244.98	252.706	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so which would mean that to be he made i mean based on old no even though we have from dropping but to something that drop everything 
Bro021.C.dialogueact94	252.706	257.725	C	PhD	s	-1	0	drop everything um the scan that's the summation of the mean a speech 
Bro021.C.dialogueact95	257.725	257.975	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	a speech 
Bro021.C.dialogueact96	258.594	261.054	C	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	but i see that we need to see it sort of like um 
Bro021.C.dialogueact97	261.758	275.523	C	PhD	fh|s^rt	-1	0	um but the third thing is um yeah instead of having a fixed time customs i try to have the time constant that's more at the beginning of deterrence is 
Bro021.C.dialogueact98	276.093	279.813	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	that the more quickly tutor something that's goes to direct mean 
Bro021.C.dialogueact99	280.393	281.973	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.C.dialogueact100	283.783	283.933	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah and 
Bro021.C.dialogueact101	284.033	286.733	C	PhD	s	-1	0	then it's time constants increases and 
Bro021.C.dialogueact102	286.813	288.663	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and i patricia old it 
Bro021.B.dialogueact103	287.601	287.881	B	Professor	b	-1	0	i patricia 
Bro021.C.dialogueact104	289.895	306.855	C	PhD	s	-1	0	but if it's i uh that's that's for show they keep it to the special just to uh at is it around his uh long enough to continue to happen after like one sitcom 
Bro021.B.dialogueact105	298.539	299.029	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.B.dialogueact107	307.074	307.334	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.C.dialogueact106	306.855	306.885	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	like one sitcom 
Bro021.C.dialogueact108	308.103	308.863	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.C.dialogueact109	309.992	311.942	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	uh well it doesn't happen either 
Bro021.C.dialogueact110	312.842	314.102	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	but did it doesn't hurt so 
Bro021.C.dialogueact111	314.282	315.022	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	so seems pretty 
Bro021.C.dialogueact112	315.755	316.575	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	seems pretty isn't 
Bro021.F.dialogueact113	316.929	318.959	F	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	isn't there some experiment you were going to try where 
Bro021.F.dialogueact114	318.959	330.149	F	PhD	s^e.%--	-1	0	you were going to try where you did something differently for each um uh i don't know whether it was each male band or each uh um that fifty been or something or something you were going to 
Bro021.F.dialogueact115	330.149	334.58	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	or something you were going to some primary we're going to vary depending on the frequency 
Bro021.F.dialogueact116	335.858	336.888	F	PhD	s^no.%--	-1	0	i don't know if that was 
Bro021.C.dialogueact117	337.746	338.736	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i guess to us 
Bro021.C.dialogueact118	339.754	340.174	C	PhD	s^no	-1	0	i don't know know maybe

Bro021.C.dialogueact120	340.414	350.714	C	PhD	s	-1	0	know know maybe it's the idea of having different online on my addition tuning slowed today from m. s. u. for each uh

Bro021.B.dialogueact147	415.168	421.518	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	i really would like to suggest looking um a little bit at the kinds of errors and they can get 
Bro021.B.dialogueact148	421.518	425.921	B	Professor	s^df	+1	1	errors and they can get lost in that and go forever and not too too much but sometimes but

Bro021.C.dialogueact174	480.974	482.514	C	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	as the first experiment i think it yeah 
Bro021.C.dialogueact175	482.784	482.944	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	i think it yeah 
Bro021.C.dialogueact176	483.514	489.904	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	well what i did is to take two majored uh ever age 
Bro021.C.dialogueact177	490.953	494.173	C	PhD	s^bsc^rt	+1	1	no the maximum energy us each times and then 
Bro021.C.dialogueact178	494.243	495.983	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and then the threshold

Bro021.C.dialogueact180	499.725	502.915	C	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	then but a threshold that's fifteen b. b. b. no

Bro021.B.dialogueact187	511.938	512.328	B	Professor	b	-1	0	now he's i was 
Bro021.C.dialogueact188	512.567	516.237	C	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	i was adding the white noise 
Bro021.C.dialogueact189	517.172	520.562	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	uh that's fifteen b. b. b. you no next nominee just restaurants

Bro021.C.dialogueact191	522.703	522.843	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah when 
Bro021.C.dialogueact192	522.993	528.863	C	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	yeah when we look at that um and they see trees out from this there are that's more smoother 
Bro021.C.dialogueact193	529.881	531.091	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.C.dialogueact194	532.948	536.348	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	when we compare like china zero in china want it runs 
Bro021.C.dialogueact195	537.513	540.873	C	PhD	fh|s^e	-1	0	um so keen and uh the same idea trance 
Bro021.C.dialogueact196	541.283	544.593	C	PhD	s	-1	0	but there's almost no difference between the construct efficient of the two 
Bro021.F.dialogueact197	545.146	545.596	F	PhD	qy^bh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.C.dialogueact198	546.555	547.515	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.C.dialogueact199	548.305	548.695	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and yeah and 
Bro021.C.dialogueact200	548.915	553.915	C	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	and yeah and the reason that we haven't with speech recognition attorney it's not it's not the worse 
Bro021.C.dialogueact201	554.345	555.335	C	PhD	s^df	+1	1	it's not better neither 
Bro021.C.dialogueact203	556.15	559.11	C	PhD	s	-1	0	but it's uh kind of surprising that it's not worth because 
Bro021.F.dialogueact202	555.66	555.92	F	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.C.dialogueact204	559.11	565.889	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because if you got noise it's fifteen d. b. just fifteen b. b. b. oh the maximum energy and 
Bro021.A.dialogueact205	560.036	560.266	A	Grad	s^fa^t3	-1	0	if you got 
Bro021.C.dialogueact206	565.999	566.279	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	energy and so what does 
Bro021.C.dialogueact208	567.001	567.561	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	that smooth 
Bro021.F.dialogueact207	566.53	568.57	F	PhD	qw	-1	0	so what does that smooth things out i don't i 
Bro021.F.dialogueact209	568.57	569.89	F	PhD	s^no	-1	0	oh this things out i don't i don't understand that 
Bro021.B.dialogueact210	569.777	571.577	B	Professor	s|qy^d^g	-1	0	oh this was different right because it's it's i think its lightening don't understand that 
Bro021.C.dialogueact211	570.044	574.887	C	PhD	s	-1	0	was different right because it's it's i think its lightening this is the portion that's almost silent 
Bro021.B.dialogueact212	571.577	572.017	B	Professor	s^df.%-	-1	0	right because it's its lightening this 
Bro021.C.dialogueact213	575.197	580.447	C	PhD	s	-1	0	as you better uh white noise that they're as a very high energy it twice and everything and huh okay 
Bro021.F.dialogueact214	578.819	579.969	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	energy it twice and everything huh okay 
Bro021.C.dialogueact215	580.447	580.897	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	and 
Bro021.C.dialogueact216	582.838	589.743	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and uh i energy portion of the speech don't get as much affected anyway like you i don't know i him as 
Bro021.C.dialogueact217	589.743	593.963	C	PhD	s	-1	0	you i don't know i him as a nice you his name is the ship it's also the same 
Bro021.F.dialogueact218	593.922	594.352	F	PhD	qy^bh	-1	0	also the same 
Bro021.B.dialogueact219	594.482	594.742	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.C.dialogueact220	595.45	597.65	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so that's the trajectory are very very similar 
Bro021.C.dialogueact221	597.84	598.21	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	so i mean again similar 
Bro021.B.dialogueact222	598.46	604.98	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so i mean again if you trained in one kind of noise untested in the same kind of noisy you know given day you don't do badly 
Bro021.B.dialogueact223	605.475	610.865	B	Professor	s	-1	0	recently that that we have the problems we have is because it's different in training test even 
Bro021.B.dialogueact224	610.865	616.006	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	test even if the general kind is the same exact instances are different and and 
Bro021.B.dialogueact226	616.006	616.676	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and 
Bro021.F.dialogueact225	615.954	616.624	F	PhD	b	-1	0	are different and and 
Bro021.B.dialogueact227	617.125	623.365	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	so when you white and it's and it's like you the the only noise to to first order the only noise that you have is white noise and you've added the same 
Bro021.B.dialogueact228	623.425	625.195	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and you've added the same thing the training a test so it's 
Bro021.F.dialogueact229	623.555	623.965	F	PhD	b	-1	0	and you've added the same 
Bro021.B.dialogueact230	625.315	625.845	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so it's 
Bro021.F.dialogueact231	625.63	626.23	F	PhD	qy^bh	-1	0	so it's 
Bro021.B.dialogueact232	626.737	627.177	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro021.F.dialogueact233	627.91	632.8	F	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	so would that be similar to like doing the smooth and then overtime or 
Bro021.F.dialogueact234	632.8	632.97	F	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	overtime or 
Bro021.C.dialogueact235	633.7	633.99	C	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.B.dialogueact236	634.823	636.053	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	well it's a kind of smoothing but i think that these different it's 
Bro021.C.dialogueact237	635.012	636.962	C	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	a kind of smoothing but think that these different it's 
Bro021.B.dialogueact238	636.053	636.223	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	but that these different it's 
Bro021.C.dialogueact239	636.962	643.213	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	but that these different it's it's something that yeah that aspect is more this the signs portions goes 
Bro021.C.dialogueact240	643.213	643.653	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	goes 
Bro021.F.dialogueact241	643.299	643.809	F	PhD	b	-1	0	goes 
Bro021.C.dialogueact242	645.55	654.24	C	PhD	s	-1	0	but anyway just the portion of speech that that as i energy on ups about effected by the nice and are identity she compare 
Bro021.B.dialogueact243	649.346	649.766	B	Professor	b	-1	0	on ups 
Bro021.C.dialogueact244	654.24	663.874	C	PhD	s	-1	0	she compare the at ten speech that car during speech partial mm it's that uh i mean she's young and very different 
Bro021.C.dialogueact245	664.441	667.451	C	PhD	s	-1	0	they're very different when energy so we're like 
Bro021.C.dialogueact246	667.901	671.161	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	we're like you're in cricket days are during speech posters 
Bro021.C.dialogueact247	671.971	672.441	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.B.dialogueact249	674.207	676.567	B	Professor	s^bk|s	-1	0	yeah but you're still getting more recognition errors which means 
Bro021.C.dialogueact248	674.204	674.504	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah but you're still getting 
Bro021.B.dialogueact250	676.567	683.226	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	errors which means that the differences even though they look like they're not so big are are are hurting your recognition right yes they do 
Bro021.C.dialogueact251	681.721	682.051	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	are are are hurting your recognition 
Bro021.B.dialogueact252	683.226	683.636	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right yes they do 
Bro021.C.dialogueact253	683.34	685.66	C	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	right yes they do storms speech right 
Bro021.C.dialogueact254	685.66	686.02	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	speech right um 
Bro021.B.dialogueact256	686.297	686.577	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	um 
Bro021.C.dialogueact255	686.11	686.7	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro021.F.dialogueact257	687.036	688.046	F	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	no he didn't the performance went down 
Bro021.C.dialogueact258	688.52	688.78	C	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	no he didn't 
Bro021.C.dialogueact259	688.78	689.33	C	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	no he didn't but oh 
Bro021.C.dialogueact261	689.33	689.53	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	but oh 
Bro021.F.dialogueact260	689.275	689.465	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	but oh 
Bro021.C.dialogueact262	691.519	691.679	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah so 
Bro021.C.dialogueact263	692.039	700.236	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	but in this case i i really expect that maybe that that too would use to streaming features they are very different and then 
Bro021.C.dialogueact264	700.236	705.562	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	well the other thing and then maybe we could gain something by combining damn 
Bro021.B.dialogueact265	705.476	708.616	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well the other thing is that you just picked one particular way of doing it uh i mean 
Bro021.C.dialogueact266	705.562	705.682	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	well the other thing 
Bro021.B.dialogueact267	708.616	712.959	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	doing it uh i mean first places fifteen d. b. uh down across the other ends and 
Bro021.B.dialogueact268	712.959	716.402	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	the other ends and maybe you don't have something that was a little more adaptive secondly you 
Bro021.B.dialogueact269	716.402	718.622	B	Professor	s	-1	0	secondly you happen fifteen you'd be and 
Bro021.C.dialogueact270	717.006	717.746	C	PhD	b	-1	0	happen fifteen 
Bro021.B.dialogueact271	718.622	720.406	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	you'd be and maybe twenty better or or twelve 
Bro021.C.dialogueact272	719.289	719.419	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	maybe twenty 
Bro021.B.dialogueact273	720.406	721.226	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	better or or twelve so 
Bro021.C.dialogueact274	721.61	722.62	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	so what was the what was the 
Bro021.F.dialogueact275	722.03	724.03	F	PhD	qw	-1	0	what was the what was the threshold part of it was the threshold uh 
Bro021.F.dialogueact276	724.03	725.83	F	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	yeah the threshold uh how far down 
Bro021.B.dialogueact277	726.029	726.339	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	well he ate 
Bro021.B.dialogueact278	726.549	728.299	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	well he ate yet figure how much to add so 
Bro021.B.dialogueact279	728.991	731.921	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so he was looking he was looking at the peak

Bro021.C.dialogueact337	878.653	881.803	C	PhD	s	+1	1	the number of fantasy see that you where you was a different views

Bro021.C.dialogueact339	882.803	884.293	C	PhD	s^e	+1	1	thirteen and we used sixteen 
Bro021.C.dialogueact340	885.847	887.427	C	PhD	s	-1	0	well a bunch of different things 
Bro021.C.dialogueact341	888.007	895.776	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um actually but the reason that you got to wear much better um get digits especially 
Bro021.C.dialogueact342	896.176	901.847	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so i'm kind of investigated to see what was the main factor for this different and 
Bro021.C.dialogueact343	901.847	907.187	C	PhD	s	-1	0	this different and it seems that that is his race is west parking 
Bro021.C.dialogueact344	908.2	919.654	C	PhD	fh|s^rt	-1	0	so when we put some nice compensation the um if you sure that that's the right from nice speeches nothing more anymore up you know 
Bro021.C.dialogueact345	920.399	925.219	C	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	and it makes a big difference k. digits

Bro021.C.dialogueact347	928.58	936.74	C	PhD	s	-1	0	uh you use it the old and you caesar i mean the and if it's for the press the proposal that we have like a. t. two one seven percent three commission rates

Bro021.B.dialogueact471	1166.41	1166.71	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	week so 
Bro021.F.dialogueact472	1167.02	1167.88	F	PhD	qo^tc	+1	2	much either 
Bro021.A.dialogueact473	1168.38	1172.14	A	Grad	h|s^rt	+1	2	um still working on my recalls preparation stuff um 
Bro021.A.dialogueact474	1172.53	1188.99	A	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	um so i'm i'm thinking about um starting some uh cheating experiments to uh determine the um the relative effectiveness of um some intermediate category so i want to classify 
Bro021.A.dialogueact475	1189.57	1198.77	A	Grad	s^e	+1	1	so for example um i know we're voicing occurs and everything um i would do a phone um phone recognition experiment 
Bro021.A.dialogueact476	1199.08	1205.36	A	Grad	fh|s^e	-1	0	um somehow putting in the uh be um the perfect knowledge i have about voices so 
Bro021.A.dialogueact477	1205.97	1222.38	A	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	so um in particular is thinking um in india hybrid framework just taking those alan any files and um setting too zero those probabilities that um that these phones are not voicing so sack i 
Bro021.A.dialogueact478	1222.51	1225.37	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	so sack i know this particular segment is voicing um 
Bro021.A.dialogueact480	1225.91	1237.3	A	Grad	fh|s^e	-1	0	um i would say uh you go into the corresponding l. a nail file and sunk out uh the post years for um those phoniness that um are not voiced and 
Bro021.F.dialogueact479	1225.54	1225.89	F	PhD	b	-1	0	um 
Bro021.F.dialogueact481	1237.33	1237.74	F	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bro021.A.dialogueact482	1237.87	1240.42	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and then see what kinds of improvements i yet and 
Bro021.A.dialogueact484	1240.97	1253.59	A	Grad	s^df	+1	1	i yet and so this would be a useful thing um to know in terms of like which which um which of these categories are are good for um speech recognition 
Bro021.F.dialogueact483	1240.66	1241.12	F	PhD	qy^bh	-1	0	i yet and so this would be 
Bro021.F.dialogueact485	1253.71	1254.07	F	PhD	b	-1	0	recognition so that's 
Bro021.A.dialogueact486	1254.43	1255.24	A	Grad	fh|%--	-1	0	so that's i 
Bro021.A.dialogueact487	1255.96	1261.82	A	Grad	s^cc	+1	1	i hope to get those uh those experiments done by that time calls come come around in july 
Bro021.F.dialogueact488	1262.12	1267.55	F	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	yeah i i i was thinking did you just take the probabilities of the other ones and spread them out evenly among uh the remaining ones 
Bro021.A.dialogueact489	1266.31	1266.75	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah i the remaining 
Bro021.A.dialogueact490	1266.75	1268.34	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	yeah i i i was thinking okay so set the remaining ones 
Bro021.A.dialogueact491	1268.39	1274.52	A	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	okay so set to set to some really low number of d. d. non boys um phones right 
Bro021.F.dialogueact492	1273.01	1273.42	F	PhD	b	-1	0	um

Bro021.F.dialogueact544	1357.14	1359.24	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	i've been focusing mainly on meeting recorder stuff so

Bro021.F.dialogueact546	1359.82	1363.0	F	PhD	fh|s^cc^tc	+1	2	so um so this i the that okay well 
Bro021.G.dialogueact547	1363.18	1363.7	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay well 
Bro021.G.dialogueact548	1363.81	1372.79	G	Grad	s	+1	3	okay well in my last talk last week i i said i tried phase normalization and gotten garbage results using not um long term mean subtraction approach 
Bro021.G.dialogueact549	1373.37	1375.35	G	Grad	s^df	+1	2	turned out was a bargain i'm not about code so i 
Bro021.G.dialogueact550	1375.72	1377.19	G	Grad	s	-1	0	so i tried it again and um 
Bro021.G.dialogueact551	1377.19	1377.57	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro021.G.dialogueact552	1378.37	1382.57	G	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	and um the results um we're we're better i got 
Bro021.G.dialogueact553	1382.73	1385.15	G	Grad	s^e	-1	0	i got intelligent both speech back but they still 
Bro021.G.dialogueact554	1385.15	1389.79	G	Grad	s	+1	1	but they still weren't as good as just the tracking the magnitude to log magnitude means 
Bro021.G.dialogueact555	1391.98	1399.0	G	Grad	s	+1	1	and also i've been talking to um under it's until about see um smart com language modeling about coming up with 
Bro021.G.dialogueact556	1399.0	1404.65	G	Grad	s	+1	1	about coming up with a good model for um far make use of this mark on system so 
Bro021.G.dialogueact557	1404.65	1405.06	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	on system so i'm going 
Bro021.G.dialogueact558	1405.86	1412.01	G	Grad	s^cc	+1	1	i'm going to be working on um implementing this means attraction approach from the farm make system for this mark i'm system 
Bro021.G.dialogueact559	1412.01	1413.54	G	Grad	s^bsc	+1	1	this mark i'm system i mean and um 
Bro021.G.dialogueact560	1413.64	1414.47	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	i mean and um 
Bro021.G.dialogueact561	1415.46	1420.95	G	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	one of these parents were going to do is um we're going to um train the a broadcast news nets 
Bro021.G.dialogueact562	1421.58	1423.75	G	Grad	s^df	-1	0	which is because that's what we've been using so far and 
Bro021.G.dialogueact563	1423.75	1429.38	G	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	so far and um adopted on some other data um i i dress wants to use um

Bro021.G.dialogueact569	1443.26	1447.11	G	Grad	qw	-1	0	it's so actually i was wondering how long does it take the train that broadcast usenet 
Bro021.B.dialogueact570	1448.1	1449.41	B	Professor	s	-1	0	the big one takes a while yeah it 
Bro021.B.dialogueact571	1449.67	1451.21	B	Professor	s^bk|s^e	-1	0	while yeah it takes two three weeks so

Bro021.B.dialogueact576	1461.34	1464.81	B	Professor	fh|s^cs.%--	-1	0	it so um you can scale it down by 
Bro021.B.dialogueact577	1465.05	1465.36	B	Professor	s^fa	-1	0	i'm sorry is two three weeks 
Bro021.B.dialogueact578	1465.36	1469.86	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i'm sorry is two three weeks for training up for the large broadcast news tests that training set i

Bro021.B.dialogueact593	1493.39	1497.42	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	so i mean i i guess i was i mean i could to be that we've talked a little bit about just doing 
Bro021.G.dialogueact592	1492.91	1493.25	G	Grad	b	-1	0	face so i mean 
Bro021.B.dialogueact594	1497.55	1499.48	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	bit about just doing it all with complex arithmetic 
Bro021.B.dialogueact595	1500.21	1501.16	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and uh and not 
Bro021.B.dialogueact596	1501.52	1505.68	B	Professor	s	+1	1	and not not uh doing the polar representation i think two can but 
Bro021.B.dialogueact597	1505.72	1514.96	B	Professor	s	-1	0	can but looks like there's ways one could potentially just work with the complex numbers and and in in principle get rid of the effects of the average complex spectrum 
Bro021.B.dialogueact598	1515.58	1515.8	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.G.dialogueact599	1517.72	1518.49	G	Grad	fg	-1	0	and um 
Bro021.G.dialogueact600	1519.7	1521.85	G	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	actually regarding the face normalization so i 
Bro021.G.dialogueact601	1521.85	1522.98	G	Grad	s	-1	0	normalization so i did two experiments and 
Bro021.G.dialogueact602	1522.98	1523.48	G	Grad	s^e.%--	-1	0	did two experiments and one is so 
Bro021.G.dialogueact603	1523.94	1526.68	G	Grad	s	-1	0	one is so faces get added modular two pie 
Bro021.G.dialogueact604	1527.29	1531.84	G	Grad	s^df	-1	0	and because you only know the phase of the complex numbers to a value modular to pry 
Bro021.G.dialogueact605	1532.35	1538.07	G	Grad	s	+1	1	and so i thought at first um that uh what i should do is unwrap the face because that one do that 
Bro021.G.dialogueact606	1538.07	1539.32	G	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because that one do that um 
Bro021.G.dialogueact607	1539.69	1547.95	G	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	um but i actually got worse results doing that unwrapping using the simple phase center opposites and not lab and i did not unwrapping it all

Bro021.B.dialogueact611	1553.9	1554.36	B	Professor	b	-1	0	so 
Bro021.G.dialogueact612	1556.66	1557.66	G	Grad	s	-1	0	that's all i have to say 
Bro021.F.dialogueact613	1558.07	1558.3	F	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.B.dialogueact614	1558.84	1558.95	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.B.dialogueact615	1559.41	1561.02	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so i'm i'm so hopeful that that i mean we don't even know if the 
Bro021.B.dialogueact616	1561.02	1565.75	B	Professor	s	-1	0	mean we don't even know if the phase is something they ever chases something we do want to remember i maybe 
Bro021.B.dialogueact617	1565.76	1568.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	want to remember i maybe there's some deeper reason why it isn't the right thing to do 
Bro021.B.dialogueact618	1569.1	1569.75	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but um 
Bro021.B.dialogueact619	1570.49	1574.23	B	Professor	s	-1	0	at least the principles looks like there's there's uh a couple potential ways to one one being 
Bro021.B.dialogueact620	1574.23	1577.14	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	one one being to just work with the complex numbers 
Bro021.B.dialogueact621	1578.04	1578.64	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.B.dialogueact622	1579.66	1583.71	B	Professor	fh|s^e	-1	0	and uh in rectangular kind of coordinates and the other 
Bro021.B.dialogueact623	1583.71	1588.83	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	coordinates and the other is to uh to uh taylor series 
Bro021.B.dialogueact624	1589.31	1589.48	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	well say work 
Bro021.B.dialogueact625	1589.72	1591.17	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	well say work at complex numbers and then when you 
Bro021.B.dialogueact626	1591.59	1596.85	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	and then when you get the spectrum the average complex spectrum um actually divided out 
Bro021.B.dialogueact627	1598.14	1600.26	B	Professor	fh|s^e	-1	0	um as opposed to taking logging distracting 
Bro021.B.dialogueact628	1601.11	1601.81	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so then um 
Bro021.B.dialogueact629	1601.81	1602.3	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so then um 
Bro021.B.dialogueact630	1603.35	1604.16	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um you there might 
Bro021.B.dialogueact631	1604.67	1606.41	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you there might be some numerical issues and 
Bro021.B.dialogueact632	1606.84	1607.77	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	and i know that 
Bro021.B.dialogueact633	1608.49	1612.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	the other thing we talked a little bit about was taylor series expansion and 
Bro021.B.dialogueact634	1612.88	1613.82	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bro021.B.dialogueact635	1614.46	1616.66	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh actually was talking to carp about a little bit and 
Bro021.B.dialogueact636	1616.8	1619.67	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	a little bit and and and i got thinking about it and 
Bro021.B.dialogueact637	1619.67	1620.77	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	about it and and uh 
Bro021.B.dialogueact638	1621.31	1623.63	B	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	so one thing is that you have to do i think uh 
Bro021.B.dialogueact639	1623.63	1623.96	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	i think uh 
Bro021.B.dialogueact640	1625.06	1626.26	B	Professor	s	-1	0	tucson whiteboard but i think 
Bro021.B.dialogueact641	1626.26	1633.35	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	but i think you have to be a little careful about scaling the numbers that you're taking the complex numbers that you're taking log off because 
Bro021.B.dialogueact642	1633.35	1638.22	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	off because the taylor expansion ford has you know square in the cuban and so forth and and so 
Bro021.B.dialogueact643	1638.22	1646.56	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and and so if if you have a a number that is modular know uh very different from one should be right around one if 
Bro021.B.dialogueact644	1646.94	1647.39	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	one if it's because it's 
Bro021.B.dialogueact645	1647.61	1649.35	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	it's because it's a expansion of log one one minus 
Bro021.B.dialogueact646	1649.67	1650.75	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	one one minus ups on our on 
Bro021.B.dialogueact647	1650.75	1654.0	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	ups on our on is is one plus up 
Bro021.B.dialogueact648	1655.16	1655.93	B	Professor	qy^bu.%--	-1	0	or don't i suppose 
Bro021.B.dialogueact649	1655.99	1657.53	B	Professor	s	-1	0	or don't i suppose nestle squared over too and have plenty 
Bro021.B.dialogueact651	1657.53	1658.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	over too and have plenty of every three and so forth 
Bro021.G.dialogueact650	1657.41	1657.67	G	Grad	b	-1	0	over too and have plenty 
Bro021.B.dialogueact652	1658.68	1659.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	of every three and so forth so perhaps one is 
Bro021.B.dialogueact653	1659.17	1661.67	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so perhaps one is bigger than one that divergence 
Bro021.G.dialogueact654	1661.65	1661.68	G	Grad	b	-1	0	divergence 
Bro021.B.dialogueact655	1662.52	1663.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so some scaling but 
Bro021.B.dialogueact656	1663.92	1664.82	B	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	scaling but that's not a big deal just 
Bro021.B.dialogueact657	1664.82	1669.52	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	that's not a big deal just log of of k. times complex numbers and you can just 
Bro021.B.dialogueact658	1669.52	1673.91	B	Professor	s	-1	0	numbers and you can just the same as block plus like a complex number 
Bro021.G.dialogueact659	1671.98	1672.01	G	Grad	b	-1	0	plus like a 
Bro021.B.dialogueact661	1674.32	1674.73	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh so there's 
Bro021.B.dialogueact662	1674.73	1675.16	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh so there's 
Bro021.G.dialogueact660	1674.3	1674.48	G	Grad	b	-1	0	uh so there's 
Bro021.B.dialogueact663	1676.35	1677.19	B	Professor	s	-1	0	convergence 
Bro021.B.dialogueact664	1678.24	1678.4	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro021.F.dialogueact666	1680.22	1680.51	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay what you said 
Bro021.F.dialogueact667	1680.61	1681.2	F	PhD	qo^rt^tc	+1	2	so okay what you said now 
Bro021.D.dialogueact668	1681.96	1687.93	D	PhD	h|s	+1	3	so uh i being uh computer learning because uh reasserting ford is under our desks now 
Bro021.D.dialogueact669	1688.51	1689.84	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	and uh 
Bro021.D.dialogueact670	1690.81	1695.11	D	PhD	s	+1	2	i i actually started was was doing fine and i'd pictured ones it's like 
Bro021.D.dialogueact671	1695.19	1697.48	D	PhD	s	+1	2	it's like using a small section of the court in and out on 
Bro021.D.dialogueact672	1697.48	1700.03	D	PhD	s	-1	0	the court in and out on the whole is recognition expert on the italian and i talked like 
Bro021.D.dialogueact673	1700.03	1703.01	D	PhD	s	+1	2	and i talked like was wasn't not using it then i 
Bro021.D.dialogueact674	1703.48	1703.86	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	then i 
Bro021.D.dialogueact675	1704.21	1706.79	D	PhD	s	+1	2	so i've been playing to find that the problem came from and then 
Bro021.D.dialogueact676	1706.79	1709.06	D	PhD	s	+1	2	came from and then it looks like i some public i mean the way some some 
Bro021.D.dialogueact677	1709.32	1711.67	D	PhD	s^df	+1	2	some some lady sea bug some and 
Bro021.D.dialogueact678	1711.67	1712.22	D	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	bug some and uh i i 
Bro021.D.dialogueact679	1712.72	1716.05	D	PhD	s	+1	2	uh i i mean it uh it actually i kitty actually made the one thing was i was looking at the spectrum 
Bro021.D.dialogueact680	1716.05	1717.91	D	PhD	s	-1	0	i was looking at the spectrum i'm said i caught 
Bro021.D.dialogueact681	1718.32	1720.42	D	PhD	s	+1	2	i just like it's it's a they caught up in like when i 
Bro021.D.dialogueact682	1720.48	1721.12	D	PhD	s^e.%-	-1	0	i miss the the i'm up in like when i 
Bro021.B.dialogueact683	1721.42	1722.0	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i miss the the i'm sorry this is the second 
Bro021.B.dialogueact684	1722.0	1722.36	B	Professor	s^fa	-1	0	sorry this is the second 
Bro021.B.dialogueact685	1722.36	1723.17	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	sorry this is the second is the very first sentence 
Bro021.B.dialogueact686	1723.17	1724.3	B	Professor	s	-1	0	is the very first sentence sentences and lost well being 
Bro021.B.dialogueact687	1724.3	1725.57	B	Professor	s	-1	0	sentences and lost in the rest the what what well being 
Bro021.D.dialogueact688	1724.52	1724.86	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	sentences and lost well being 
Bro021.B.dialogueact689	1725.57	1726.18	B	Professor	qw.%-	-1	0	in the rest the what what oh yeah i actually 
Bro021.D.dialogueact690	1726.45	1726.7	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh yeah i actually 
Bro021.D.dialogueact691	1726.69	1731.8	D	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah it oh okay oh yeah i actually do it i mean of fitting as i have more do it and then it started out separately and it 
Bro021.B.dialogueact692	1730.33	1730.66	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah it then it started out 
Bro021.B.dialogueact693	1731.3	1732.1	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay separately and it it did get 
Bro021.D.dialogueact694	1731.8	1734.55	D	PhD	s	-1	0	oh okay separately and it it did get like hey i just caught the signal out and it goes 
Bro021.D.dialogueact695	1734.55	1735.43	D	PhD	s	-1	0	signal out and it goes okay 
Bro021.D.dialogueact696	1736.25	1737.63	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so i played it ends on that and then 
Bro021.D.dialogueact697	1737.63	1739.59	D	PhD	s	-1	0	it ends on that and then i mean it's like i did in with some part and into liking 
Bro021.D.dialogueact698	1739.59	1740.7	D	PhD	s	-1	0	with some part and into liking it and some and then i 
Bro021.D.dialogueact699	1740.7	1742.68	D	PhD	s	-1	0	it and some and then i in that boss that i messed it up some it 
Bro021.B.dialogueact701	1743.41	1743.78	B	Professor	b	-1	0	so so 
Bro021.D.dialogueact700	1743.25	1743.58	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	so so 
Bro021.D.dialogueact702	1743.93	1744.62	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so so they i mean i thought 
Bro021.D.dialogueact703	1744.62	1745.74	D	PhD	s	-1	0	they i mean i thought it was all fine and then i 
Bro021.D.dialogueact704	1745.74	1748.77	D	PhD	s	-1	0	it was all fine and then i i did and i like something was then not using it 
Bro021.D.dialogueact705	1749.2	1749.43	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	so i like 
Bro021.D.dialogueact706	1749.59	1752.59	D	PhD	s	+1	2	so i like i'm trying to find like um probably given it seems 
Bro021.B.dialogueact707	1751.67	1751.95	B	Professor	b	-1	0	like um 
Bro021.D.dialogueact708	1752.59	1754.17	D	PhD	s	-1	0	probably given it seems to me like some in some cities have 
Bro021.B.dialogueact709	1754.13	1754.35	B	Professor	b	-1	0	in some cities have 
Bro021.D.dialogueact710	1754.17	1754.88	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	in some cities have 
Bro021.D.dialogueact711	1755.49	1759.19	D	PhD	fh|s^tc.%--	-1	0	and um the other thing uh was uh uh the 
Bro021.D.dialogueact712	1759.68	1762.46	D	PhD	s	+1	1	the he make short of one seventy one day and then i was to 
Bro021.D.dialogueact713	1762.45	1763.6	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	one day and then i was to talk 
Bro021.B.dialogueact714	1763.16	1763.38	B	Professor	b	-1	0	talk 
Bro021.B.dialogueact715	1764.74	1765.08	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	yeah that is these onto 
Bro021.B.dialogueact716	1765.39	1766.43	B	Professor	s^j	-1	0	that is these onto their yeah 
Bro021.B.dialogueact717	1766.62	1766.77	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	their yeah 
Bro021.D.dialogueact718	1767.89	1768.15	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	that yeah i i like too that 
Bro021.D.dialogueact719	1768.15	1774.27	D	PhD	s	+1	1	i i like too that the other thing it would doing something i would do it if anything and then it got to listen to their of style in any sort of 
Bro021.D.dialogueact720	1774.27	1774.98	D	PhD	s	-1	0	in any sort of 
Bro021.D.dialogueact721	1774.98	1775.65	D	PhD	s	-1	0	in any sort of and then at the time and then he gave 
Bro021.D.dialogueact722	1775.65	1777.3	D	PhD	s	+1	1	and then at the time and then he gave me would i do if it doesn't out live used 
Bro021.D.dialogueact723	1777.3	1780.0	D	PhD	s^e	+1	1	it doesn't out live used it is uh uh duties and and of that 
Bro021.D.dialogueact724	1780.0	1782.22	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and and of that or something it's came up and then um 
Bro021.D.dialogueact725	1782.22	1783.13	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	up and then um i thought i i'm actually 
Bro021.D.dialogueact726	1783.41	1788.18	D	PhD	s	-1	0	i thought i i'm actually uh think of using that also in this so you know sitting because that is them 
Bro021.D.dialogueact727	1788.26	1791.11	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because that is them mortified i mean the fading a president's refusing to cut cotton 
Bro021.D.dialogueact728	1791.11	1796.15	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	refusing to cut cotton same uses i just and things also in designing i mean if that sensitive designing 
Bro021.D.dialogueact729	1796.44	1802.17	D	PhD	s	+1	1	sensitive designing out on you mean if they're that i'm i just use one of those carlos because in in this and doing this and into a that it it actually 
Bro021.B.dialogueact730	1800.92	1801.39	B	Professor	b	-1	0	because in in this and doing this 
Bro021.D.dialogueact731	1802.17	1804.22	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and into a that it it actually gives me something better then 
Bro021.D.dialogueact732	1804.79	1806.84	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	then using just the guidance confident

Bro021.B.dialogueact812	1985.42	1986.95	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you're right mean each of these require this 
Bro021.B.dialogueact813	1987.44	2000.71	B	Professor	qw^cs	-1	0	um given that we're going to have for this test at least of the boundaries what if initially we start off by using sections of non speech yes this nation

Bro021.B.dialogueact820	2005.9	2013.95	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	um first place i mean even if ultimately we wouldn't be given the boundaries uh this would be a good initial experiment to separate out the effects of things i mean 
Bro021.B.dialogueact821	2013.95	2019.92	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	effects of things i mean how much is the poor yeah relatively uh on helpful result that you're getting and this is this is this is 
Bro021.B.dialogueact822	2019.92	2023.93	B	Professor	qy	-1	0	this is this is this is the due to some inherent limitation to the method for these tasks and 
Bro021.B.dialogueact823	2023.93	2031.28	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	these tasks and how much of it is just to the fact that you're not accurately finding enough reasons that uh really

Bro021.B.dialogueact828	2033.08	2041.31	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	so maybe if you tested using uh you have more reliable stretches of non speech to the estimation from see if 
Bro021.B.dialogueact829	2041.31	2042.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	see if that helps yeah 
Bro021.E.dialogueact830	2042.92	2043.18	E	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	that helps yeah another thing

Bro021.B.dialogueact1309	3297.99	3298.67	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	the and this is 
Bro021.E.dialogueact1310	3299.48	3302.74	E	PhD	h|s^rt	-1	0	so's uh the mm i spend a message to bomb 
Bro021.B.dialogueact1311	3302.93	3304.12	B	Professor	qy^d	-1	0	so's twenty or something twenty to bomb uneasy 
Bro021.E.dialogueact1312	3303.71	3304.63	E	PhD	s	-1	0	twenty or something twenty uneasy 
Bro021.B.dialogueact1313	3304.32	3304.7	B	Professor	qy^bu^d^m	-1	0	twenty 
Bro021.B.dialogueact1314	3305.55	3305.96	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so it's yes 
Bro021.B.dialogueact1315	3305.96	3308.68	B	Professor	s^bk|s	-1	0	so it's yes it's actually forty numbers that you're again 
Bro021.B.dialogueact1316	3310.45	3313.07	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh there there's united papers 
Bro021.E.dialogueact1317	3312.07	3318.31	E	PhD	s	-1	0	uh there there's united papers see ability well no medicine for the noise 
Bro021.B.dialogueact1318	3319.33	3319.96	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	well yeah but 
Bro021.B.dialogueact1319	3319.96	3323.85	B	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	well yeah but i mean no no papers is the bible you know yeah maybe to think

Bro021.B.dialogueact1321	3323.85	3324.21	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	is the bible you know this is this is 
Bro021.B.dialogueact1322	3324.21	3325.38	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	this is this is uh the 
Bro021.E.dialogueact1323	3324.32	3325.07	E	PhD	b	-1	0	this is this is uh the 
Bro021.B.dialogueact1324	3325.98	3333.44	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh the question is um whether it would be helpful it sickly if you use if you had more so 
Bro021.B.dialogueact1325	3333.96	3334.9	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	more so suppose you did this 
Bro021.B.dialogueact1326	3334.9	3336.02	B	Professor	s	-1	0	suppose you did this is almost cheating uncertainties in real time 
Bro021.B.dialogueact1327	3336.02	3337.04	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uncertainties in real time but i suppose you use 
Bro021.B.dialogueact1328	3337.04	3343.24	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but i suppose you use the real boundaries that that you ever factor given by the v. a. d. and so forth are i guess 
Bro021.B.dialogueact1329	3343.3	3346.04	B	Professor	s	-1	0	are i guess we're going to be getting better boundaries and uh and 
Bro021.B.dialogueact1330	3346.9	3351.07	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and you look you take all of the all of the non speech components address so you have a fair amount 
Bro021.B.dialogueact1331	3351.07	3352.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you have a fair amount do you 
Bro021.B.dialogueact1332	3352.66	3356.37	B	Professor	qy	-1	0	do you benefit from having a better model for the noise that would be another 
Bro021.B.dialogueact1333	3356.44	3357.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that would be another question 
Bro021.E.dialogueact1334	3357.99	3358.31	E	PhD	s^am	-1	0	question so first 
Bro021.B.dialogueact1335	3358.57	3371.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so first question would be to what extent is are the errors that you still saying based on the fact that you have poor boundaries for the uh uh non speech the second question 
Bro021.B.dialogueact1336	3371.44	3379.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	the second question might be given that you have good boundaries because you do better if you use more parameters to characterize the nice 
Bro021.B.dialogueact1337	3380.77	3381.34	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro021.B.dialogueact1338	3382.04	3383.89	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	also another question might be
