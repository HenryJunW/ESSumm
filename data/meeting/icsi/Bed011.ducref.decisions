As the data collection is ready to start , it was agreed that for the first ten subjects the interaction with the system/instructor will be along the lines of a basic response system.
Tasks will be divided in categories ( "tour" , "attend" etc ) and subjects are going to be asked to choose no more than one task out of each category .
This first run will probably take a couple of weeks , but the first results ( audio files and selected highlights ) will be discussed shortly , in order to decide whether more detail ( complex spatial relationships , temporal planning etc ) should be included in the design or particular constructions be elicited.
Regarding the completion of the belief-net , the remaining details , mainly the properties of the ontology and discourse nodes , should be added.
After building in the conditional probability tables , a working prototype of the net will be ready.
Finally , the initial work on constructions should focus on a general overview of the dialogues with brief descriptions.
Further analysis will follow from there in a top-down fashion.
