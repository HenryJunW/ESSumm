Bro004.B.dialogueact112	266.077	269.967	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	but the question is how much worse is it if you have broadband i 
Bro004.B.dialogueact113	269.967	271.317	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	have broadband i mean my son what i saw 
Bro004.B.dialogueact114	271.317	284.147	B	Professor	s	-1	0	son what i saw the early results uh i guess last week was that um if you train them one language and testing on other say that the results were were relatively poor

Bro004.B.dialogueact116	285.594	296.454	B	Professor	qy	-1	0	but but the question is if you train on one language but you have a broad coverage and then test in another is that is that improve things in comparison 
Bro004.D.dialogueact117	297.612	298.972	D	PhD	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	we use the same language

Bro004.D.dialogueact225	539.533	540.223	D	PhD	b	-1	0	so on call that one 
Bro004.B.dialogueact226	540.112	550.982	B	Professor	s	-1	0	on call that one what you're saying is that the word air rate for the same language but using uh different training dated and you testing on see tim and so forth one point one 
Bro004.D.dialogueact227	549.886	550.276	D	PhD	b	-1	0	so forth one point one 
Bro004.D.dialogueact228	551.889	553.049	D	PhD	s^aa^m	-1	0	right and if it's yeah it's around one point one

Bro004.D.dialogueact231	553.509	553.709	D	PhD	b	-1	0	right and if it's 
Bro004.B.dialogueact232	554.515	560.115	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	you do go to three languages including english it's something like one point three

Bro004.A.dialogueact238	569.501	571.041	A	PhD	qy^bu^d	-1	0	so it's an additional thirty percent producing around 
Bro004.D.dialogueact239	571.052	571.732	D	PhD	qw^t3	-1	0	producing around 
Bro004.D.dialogueact240	571.842	572.882	D	PhD	s	-1	0	producing around one point four

Bro004.B.dialogueact243	573.929	577.679	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	okay and if you exclude english in this combination with that 
Bro004.D.dialogueact244	578.187	585.537	D	PhD	s	-1	0	if we exclude english um there is not much difference with uh date that we think 
Bro004.D.dialogueact245	585.537	586.237	D	PhD	s	-1	0	date that we think so 
Bro004.B.dialogueact247	586.633	587.013	B	Professor	s^fe	-1	0	i think just so

Bro004.B.dialogueact251	591.207	592.627	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so oh that's that's important so what what 
Bro004.B.dialogueact252	592.627	594.497	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	that's important so what what it's saying here is just that yes there is 
Bro004.B.dialogueact253	594.497	594.747	B	Professor	s	-1	0	just that yes there is 
Bro004.B.dialogueact254	594.747	602.997	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	just that yes there is a reduction in performance when you don't um have this when you don't have um

Bro004.B.dialogueact260	614.399	617.829	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so it's so when you go to a different task is actually not so different it's when 
Bro004.B.dialogueact261	617.829	618.739	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so different it's when you went to these so 
Bro004.B.dialogueact262	618.869	620.769	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	you went to these so what's the difference between two and three 
Bro004.B.dialogueact263	621.009	623.109	B	Professor	qw^e^rt	-1	0	and one point one case in point four case i'm confused

Bro004.B.dialogueact307	712.776	722.266	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but when you add in more trained dated keeping around the same size it um performs worse on the t. i. digits 
Bro004.B.dialogueact308	723.156	727.126	B	Professor	s^bu^rt	-1	0	okay now all of this is this is noisy t. i. digits i assume but

Bro004.B.dialogueact315	741.879	746.129	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so i mean it's interesting that they had going to different different task didn't seem to hurt us that much in going to a different 
Bro004.B.dialogueact316	746.129	750.261	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	in going to a different language um 
Bro004.B.dialogueact317	752.732	753.802	B	Professor	s^rt.%--	-1	0	it doesn't seem to matter the difference 
Bro004.B.dialogueact318	753.802	756.342	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	seem to matter the difference between train four's not particularly great so that means 
Bro004.B.dialogueact319	756.342	760.912	B	Professor	s	-1	0	great so that means that whether you have the language in or not it's not such a big deal 
Bro004.D.dialogueact320	761.212	762.142	D	PhD	b	-1	0	it sounds like 
Bro004.B.dialogueact321	762.256	773.026	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	it sounds like um we may need to have more of uh things that are similar to a target language or i mean 
Bro004.B.dialogueact322	773.026	776.786	B	Professor	s	-1	0	or i mean you have the same number parameters and then the wrong that you have 
Bro004.B.dialogueact323	776.786	778.646	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then the wrong that you have increased the size of the they're on that and 
Bro004.B.dialogueact324	778.896	786.656	B	Professor	s	-1	0	the they're on that and maybe there's just just down and complexity to it represents the very been increased very ability and the and the training so 
Bro004.B.dialogueact325	786.656	787.786	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	the training so that could be 
Bro004.B.dialogueact326	789.504	790.994	B	Professor	h|qw^tc.%--	-1	0	um so what about 
Bro004.B.dialogueact327	791.144	798.544	B	Professor	qr^d^rt.%--	-1	0	so these results with uh that pictures driving now that are pretty similar for the different teachers or or uh um 
Bro004.D.dialogueact328	798.694	799.774	D	PhD	h|s	-1	0	uh um let me check uh 
Bro004.D.dialogueact329	799.774	800.204	D	PhD	h	-1	0	let me check uh 
Bro004.B.dialogueact330	800.749	801.059	B	Professor	b	-1	0	so this 
Bro004.D.dialogueact331	801.261	803.261	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	so this was sort of it being um 
Bro004.B.dialogueact332	803.664	804.114	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	um

Bro004.D.dialogueact335	807.231	811.171	D	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	what would it be with jared stuff that uh we describe the same 
Bro004.D.dialogueact336	811.291	820.051	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	describe the same and see with a slight increase of p. r. a. rates uh would go to to commit and then 
Bro004.D.dialogueact337	820.841	824.241	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	and then it's gets get with them and getting well 
Bro004.D.dialogueact338	825.301	828.919	D	PhD	h|s^bk	-1	0	yeah that 
Bro004.D.dialogueact339	828.919	832.639	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	yeah that there's a difference security would between it being generous ties that

Bro004.B.dialogueact370	891.725	893.535	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but but it's it sounds like but 
Bro004.F.dialogueact371	891.996	930.033	F	Grad	b	-1	0	i wonder were um all three of these net using the same output this multi language uh labeling but but it's it sounds like i mean that's interesting because it it seems like what it's saying it's not so much that you got hurt uh uh because you uh didn't have so much representation of english because the other case you don't get her any more at least one it seems like uh it might simply be a case that you have something is just much more diverse that you have the same number parameters representing but 
Bro004.B.dialogueact372	894.395	895.285	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	i mean that's interesting because it

Bro004.A.dialogueact385	939.743	950.773	A	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	so this would from this you would say well it doesn't really matter if we put finish into the training of general that if there's going to be you know finishing the test 
Bro004.A.dialogueact386	951.033	951.273	A	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	well it's it 
Bro004.B.dialogueact387	951.58	954.49	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well it's it sounds have to be careful because we have no 
Bro004.B.dialogueact388	954.49	956.09	B	Professor	s	-1	0	be careful because we have no a good result yet

Bro004.B.dialogueact397	984.649	987.779	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	we get oh yeah the other thing i was asking though is that i think that in the case 
Bro004.B.dialogueact398	988.399	988.589	B	Professor	h	-1	0	you know you do have 
Bro004.B.dialogueact399	988.589	989.459	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you know you do have to be careful because the pumpkin 
Bro004.B.dialogueact400	989.459	990.899	B	Professor	s	-1	0	to be careful because the pumpkin ponder results i think 
Bro004.B.dialogueact401	990.899	995.849	B	Professor	s	-1	0	ponder results i think they got some really results in which you trained on one language untested on another he 
Bro004.B.dialogueact402	995.849	999.089	B	Professor	s	-1	0	on another he didn't have three that you just had one language so you trained on 
Bro004.B.dialogueact403	999.089	1002.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so you trained on one type of digits untested another wasn't there something

Bro004.D.dialogueact461	1137.47	1141.49	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	matched on this uh sickened group of four oh she's mismatch in 
Bro004.D.dialogueact462	1141.49	1144.16	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	in i need i need me snatched and then 
Bro004.D.dialogueact463	1144.61	1146.75	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	and then there were parts forty that and and it's 
Bro004.D.dialogueact464	1146.75	1149.6	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	that and and it's the same i don't think 
Bro004.A.dialogueact465	1150.4	1153.84	A	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	sort of so the upper part is training t. i. digits 
Bro004.D.dialogueact466	1150.99	1156.44	D	PhD	s	-1	0	sort of so the upper part is training t. i. digits it's it's it's gay results i mean so it's 
Bro004.D.dialogueact467	1156.44	1161.5	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	i mean so it's it's good training testings with different kind of features and what the 
Bro004.A.dialogueact468	1157.39	1157.63	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	it's good 
Bro004.D.dialogueact469	1161.59	1168.46	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and what the and um uh that's gone on the networks that are used fool doing this

Bro004.D.dialogueact481	1204.43	1206.33	D	PhD	s	-1	0	it's uh the one hundred number it's 
Bro004.D.dialogueact482	1206.51	1211.58	D	PhD	s	-1	0	uh uh it's what all these numbers are the ratio with respect to the base 
Bro004.A.dialogueact483	1208.37	1208.68	A	PhD	s^bk^fe	-1	0	uh are the ratio 
Bro004.A.dialogueact484	1211.69	1212.95	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	uh okay okay this is word the base 
Bro004.B.dialogueact485	1212.63	1214.0	B	Professor	s	-1	0	okay okay this is word rare rachel so high numbers that 
Bro004.B.dialogueact486	1214.0	1215.23	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	so high numbers that 
Bro004.D.dialogueact487	1216.12	1219.17	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	yeah it's just a word aerate racial 
Bro004.E.dialogueact488	1216.5	1216.69	E	PhD	%	-1	0	yeah it's just 
Bro004.A.dialogueact490	1220.62	1221.59	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay so uh 
Bro004.D.dialogueact489	1220.16	1220.29	D	PhD	b	-1	0	okay 
Bro004.D.dialogueact491	1221.31	1226.89	D	PhD	s	-1	0	oh so uh seventy point two means that richard or it's and like there's that person 
Bro004.A.dialogueact493	1226.92	1228.31	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay okay that person

Bro004.B.dialogueact499	1242.3	1245.83	B	Professor	s	-1	0	though so that's thing you have circled here in the second column 
Bro004.D.dialogueact500	1244.62	1244.91	D	PhD	b	-1	0	in the second 
Bro004.B.dialogueact501	1247.18	1250.77	B	Professor	qw^rt	-1	0	and multi english refers to what do 
Bro004.D.dialogueact502	1250.99	1251.65	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	to what do they make 
Bro004.D.dialogueact503	1254.16	1254.23	D	PhD	b	-1	0	then 
Bro004.D.dialogueact504	1254.92	1258.42	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	then you s. uh m. s. m. s. and andy which are

Bro004.D.dialogueact508	1264.07	1274.87	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	like eighty eight and am it to say that imitating one that i've trained on uh future we south and uh there is tapes 
Bro004.D.dialogueact509	1275.79	1278.62	D	PhD	s	-1	0	uh but with increased frame numbers 
Bro004.D.dialogueact510	1278.88	1278.94	D	PhD	b.%	-1	0	numbers 
Bro004.D.dialogueact511	1284.39	1290.76	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and we can't we can't see any on the first line of the table that's it it's actually slightly worse when we don't use that 
Bro004.D.dialogueact512	1290.76	1294.09	D	PhD	s	-1	0	@reject@ sometime is that what's when we don't use that that that it's not not that much 
Bro004.B.dialogueact513	1292.35	1292.61	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro004.B.dialogueact514	1293.22	1294.92	B	Professor	s^fa	-1	0	@reject@ sometime is that what's not that much 
Bro004.B.dialogueact515	1294.92	1297.19	B	Professor	qw^rt	-1	0	multi french multi sometime is that what's m. s. n. and destiny so 
Bro004.A.dialogueact516	1297.13	1297.78	A	PhD	s	-1	0	multi french multi so 
Bro004.A.dialogueact518	1297.78	1298.61	A	PhD	s	-1	0	multi french multi stan so the french the spanish 
Bro004.D.dialogueact517	1297.3	1300.18	D	PhD	s	-1	0	multi french multi stan oh okay so it's so the french the spanish and english 
Bro004.B.dialogueact519	1299.36	1299.97	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay and english 
Bro004.B.dialogueact520	1300.18	1303.15	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	so it's broader vocabulary yeah 
Bro004.B.dialogueact522	1303.68	1305.31	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and okay yeah 
Bro004.D.dialogueact521	1303.35	1303.54	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah 
Bro004.B.dialogueact523	1305.76	1306.04	B	Professor	s^tc	-1	0	okay so i think what time 
Bro004.B.dialogueact524	1306.04	1316.71	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so i think what time what i saw and they're smaller chart that i was thinking of was it was there were some numbers i saw i think that included these multiple languages and 
Bro004.B.dialogueact525	1316.91	1320.01	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and it and i was seeing that it got worse i think i was always 
Bro004.B.dialogueact526	1320.28	1321.34	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i think i was always forget some very limited 
Bro004.B.dialogueact527	1321.34	1324.05	B	Professor	s	-1	0	forget some very limited results then at that point which showed 
Bro004.D.dialogueact528	1323.38	1323.87	D	PhD	b	-1	0	at that point 
Bro004.B.dialogueact529	1324.73	1327.46	B	Professor	s	-1	0	which showed having in these these other languages in fact it might have 
Bro004.B.dialogueact530	1327.46	1333.64	B	Professor	s	-1	0	in fact it might have been just this last category having two languages broad that were were were english was removed 
Bro004.B.dialogueact531	1334.25	1335.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so that was cross language and 
Bro004.B.dialogueact532	1335.92	1338.14	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and and the result was quite poor what 
Bro004.B.dialogueact533	1338.82	1342.58	B	Professor	s	-1	0	what i we hadn't seen yet was that if you had in english it's still before 
Bro004.D.dialogueact534	1343.25	1343.42	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah 
Bro004.B.dialogueact535	1344.2	1352.08	B	Professor	qw	+1	1	uh um now what's the noise condition um of the training data well i think this 
Bro004.D.dialogueact536	1344.3	1344.79	D	PhD	s^m^na	-1	0	uh 
Bro004.B.dialogueact537	1352.48	1353.83	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	well i think this is what you were saying the noise 
Bro004.B.dialogueact538	1353.83	1355.31	B	Professor	s	+1	1	is what you were saying the noise condition is the same it's the same uh 
Bro004.B.dialogueact539	1355.31	1356.0	B	Professor	s^r	-1	0	it's the same uh aurora 
Bro004.B.dialogueact540	1356.0	1360.46	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	aurora noises uh in all these cases for the tree yeah 
Bro004.D.dialogueact541	1357.95	1360.08	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	noises uh in all these cases for the tree yeah 
Bro004.B.dialogueact542	1361.21	1370.26	B	Professor	s	+1	1	so there's not a statistical system based trunks of statistically different no it's characteristic between uh the training attest and yet we're no you this same nice 
Bro004.D.dialogueact543	1368.35	1370.46	D	PhD	s^na	+1	1	uh the training attest and yet we're no you this same nice 
Bro004.B.dialogueact544	1370.61	1372.47	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	and yet we're seeing some kind of effect i think that they saw the first 
Bro004.D.dialogueact545	1370.74	1370.85	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and yet we're 
Bro004.D.dialogueact546	1371.41	1374.75	D	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	seeing some kind of effect i think that they saw the first what the when matched well matched 
Bro004.F.dialogueact547	1374.48	1375.61	F	Grad	s^2	-1	0	right when matched well matched condition 
Bro004.B.dialogueact549	1375.55	1375.94	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	right condition 
Bro004.D.dialogueact548	1375.35	1375.5	D	PhD	b	-1	0	right condition 
Bro004.B.dialogueact550	1376.2	1381.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so the some kind of a a an effect from having these uh this broader coverage 
Bro004.B.dialogueact551	1382.34	1383.04	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro004.B.dialogueact552	1386.56	1392.34	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	oh i guess what we should do i doing with this is try a testing nissan uh the same sort of thing on you 
Bro004.B.dialogueact553	1392.34	1392.62	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	thing on you 
Bro004.B.dialogueact554	1392.94	1394.74	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	thing on you probably must have this lined up to do try 
Bro004.B.dialogueact555	1394.74	1399.75	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	lined up to do try the same but exact same training do testing on the other languages 
Bro004.D.dialogueact556	1400.49	1400.95	D	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}

Bro004.B.dialogueact559	1406.94	1407.68	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	um oh well women you have it 
Bro004.B.dialogueact560	1407.68	1408.92	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well women you have it here for the italian that's 
Bro004.B.dialogueact561	1408.92	1409.3	B	Professor	s	-1	0	here for the italian that's right okay so 
Bro004.B.dialogueact563	1409.46	1409.74	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	right okay so 
Bro004.B.dialogueact564	1409.74	1411.2	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	right okay so so yeah so forty

Bro004.D.dialogueact567	1421.43	1425.57	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	so it appears that press spanish is that's very true street that in 
Bro004.D.dialogueact568	1426.13	1437.34	D	PhD	s^df	+1	1	because uh well amusing using and then that's working on you know spanish it's your or it just almost um twice visiting all right

Bro004.B.dialogueact572	1442.61	1443.91	B	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	i see is there any difference in 
Bro004.B.dialogueact573	1444.53	1446.47	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so it's in the um 
Bro004.B.dialogueact574	1447.1	1453.99	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	she's thing that when you train in english and uh test on 
Bro004.D.dialogueact575	1449.69	1450.4	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and uh 
Bro004.B.dialogueact576	1455.32	1456.74	B	Professor	s^t1	-1	0	oh you don't have training recession that there is another difference 
Bro004.D.dialogueact577	1456.04	1459.68	D	PhD	s	+1	1	recession in that there is another difference is that the noise nice out there 
Bro004.B.dialogueact579	1459.92	1460.78	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	in in what out there 
Bro004.D.dialogueact578	1459.68	1462.63	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	in in what out there before they can talk i mean the 
Bro004.D.dialogueact580	1462.63	1472.35	D	PhD	s^e	+1	1	i mean the uh but uh um networks talk trained with nice from or uh two digits and oh that's true 
Bro004.E.dialogueact581	1471.38	1471.89	E	PhD	s^2	-1	0	uh two digits oh that's true

Bro004.A.dialogueact597	1523.98	1525.46	A	PhD	s^bu^rt	-1	0	so that's match training is that what 
Bro004.A.dialogueact598	1525.46	1526.39	A	PhD	qy^g^rt	-1	0	is that what that is it's 
Bro004.D.dialogueact599	1526.9	1527.08	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	that is it's no that the pot

Bro004.D.dialogueact603	1531.62	1534.59	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so why do you get your best number so training and that's nice and different 
Bro004.A.dialogueact604	1532.47	1536.38	A	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	so why do you get your best number and that's nice and different 
Bro004.A.dialogueact605	1537.39	1539.62	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	when you get your best number in the clean case well it's 
Bro004.C.dialogueact606	1539.8	1543.34	C	PhD	s	-1	0	case uh well it's relative to um baseline matching

Bro004.A.dialogueact617	1560.25	1561.72	A	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	that sixty one point four 
Bro004.D.dialogueact618	1562.18	1564.12	D	PhD	s^aa|s^arp	-1	0	yeah but it's not the king case it's a

Bro004.B.dialogueact634	1598.3	1604.38	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	about but what is uh what is currently running that's uh that just filling in holes here or or uh 
Bro004.B.dialogueact635	1604.38	1606.27	B	Professor	qrr^rt	-1	0	here or or uh uh no we done into 
Bro004.D.dialogueact636	1605.02	1607.95	D	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	uh no we done into physicals but 
Bro004.B.dialogueact638	1608.0	1608.39	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	i could eat 
Bro004.D.dialogueact637	1607.95	1610.46	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	physicals but i could eat there's something important is 
Bro004.D.dialogueact639	1610.98	1616.67	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	is that um we made about the assumption concerning the online on my station 
Bro004.D.dialogueact640	1617.24	1633.51	D	PhD	s	+1	1	and we just no taste uh recently that um uh approach that we are using what's not didn't do very good results when we use the streets futuristic 
Bro004.D.dialogueact641	1635.67	1638.88	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro004.D.dialogueact642	1639.41	1649.63	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so basically if you if you look at and uh that's on the table the first uh row we take you six hundred and forth tree and seventy five 
Bro004.D.dialogueact643	1651.26	1662.84	D	PhD	s	-1	0	he's out to recess we append for that young uh we've strayed um yeah the future us using all my nomination 
Bro004.B.dialogueact644	1664.14	1664.62	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro004.D.dialogueact645	1665.47	1676.43	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	and but uh um what's in the table and just at that stuff that get beat us online on my mission calm so the number 
Bro004.D.dialogueact646	1676.7	1688.2	D	PhD	s	-1	0	worth that seventy nine so the number seventy nine fifty four and uh forty two uh the results thing by uh plenty about the uh is online on my are online i my edition approach 
Bro004.A.dialogueact647	1687.91	1688.36	A	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	worth that seventy nine my edition approach 
Bro004.A.dialogueact648	1688.36	1689.67	A	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	that seventy nine uh 
Bro004.B.dialogueact649	1689.99	1693.78	B	Professor	h|s	-1	0	uh it's just sort of sitting right on the uh the column online huh 
Bro004.D.dialogueact651	1690.68	1690.97	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	it's just 
Bro004.E.dialogueact650	1690.28	1690.6	E	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	it's just 
Bro004.E.dialogueact652	1690.72	1690.81	E	PhD	%--	-1	0	it's just 
Bro004.A.dialogueact654	1694.94	1695.87	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	oh i see 
Bro004.B.dialogueact653	1694.51	1695.94	B	Professor	b	-1	0	oh i see 
Bro004.D.dialogueact655	1695.19	1695.86	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	i see 
Bro004.D.dialogueact656	1696.51	1696.67	D	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro004.D.dialogueact657	1697.64	1701.41	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so these out areas and stuff but yeah i we online on my and treat 
Bro004.D.dialogueact658	1701.41	1703.52	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	and treat teachers to educate them 
Bro004.D.dialogueact659	1703.68	1709.89	D	PhD	s	-1	0	them the prehistory so seventy six and so on are we our future straightedge kids so 
Bro004.B.dialogueact660	1706.18	1706.48	B	Professor	b	-1	0	are 
Bro004.B.dialogueact661	1708.68	1708.99	B	Professor	b	-1	0	future straightedge 
Bro004.D.dialogueact662	1709.89	1716.85	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	kids so what you see that is there is that uh uh the way we were doing this was that's correct but 
Bro004.D.dialogueact663	1716.85	1719.85	D	PhD	s^df	-1	0	correct but still the networks are very good 
Bro004.D.dialogueact664	1720.76	1726.86	D	PhD	s^e	+1	1	so do you know what was wrong with the online normalization when we using that networks on number are but are that's uh the beverages 
Bro004.E.dialogueact665	1723.24	1723.77	E	PhD	s^2	-1	0	number are but are 
Bro004.B.dialogueact666	1725.43	1727.83	B	Professor	qy	-1	0	so do you know what was wrong with the online normalization or uh the beverages 
Bro004.D.dialogueact667	1728.26	1728.55	D	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah they was if 
Bro004.D.dialogueact668	1728.56	1730.44	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	yeah they was if they were different things and 
Bro004.D.dialogueact669	1730.44	1737.75	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	and basically my first thing you said um that's uh so you it 
Bro004.D.dialogueact670	1737.74	1743.55	D	PhD	s^rt.%--	-1	0	so you it uh regression part 
Bro004.D.dialogueact671	1744.12	1752.7	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	i use to point five percent which to close to you and uh the programs here 
Bro004.D.dialogueact672	1753.62	1755.47	D	PhD	s	+1	1	and but the values five person so 
Bro004.B.dialogueact673	1755.84	1756.21	B	Professor	b	-1	0	so and that's more 
Bro004.D.dialogueact674	1755.86	1758.16	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	so and that's more quickly um 
Bro004.B.dialogueact675	1757.84	1758.16	B	Professor	b	-1	0	quickly um 
Bro004.B.dialogueact676	1758.39	1758.61	B	Professor	b	-1	0	um 
Bro004.D.dialogueact677	1759.0	1760.52	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but yeah 
Bro004.D.dialogueact678	1760.64	1760.86	D	PhD	b	-1	0	but yeah 
Bro004.D.dialogueact679	1761.07	1776.39	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	i assumed that this was not important because uh previous results from from down and show that basically both both values you the same it's it press 
Bro004.D.dialogueact680	1776.59	1781.37	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	it press true um uh k. digits but platoon italian the 
Bro004.B.dialogueact681	1780.29	1780.91	B	Professor	b	-1	0	platoon italian 
Bro004.D.dialogueact682	1782.37	1786.86	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	second thing is to unionization us and uh stuff like 
Bro004.D.dialogueact683	1786.87	1794.46	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	stuff like jodie uh what we where doing just to start the regression from the beginning of uh fifty rounds 
Bro004.D.dialogueact684	1795.31	1801.65	D	PhD	s	+1	1	and using echinacea a i use that oz uh go about i mean in torrance measured across the world database

Bro004.D.dialogueact687	1802.18	1803.87	D	PhD	s	+1	1	and too bad did something to friends 
Bro004.D.dialogueact688	1804.08	1816.04	D	PhD	s	+1	1	that it uh she initialized um that something to me and sorry owns like computing these owned uh ninety five first frames a future terrorists 
Bro004.D.dialogueact689	1818.28	1822.61	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	there where all them i know difference is the fact that 
Bro004.D.dialogueact690	1822.61	1827.27	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	is the fact that she's fifteen d. c. instead of instead of thirteen 
Bro004.D.dialogueact691	1828.12	1831.18	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and that she used to see hero instead of like energy 
Bro004.D.dialogueact692	1832.37	1835.19	D	PhD	s	-1	0	uh but the main difference consumes the readers so 
Bro004.D.dialogueact693	1836.03	1838.42	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	uh i changed the code 
Bro004.D.dialogueact694	1839.59	1843.29	D	PhD	s	+1	1	uh i know we have a big thing that me out too rejected 
Bro004.B.dialogueact695	1844.02	1844.39	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	we 
Bro004.D.dialogueact696	1845.02	1847.57	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	see i see uh the friend goes 
Bro004.D.dialogueact697	1847.57	1851.41	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	the friend goes i don't think sexy and he said i the same way she does 
Bro004.D.dialogueact698	1852.08	1863.52	D	PhD	s	-1	0	actually i stocked i i don't wait too and fifty can decide to five frames before computing i mean and the variance three two to stunned regression

Bro004.B.dialogueact700	1862.74	1862.91	B	Professor	b	-1	0	stunned regression 
Bro004.D.dialogueact701	1864.08	1865.99	D	PhD	s	-1	0	i i i use online scheme 
Bro004.D.dialogueact702	1866.97	1870.46	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and only started precursor to that insight into his frame but 
Bro004.D.dialogueact703	1870.96	1871.96	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	frame but he to me now 
Bro004.D.dialogueact704	1872.77	1878.94	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so uh i retrained and uh that works with these 
Bro004.D.dialogueact705	1879.16	1884.54	D	PhD	s	+1	1	but like the networks are retraining with these you teachers

Bro004.D.dialogueact710	1891.08	1895.11	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so basically what they expect is that these numbers the a big go down but perhaps 
Bro004.D.dialogueact711	1895.11	1897.38	D	PhD	s	-1	0	but perhaps not not so much because 
Bro004.B.dialogueact712	1897.67	1898.01	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	because i think and

Bro004.B.dialogueact717	1908.48	1914.59	B	Professor	fg|s^cs	+1	1	okay but i think that given the pressure time we probably want to draw some because of that especially want to draw some conclusions from this some reductions 
Bro004.B.dialogueact718	1914.59	1917.55	B	Professor	s	-1	0	from this some reductions and what we're looking at

Bro004.D.dialogueact728	1939.93	1946.71	D	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	researching we were thinking perhaps that uh the way we use it and them is not 
Bro004.D.dialogueact729	1947.99	1950.91	D	PhD	s	-1	0	when there's basic you going and uh the stuff because 
Bro004.D.dialogueact730	1950.91	1954.02	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	uh the stuff because we train the networks if we trained and that's works 
Bro004.D.dialogueact731	1954.08	1960.03	D	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	if we trained and that's works on um english and part uh specific task um 
Bro004.B.dialogueact732	1960.03	1960.78	B	Professor	b	-1	0	um 
Bro004.D.dialogueact733	1960.81	1967.32	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	um what we ask is to the networks to put the ball and the decision bond every somewhere in space 
Bro004.B.dialogueact734	1967.77	1968.46	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro004.D.dialogueact735	1968.19	1979.76	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	and ask them to talk to put one that's one side of the uh for frost partake of funny my once i have the boundaries decision in every in 
Bro004.D.dialogueact736	1979.76	1982.02	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	in every in went for another fundamental aside am 
Bro004.D.dialogueact737	1982.74	1987.29	D	PhD	s	+1	1	am so there's kind of reduction of the information there that that's correct because if we 
Bro004.D.dialogueact738	1987.29	1999.98	D	PhD	s^df	+1	1	because if we change back and if the funniness on it in the same context and in your task okay just eat um decision boundaries on up should not be at the same place 
Bro004.B.dialogueact740	2003.07	2003.34	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	but the way the future 
Bro004.D.dialogueact739	2003.06	2023.06	D	PhD	s	+1	1	but the way the future i guess the the way the network if the features is that it's creatures company did it's removed companies information how about some information from the teachers basing the decision boundary stepped up to my place for one kind of state that but it's 
Bro004.D.dialogueact741	2023.06	2025.82	D	PhD	s	-1	0	that's but it's not the case so another kind of did 
Bro004.B.dialogueact742	2026.03	2026.74	B	Professor	s^by	-1	0	a trade off right so 
Bro004.D.dialogueact743	2026.18	2026.45	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	a trade off right so 
Bro004.B.dialogueact744	2026.74	2026.94	B	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	a trade off right so 
Bro004.B.dialogueact745	2027.0	2027.86	B	Professor	s^co	-1	0	anyway go ahead yeah 
Bro004.D.dialogueact746	2027.67	2027.9	D	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	anyway go ahead yeah 
Bro004.D.dialogueact747	2028.09	2038.31	D	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	so uh what we were thinking about the perhaps um one way too so these programs drink reason number off but put something around that works 
Bro004.D.dialogueact748	2040.02	2046.16	D	PhD	s^e.%--	-1	0	something like you funniness within context um what basically 
Bro004.D.dialogueact749	2046.23	2048.9	D	PhD	s	+1	0	what basically context dependent funniness 
Bro004.B.dialogueact750	2053.06	2053.39	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	maybe i mean 
Bro004.B.dialogueact751	2053.62	2057.13	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	maybe i mean i i think you could make the same argument be justice legitimate 
Bro004.B.dialogueact752	2057.22	2060.12	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	be justice legitimate for hybrid systems so 
Bro004.B.dialogueact754	2061.3	2061.61	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	yeah but we know 
Bro004.D.dialogueact753	2061.16	2062.79	D	PhD	s^aa|s^arp.%-	-1	0	and in fact yeah but we know that 
Bro004.B.dialogueact755	2062.41	2066.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and in fact things get better context dependent versions that 
Bro004.B.dialogueact756	2067.61	2067.9	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro004.D.dialogueact757	2068.08	2070.24	D	PhD	s^aa|s^arp	-1	0	yeah but you it's something different we went to future 
Bro004.D.dialogueact758	2070.24	2071.4	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	we went to future is uh 
Bro004.B.dialogueact760	2071.65	2071.89	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	is uh 
Bro004.D.dialogueact759	2071.4	2074.14	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah but is uh 
Bro004.B.dialogueact761	2074.73	2078.32	B	Professor	fg|s^arp^df.%--	-1	0	yeah but it's still true that what you're doing is you're ignoring 
Bro004.B.dialogueact762	2078.48	2079.37	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	you're ignoring you're you're coming 
Bro004.B.dialogueact763	2079.44	2084.87	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you're you're coming up with something to represent whether it's distribution pro distribution of our futures 
Bro004.B.dialogueact764	2085.38	2091.78	B	Professor	s	-1	0	coming up with a sitter variables that are representing uh things that very well over context 
Bro004.D.dialogueact765	2091.72	2092.25	D	PhD	b	-1	0	context uh 
Bro004.B.dialogueact766	2092.73	2094.65	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh and you're putting it all together 
Bro004.B.dialogueact767	2095.14	2096.67	B	Professor	s	-1	0	ignoring the differences in context 
Bro004.B.dialogueact768	2097.28	2099.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that's that's true the hybrid system true for 
Bro004.B.dialogueact769	2099.6	2100.74	B	Professor	s	-1	0	true for tennis 
Bro004.B.dialogueact770	2101.5	2108.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so for that reason when you in in a hybrid system when you incorporate context one or another you do get better scores 
Bro004.D.dialogueact771	2109.03	2109.26	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	okay 
Bro004.B.dialogueact772	2109.62	2110.01	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay but i 
Bro004.B.dialogueact773	2110.6	2114.56	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but i it's it's it's a big deal to get that 
Bro004.B.dialogueact774	2115.58	2117.07	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i i'm i'm sort of 
Bro004.B.dialogueact775	2118.87	2131.94	B	Professor	s^df	+1	1	and once you the other thing is that what she represents start repeating more more context it is uh much more um specific two particular tasking language 
Bro004.B.dialogueact776	2132.72	2141.44	B	Professor	s.x	-1	0	so um the acoustics associated with uh particular context christmas you may 
Bro004.B.dialogueact777	2141.44	2147.49	B	Professor	s	+1	1	christmas you may have some kind of context that won't never occur and one language and walker frequently now there's a crazy 
Bro004.B.dialogueact778	2147.49	2148.0	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	now there's a crazy issue getting enough 
Bro004.B.dialogueact779	2148.0	2152.57	B	Professor	s	+1	1	issue getting enough training for a particular kind of context becomes harder 
Bro004.B.dialogueact780	2153.47	2156.0	B	Professor	s	+1	1	we already actually don't have a huge amount of training did 
Bro004.B.dialogueact781	2157.39	2157.8	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro004.D.dialogueact782	2159.37	2165.91	D	PhD	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	yeah but i mean the 
Bro004.D.dialogueact783	2167.1	2170.09	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	2	the way we we do we now is that we have in your on it's working basically 
Bro004.D.dialogueact784	2170.09	2175.85	D	PhD	s	+1	2	basically dimension internet working train almost to give binary decisions 
Bro004.B.dialogueact785	2176.71	2176.97	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro004.D.dialogueact786	2177.74	2181.93	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	and um uh binary decisions about funny 
Bro004.D.dialogueact787	2182.0	2186.48	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	almost but i mean it it um 
Bro004.B.dialogueact788	2185.17	2185.68	B	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	almost but 
Bro004.B.dialogueact789	2185.9	2188.4	B	Professor	s	-1	0	almost but i mean it it it does give it just tradition yeah 
Bro004.D.dialogueact790	2189.01	2189.29	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	it's and 
Bro004.B.dialogueact791	2189.65	2201.67	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it's and and it is true that if there's two phones that are very similar that uh the it may prefer one but it will give a reasonably high value to the other two 
Bro004.D.dialogueact792	2201.05	2201.33	D	PhD	b	-1	0	the other two 
Bro004.D.dialogueact793	2202.6	2202.94	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah sure but 
Bro004.D.dialogueact794	2202.94	2203.08	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	yeah sure but uh 
Bro004.D.dialogueact795	2203.82	2210.52	D	PhD	h|s^rt	-1	0	uh so basically it's almost binary decision some 
Bro004.D.dialogueact796	2210.52	2220.31	D	PhD	s	-1	0	oh nobody would still decision some um the idea of using more classes is to get something that's less uh binary decision 
Bro004.B.dialogueact797	2220.09	2220.4	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	oh nobody would still 
Bro004.B.dialogueact798	2220.4	2222.35	B	Professor	s	+1	1	oh nobody would still be even more of a binary decision you be more 
Bro004.B.dialogueact799	2222.6	2223.48	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you be more fun because 
Bro004.B.dialogueact800	2223.87	2231.46	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	fun because then you would say that in that that this phone in this context is the one but the same phone in a slightly different context zero but yeah but 
Bro004.D.dialogueact801	2224.51	2225.65	D	PhD	s^arp.%-	-1	0	then you would say that in that that but yeah but 
Bro004.B.dialogueact802	2232.25	2235.12	B	Professor	s^r	+1	1	that would be even even more distinctive binary decision i actually would have thought yeah but if 
Bro004.B.dialogueact803	2235.12	2238.18	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	i actually would have thought you'd going to go the other way have fewer classes uh yeah but if 
Bro004.D.dialogueact804	2235.41	2236.14	D	PhD	s^arp.%-	-1	0	i actually would have thought you'd going to go the other way yeah but if 
Bro004.B.dialogueact805	2239.02	2249.81	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	i mean for instance the the thing i was argue for before but again which i don't think we have time to try something in which you would not if the code so you could train to have several outputs on you circulatory features 
Bro004.D.dialogueact806	2241.18	2241.73	D	PhD	b	-1	0	i was argue for before 
Bro004.D.dialogueact807	2249.78	2250.38	D	PhD	b	-1	0	features person that would that 
Bro004.B.dialogueact808	2250.31	2254.67	B	Professor	s	-1	0	person that would that would go that would be much broader recover many different situations 
Bro004.B.dialogueact809	2255.01	2258.36	B	Professor	s	-1	0	if you you're very very fine categories is very yeah but they think yeah perhaps 
Bro004.D.dialogueact810	2255.22	2255.87	D	PhD	b	-1	0	if you you're very very fine 
Bro004.D.dialogueact811	2256.76	2257.53	D	PhD	s^arp.%-	-1	0	categories is very yeah but they think 
Bro004.D.dialogueact812	2258.72	2259.75	D	PhD	s^am	-1	0	yeah perhaps you're right but 
Bro004.D.dialogueact813	2259.75	2261.18	D	PhD	s^arp^df	-1	0	you're right but u. s. more classes so you you 
Bro004.D.dialogueact814	2261.18	2264.07	D	PhD	s	-1	0	so you you have more information your features so 
Bro004.D.dialogueact815	2264.07	2270.97	D	PhD	s^e	-1	0	so um you us more information and uh um uh

Bro004.B.dialogueact867	2375.71	2379.28	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	and is this with the revised online normalization yeah we'd 
Bro004.E.dialogueact868	2379.3	2381.25	E	PhD	s	-1	0	old one so it's yeah we'd always order yet 
Bro004.D.dialogueact869	2380.11	2380.43	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	old always order 
Bro004.B.dialogueact870	2380.79	2381.27	B	Professor	s^2	-1	0	old one so it's always order yet 
Bro004.B.dialogueact872	2381.83	2383.18	B	Professor	s	-1	0	one so it's using all the that's for that but again we have yet yeah but 
Bro004.E.dialogueact871	2381.42	2381.62	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	one so it's yet 
Bro004.B.dialogueact873	2383.18	2388.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but again we have the hope it's we have a hope that it maybe it's some making too much difference yeah yeah but we guys maybe 
Bro004.E.dialogueact874	2383.3	2383.47	E	PhD	b	-1	0	but again we have yeah but 
Bro004.E.dialogueact875	2383.84	2384.79	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	but again we have the hope it's yeah but we guys 
Bro004.E.dialogueact876	2385.98	2386.53	E	PhD	s	-1	0	we have a hope that it maybe it's some 
Bro004.B.dialogueact878	2388.1	2388.66	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah 
Bro004.E.dialogueact877	2387.73	2388.16	E	PhD	s^am	-1	0	making too much difference yeah maybe 
Bro004.B.dialogueact879	2388.66	2388.85	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bro004.E.dialogueact880	2388.77	2389.1	E	PhD	s^no	-1	0	yeah 
Bro004.D.dialogueact881	2389.58	2389.72	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro004.B.dialogueact882	2390.55	2391.23	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	uh okay uh so there's 
Bro004.D.dialogueact883	2391.32	2393.16	D	PhD	s	-1	0	uh so there's this combination yeah working in 
Bro004.D.dialogueact884	2393.16	2393.34	D	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah working in 
Bro004.D.dialogueact885	2393.53	2395.41	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	yeah working in of of 
Bro004.E.dialogueact886	2395.74	2396.08	E	PhD	b	-1	0	of um 
Bro004.D.dialogueact887	2396.31	2399.13	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	um i we stopped working mostly down and 
Bro004.D.dialogueact888	2400.04	2409.97	D	PhD	s	+1	1	um we e. in work so um the idea of using both futures come net books 
Bro004.E.dialogueact889	2410.57	2410.69	E	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro004.D.dialogueact890	2411.24	2421.34	D	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um and um we think that with this approach perhaps we could read use a number of what puts it in your the tour okay 
Bro004.D.dialogueact891	2422.06	2425.08	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	um so get simpler networks because we the teachers 
Bro004.D.dialogueact892	2425.37	2426.69	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	because we the teachers 
Bro004.D.dialogueact893	2427.22	2436.95	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	so we have um come up with um different kind of broke funny he get bigger race 
Bro004.D.dialogueact894	2437.97	2442.28	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	and we basically we have three types of brodsman that's just 
Bro004.D.dialogueact895	2443.36	2445.55	D	PhD	s	-1	0	what something using piece of articulation sweeps 
Bro004.D.dialogueact896	2445.55	2450.19	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	sweeps which leads to nine i think broadcast this 
Bro004.D.dialogueact897	2451.21	2453.21	D	PhD	s	-1	0	uh another which basin manner which 
Bro004.D.dialogueact898	2453.32	2455.95	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	which each something so we like nine kassy's 
Bro004.D.dialogueact899	2456.59	2458.52	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	and then something that combine both and 
Bro004.D.dialogueact900	2458.82	2461.26	D	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	both and me have pennies twenty five 
Bro004.F.dialogueact901	2462.05	2462.63	F	Grad	s	-1	0	two seven 
Bro004.D.dialogueact902	2462.76	2464.44	D	PhD	s^m	+1	1	two seven broadcasts 
Bro004.D.dialogueact903	2466.13	2467.31	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so like uh you know 
Bro004.D.dialogueact904	2467.31	2467.79	D	PhD	s^no	-1	0	you know 
Bro004.D.dialogueact905	2468.56	2470.36	D	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so what you like back fellows from the fellows 
Bro004.B.dialogueact906	2470.56	2471.27	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so what you do um uh the source um 
Bro004.B.dialogueact908	2471.27	2472.39	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	do um uh the source and so your um 
Bro004.D.dialogueact907	2471.18	2479.48	D	PhD	s	-1	0	do um uh the source and so your that's or you know it's it's i mean that's you have and that's um foremost we'd and that that that that's i mean 
Bro004.B.dialogueact909	2472.39	2474.39	B	Professor	qr^rt	-1	0	and so your that's or you know it's it's 
Bro004.B.dialogueact910	2474.87	2475.23	B	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	know it's it's i 
Bro004.B.dialogueact911	2476.03	2477.14	B	Professor	qw^rt	-1	0	mean that's you have foremost 
Bro004.B.dialogueact913	2479.56	2480.1	B	Professor	s^bk^m	-1	0	and that's that that's i mean it it just 
Bro004.D.dialogueact912	2479.48	2485.35	D	PhD	s^df^rt	-1	0	and that's right that that's i mean it it just we just changing their they boast to train that's with fewer out outputs maybe to working 
Bro004.E.dialogueact914	2481.63	2482.7	E	PhD	s	-1	0	we just changing their they boast maybe to working 
Bro004.E.dialogueact915	2484.03	2484.12	E	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	with fewer out outputs 
Bro004.B.dialogueact916	2485.96	2486.16	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	right but and then 
Bro004.B.dialogueact918	2486.84	2488.62	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but but i didn't understand and then 
Bro004.D.dialogueact917	2486.79	2487.25	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	but but i didn't understand and then

Bro004.B.dialogueact920	2490.09	2497.03	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh the software currently just has uh a laws for i think the one one hot i'll put so you're having multiple 
Bro004.B.dialogueact921	2497.03	2499.36	B	Professor	qy	-1	0	so you're having multiple that's and combining them or 
Bro004.B.dialogueact922	2499.36	2499.58	B	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	or 
Bro004.B.dialogueact923	2501.1	2502.81	B	Professor	qw.%--	-1	0	uh how are you how are you coming up with

Bro004.D.dialogueact925	2510.33	2512.66	D	PhD	s	-1	0	and they have one out do you it's the thinking that yeah 
Bro004.A.dialogueact926	2511.69	2513.32	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and they have one out what's just it's the thinking that yeah 
Bro004.D.dialogueact927	2512.78	2513.09	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	have one out what's just thinking that yeah 
Bro004.B.dialogueact928	2513.78	2514.59	B	Professor	s^bk^m	-1	0	what's just one that it's 
Bro004.D.dialogueact931	2514.77	2519.13	D	PhD	s^bs	-1	0	one that it's one that's with uh um thirty seven up what's and 
Bro004.E.dialogueact929	2514.47	2514.68	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	one that it's 
Bro004.F.dialogueact930	2514.66	2515.19	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	one that it's one that's with 
Bro004.D.dialogueact932	2519.13	2520.62	D	PhD	s	-1	0	i see i and that's just 
Bro004.B.dialogueact933	2519.91	2520.46	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	i see i and that's just 
Bro004.B.dialogueact935	2521.09	2521.89	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	see so 
Bro004.D.dialogueact934	2520.62	2520.73	D	PhD	b	-1	0	i see i that's just 
Bro004.D.dialogueact936	2522.09	2526.49	D	PhD	s^rt	+1	1	it's like basically uh spend on that like if you were texas 
Bro004.B.dialogueact937	2527.24	2529.56	B	Professor	s	-1	0	sues everybody other way of what you were saying a better going says 
Bro004.B.dialogueact938	2529.56	2530.24	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	a better going says yeah yeah but i think yeah 
Bro004.B.dialogueact940	2530.24	2530.57	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah yeah but i think yeah 
Bro004.D.dialogueact939	2530.16	2530.36	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah yeah but i think yeah 
Bro004.D.dialogueact941	2530.36	2530.96	D	PhD	s^arp.%--	-1	0	yeah yeah but i think yeah 
Bro004.D.dialogueact942	2530.96	2531.32	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah yeah but i think yeah could be including the 
Bro004.D.dialogueact944	2531.77	2533.58	D	PhD	s^aa^m	-1	0	could be including the features yeah i don't including the teachers 
Bro004.F.dialogueact943	2531.38	2532.86	F	Grad	s^2	+1	1	could be including the features including the teachers 
Bro004.E.dialogueact945	2531.98	2532.2	E	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	could be including the features including the teachers 
Bro004.D.dialogueact946	2533.86	2535.96	D	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah i don't think this would work i don't 
Bro004.D.dialogueact947	2536.18	2537.28	D	PhD	s	-1	0	i think it's going to get worse because 
Bro004.D.dialogueact948	2537.28	2547.24	D	PhD	s^df	+1	1	because what i be the effect that that tough tomb reducing too much information is basic basically what happens in 
Bro004.B.dialogueact949	2538.6	2538.92	B	Professor	b	-1	0	what i be 
Bro004.D.dialogueact950	2547.24	2547.55	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	in 
Bro004.B.dialogueact951	2548.07	2550.57	B	Professor	s^cs.%-	+1	1	do you think if you include that plus the other features but yeah because 
Bro004.D.dialogueact952	2548.18	2548.39	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	do you think if you include that but 
Bro004.D.dialogueact953	2550.1	2550.5	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	yeah because 
Bro004.D.dialogueact954	2550.5	2554.0	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	yeah because there's press one important thing that that that brings and which i show 
Bro004.D.dialogueact955	2554.0	2559.46	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	and which i show show that this distinction between this speech in silence because 
Bro004.D.dialogueact956	2560.11	2562.72	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	these nets are trained on what concur condition i mean do 
Bro004.D.dialogueact957	2562.72	2565.92	D	PhD	s	-1	0	condition i mean do they both are thing and can speech and we had a nice after 
Bro004.D.dialogueact958	2566.42	2567.27	D	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	such is one thing 
Bro004.D.dialogueact959	2568.46	2568.94	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro004.D.dialogueact960	2570.15	2576.64	D	PhD	s^cs^rt	-1	0	but perhaps something intermediary you single so some protests could could bring some much more information 
Bro004.D.dialogueact961	2577.44	2578.42	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh 
Bro004.B.dialogueact962	2579.36	2581.93	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so so again we have these broad classes and 
Bro004.B.dialogueact963	2581.99	2583.2	B	Professor	s	-1	0	classes and was somewhat pry means twenty seven 
Bro004.B.dialogueact964	2583.2	2585.71	B	Professor	s	-1	0	pry means twenty seven this is sixty four basically 
Bro004.B.dialogueact966	2586.51	2588.7	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and you have the original features which 
Bro004.D.dialogueact965	2586.17	2586.26	D	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bro004.B.dialogueact967	2589.13	2590.15	B	Professor	s	-1	0	p. p. or something then uh 
Bro004.D.dialogueact968	2589.17	2589.34	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	p. p. or something 
Bro004.B.dialogueact970	2590.72	2599.49	B	Professor	qr^d^rt	+1	2	then uh just remind me all of that goes into uh that all that is transformed by uh uh k. jail or something yeah 
Bro004.D.dialogueact969	2590.23	2590.72	D	PhD	b	-1	0	then uh 
Bro004.D.dialogueact971	2599.6	2601.61	D	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	something yeah we'd probably be uh 
Bro004.E.dialogueact972	2600.5	2600.67	E	PhD	s	-1	0	we'd probably 
Bro004.D.dialogueact973	2601.61	2601.9	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	be uh 
Bro004.D.dialogueact974	2601.9	2604.38	D	PhD	s	+1	2	be uh one single gal to consume everything or

Bro004.D.dialogueact1157	2971.86	2975.41	D	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	yeah you can basically removed the frames from the future future if i 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1158	2974.6	2974.82	B	Professor	b	-1	0	future future 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1159	2976.28	2980.79	B	Professor	fg|s^rt	-1	0	yeah so i mean in that in in the in the decoding you're saying we were going to go from here to here i 
Bro004.D.dialogueact1160	2976.81	2977.17	D	PhD	%-	-1	0	yeah so i mean in that in in the i 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1161	2981.23	2981.54	A	PhD	b	-1	0	i think 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1162	2981.83	2984.88	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i think they're they're they're treating it you know like um 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1163	2985.05	2986.15	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well size slave word but but connected 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1164	2986.15	2987.22	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but but connected you know the that 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1165	2987.35	2987.94	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	you know the that 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1166	2988.58	2993.5	A	PhD	s	-1	0	in the text they say that this this is a tentative block bag of a possible configuration we could think of 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1167	2995.11	2996.95	A	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	that sort of sounds like they're not doing that yeah 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1168	2998.36	3000.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well no they they have numbers though right so 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1169	3000.44	3000.78	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	though right so 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1170	3000.98	3002.82	B	Professor	s	-1	0	though right so i think they're they're doing something like that i think 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1171	3002.82	3003.88	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	like that i think that they're they're 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1172	3004.86	3010.89	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i think what i mean by that that is they're trying to come up with any block diagram that's plausible for the standard 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1173	3011.51	3012.32	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	you know there is safe i mean 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1174	3012.32	3019.5	B	Professor	s	-1	0	safe i mean from the point of view of of uh reducing the number of that you have to transmit it's not a bad idea to use accents anyway 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1175	3018.82	3019.94	A	PhD	b	-1	0	idea to use accents anyway 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1177	3020.74	3024.91	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i'm just wondering what exactly did they do up in this people if it wasn't uh um 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1176	3020.72	3021.01	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	i'm just wondering um 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1178	3027.11	3030.38	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but it's the thing is it's that that that's that's i i i 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1179	3031.45	3041.02	B	Professor	s	-1	0	certainly be tricky about it and try in transmitting voice uh and for listening to is that these kinds of things uh cut speech off a lot and 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1181	3041.63	3042.17	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and so um 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1180	3041.28	3041.57	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	and 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1182	3041.97	3043.29	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and so um 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1183	3044.37	3045.74	A	PhD	s	-1	0	plus it's going to introduce delays 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1184	3047.07	3048.2	B	Professor	s^aa^m	-1	0	does introduce delays but they're claiming that 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1185	3048.2	3051.83	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but they're claiming that it's it's within uh the boundaries of and 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1186	3051.68	3051.99	A	PhD	b	-1	0	of and 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1187	3052.54	3054.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and the l. d. a. introduces delays and what 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1188	3054.51	3057.21	B	Professor	s	-1	0	delays and what he's suggesting this is a parallel path so that it doesn't 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1189	3057.21	3060.79	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so that it doesn't introduce uh any more delay 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1190	3061.44	3063.79	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it introduces hundred millisecond delay but the 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1191	3063.79	3066.78	B	Professor	s	-1	0	delay but the same time the l. d. a down here 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1192	3067.47	3067.74	B	Professor	s^no.%--	-1	0	what's 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1193	3067.74	3070.09	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	what's the uncertainty l. d. a. n. s. okay temple inspect spectacle 
Bro004.C.dialogueact1194	3069.88	3070.82	C	PhD	s	-1	0	n. s. okay temple inspect spectacle 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1195	3071.14	3071.64	B	Professor	s^bk|s^ft	-1	0	uh thank you 
Bro004.E.dialogueact1196	3072.57	3073.82	E	PhD	s.%	-1	0	yeah you would know that 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1197	3073.5	3074.3	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah you would know that 
Bro004.C.dialogueact1198	3074.25	3074.69	C	PhD	s^bk.%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro004.B.dialogueact1199	3075.92	3081.34	B	Professor	fg|s^tc	-1	0	so um it's the temper l. l. d. a. does in fact include the same so 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1200	3082.0	3091.21	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that i think he but by by saying this is a tentative block a diagram i think means if you construct it this way just this delay would work out that way and then be okay 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1202	3091.3	3091.75	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	way and then be okay 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1201	3091.21	3092.22	B	Professor	s	-1	0	way and then be okay they 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1203	3092.83	3096.09	B	Professor	s	-1	0	they they clearly did actually remove silent sections in her because they 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1204	3096.09	3100.3	B	Professor	s	-1	0	in her because they got these were there any results 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1205	3101.75	3106.41	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	2	so um i think that it's it's nice to do that in this because in fact 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1206	3106.41	3108.91	B	Professor	s	+1	2	in this because in fact it's going to give a better word air result and 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1207	3109.02	3111.3	B	Professor	s	+1	2	there for will help helping in an evaluation where 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1208	3111.77	3114.74	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	where the weather this would actually be a final standard i don't know um 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1209	3114.88	3120.6	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	2	i don't know um uh as you know part of the problem of the valuation right now is that the word models are pretty bad and nobody wants 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1210	3120.6	3123.19	B	Professor	s	+1	2	pretty bad and nobody wants has has approached improving them so 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1211	3123.46	3130.28	B	Professor	s	-1	0	them so it's possible that a lot of the problems with some of insurgents and so forth go away if there were better word models to begin with so 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1212	3130.28	3132.77	B	Professor	s	-1	0	with so this might just be a temporary thing but 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1213	3132.77	3136.55	B	Professor	s	-1	0	thing but but on the other hand and maybe just the idea 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1214	3137.43	3145.67	B	Professor	fh|s.%--	+1	3	so um question i'm going to want to go through next week when it shows up i guess is given that we've been look at 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1215	3145.67	3147.01	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	we've been look at what we've been trying were 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1216	3147.95	3150.13	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	2	were uh looking at 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1217	3151.04	3154.04	B	Professor	s	+1	2	i then i guess combinations of features in multi band uh 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1218	3154.97	3160.43	B	Professor	s	+1	2	uh and we've been looking at cross language cross task issues 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1219	3161.14	3167.21	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and they've been not so much looking at the crust task um multi-language issues that they've been 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1220	3167.68	3170.2	B	Professor	s	+1	2	that they've been looking at uh these issues that they 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1221	3170.2	3175.32	B	Professor	s	+1	2	that they online normalization and the uh police activity detection 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1222	3176.05	3186.56	B	Professor	qh^co	+1	3	and i guess when he comes here we're going to have to start saying about um what are we choose from what we've looked at to um bland with some group of things what they've looked at 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1223	3187.05	3190.18	B	Professor	qh	+1	3	once we choose that how do we split up the effort 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1224	3191.08	3197.74	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because we still have even once we choose we've still got uh another month or so i mean there's 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1225	3197.74	3203.39	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	month or so i mean there's holidays in a way but but uh i think the valuation data come january thirty first of the still a fair 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1226	3203.39	3206.77	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	of the still a fair amount of time to do things together is just 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1227	3206.77	3211.97	B	Professor	s	-1	0	things together is just that they probably should be somewhat more coherent between the two sides that amount of time 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1228	3212.79	3219.71	A	PhD	qy^rt^rt	-1	0	they removed the silence friends do they insert some kind of a marker so the the recognize or noses knows when it's time to back trace or something 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1229	3220.41	3221.03	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	well see they i i think there 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1230	3221.03	3222.08	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i i think there 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1231	3223.76	3228.69	B	Professor	h|s^no	-1	0	um i don't know the the specifics of how they're doing it they're 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1232	3228.69	3238.58	B	Professor	s	-1	0	how they're doing it they're they're getting around the way to recognize it works because they're not allowed to um change the script to recognize or i believe so 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1233	3236.14	3236.72	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	to recognize 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1235	3239.03	3241.31	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	maybe the disconcerting some dummy frames uh 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1234	3238.58	3239.0	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	maybe the disconcerting some i believe so 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1236	3239.23	3243.75	B	Professor	s	-1	0	maybe the disconcerting some dummy frames uh you know that's what i had thought but 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1237	3244.09	3245.48	B	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	i don't i don't think they are 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1238	3245.74	3246.19	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	are me it's 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1239	3246.56	3250.43	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	me it's sort of what would i do what i had imagined would happen is that on the other side yeah you 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1240	3250.43	3250.57	B	Professor	b	-1	0	side yeah you 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1241	3250.57	3252.96	B	Professor	s	-1	0	side yeah you put some low level noise or something 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1242	3253.51	3254.49	B	Professor	s	-1	0	predawn all zeros stricter 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1244	3254.76	3255.19	A	PhD	b	-1	0	zeros stricter something like service 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1243	3254.57	3256.05	B	Professor	s	-1	0	zeros stricter something like service but 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1245	3256.05	3259.9	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but but you know put some epsilon dinner some grants 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1246	3257.23	3257.57	A	PhD	b	-1	0	but you know 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1247	3259.9	3260.16	B	Professor	s^fa	-1	0	dinner some grants that's one random 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1248	3260.36	3262.4	B	Professor	s	-1	0	some constant that's one random variable in or something 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1249	3262.43	3263.45	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	some constant actor

Bro004.B.dialogueact1251	3264.62	3268.27	B	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	or something not a consular that doesn't i still like to divide by the variance of that but i mean it's 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1253	3268.27	3268.89	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	that but i mean it's 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1254	3270.22	3271.83	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	track but 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1255	3272.03	3272.65	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	something that what i mean 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1256	3272.65	3276.26	A	PhD	s	-1	0	something that what i mean it's something that is very distinguishable from speech so that uh 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1257	3275.19	3275.69	B	Professor	b	-1	0	from speech 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1258	3276.61	3279.91	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	so that uh silence model in each to cable always pick it up 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1259	3280.29	3280.5	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah so i i 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1260	3280.5	3282.7	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah so i i that's what i thought they would do 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1261	3283.16	3287.77	B	Professor	s	-1	0	or else uh um maybe there is some indicator tell start and stop i don't 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1262	3287.77	3288.27	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	and stop i don't know but whatever they 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1263	3288.57	3288.98	A	PhD	b	-1	0	know but whatever they 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1264	3288.57	3292.37	B	Professor	s	-1	0	know but whatever they did i mean they have to play within the rules of the specific various 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1265	3291.68	3292.04	A	PhD	b	-1	0	specific various 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1266	3293.74	3294.83	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we and find out 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1267	3295.68	3299.52	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	you got to do something otherwise if it's just a bunch of speech stuck together no 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1268	3299.87	3300.36	B	Professor	s^ar.%--	-1	0	together no there 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1269	3301.36	3301.53	A	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro004.B.dialogueact1270	3302.42	3303.11	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	it would do badly and didn't did badly right 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1272	3303.47	3304.21	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah and didn't did badly right so they did something 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1271	3303.11	3304.0	B	Professor	s^df^e	-1	0	yeah and didn't did badly right so they did something 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1273	3304.0	3304.23	B	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	yeah so they did something 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1274	3304.23	3304.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah so they did something 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1275	3304.99	3305.81	A	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah yeah so they did something 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1276	3306.59	3306.88	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro004.B.dialogueact1277	3308.62	3311.26	B	Professor	h|s^bk^tc	-1	0	so okay so i think 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1278	3311.26	3313.91	B	Professor	s	-1	0	okay so i think this brings me up to date a bit 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1279	3314.01	3316.23	B	Professor	s	-1	0	play brings other people it is a bit and 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1280	3316.48	3323.46	B	Professor	h|s^cs	-1	0	and um uh i want to look at these numbers a little bit and think about 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1281	3323.46	3327.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	bit and think about it and talk with everybody uh outsiders meeting 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1282	3328.06	3329.43	B	Professor	h	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro004.B.dialogueact1283	3331.98	3337.77	B	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	i mean it sounds like i mean they're they're they're the usual number of of little little problems and bucks and so forth but sounds 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1284	3337.77	3339.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so forth but sounds like you're getting ironed out now where 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1285	3339.34	3346.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	now where seen any kind of in a position to actually uh look at stuff and and compare things like that's 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1286	3346.36	3347.86	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	like that's that's pretty good 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1287	3348.97	3350.62	B	Professor	s^no.%--	-1	0	i don't know what the 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1288	3351.24	3361.87	B	Professor	s	-1	0	one of the things i wonder about coming back to the first results you talked about is is how much uh things could be helped by any more parameters

Bro004.G.dialogueact1333	3456.09	3456.94	G	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and i think it 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1334	3458.18	3464.51	B	Professor	s	+1	1	we have these little tiny i've been machines that might someday grew up to be a big i. b. m. machine got 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1335	3464.67	3466.18	B	Professor	s	+1	1	got slots for eight 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1336	3467.06	3469.08	B	Professor	h|s	-1	0	uh i mean was donating five i think we only got two 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1337	3469.08	3470.97	B	Professor	s	+1	1	i think we only got two so far 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1338	3471.83	3472.83	B	Professor	s	-1	0	processors 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1339	3473.61	3475.96	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we originally hope you're getting eight hundred megahertz processors interrupting 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1340	3475.96	3477.19	B	Professor	s	-1	0	megahertz processors interrupting five fifty so 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1341	3477.93	3483.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so instead of having a processors that were eight hundred megahertz going to put two that are are fifty megahertz and more 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1342	3483.82	3485.26	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and more are supposed to come soon and there's only modern 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1343	3485.26	3487.19	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and there's only modern honesty uh memory so i don't think 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1344	3487.19	3496.81	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so i don't think anybody has been sufficiently excited by that too spend much time with it but 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1345	3496.96	3502.95	B	Professor	s	-1	0	with it but um hopefully they'll get us some more parts food 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1346	3502.95	3503.08	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	food 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1347	3504.43	3505.23	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	uh yeah i think that would be once we get a populated 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1348	3505.23	3507.48	B	Professor	s	-1	0	be once we get a populated that'll be nice machine i mean we will ultimately 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1349	3507.48	3509.73	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean we will ultimately getting processors in there 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1350	3510.6	3513.31	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and uh and uh a nice amount of memory uh so it'll 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1351	3513.6	3516.18	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh so it'll be a pretty fast linux machine and 
Bro004.G.dialogueact1352	3516.82	3521.05	G	Grad	s^cs^rt	-1	0	and if we can do things on linux some of the machines we have going already like sweet um 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1353	3521.41	3521.91	B	Professor	b	-1	0	um 
Bro004.G.dialogueact1354	3521.99	3523.91	G	Grad	s	-1	0	um it seems pretty fast 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1355	3524.22	3524.7	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bro004.G.dialogueact1356	3524.74	3526.62	G	Grad	s^bu^rt	-1	0	yeah i think so i just pretty fast too 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1357	3528.0	3530.48	B	Professor	s^bk|s^cs	+1	2	i mean you can check with uh the johnson they definitely it 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1358	3530.48	3532.98	B	Professor	s	-1	0	johnson they definitely it it's i think the machines just sitting there 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1359	3533.49	3535.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and it does have two processors you know and 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1360	3535.28	3535.6	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	you know and 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1361	3535.6	3541.92	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	3	you know and so they could do yeah uh check out uh the multi spreading libraries and 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1362	3541.92	3543.94	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	libraries and i mean it it's possible that the 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1363	3543.94	3554.11	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	3	that the and i guess the prudent thing to do would be for somebody to do the work on i'm getting our code running on that machine two processes even though there are times great it's there's 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1364	3554.36	3556.99	B	Professor	s	+1	2	it's there's there's going to be the bucking hassles 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1365	3557.66	3561.1	B	Professor	s	+1	2	and then we'd be set for when we did have five or eight that would really be useful 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1366	3562.14	3564.9	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	1	what i said somebody 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1367	3564.9	3567.52	B	Professor	s	+1	1	i said somebody mm had had the direction that's one thing you 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1368	3567.52	3569.08	B	Professor	s	+1	1	the direction that's one thing you don't get these recordings tempting to 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1369	3569.08	3571.01	B	Professor	s	-1	0	tempting to to get the visuals but it's 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1370	3571.01	3571.21	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	it's 
Bro004.G.dialogueact1371	3571.94	3580.45	G	Grad	qr	-1	0	it's it um mostly um be doing that work training today um the funniest down or a d. h. became friends that's funny so 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1372	3581.19	3582.12	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh i think yeah uh 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1373	3582.5	3585.54	B	Professor	h|qy^d^rt	-1	0	uh they're right i mean i think you're 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1374	3585.54	3587.4	B	Professor	s	-1	0	they're right i mean i think you're you're sort of held up at both right it if 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1375	3587.45	3587.83	B	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	at both right it if 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1376	3587.93	3592.97	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	at both right it if the if and they're on the trainings were a hundred times faster you still wouldn't be anything 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1377	3593.24	3594.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	refreeze a hundred times faster because you 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1378	3594.59	3597.26	B	Professor	s	-1	0	faster because you you education 
Bro004.D.dialogueact1379	3595.61	3596.03	D	PhD	b	-1	0	you education

Bro004.B.dialogueact1383	3598.86	3601.29	B	Professor	s^bu^rt	-1	0	put a c. h. e. k. i mean i think they're both it sounded like a roughly equal so that's all right 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1384	3601.63	3602.22	B	Professor	qy^g^rt	-1	0	so that's all right

Bro004.G.dialogueact1388	3608.02	3609.93	G	Grad	s	-1	0	unseat sweden fights already running with it so 
Bro004.G.dialogueact1389	3609.93	3619.39	G	Grad	s^rt	+1	1	already running with it so um i could try to get um the train easy whenever training to c. k. stuff running under linux at the start with them when they which one i should take for instance 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1390	3620.18	3621.16	B	Professor	h|s	+1	2	uh probably the that because probably 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1391	3621.16	3624.13	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	because probably it's it's it's um well i

Bro004.B.dialogueact1394	3627.49	3631.93	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	h. c. k. we use for um this or or stuff 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1395	3632.39	3639.5	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	um um i think it's not clear yet what we're going to use for trainings uh 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1396	3639.6	3640.33	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh well 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1397	3640.68	3642.52	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	well a train is uh is 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1398	3642.52	3645.3	B	Professor	qr	-1	0	is uh is it the training that takes the time at the decoding uh 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1399	3645.67	3647.88	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	uh is body cool between the two

Bro004.B.dialogueact1414	3668.09	3669.78	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	you would think that would fairly trivial e. 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1415	3670.96	3671.95	B	Professor	s	-1	0	the training would anyway the 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1416	3671.95	3677.18	B	Professor	s	-1	0	training would anyway the the testing uh i don't think would paralyze all that well but i think that 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1417	3677.18	3683.79	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but i think that you could certainly do distributed sort of in those

Bro004.B.dialogueact1419	3687.22	3689.16	B	Professor	s	-1	0	be tricky to paralyze but you could 
Bro004.B.dialogueact1420	3689.62	3691.83	B	Professor	s	-1	0	they have uh they but you could split up the sentences and test that 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1421	3691.11	3693.21	A	PhD	s	-1	0	they have uh they have a thing for doing that and they have for and test that 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1422	3693.21	3695.13	A	PhD	s	-1	0	that and they have for a while in h. k. and 
Bro004.A.dialogueact1424	3695.77	3697.85	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and you can paralyze the training

Bro004.A.dialogueact1425	3698.49	3699.86	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and running and several machines and it

Bro004.A.dialogueact1427	3699.86	3701.37	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and several machines and it just basically keeps counts and then there's something
