Bed011.C.dialogueact0	4.89	7.35	C	Grad	z	-1	0	no can you give me the uh remote 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1	46.77	48.83	D	Professor	z	-1	0	going okay okay so even could you read your numbers you know 
Bed011.A.dialogueact2	48.06	48.6	A	Grad	z	-1	0	okay read your numbers you know 
Bed011.A.dialogueact4	48.99	49.26	A	Grad	z	-1	0	okay read your numbers you know 
Bed011.D.dialogueact3	48.83	49.03	D	Professor	z	-1	0	okay read your numbers you know 
Bed011.C.dialogueact5	92.47	92.77	C	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed011.D.dialogueact6	93.38	94.18	D	Professor	s^co	-1	0	yeah it started um 
Bed011.D.dialogueact7	95.02	97.28	D	Professor	h|s	-1	0	hopefully nancy come not she won't 
Bed011.D.dialogueact8	97.28	98.01	D	Professor	s	-1	0	come not she won't 
Bed011.B.dialogueact9	100.66	108.07	B	Grad	fg|qy.%--	-1	0	uh well about to uh have any way to turn off your uh screensaver on there so it's not going off every uh seems to have about 
Bed011.B.dialogueact10	108.07	109.7	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	seems to have about a two minute yeah 
Bed011.C.dialogueact11	109.89	112.77	C	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	a two minute yeah i i uh it's not that i didn't try 
Bed011.B.dialogueact12	113.283	113.663	B	Grad	b	-1	0	and 
Bed011.C.dialogueact13	114.017	119.357	C	Grad	s	-1	0	okay um i i told it to stay on for ever and ever but if it's not like and it just doesn't open like man has a 
Bed011.B.dialogueact14	119.13	119.33	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay man has a 
Bed011.C.dialogueact15	119.736	120.396	C	Grad	s	-1	0	okay man has a mind 
Bed011.B.dialogueact16	121.971	122.771	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	one second sir 
Bed011.C.dialogueact18	122.26	124.88	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i just sort of keep really one second sir 
Bed011.E.dialogueact17	122.2	123.19	E	Undergrad	s^e	-1	0	i just sort one second sir 
Bed011.B.dialogueact19	125.076	125.566	B	Grad	s^bk.x	-1	0	yeah 
Bed011.C.dialogueact20	128.657	134.057	C	Grad	s	-1	0	but uh we just be mm mm working on it that intensity so it doesn't happen let's see 
Bed011.C.dialogueact21	134.057	134.417	C	Grad	b	-1	0	let's see 
Bed011.C.dialogueact22	137.007	138.537	C	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	three times right into yeah 
Bed011.D.dialogueact23	139.09	139.3	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	i think 
Bed011.C.dialogueact24	139.922	140.902	C	Grad	qy.%--	-1	0	i think so 
Bed011.D.dialogueact25	139.96	140.46	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i think so 
Bed011.C.dialogueact26	141.4	148.11	C	Grad	s	+1	1	so what i've tried to do here is this all the decision knows that we have identified on this site 
Bed011.C.dialogueact27	149.26	157.07	C	Grad	s	+1	0	commented and what they're about and sort of the proper keys we may give them 
Bed011.C.dialogueact28	158.24	167.75	C	Grad	s	+1	0	and yeah i'd be uh half to be implemented it's our data connection 
Bed011.C.dialogueact29	168.51	171.61	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so oh these tasks 
Bed011.C.dialogueact30	172.72	179.31	C	Grad	s	-1	0	reading is out of these tasks more or less imply that the user wants to go there sometime or the other 
Bed011.C.dialogueact31	180.691	189.39	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and that i guess be for example here we have eve uh intention and 
Bed011.C.dialogueact32	189.89	199.403	C	Grad	s	+1	1	and these uh data tasks where we can assume the person would like to enter you or just approach the thing guess the 
Bed011.C.dialogueact33	199.403	202.38	C	Grad	s	-1	0	guess the the same on the object information we 
Bed011.C.dialogueact34	203.04	209.18	C	Grad	s	-1	0	can see that you know we have so created these tasks before we came up with our discussion notes so there's a lot of 
Bed011.C.dialogueact35	209.18	218.46	C	Grad	s	+1	1	so there's a lot of things well we have no in that i guess asks and that may or may not be a problem we could change 
Bed011.C.dialogueact36	218.46	227.401	C	Grad	s	+1	0	problem we could change the tasks like see if we feel that we should have stayed at fort sort of for every decision no it's uh trenton 
Bed011.C.dialogueact37	227.401	238.07	C	Grad	s	+1	1	it's uh trenton and and the intentional score scoring to place now going to place later on this intro trying to 
Bed011.C.dialogueact38	238.07	244.4	C	Grad	s	-1	0	trying to and attention of going sometime on the next four or the next day or whenever i think 
Bed011.D.dialogueact39	244.039	244.439	D	Professor	b	-1	0	i think 
Bed011.C.dialogueact40	244.79	246.69	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i think that might be over yeah so 
Bed011.D.dialogueact41	244.93	246.73	D	Professor	b	-1	0	i think that might be over yeah so 
Bed011.D.dialogueact42	246.96	248.67	D	Professor	s^t	-1	0	yeah so like pop up a level 
Bed011.D.dialogueact43	249.47	254.55	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and uh it's just make sure that we're all oriented the same so 
Bed011.D.dialogueact44	254.96	260.06	D	Professor	s^t	+1	0	the same so what we're doing do today is two related things uh one 
Bed011.D.dialogueact45	260.48	278.41	D	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	uh one of them is too who work on the semantics of the bullies nets which is going to be the main inference engine for the the system uh making decisions and decisions 
Bed011.D.dialogueact46	278.48	286.76	D	Professor	s	+1	1	and decisions are going to turn out to be parameter choices four calls on other modules 
Bed011.D.dialogueact47	287.12	296.85	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so if the natural language understanding thing is uh we think the only have to choose parameters but you know fairly large set of parameters 
Bed011.D.dialogueact48	297.2	301.3	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so to do that we need to to to think one of which is 
Bed011.D.dialogueact49	301.3	306.6	D	Professor	s	-1	0	one of which is figure out what all's the choices are what we've done a fair amount 
Bed011.D.dialogueact50	307.1	309.61	D	Professor	s	-1	0	then we need to figure out what influences choices and finally 
Bed011.D.dialogueact51	309.61	316.58	D	Professor	s	-1	0	choices and finally get to do some technical work on the actual belief relations and presumably estimate the probability and stuff we are can 
Bed011.D.dialogueact52	316.58	319.38	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and stuff we are can do be probabilities stuff today technical 
Bed011.D.dialogueact53	319.78	323.7	D	Professor	s	-1	0	technical stuff will do another day probably 
Bed011.D.dialogueact54	323.79	324.61	D	Professor	s	-1	0	another day probably next week 
Bed011.D.dialogueact55	325.52	332.26	D	Professor	s	-1	0	bought we are going to worry about all the decisions and the things that the that contribute to them and 
Bed011.D.dialogueact56	332.69	341.71	D	Professor	s	+1	1	them and we're also sort of it in the same process going to work with say on what there should be in the dialogue so 
Bed011.D.dialogueact57	341.71	354.63	D	Professor	s	-1	0	the dialogue so one of the steps coming up real soon used to actually get subjects uh in here and have them i actually record like this 
Bed011.D.dialogueact58	355.31	356.97	D	Professor	s	-1	0	uh record dialogues more less 
Bed011.D.dialogueact59	357.56	366.83	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and depending on what phase sort of provokes them to say we'll get information on different sects 
Bed011.C.dialogueact61	367.34	369.74	C	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	well how people phrase different attention smarter so for get people with 
Bed011.D.dialogueact60	367.24	367.58	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	well how people phrase so 
Bed011.D.dialogueact62	369.05	370.71	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	smarter get people with the phrase them and so 
Bed011.C.dialogueact63	369.74	369.9	C	Grad	qy^d^g	-1	0	smarter get people with 
Bed011.D.dialogueact64	370.71	382.32	D	Professor	s	-1	0	the phrase them and so uh for you know keith and people worrying about what constructions people use um we have so many we have some ways to affect that mall i need the way the dialogues go 
Bed011.D.dialogueact65	383.077	395.487	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so what robert kindly did is to lay out a table of the colleen means of uh things that that might come up 
Bed011.D.dialogueact66	396.292	399.518	D	Professor	s	-1	0	the kinds of decisions so the 
Bed011.D.dialogueact67	399.518	408.42	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so the uh uh on the last our decision nodes discrete values so if 
Bed011.D.dialogueact68	408.56	417.56	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so if if we're right you can get by with um just this middle column worth of decisions and it's not all 
Bed011.D.dialogueact69	417.56	423.02	D	Professor	s	-1	0	decisions and it's not all that many and it's perfectly feasible technically to build believe that's that will do that and he has a handout 
Bed011.D.dialogueact70	423.02	424.02	D	Professor	s	-1	0	he has a handout 
Bed011.C.dialogueact71	425.53	425.87	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	yeah 
Bed011.C.dialogueact72	426.32	430.47	C	Grad	s	-1	0	maybe it was too fast punching and every cause react to updates and you can yeah 
Bed011.D.dialogueact73	428.912	429.132	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	and every cause react to updates yeah 
Bed011.C.dialogueact74	430.55	432.42	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and you can look at this if you want these are 
Bed011.C.dialogueact75	432.49	436.62	C	Grad	s	-1	0	want these are what our subjects going to have to physiology any 
Bed011.C.dialogueact76	436.62	441.51	C	Grad	s	-1	0	any comments i can can still be made in the changes would be put in correspondent let me 
Bed011.E.dialogueact77	437.91	523.43	E	Undergrad	b	-1	0	Yes
Bed011.C.dialogueact78	441.813	443.693	C	Grad	s	-1	0	let me some rice and two sentences may need 
Bed011.C.dialogueact79	443.693	447.523	C	Grad	s.x	-1	0	okay may need for you best benefit too but we have not heard about the data collection at all or have you heard 
Bed011.A.dialogueact80	446.596	447.086	A	Grad	b.x	-1	0	okay the data collection at all or have you heard 
Bed011.C.dialogueact81	447.523	448.533	C	Grad	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	not at all or have you heard about it 
Bed011.A.dialogueact82	448.94	449.46	A	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	not that much and about it 
Bed011.A.dialogueact84	449.46	449.78	A	Grad	%--	-1	0	that much and 
Bed011.C.dialogueact83	449.173	449.433	C	Grad	s^bk^m	-1	0	that much and 
Bed011.C.dialogueact85	450.253	451.893	C	Grad	s	+1	0	okay we were going to put this in front of people they 
Bed011.C.dialogueact86	451.893	453.913	C	Grad	s	-1	0	this in front of people they give us some information on themselves 
Bed011.A.dialogueact87	454.64	455.03	A	Grad	b	-1	0	then then 
Bed011.C.dialogueact88	455.023	460.733	C	Grad	s	+1	1	then they would read uh task where there's a german words sort of thrown in between 
Bed011.C.dialogueact89	462.11	465.5	C	Grad	s	+1	1	and um and they have three isolated proper names 
Bed011.C.dialogueact90	466.77	468.27	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	and these change i don't see a release 
Bed011.D.dialogueact91	466.893	469.6	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	and these change no this is not i don't see a release 
Bed011.C.dialogueact92	469.312	470.662	C	Grad	s	-1	0	no this is not the release from this the but okay 
Bed011.C.dialogueact93	470.662	472.522	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	the release from this the speaker information form the release but okay fine okay 
Bed011.D.dialogueact94	470.715	471.025	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	the release from this the speaker information but okay fine okay 
Bed011.D.dialogueact95	471.025	471.685	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	speaker information fine okay 
Bed011.D.dialogueact96	471.865	472.155	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	speaker information form the release fine okay 
Bed011.C.dialogueact97	472.772	474.552	C	Grad	s	-1	0	form the release form is over there in the box are trying to 
Bed011.D.dialogueact98	474.59	475.12	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	the box are trying to 
Bed011.C.dialogueact99	475.454	489.87	C	Grad	s	+1	3	and then they going to have to um she was from one of these tasks which are listed here 
Bed011.C.dialogueact100	490.2	491.58	C	Grad	s	-1	0	they they pick a couple say 
Bed011.C.dialogueact101	491.91	494.87	C	Grad	s	-1	0	a couple say three uh uh a sixty an effect 
Bed011.C.dialogueact102	495.48	500.56	C	Grad	s	+1	0	six different things they sort of think they would do if they were in heidelberg or driving someplace 
Bed011.C.dialogueact103	501.79	504.92	C	Grad	h|s	+1	1	and um and they have a map 
Bed011.B.dialogueact104	506.23	506.86	B	Grad	b	-1	0	like 
Bed011.C.dialogueact105	506.98	507.49	C	Grad	s	-1	0	like this very sketchy 
Bed011.C.dialogueact106	507.56	509.26	C	Grad	s	+1	1	this very sketchy simplified map and they can take 
Bed011.C.dialogueact107	509.63	511.07	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and they can take notes on that map and 
Bed011.C.dialogueact108	511.91	516.47	C	Grad	s^j	+1	1	and then they called this computer system works perfectly yeah in a sense everything 
Bed011.A.dialogueact109	514.392	514.702	A	Grad	b	-1	0	works perfectly 
Bed011.C.dialogueact110	517.52	518.55	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bed011.B.dialogueact112	519.48	520.97	B	Grad	s^j	-1	0	is a fictional system to come 
Bed011.C.dialogueact111	519.47	523.23	C	Grad	s	-1	0	is a fictional system to come yeah the computer systems it's right in front of you that's insane yes i 
Bed011.B.dialogueact113	521.74	521.96	B	Grad	qy^d^g	-1	0	yeah the computer systems 
Bed011.C.dialogueact114	523.23	524.17	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	of you that's insane but she does know yes i i understand everything 
Bed011.E.dialogueact115	523.86	525.3	E	Undergrad	s^j	-1	0	of you that's insane but she does know everything yes i i understand everything yes i do 
Bed011.D.dialogueact116	524.47	525.65	D	Professor	s^j	-1	0	but she does know everything i understand everything yes i do 
Bed011.E.dialogueact117	525.56	526.17	E	Undergrad	s^aa	-1	0	and she has everything yes i do 
Bed011.C.dialogueact118	526.347	530.107	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and she has a way off making this machine talk so she can 
Bed011.C.dialogueact119	530.457	534.917	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so she can copy sentences into a window or type pretty fast and 
Bed011.C.dialogueact120	534.917	538.717	C	Grad	s	-1	0	pretty fast and the fishing boat use speech synthesis to produce that so if 
Bed011.C.dialogueact121	538.717	545.847	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	produce that so if you ask older i get to the castle then i'm several seconds later become harder you're in art that they've got to that castle is a 
Bed011.B.dialogueact123	546.21	546.46	B	Grad	b	-1	0	okay 
Bed011.C.dialogueact122	546.147	546.457	C	Grad	qy^f^rt	-1	0	okay 
Bed011.C.dialogueact124	547.047	550.257	C	Grad	s	+1	0	and um and then after three test the system breaks down 
Bed011.C.dialogueact125	551.043	554.063	C	Grad	s	+1	1	in fate comes on the phone as a human operator 
Bed011.C.dialogueact126	555.33	557.95	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and so sorry this is broke down but let's continue 
Bed011.C.dialogueact127	558.26	569.835	C	Grad	s	-1	0	okay and recent of get the idea what people do when they think they speak to a machine and what people say when they think they speak to you or know or assume speak to him 
Bed011.A.dialogueact128	566.399	566.759	A	Grad	b	-1	0	okay or know 
Bed011.A.dialogueact129	567.624	567.844	A	Grad	b	-1	0	or assume 
Bed011.B.dialogueact130	567.64	568.07	B	Grad	b	-1	0	or assume speak to 
Bed011.B.dialogueact131	568.07	568.45	B	Grad	b	-1	0	speak to 
Bed011.C.dialogueact132	570.94	572.17	C	Grad	s^bs	-1	0	that's the day that connection 
Bed011.C.dialogueact133	573.04	578.133	C	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	+1	2	and um and they have some thirtysomething signed up something 
Bed011.C.dialogueact134	578.303	578.843	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	something 
Bed011.E.dialogueact135	578.924	579.084	E	Undergrad	s^aa	+1	0	something 
Bed011.C.dialogueact137	580.22	586.71	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and they're through all them are going 
Bed011.E.dialogueact136	579.914	581.284	E	Undergrad	s	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed011.C.dialogueact138	586.71	588.66	C	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	through all them are going to start tomorrow at three four 
Bed011.C.dialogueact139	588.76	589.06	C	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	three four one oh 
Bed011.C.dialogueact140	589.33	589.62	C	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	one oh 
Bed011.E.dialogueact141	589.605	590.255	E	Undergrad	s^rt.%--	-1	0	one oh well we don't know for 
Bed011.E.dialogueact142	590.255	591.505	E	Undergrad	s^no	-1	0	well we don't know for sure because 
Bed011.E.dialogueact143	591.765	593.535	E	Undergrad	s^e	-1	0	okay run sure because i don't know whether that person is coming out but 
Bed011.C.dialogueact144	593.362	593.642	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay run coming out but 
Bed011.C.dialogueact146	593.872	594.852	C	Grad	s	-1	0	okay run force coming out but 
Bed011.E.dialogueact145	593.535	593.695	E	Undergrad	fh	-1	0	okay run coming out but 
Bed011.C.dialogueact147	595.6	604.501	C	Grad	s	+1	1	we're still looking for room and the sixth or because they still the way that conference room behind our backs but 
Bed011.C.dialogueact148	604.841	605.081	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	but there are these 
Bed011.D.dialogueact149	605.6	606.78	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	there are these oh i 
Bed011.D.dialogueact150	606.78	607.88	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	oh i see we have to 
Bed011.D.dialogueact151	608.32	608.93	D	Professor	s	-1	0	yesterday what 
Bed011.D.dialogueact152	608.93	610.74	D	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah i it yesterday what let's let's offline okay 
Bed011.C.dialogueact153	609.62	611.72	C	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah i it is happening dividends let's let's offline okay 
Bed011.C.dialogueact154	612.02	615.91	C	Grad	s	+1	1	and jane and and not uh working on that as we speak 
Bed011.D.dialogueact155	612.86	613.27	D	Professor	b	-1	0	and jane and and 
Bed011.C.dialogueact156	616.56	616.79	C	Grad	s	-1	0	okay 
Bed011.C.dialogueact157	617.26	620.98	C	Grad	s^bs	-1	0	that was the uh uh the data collection in a nut shell 
Bed011.C.dialogueact158	622.29	636.46	C	Grad	h|s.%--	-1	0	and um i can report to so i did this but i also tried to do this so a 
Bed011.C.dialogueact159	636.46	637.6	C	Grad	s^t1.%--	-1	0	so a gun here it's nice 
Bed011.C.dialogueact160	637.6	638.67	C	Grad	qy^t1	-1	0	gun here it's nice wonderful 
Bed011.C.dialogueact161	639.88	646.66	C	Grad	s	+1	1	we get to the uh even at just focusing on on the go there no 
Bed011.C.dialogueact162	647.17	652.36	C	Grad	s	-1	0	uh and then to go see this would be so the reason know and and uh timing no and so forth and 
Bed011.B.dialogueact163	652.079	652.649	B	Grad	b	-1	0	and 
Bed011.C.dialogueact164	652.96	668.55	C	Grad	s	+1	0	and what what happened is that design wise eyed citizen noticed that we can we still got a lot of iris from a lot of points to one of these supper go there you was there goes or a situation no it's so 
Bed011.C.dialogueact165	669.05	672.97	C	Grad	s.%--	+1	0	i came up with a couple of additional notes here where 
Bed011.C.dialogueact166	673.4	680.88	C	Grad	s	-1	0	whether the users fifty or not and what his budget is could be like it's going to result in some financial state of the user 
Bed011.C.dialogueact167	681.24	683.14	C	Grad	qh	-1	0	how much wedding she willing to spend 
Bed011.C.dialogueact168	684.19	684.86	C	Grad	s^bsc	-1	0	what can spend 
Bed011.C.dialogueact169	685.21	690.38	C	Grad	s	-1	0	being the same at this just the money available which may influences whether he wants to go there if it's 
Bed011.C.dialogueact170	690.38	695.8	C	Grad	s^e.%--	-1	0	there if it's your charging tons of daughter for admission or it's going to cost a lot of staff 
Bed011.C.dialogueact171	696.26	696.61	C	Grad	s	-1	0	whatever 
Bed011.C.dialogueact172	697.23	701.1	C	Grad	s^j	-1	0	twenty two million to fight too international space station 
Bed011.C.dialogueact174	701.517	703.75	C	Grad	s	-1	0	not all people can do that 
Bed011.D.dialogueact173	701.056	701.236	D	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed011.C.dialogueact175	704.93	719.73	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so and this actually turned out to be pretty key because having specified sort of these uh this this intermediate level um and sort of noticing that everything that happens here it's 
Bed011.C.dialogueact176	719.94	722.51	C	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	here it's goat or favorite and find one 
Bed011.C.dialogueact177	723.45	727.51	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	is again more or less we have um than the 
Bed011.C.dialogueact178	727.77	736.43	C	Grad	s	-1	0	than the situation no it's contributing to the the end points education goat which contributes to the end point and so forth um 
Bed011.C.dialogueact179	736.87	743.06	C	Grad	s	+1	0	forth um i can outside of prostate science from these two here meaning it golf course goes we had these stop ass everything that comes from situation 
Bed011.C.dialogueact180	743.06	747.28	C	Grad	s	+1	1	everything that comes from situation everything that comes from user goes we had they sent you and 
Bed011.C.dialogueact181	747.7	760.614	C	Grad	s	+1	1	and whatever we specify for these so called keith note or the discourse it comes from the author construction pus or um what contribute to the d. n. d. a tendency to be sub oh no it 
Bed011.C.dialogueact182	761.53	774.38	C	Grad	fh|s	+1	0	and then well just sort of has to watch which find finding deficient no it's so it doesn't make sense to figure out whether he wants to interview are approaching uptake if you never wants to go there in the first place 
Bed011.C.dialogueact183	775.177	778.227	C	Grad	s	-1	0	this makes the design thing fairly simple 
Bed011.C.dialogueact184	779.32	793.84	C	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and um no all that's left to do then is the c. p. t. stick on the show of of a tease for the likelihood of a person having enough money actually wanting to go okay sit across 
Bed011.C.dialogueact185	795.56	797.931	C	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and um 
Bed011.C.dialogueact186	799.895	806.945	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and once um for uh has finished his class work that's what we're going to end up doing you 
Bed011.C.dialogueact187	806.945	809.035	C	Grad	s	-1	0	end up doing you get involved in that process through 
Bed011.C.dialogueact188	810.15	824.27	C	Grad	fh|qh	+1	0	and for no the the question is how much of these decisions do we went to bed in explicitly into all or data collection 
Bed011.C.dialogueact189	825.89	830.96	C	Grad	fh|s.%--	-1	0	and one could sort of think of 
Bed011.C.dialogueact190	833.66	837.19	C	Grad	s	-1	0	you know we could call is c. e. o. of you people visit the zoo we could choose cosby's 
Bed011.C.dialogueact191	837.19	839.68	C	Grad	s	-1	0	we could choose cosby's at the zoo tomorrow so 
Bed011.C.dialogueact192	839.9	843.993	C	Grad	s	-1	0	tomorrow so we have no intention of seeing something but not now but later yeah 
Bed011.D.dialogueact193	841.3	841.53	D	Professor	b	-1	0	no intention of seeing 
Bed011.D.dialogueact194	843.55	843.63	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	now but later yeah 
Bed011.D.dialogueact195	844.13	857.226	D	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	yeah so let's see i i think that from one point of view um all these places are the same so that 
Bed011.D.dialogueact196	857.596	866.59	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so that did that um in terms of the linguistics and stuff there maybe a few different kinds of places so 
Bed011.D.dialogueact197	866.68	876.06	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so i it seems to me is that we ought to decide you know what things are are actually going to matter to us and 
Bed011.D.dialogueact198	876.36	889.97	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and um so the zoo when the university in the castle it's cetera um are all big issue things that um you know have different parts to them and one of them might be fun 
Bed011.C.dialogueact199	887.251	887.641	C	Grad	b	-1	0	you know have different parts 
Bed011.C.dialogueact200	888.914	890.194	C	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah to them and one of them might be fun 
Bed011.C.dialogueact202	890.564	898.22	C	Grad	fg|s^df	-1	0	yeah the the reason why we did it that way as as a reminder is no person is going to do all of them they just going to 
Bed011.D.dialogueact201	890.42	890.79	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	yeah 
Bed011.C.dialogueact203	898.53	901.55	C	Grad	s	-1	0	they just going to select um according to their preferences i yeah i yeah 
Bed011.D.dialogueact204	900.42	900.71	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	um according to their yeah 
Bed011.C.dialogueact205	901.55	905.69	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	preferences i yeah i i usually visits too was i usually visit castle so i usually and 
Bed011.C.dialogueact206	905.99	906.97	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i usually and then like that and right now but 
Bed011.D.dialogueact207	906.13	906.51	D	Professor	s^bk|fg	-1	0	then like that and right now but 
Bed011.D.dialogueact208	906.51	915.23	D	Professor	s	+1	0	then like that and right now but sit the the point is to to get too build a system it's got everything in it that might happen you do one thing to to so redundant 
Bed011.E.dialogueact209	908.884	909.574	E	Undergrad	s^2^bu^rt	-1	0	to to so redundant 
Bed011.D.dialogueact210	915.85	926.05	D	Professor	s	+1	0	thing to to build a system that uh had the most data on a relatively confined set of things you do something else and 
Bed011.D.dialogueact211	926.61	935.29	D	Professor	s	+1	0	and the speech people for example are going to do better if the if things come up uh repeatedly now of 
Bed011.D.dialogueact212	935.69	938.73	D	Professor	s	-1	0	now of course if everybody says exactly same thing it's not interesting 
Bed011.D.dialogueact213	939.53	945.42	D	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	so all things that that there's there's a kind of question of what we're trying to to to accomplish 
Bed011.D.dialogueact214	946.657	954.584	D	Professor	h|s.%--	-1	0	i think my temptation for that they together thing would be to uh you know he's persons 
Bed011.D.dialogueact215	954.584	956.034	D	Professor	s	-1	0	you know he's persons only go do it once you have to worry about them being 
Bed011.D.dialogueact216	956.034	957.554	D	Professor	s	-1	0	you have to worry about them being bored soap 
Bed011.D.dialogueact217	957.554	976.97	D	Professor	s	+1	1	bored soap if it's one service one luxury item you know one biggest place and so forth and so on um my guess is that that the data is going to be easier they had on my 
Bed011.D.dialogueact218	976.97	987.59	D	Professor	s^df.x	+1	1	they had on my porch if it's possible danger that somehow there are certain constructions that people use uh when talking about a museum that they wouldn't talk about with the university and stuff 
Bed011.D.dialogueact219	988.65	995.84	D	Professor	s	-1	0	um but i guess i i my temptation is to go for simpler 
Bed011.D.dialogueact220	997.118	998.758	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	know less variation by what 
Bed011.D.dialogueact221	998.758	1001.28	D	Professor	s^no.%--	-1	0	variation by what other people think about this in terms of 
Bed011.B.dialogueact223	1002.7	1004.59	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so i don't exactly understand like i 
Bed011.D.dialogueact222	1002.25	1003.31	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	so i don't exactly understand 
Bed011.B.dialogueact224	1004.59	1011.2	B	Grad	s	-1	0	like i i i guess we're trying to women detail of our on college is types of places that someone could go right but who 
Bed011.B.dialogueact225	1011.2	1011.52	B	Grad	qy^d^g	-1	0	right but who 
Bed011.B.dialogueact226	1011.52	1013.28	B	Grad	qw	-1	0	right but who is it that has to care about this or what components 
Bed011.B.dialogueact227	1013.28	1014.59	B	Grad	qrr	-1	0	this or what components oh 
Bed011.D.dialogueact228	1014.82	1014.99	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	oh 
Bed011.D.dialogueact229	1015.08	1018.36	D	Professor	h|s	-1	0	well uh that i think are two places where it comes up one is 
Bed011.D.dialogueact230	1018.53	1025.49	D	Professor	s	-1	0	up one is um in the these people are going to take this and introduce speech with it 
Bed011.B.dialogueact231	1025.62	1026.03	B	Grad	b	-1	0	with it uh lots 
Bed011.D.dialogueact232	1026.48	1036.85	D	Professor	s	-1	0	uh lots of pronunciations of of the same thing are going to give you better data you know a few pronunciations of lots more things 
Bed011.B.dialogueact233	1036.63	1037.09	B	Grad	b	-1	0	more things that's what 
Bed011.D.dialogueact234	1037.55	1038.0	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so that's what 
Bed011.B.dialogueact235	1038.79	1044.19	B	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	so we would rather just yes you have a bunch of people talk about the zoo 
Bed011.B.dialogueact236	1045.84	1055.0	B	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	uh and assume that that will that the construction to use their will give us everything we need to know about the sort of sue castle whatever type things these bigger places yeah that was 
Bed011.D.dialogueact237	1051.71	1051.96	D	Professor	s^2	-1	0	sue 
Bed011.D.dialogueact238	1055.45	1056.89	D	Professor	s^aa|s.%-	-1	0	and that way you get the speech yeah that was the question first 
Bed011.B.dialogueact239	1056.22	1059.68	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and that way you get the speech of people saying zoo over and over again or whatever too the question first yeah yeah so 
Bed011.D.dialogueact240	1057.94	1058.09	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	of people saying zoo over and over again 
Bed011.D.dialogueact241	1059.1	1059.29	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	or whatever too yeah yeah so 
Bed011.B.dialogueact243	1059.96	1060.23	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	or whatever too yeah yeah so this is a question for 
Bed011.D.dialogueact242	1059.66	1059.76	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	or whatever too yeah yeah so 
Bed011.D.dialogueact244	1060.0	1061.49	D	Professor	s	-1	0	this is a question for you and 
Bed011.B.dialogueact245	1061.2	1061.72	B	Grad	b	-1	0	you and 
Bed011.D.dialogueact246	1061.74	1070.14	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	you and you know if we if we do we probably will actually try to uh build a prototype 
Bed011.D.dialogueact247	1071.74	1077.0	D	Professor	s	-1	0	probably we could get by with the prototype only handling a few of them anyway so 
Bed011.D.dialogueact248	1077.97	1080.36	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah so um 
Bed011.C.dialogueact249	1080.95	1085.88	C	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah the this was sort if they sell out different vet tech t. v. t.'s 
Bed011.C.dialogueact250	1086.8	1090.6	C	Grad	s	-1	0	but i think yeah i i got the point and i think i like it we tend 
Bed011.C.dialogueact251	1090.82	1095.03	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i like it we tend to put them into more high rock co session so goto 
Bed011.C.dialogueact252	1095.03	1097.87	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so goto taste name given a choice to 
Bed011.C.dialogueact253	1097.87	1109.06	C	Grad	s	-1	0	given a choice to either the the symphony taebo opera type or the tourists i'd got type weather night except the school type person and they said this is and that's go too big a space this is what i would do 
Bed011.B.dialogueact255	1109.44	1110.19	B	Grad	b	-1	0	this is what i would do then 
Bed011.C.dialogueact254	1109.06	1110.16	C	Grad	s	-1	0	this is what i would do then 
Bed011.C.dialogueact256	1110.65	1114.72	C	Grad	s	-1	0	then we have these six thing and then maybe do something the other day saying 
Bed011.C.dialogueact257	1115.36	1117.2	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so my question is 
Bed011.C.dialogueact258	1120.32	1124.62	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i guess it to some extent we should you we just have to try it out and see if it works it 
Bed011.C.dialogueact259	1124.94	1138.52	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	it works it would be chatting in a innocence and tried to make it so so complex that they even really should schedule on the planet uh more complex thing in terms of 
Bed011.C.dialogueact260	1139.06	1139.6	C	Grad	h	-1	0	okay you 
Bed011.C.dialogueact261	1139.92	1144.09	C	Grad	s	-1	0	okay you know they should get the c. d. that there'd be six things they have to do and they well 
Bed011.C.dialogueact262	1144.77	1147.02	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and they can be done maybe in two days well yeah well i 
Bed011.D.dialogueact263	1144.8	1145.0	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	and they can be done maybe well yeah 
Bed011.D.dialogueact264	1145.36	1145.75	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	can be done maybe yeah 
Bed011.C.dialogueact266	1148.15	1149.3	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so they make these decisions can i go there tomorrow think yeah 
Bed011.D.dialogueact265	1147.75	1148.76	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	so they make these decisions well i think yeah 
Bed011.C.dialogueact268	1149.3	1150.58	C	Grad	qh	-1	0	can i go there tomorrow or your 
Bed011.D.dialogueact267	1148.96	1149.2	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	so they make these decisions can i go there tomorrow think yeah 
Bed011.C.dialogueact269	1150.58	1152.03	C	Grad	s	-1	0	or your influences well i think 
Bed011.B.dialogueact271	1152.3	1152.69	B	Grad	b	-1	0	well i think 
Bed011.D.dialogueact270	1151.82	1151.96	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	influences 
Bed011.D.dialogueact272	1152.72	1156.26	D	Professor	s	-1	0	well i think it's easy enough to set that up if that's your expectations so 
Bed011.D.dialogueact273	1156.26	1165.28	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so the uh system could say well uh would like to to set up your program for two days and i don't berg you know 
Bed011.D.dialogueact274	1165.78	1168.37	D	Professor	s	-1	0	you know the first thing about all the things you might like to do 
Bed011.D.dialogueact275	1170.43	1181.84	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so there i mean it i i'm sure that if if that's what you did then they would start telling you about that and then you could get in too various things about ordering if you wanted 
Bed011.C.dialogueact276	1178.01	1178.44	C	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed011.C.dialogueact277	1180.98	1181.11	C	Grad	b	-1	0	various things about ordering if you wanted 
Bed011.C.dialogueact278	1182.38	1184.32	C	Grad	s^arp	-1	0	no but i think this is part of the instructors dropping that can be done 
Bed011.C.dialogueact279	1184.32	1188.9	C	Grad	s	-1	0	dropping that can be done sort of to say okay now we've picked these six tasks 
Bed011.C.dialogueact280	1189.55	1193.55	C	Grad	s	-1	0	know you you can call the system and have two days 
Bed011.D.dialogueact282	1194.46	1194.68	D	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	okay 
Bed011.C.dialogueact281	1194.46	1195.6	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	okay we have to help we 
Bed011.D.dialogueact283	1194.96	1196.8	D	Professor	s^ar|s^ng	-1	0	okay we have to help we have to decide fables 
Bed011.D.dialogueact284	1196.8	1198.74	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	have to decide fables carry out whatever we decide 
Bed011.D.dialogueact285	1199.07	1203.27	D	Professor	s	-1	0	that we have to decide you know what is the appropriate scenario 
Bed011.D.dialogueact286	1204.23	1205.48	D	Professor	s	-1	0	that's what we're going to talk about that yeah 
Bed011.C.dialogueact287	1204.93	1205.42	C	Grad	b	-1	0	that's what we're going to talk about that yeah 
Bed011.F.dialogueact288	1206.3	1208.28	F	PhD	s^ng	-1	0	@reject@ 
Bed011.F.dialogueact289	1208.28	1213.07	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	yeah but 
Bed011.C.dialogueact290	1213.63	1218.26	C	Grad	s^aap|s^ng	-1	0	yeah but the i don't i'm not really interested in sort of face planning capability but 
Bed011.C.dialogueact291	1218.91	1223.67	C	Grad	qh	-1	0	but it's more the whole do people phrase these pending requests 
Bed011.C.dialogueact292	1224.79	1229.25	C	Grad	qy	-1	0	so i we going to mass great the system just as you said simple response system i have 
Bed011.C.dialogueact293	1229.94	1231.76	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	i have one question i got one response 
Bed011.C.dialogueact294	1232.22	1235.77	C	Grad	qrr	-1	0	or should we allow for it or something that's enough complexity and that 
Bed011.C.dialogueact295	1235.77	1240.56	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and that i i think the data would be nicer if we get temper oh references well so 
Bed011.D.dialogueact296	1240.05	1241.97	D	Professor	qw	-1	0	so keith what do you think 
Bed011.B.dialogueact297	1244.17	1248.07	B	Grad	h|s.%--	-1	0	well um it seems yeah i mean 
Bed011.B.dialogueact298	1248.07	1248.77	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i mean 
Bed011.B.dialogueact299	1251.17	1254.14	B	Grad	s	-1	0	off the top of my head it kind of seems like you're probably just want to you know richard it are more complex stuff 
Bed011.B.dialogueact300	1254.14	1255.63	B	Grad	s	-1	0	are more complex stuff going on people trying 
Bed011.B.dialogueact301	1255.63	1257.55	B	Grad	s	-1	0	going on people trying to do more complex it's things i mean 
Bed011.B.dialogueact302	1257.55	1269.3	B	Grad	s	+1	0	things i mean you know if our goal is to really sort of be able to handle a whole bunch of different stuff than throwing harder situations that people will get them to do more linguistic more interesting linguistics stuff but i mean i'm i'm 
Bed011.B.dialogueact303	1269.3	1270.83	B	Grad	s^no	-1	0	but i mean i'm i'm not really sure 
Bed011.B.dialogueact304	1271.51	1276.62	B	Grad	s	-1	0	uh because i don't fully understand like what our choices are ways to do this year i mean we have tested this 
Bed011.C.dialogueact305	1275.76	1277.47	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	ways to do this year i mean we have tested this and uh you have you heard 
Bed011.C.dialogueact306	1277.47	1279.88	C	Grad	qy^rt.%--	-1	0	and uh you have you heard listen to the first two or the 
Bed011.C.dialogueact307	1279.88	1285.17	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i started two or the as a matter of fact the second person is uh is we're faced with expecting this kind of set up 
Bed011.B.dialogueact309	1285.93	1291.1	B	Grad	s	-1	0	i started to listen to one it was just like um sort of depressing a sort 
Bed011.C.dialogueact308	1285.83	1286.37	C	Grad	%--	-1	0	i started to listen to one it 
Bed011.B.dialogueact310	1291.59	1295.92	B	Grad	s	-1	0	a sort of listen to the beginning part of the person is just sort of reading off a script or something oh 
Bed011.B.dialogueact311	1295.92	1296.01	B	Grad	%--	-1	0	a script or something oh okay that was the first 
Bed011.C.dialogueact312	1296.07	1296.48	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay that was the first 
Bed011.C.dialogueact314	1296.48	1298.07	C	Grad	s	-1	0	okay that was the first subject that person wasn't very good 
Bed011.D.dialogueact313	1296.31	1296.52	D	Professor	b	-1	0	okay that was the first 
Bed011.B.dialogueact315	1297.59	1297.76	B	Grad	b	-1	0	subject person wasn't 
Bed011.D.dialogueact316	1297.59	1298.42	D	Professor	s	-1	0	subject that person wasn't very good 
Bed011.B.dialogueact317	1298.63	1298.83	B	Grad	b	-1	0	that very good 
Bed011.C.dialogueact318	1298.65	1298.85	C	Grad	b	-1	0	that very good 
Bed011.B.dialogueact319	1299.43	1301.01	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	so um and it is 
Bed011.C.dialogueact321	1300.76	1309.06	C	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	and it is already with this it got pretty with this setup and that particular subject it got pretty complex maybe 
Bed011.E.dialogueact320	1300.69	1301.01	E	Undergrad	%-	-1	0	and it is 
Bed011.B.dialogueact322	1306.95	1307.23	B	Grad	b	-1	0	subject 
Bed011.C.dialogueact323	1309.4	1317.53	C	Grad	s^cs	+1	1	maybe i suggest we make some fine tuning of these get sort of run through ten or so subjects and then take 
Bed011.B.dialogueact324	1317.53	1317.92	B	Grad	b	-1	0	and then take 
Bed011.C.dialogueact325	1317.53	1318.66	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and then take a breather and see 
Bed011.C.dialogueact326	1318.66	1324.63	C	Grad	s	+1	1	yeah a breather and see whether we want to make it more complex or not depending on what what sort of results forgetting 
Bed011.B.dialogueact327	1322.52	1322.96	B	Grad	b	-1	0	depending on what what 
Bed011.B.dialogueact328	1324.86	1325.16	B	Grad	fg	-1	0	yeah in fact um forgetting 
Bed011.B.dialogueact329	1325.16	1331.62	B	Grad	s	-1	0	in fact um i and just you know today next couple days going to start really diving into the state i basically 
Bed011.B.dialogueact330	1331.62	1333.18	B	Grad	s	-1	0	into the state i basically look at one of the files you know one of these 
Bed011.B.dialogueact331	1333.18	1334.01	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	you know one of these that you you give me 
Bed011.B.dialogueact332	1334.01	1336.06	B	Grad	s	-1	0	that you you give me those dozens of files and i looked at one of them which is 
Bed011.B.dialogueact333	1336.06	1342.33	B	Grad	s	+1	1	and i looked at one of them which is about ten sentences found fifteen twenty different construction types that we would have to look for in time all right well 
Bed011.B.dialogueact334	1342.33	1344.2	B	Grad	s	-1	0	in time all right well let's start here um 
Bed011.B.dialogueact335	1344.71	1348.07	B	Grad	s	-1	0	um so i haven't really gone into the you know look at all of the stuff that's going on so i don't really 
Bed011.B.dialogueact336	1348.07	1348.8	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so i don't really 
Bed011.B.dialogueact337	1349.87	1353.46	B	Grad	s	-1	0	right i mean once i start doing that i'll have more to say about this okay 
Bed011.D.dialogueact338	1353.58	1353.84	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bed011.C.dialogueact339	1354.48	1355.26	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	and you can always oh did you did say something 
Bed011.D.dialogueact340	1354.77	1366.48	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and you can always oh did you did say something important which is sad um you can probably keep yourself fairly well occupied uh with this simple cases for quite a while 
Bed011.B.dialogueact341	1366.63	1366.86	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	a while 
Bed011.D.dialogueact342	1367.28	1372.47	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	although obviously the so so that's not it does suggest that uh 
Bed011.D.dialogueact343	1373.04	1379.12	D	Professor	s	-1	0	now i have looked at all the data and it's it's actually at least two an amateur quite redundant that it was it was 
Bed011.B.dialogueact345	1379.31	1379.87	B	Grad	b	-1	0	that it was it was 
Bed011.D.dialogueact344	1379.23	1383.97	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i that it was it was very style eyes and quite a lot of people said more or less the same thing 
Bed011.B.dialogueact346	1384.05	1388.81	B	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	um i did sort of scan it at first and noticed that and then looked in detail and one of them but yeah yeah 
Bed011.D.dialogueact347	1386.4	1386.68	D	Professor	b	-1	0	it at first and noticed yeah 
Bed011.B.dialogueact348	1388.81	1389.81	B	Grad	s	-1	0	detail and one of them but yeah i i noticed that too so 
Bed011.D.dialogueact349	1389.88	1392.36	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i i noticed that too so we we we want to do more than that 
Bed011.C.dialogueact350	1393.17	1394.37	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and with this we're getting more no 
Bed011.C.dialogueact352	1394.93	1395.51	C	Grad	s	-1	0	more no question 
Bed011.D.dialogueact351	1394.72	1395.04	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	more no question 
Bed011.D.dialogueact353	1395.84	1396.05	D	Professor	b	-1	0	question so 
Bed011.D.dialogueact354	1396.81	1397.53	D	Professor	%-	-1	0	but we we so 
Bed011.C.dialogueact355	1397.61	1400.96	C	Grad	qy.%--	-1	0	but we we want to get going beyond more which is a well okay so let's 
Bed011.D.dialogueact356	1399.93	1402.04	D	Professor	h|s.%--	-1	0	more which is a well okay so let's let's take i i think your station is 
Bed011.D.dialogueact357	1402.19	1406.32	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i think your station is good which is will do uh uh a batch 
Bed011.D.dialogueact358	1407.24	1407.66	D	Professor	s^f	-1	0	okay 
Bed011.D.dialogueact359	1408.16	1410.01	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	and uh say how long it's going to be

Bed011.E.dialogueact422	1542.78	1542.98	E	Undergrad	fh	-1	0	yeah like a long time but 
Bed011.C.dialogueact425	1543.5	1545.39	C	Grad	s^na	-1	0	it seems like forever when you're doing that but then it turns 
Bed011.D.dialogueact424	1543.47	1543.72	D	Professor	b	-1	0	it seems like 
Bed011.C.dialogueact426	1545.39	1547.78	C	Grad	s	-1	0	that but then it turns out to be three minutes and forty five seconds okay 
Bed011.D.dialogueact427	1545.53	1545.7	D	Professor	b	-1	0	that but then it turns 
Bed011.B.dialogueact429	1547.82	1548.15	B	Grad	b	-1	0	five seconds okay okay i would 
Bed011.D.dialogueact428	1547.75	1548.01	D	Professor	s^am	-1	0	five seconds okay okay i would 
Bed011.D.dialogueact430	1548.28	1548.6	D	Professor	b	-1	0	okay i would 
Bed011.D.dialogueact431	1548.84	1552.08	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	okay i would think people would you know hesitate whatever whatever it is 
Bed011.D.dialogueact432	1552.38	1553.75	D	Professor	s	-1	0	that's whatever it is will will do with it 
Bed011.C.dialogueact433	1553.89	1554.39	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	that's not will will do with it okay 
Bed011.C.dialogueact435	1555.34	1555.96	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so that'll be that'll be 
Bed011.D.dialogueact434	1555.03	1559.12	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so that'll be that'll be um on on the web page

Bed011.D.dialogueact438	1560.99	1569.69	D	Professor	fh|s^tc	+1	1	but yeah so i think it's a good idea to start with these sort of relatively straightforward reese just response system 
Bed011.D.dialogueact439	1570.26	1578.84	D	Professor	s	+1	1	and then if we want to uh get them to start doing uh multiple step planning with a whole bunch of things and then organize them and 
Bed011.D.dialogueact440	1578.84	1580.18	D	Professor	%--	-1	0	organize them and um tell him which things are 
Bed011.D.dialogueact441	1580.18	1582.08	D	Professor	s^e	+1	1	tell him which things are near each other and you 
Bed011.D.dialogueact442	1582.08	1582.53	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	and you 
Bed011.D.dialogueact443	1583.03	1584.01	D	Professor	s	-1	0	know any of that stuff 
Bed011.D.dialogueact444	1585.51	1589.34	D	Professor	fh|s^e	+1	0	you know which things would you like to do tuesday morning

Bed011.C.dialogueact448	1602.62	1603.64	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i need those back by the way

Bed011.D.dialogueact453	1609.43	1610.1	D	Professor	s^fa|qy^br	-1	0	it's the same one that 
Bed011.E.dialogueact454	1610.16	1616.9	E	Undergrad	qy^bu^d^rt	+1	2	that's that maybe one thing we should do is go to this listen sort of select like things that are categories and then offer only one member of that category 
Bed011.D.dialogueact455	1616.9	1618.63	D	Professor	s^na	+1	0	that's what i was suggesting for the first round yeah of that category okay 
Bed011.E.dialogueact456	1618.57	1618.82	E	Undergrad	s^bk	-1	0	round yeah okay 
Bed011.B.dialogueact457	1619.83	1621.38	B	Grad	s^e.%--	-1	0	so rather than having doing and then i mean they could be alternate 
Bed011.E.dialogueact458	1620.83	1627.36	E	Undergrad	s^bu	-1	0	than having doing they could but it but it did maybe yeah but uh and then i mean they could be alternate versions of the same thing cause you want to date on different yeah construction 
Bed011.D.dialogueact459	1623.62	1626.33	D	Professor	s^am.%-	-1	0	they could but it but it did maybe yeah but same thing cause you want to date on different yeah construction

Bed011.E.dialogueact461	1633.25	1636.72	E	Undergrad	s^e.%-	-1	0	you could but but i i i think like one person gets the person with the zoo as a choice and the other person get to 
Bed011.D.dialogueact462	1635.37	1635.65	D	Professor	s^am.%-	-1	0	you could but a choice and the other person

Bed011.C.dialogueact466	1638.27	1639.33	C	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	for the person don't get it i mean 
Bed011.C.dialogueact467	1639.67	1647.51	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	it i mean this is what we did it because when we gave them just three tasks full part paying three test a puppy and well no they can still choose they just wouldn't be able to choose both 
Bed011.D.dialogueact468	1641.83	1641.97	D	Professor	b	-1	0	it because

Bed011.C.dialogueact486	1679.32	1680.75	C	Grad	s	-1	0	you know maybe a bit different and 
Bed011.E.dialogueact487	1680.18	1681.03	E	Undergrad	s^am	-1	0	bit different and and these 
Bed011.C.dialogueact488	1680.75	1686.31	C	Grad	s	-1	0	bit different and and these it just places where you you ensure um much like here 
Bed011.D.dialogueact489	1681.77	1681.94	D	Professor	b	-1	0	and these 
Bed011.C.dialogueact490	1687.18	1688.04	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	but we can uh yeah in fact if if 
Bed011.D.dialogueact491	1688.39	1692.38	D	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	yeah in fact if if if you use the right verb for each common like it you know 
Bed011.D.dialogueact492	1692.38	1695.38	D	Professor	s^e	+1	1	common like it you know i tend to theater symphony or operates as a group and tore 
Bed011.D.dialogueact493	1695.38	1698.18	D	Professor	s^e	+1	1	a group and tore the university counselors zoo all

Bed011.D.dialogueact495	1698.89	1705.77	D	Professor	s	-1	0	all of these do have this kind of who were aspect about the way you would go to them 
Bed011.D.dialogueact496	1706.63	1713.77	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	the movie theaters probably also uh and and it's they're 
Bed011.C.dialogueact497	1712.36	1712.91	C	Grad	s^2	-1	0	and 
Bed011.C.dialogueact498	1713.01	1713.09	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	it's they're 
Bed011.D.dialogueact499	1714.36	1719.39	D	Professor	s	-1	0	they they turn out to be not so many different kinds of things and then 
Bed011.C.dialogueact500	1718.49	1719.57	C	Grad	b	-1	0	kinds of things and then 
Bed011.D.dialogueact501	1719.77	1732.8	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and then what what expect is that that be sentence types would uh the responses would tend to be grouped according to the kind of activity you would expect 
Bed011.B.dialogueact502	1732.95	1733.39	B	Grad	b	-1	0	would expect 
Bed011.F.dialogueact503	1735.28	1742.99	F	PhD	s	+1	0	oh absolutely yeah i mean it seems that uh the difference between going to see something and exact exchange mine you know i know it 
Bed011.D.dialogueact504	1742.25	1742.83	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	oh absolutely yeah know i know it

Bed011.F.dialogueact506	1743.07	1745.61	F	PhD	s.%	-1	0	yeah this is where yeah the the function for the function

Bed011.C.dialogueact508	1745.13	1745.42	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	yeah the the function 
Bed011.C.dialogueact509	1745.42	1751.23	C	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah the the function stuff especially a different than the getting information or 
Bed011.C.dialogueact510	1755.74	1755.98	C	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed011.C.dialogueact511	1756.55	1757.34	C	Grad	s	-1	0	this is open so since 
Bed011.C.dialogueact512	1757.34	1763.68	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so since people going to still take something we we're not going to get any significant amount of redundancy 
Bed011.C.dialogueact513	1764.25	1767.82	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and for reasons we don't want it's ready in that sense 
Bed011.C.dialogueact514	1768.65	1780.41	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and um we would be ultimately more interested in getting all the possible ways of people asking oh for different things with the with the computer and 
Bed011.C.dialogueact515	1781.0	1790.63	C	Grad	s^co	-1	0	so if you can think of any uh other a of high level tasks trust me do just always just me made into awesome though sneaking into collection 
Bed011.C.dialogueact516	1792.06	1794.05	C	Grad	s	-1	0	not that much statistical stuff with it we don't

Bed011.B.dialogueact756	2280.8	2285.23	B	Grad	qy^d^rt	+1	0	i mean you're you're talking about rather than having the user decided this they're supposed to we're supposed to that they use you can always well

Bed011.C.dialogueact758	2285.16	2293.41	C	Grad	s	+1	0	that they use you can always say it but it's just so if we we had over these parameters if we make if we have a feeding that they are important and well 
Bed011.B.dialogueact759	2286.86	2287.33	B	Grad	s	-1	0	say it but it's just so if 
Bed011.D.dialogueact760	2287.55	2287.76	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	but it's just so if

Bed011.C.dialogueact762	2293.79	2299.25	C	Grad	s	+1	1	and that we can x. t. unfair them to a significant decree all we ask and and put yeah and

Bed011.B.dialogueact765	2299.59	2299.88	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	and put yeah and 
Bed011.D.dialogueact764	2299.48	2304.5	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and put yeah and part of the system design is this it looks to be important and you can't figure it out then you ask 
Bed011.C.dialogueact766	2300.0	2300.16	C	Grad	b	-1	0	part of the system design 
Bed011.B.dialogueact767	2304.56	2304.92	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	you ask 
Bed011.D.dialogueact768	2305.17	2308.51	D	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah but please don't ask you know all all these things all the time or 
Bed011.B.dialogueact770	2308.74	2308.99	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah the time or 
Bed011.D.dialogueact769	2308.56	2313.63	D	Professor	s	+1	1	yeah yeah right yeah and the time or it so but there's that that definitely a back off position to ask 
Bed011.B.dialogueact771	2309.1	2309.34	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah right yeah it so 
Bed011.B.dialogueact772	2309.54	2309.87	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah right yeah it so 
Bed011.B.dialogueact773	2309.87	2310.28	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah right yeah it so but there's that that definitely 
Bed011.C.dialogueact774	2313.97	2320.65	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and there's no no part of this system ever comes up with the idea that this could be important no planners ever going to ask for it ask 
Bed011.B.dialogueact775	2320.84	2321.04	B	Grad	b	-1	0	for it you know so 
Bed011.C.dialogueact776	2321.11	2324.46	C	Grad	s^ba.%--	-1	0	you know so and i like the idea that you know sort of jerry push 
Bed011.C.dialogueact777	2324.63	2334.91	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	sort of jerry push the study from the very beginning that part of the understanding business to sort of make a good question of what's the sort of important in this general picture what you need to if

Bed011.C.dialogueact779	2334.91	2338.4	C	Grad	qh	-1	0	you need to if you want a simulated for except for what parameters would you need for this relation 
Bed011.C.dialogueact780	2339.01	2343.68	C	Grad	s	+1	1	i think that would definitely be part of it 
Bed011.C.dialogueact781	2344.12	2344.83	C	Grad	qh^rt	+1	1	costs 
Bed011.C.dialogueact782	2346.23	2347.68	C	Grad	qo^rt	+1	0	the money some money that's money

Bed011.C.dialogueact784	2350.84	2353.28	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	actually maybe assess for okay

Bed011.B.dialogueact787	2358.83	2360.04	B	Grad	s	-1	0	you could say some in there 
Bed011.F.dialogueact788	2361.36	2364.41	F	PhD	s	-1	0	yes it looks a bit pays for me i mean 
Bed011.F.dialogueact789	2364.61	2367.66	F	PhD	s	-1	0	for me i mean it's it's inappropriate does los vegas 
Bed011.F.dialogueact790	2368.37	2372.12	F	PhD	s.x	-1	0	but i i just i kind of how much money i'm going to lose but 
Bed011.F.dialogueact791	2372.86	2377.46	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i think there are different things but it really understand what's what's more that's it 
Bed011.D.dialogueact792	2376.42	2376.95	D	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	i more that's it 
Bed011.D.dialogueact793	2376.95	2379.26	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	i think there are different things where you have much choice for example more that's it 
Bed011.E.dialogueact794	2378.57	2378.86	E	Undergrad	b	-1	0	where you have much choice 
Bed011.B.dialogueact796	2379.56	2379.82	B	Grad	b	-1	0	for example 
Bed011.D.dialogueact795	2379.26	2383.52	D	Professor	qh^e	-1	0	for example uh just interacts with do might you willing to take a taxi

Bed011.D.dialogueact798	2384.58	2393.93	D	Professor	qh^e	-1	0	or uh you know if if you're going too be up or are you going to look for the best seats or the peanut gallery or the best pizza 
Bed011.F.dialogueact799	2391.18	2394.85	F	PhD	s^2	-1	0	okay the best seats or the peanut gallery or you know whatever the best pizza 
Bed011.D.dialogueact800	2393.93	2394.65	D	Professor	qy^f	-1	0	okay peanut gallery or you know whatever 
Bed011.B.dialogueact802	2395.03	2395.4	B	Grad	fg	-1	0	so i think there 
Bed011.D.dialogueact801	2394.65	2395.0	D	Professor	s	-1	0	okay you know whatever so i think there 
Bed011.D.dialogueact803	2395.28	2400.38	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so i think there are a variety of things in which um

Bed011.C.dialogueact811	2411.36	2415.99	C	Grad	s	-1	0	well i i wanted to write uh uh a chart our car cartel for uh student organization and

Bed011.C.dialogueact813	2420.05	2425.42	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and i look at the other ones so they waste ten percent of the student body has to be present at the general meeting otherwise it's not and 
Bed011.C.dialogueact814	2425.94	2430.34	C	Grad	s	-1	0	it's not and i wrote in in in now people that have to be there and 
Bed011.C.dialogueact815	2430.95	2439.28	C	Grad	s	-1	0	there and it was hot they debated that but given agreed with me that everybody probably has a good speeding weather it was a farce the joke or whether there were enough people and if you go to turkey 
Bed011.B.dialogueact816	2438.06	2438.24	B	Grad	b	-1	0	whether there were enough people 
Bed011.C.dialogueact817	2439.28	2444.15	C	Grad	s:qw	-1	0	and if you go to turkey you would find when people go shopping they would say how much you if you want and they said i enough 
Bed011.C.dialogueact818	2444.15	2445.11	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and they said i enough and that and that 
Bed011.C.dialogueact819	2445.43	2448.12	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and that and that this used all over the place because the person 
Bed011.C.dialogueact820	2448.12	2455.11	C	Grad	s	-1	0	because the person setting that you snows you know that person has two kids and a husband that just like cheese so this is enough and 
Bed011.B.dialogueact821	2450.55	2450.8	B	Grad	b	-1	0	you know that person 
Bed011.C.dialogueact822	2455.71	2459.52	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and then said the middle part of is always sort of the the golden way right

Bed011.C.dialogueact824	2460.14	2465.71	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so you can see you can be really make it asked cheapest possible or you can say i wonder is i don't care 
Bed011.B.dialogueact825	2466.7	2467.59	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	money is no object money

Bed011.B.dialogueact844	2502.45	2505.43	B	Grad	s	-1	0	i mean it's so there's a couple of different ways you can interpret these things right you know

Bed011.D.dialogueact1012	2868.4	2873.78	D	Professor	s	+1	1	well the hope is that the par syria itself is uh pretty robust 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1013	2874.31	2876.87	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	right right but it's not popular it's only only

Bed011.B.dialogueact1021	2881.55	2889.03	B	Grad	s^cs^tc	-1	0	um some time i have to talk to some subset of the people in this group at least about um what sort of construction i'm looking for i mean you know obviously like 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1022	2889.03	2897.54	B	Grad	s	-1	0	i mean you know obviously like just again looking at this one uh then you know i saw the things from sort of as general has argument structure construction so you know 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1023	2897.54	2899.54	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so you know i have to do for phrase i have to do 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1024	2899.54	2903.21	B	Grad	s	-1	0	phrase i have to do uh uh went down to dependencies you know which a variety 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1025	2903.21	2905.96	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	you know which a variety of construction in uh in 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1026	2905.96	2906.81	B	Grad	s	-1	0	in uh in statute that 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1027	2907.26	2908.48	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	on the other hand i have to have you know this particular 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1028	2908.48	2919.4	B	Grad	s:qh	-1	0	you know this particular uh fixed expression source of my fixed expressions like cats plus path expression for you know how do how do i get there how do i get in 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1029	2917.63	2917.99	D	Professor	b	-1	0	expression for 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1030	2919.4	2920.01	B	Grad	s:qh	-1	0	get there how do i get in how do i get away right 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1031	2920.01	2920.96	B	Grad	s:qh	-1	0	how do i get away right 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1032	2920.61	2920.79	D	Professor	b	-1	0	how do i get away right 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1033	2921.49	2922.55	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and all that kind of stuff um 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1034	2922.85	2926.29	B	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	of stuff um there's a variety of sort of different sorts of constructions and you know it's sort absolutely 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1035	2924.94	2925.42	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	of sort of different sorts of constructions absolutely 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1036	2926.29	2928.21	B	Grad	s^bu^rt	-1	0	and you know it's sort of like anything goes like okay 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1037	2928.41	2928.77	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	like okay 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1038	2928.96	2931.57	D	Professor	s^bk|s	-1	0	like okay so they said they were going to mainly work on with george 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1040	2932.18	2932.47	B	Grad	b	-1	0	okay and 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1039	2932.17	2933.22	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	okay and he let me 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1041	2933.22	2935.4	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	he let me say what i think is is the the idea 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1042	2935.63	2943.36	D	Professor	s	+1	0	is the the idea is uh first of all i miss spoke when i said we thought you should do the constructions cause apparently for linguist 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1043	2943.36	2946.24	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	cause apparently for linguist that means to do completely perfectly so what 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1044	2946.67	2951.75	D	Professor	s	-1	0	right that's right so what i okay so what what i meant was doing first cut at 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1045	2947.41	2947.98	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	right that's right i 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1046	2951.92	2952.22	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	first cut at okay 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1047	2952.44	2958.97	D	Professor	s^bk|s	+1	2	of course okay because uh we do want to get them perfect i think we're going to have to do first got a lot of them to see how they interact 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1048	2958.1	2958.58	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	of course how they interact 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1049	2959.06	2959.75	B	Grad	fg	-1	0	right exactly know 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1050	2960.02	2961.39	B	Grad	s	-1	0	it we we talked about this before right and it it 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1051	2961.39	2961.58	B	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	before right and it it 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1052	2961.58	2967.36	B	Grad	s	+1	1	before right and it it would be completely out of the question to really do more than say like oh i don't know ten over the summer but uh but yeah 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1053	2966.81	2966.95	D	Professor	b	-1	0	know ten over the summer yeah 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1054	2967.36	2972.45	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but uh but you know obviously we need to get sort of a general view of what things look like so yeah right 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1055	2972.45	2972.62	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	look like so yeah right 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1056	2972.62	2972.91	B	Grad	b	-1	0	look like so yeah right 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1057	2972.67	2972.92	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	look like so yeah right 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1058	2973.19	2976.89	D	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	so the idea is going to be to do 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1059	2976.89	2984.01	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	to do like nancy didn't some of these papers where you do enough of them so you can go from top to bottom so you can do for you 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1060	2984.35	2991.14	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	so you can do for you know if if uh have a complete story overcoats of some piece of dialogue 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1061	2991.31	2991.63	B	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed011.D.dialogueact1062	2992.19	3001.14	D	Professor	s	+1	0	and that's going to be much more useful they and having all of the calls all constructions and nothing else or or or something like that so that they they trick 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1063	2999.63	2999.93	B	Grad	b	-1	0	else or or 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1064	2999.93	3000.26	B	Grad	b	-1	0	else or or or something like that 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1065	3001.15	3001.52	B	Grad	b	-1	0	so that they they trick 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1066	3001.35	3010.42	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	so that they they trick is going to be to to take this and pick a some sort of gladys of construction some some electrical 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1067	3009.14	3009.48	B	Grad	b	-1	0	of construction 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1068	3010.42	3013.55	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	some some electrical in some phrase one and you know whatever you need 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1069	3012.3	3012.7	B	Grad	b	-1	0	one and 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1070	3013.55	3023.81	D	Professor	s	+1	1	you know whatever you need in order to uh be able to ban uh by hand you know explain some fraction of the entrance 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1071	3021.06	3021.57	B	Grad	b	-1	0	know explain 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1072	3022.2	3022.37	B	Grad	b	-1	0	some fraction 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1073	3024.72	3030.51	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and so exactly which ones are partly depend on your research interests and a bunch of other things 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1074	3029.38	3029.73	B	Grad	b	-1	0	and a bunch of other 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1075	3030.66	3030.95	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	things 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1076	3031.59	3031.75	B	Grad	b	-1	0	okay but i mean 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1077	3031.75	3034.95	B	Grad	s	-1	0	okay but i mean in terms of this sort of level of of analysis you 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1078	3034.95	3042.05	B	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	of analysis you know you don't necessarily have to be more complex than like the out of construction and the b. c. p. paper where it's just like you know half a page and you correct oh yeah but half pages is 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1079	3039.87	3040.21	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	the b. c. p. paper where it's just like you know half a correct 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1080	3041.67	3042.17	D	Professor	s^aa.x	-1	0	page and you oh yeah but half pages is 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1081	3042.17	3043.85	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	yeah but half pages is what would like 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1082	3043.76	3044.04	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah what would like and if 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1083	3044.8	3048.03	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and if if there's something that really requires a lot more than that then it does and we have to do it but 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1084	3048.03	3048.78	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and we have to do it but 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1086	3048.82	3049.03	B	Grad	fg	-1	0	and we have to do it but 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1085	3048.78	3049.03	D	Professor	%--	-1	0	and we have to do it but 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1087	3050.9	3052.73	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	for the first cut that should be fine we got 
Bed011.D.dialogueact1088	3052.37	3052.66	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	we got 
Bed011.C.dialogueact1089	3052.9	3059.26	C	Grad	s^cs	+1	0	we got to sit down and think of sort of the the idea ideal speaker to says and i mean 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1091	3059.34	3059.64	B	Grad	b	-1	0	and i mean 
Bed011.C.dialogueact1090	3059.26	3064.65	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and i mean tool or three that funnel each other so 
Bed011.C.dialogueact1092	3064.82	3074.59	C	Grad	s^j	-1	0	each other so where we can also sort of once we have everything up and running showed the tremendous insane inference think everybody teas or system 
Bed011.B.dialogueact1093	3074.83	3075.55	B	Grad	b	-1	0	system so you know 
Bed011.C.dialogueact1094	3075.14	3077.55	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so you know as as the sparkle people have a 
Bed011.C.dialogueact1095	3077.55	3084.19	C	Grad	s	-1	0	people have a extended they more die locke which is near what the system survives and nothing but
