Bmr012.A.dialogueact112	126.578	128.988	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Instead of age put date of {disfmarker} uh year of birth
Bmr012.E.dialogueact113	126.741	126.971	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Sure .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact114	129.188	134.706	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because age will change , but The year of birth changes , you know , stays the same , usually .

Bmr012.D.dialogueact121	138.12	138.59	D	PhD	s^j	-1	0	Not for me .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact122	139.297	143.777	G	Postdoc	s^cs.%-	-1	0	course on the other {disfmarker} on the other hand you could {disfmarker} you view it as the age at the time of the {disfmarker}
Bmr012.C.dialogueact123	140.432	141.082	C	PhD	s	-1	0	On the other side ,
Bmr012.A.dialogueact125	141.612	145.422	A	PhD	s^nd.%-	-1	0	Well the thing is , if ten years from now you look at this form knowing that {disfmarker}
Bmr012.C.dialogueact124	141.482	141.862	C	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact126	144.598	148.408	G	Postdoc	fg|s^df^nd.%-	-1	0	Yes , but what we care about is the age at {disfmarker} at the recording date rather than the {disfmarker}
Bmr012.C.dialogueact128	146.471	147.191	C	PhD	b	-1	0	O yeah .
Bmr012.D.dialogueact127	146.076	147.436	D	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	But there 's no other date on the form .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact129	147.191	149.811	C	PhD	s^j	-1	0	W we don't care how they {disfmarker} old they really are .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact130	147.813	150.673	A	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	Well {disfmarker} well I don't know .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact131	148.958	151.138	G	Postdoc	s^aa|s^j	-1	0	Yes . {vocalsound} Unless we wanna send them a card .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact132	152.48	155.47	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Well I guess it depends on how long the corpus is gonna be collected for .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact134	157.022	157.292	A	PhD	s^t1	-1	0	Anyway .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact133	156.861	157.381	G	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , that 's true .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact135	158.22	159.66	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I still don't see the problem .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact136	158.806	159.316	E	Grad	%--	-1	0	Either way
Bmr012.E.dialogueact137	159.956	161.916	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	yeah I think {disfmarker} I think age is alright
Bmr012.A.dialogueact139	162.083	162.443	A	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact138	161.916	171.087	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and then um there will be attached to this a point or two these forms uh so that you 'll be able to extract the date off that
Bmr012.A.dialogueact140	168.722	169.132	A	PhD	%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact141	172.273	173.083	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	so , anyway .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact142	173.663	180.493	E	Grad	s	-1	0	And so then you also have a digits form which needs to be filled out every time , the speaker form only once , the digit form every time
Bmr012.E.dialogueact143	180.493	184.773	E	Grad	s^co	-1	0	even if you don't read the digits you have to fill out the digits form so that we know that you were at the meeting .

Bmr012.C.dialogueact171	251.76	257.14	C	PhD	s^e	+1	0	which is uh gender - dependent but like no adaptation , no cross - word models , no trigrams {disfmarker}
Bmr012.C.dialogueact172	257.14	258.5	C	PhD	s	+1	0	a bigram recognizer
Bmr012.C.dialogueact173	258.93	261.76	C	PhD	s	+1	1	and that 's trained on Switchboard which is telephone conversations .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact174	262.61	265.933	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Um and thanks to Don 's help wh who {disfmarker}
Bmr012.C.dialogueact175	266.003	270.193	C	PhD	s	+1	0	Don took the first meeting that Jane had transcribed
Bmr012.C.dialogueact176	270.583	277.183	C	PhD	s	+1	0	and um {vocalsound} you know separated {disfmarker} used the individual channels we segmented it in into the segments that Jane had used
Bmr012.C.dialogueact177	277.813	280.883	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and uh Don sampled that so {disfmarker} so eight K
Bmr012.C.dialogueact178	281.723	285.153	C	PhD	fh|s^rt	-1	0	um and then we ran up to I guess the first twenty minutes ,
Bmr012.C.dialogueact179	285.153	287.083	C	PhD	s	-1	0	up to synch time of one two zero zero
Bmr012.C.dialogueact180	287.653	289.103	C	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	so is that {disfmarker} that 's twenty minutes or so ?
Bmr012.C.dialogueact181	289.963	292.463	C	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Um yeah because I guess there 's some ,
Bmr012.E.dialogueact182	290.309	290.779	E	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Or so .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact183	292.463	293.843	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	and Don can talk to Jane about this ,
Bmr012.C.dialogueact184	293.843	297.213	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	there 's some bug in the actual synch time file that ah uh
Bmr012.C.dialogueact185	297.633	300.883	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I 'm {disfmarker} we 're not sure where it came from but stuff after that was a little messier .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact186	301.303	303.263	C	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	Anyway so it 's twenty minutes and I actually
Bmr012.E.dialogueact187	301.507	301.947	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact188	303.543	304.323	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	um

Bmr012.E.dialogueact190	305.536	308.556	E	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	was that {disfmarker} did that {disfmarker} did that recording have the glitch in the middle ?
Bmr012.G.dialogueact191	306.073	306.863	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I 'm puzzled by that .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact192	308.757	309.777	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} oh {disfmarker} oh , I see .

Bmr012.G.dialogueact194	309.977	311.567	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Oh there was a glitch somewhere .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact195	310.931	311.381	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah ,
Bmr012.C.dialogueact196	311.381	312.521	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so that actually
Bmr012.C.dialogueact197	312.591	313.071	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	um
Bmr012.F.dialogueact198	312.642	313.722	F	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Was it twenty minutes in ,
Bmr012.C.dialogueact200	313.221	315.521	C	PhD	s^no	-1	0	if it was twenty minutes in then I don't know
Bmr012.G.dialogueact199	313.033	314.013	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I forgot about that .
Bmr012.F.dialogueact201	313.722	314.022	F	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	I thought {disfmarker}
Bmr012.A.dialogueact203	314.988	315.898	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Well it was interesting ,
Bmr012.G.dialogueact202	314.985	315.585	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	Well , I mean , they {disfmarker}
Bmr012.A.dialogueact206	316.038	320.768	A	PhD	s	+1	0	suddenly {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the overall error rate when we first ran it was like eighty percent
Bmr012.E.dialogueact205	315.925	317.125	E	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I don't remember when it is .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact204	315.585	317.175	G	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	but I was able to can transcribe
Bmr012.A.dialogueact207	321.238	325.098	A	PhD	s	+1	0	but i looking at {disfmarker} the first sentences looked much better than that
Bmr012.A.dialogueact208	325.428	326.858	A	PhD	s	+1	0	and then suddenly it turned very bad
Bmr012.A.dialogueact209	326.858	330.118	A	PhD	s.%-	+1	2	and then we noticed that the reference was always one off with the {disfmarker}
Bmr012.A.dialogueact212	330.688	331.968	A	PhD	s	-1	0	it was actually recognized
Bmr012.C.dialogueact211	330.628	331.288	C	PhD	%	-1	0	Wel
Bmr012.E.dialogueact213	330.758	331.748	E	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	Oh no .
Bmr012.F.dialogueact210	330.584	333.014	F	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , that might be {disfmarker} that might be {disfmarker} that might be my fault .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact214	331.424	333.484	G	Postdoc	s^fe.%	-1	0	Wow .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact215	332.118	332.638	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so
Bmr012.E.dialogueact217	333.021	335.641	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Oh so that was just a parsing mismatch .
Bmr012.F.dialogueact216	333.014	333.414	F	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	I 'm not {disfmarker}
Bmr012.A.dialogueact218	333.599	333.939	A	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact219	333.701	335.201	C	PhD	s^ar.%--	-1	0	No actually it was {disfmarker}
Bmr012.C.dialogueact220	335.251	337.081	C	PhD	fh|s	+1	2	yeah i it was a complicated bug
Bmr012.C.dialogueact221	337.081	340.151	C	PhD	s^df^rt	+1	2	because they were sometimes one off and then sometimes totally random
Bmr012.C.dialogueact222	340.241	340.531	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	so
Bmr012.C.dialogueact226	341.121	341.541	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	um
Bmr012.F.dialogueact224	340.625	343.385	F	Grad	fg|s	+1	0	yeah , I was pretty certain that it worked up until that time ,
Bmr012.G.dialogueact223	340.368	341.038	G	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact225	341.098	341.848	G	Postdoc	%	-1	0	That 's not good .

Bmr012.A.dialogueact230	343.552	344.222	A	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact229	343.515	344.425	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so that 's what we have

Bmr012.F.dialogueact228	343.385	343.995	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	so
Bmr012.C.dialogueact233	344.425	348.295	C	PhD	s	+1	0	but that {disfmarker} that will be completely gone if this synch time problem
Bmr012.G.dialogueact232	344.249	344.609	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact234	346.218	348.562	E	Grad	s	-1	0	The {disfmarker} the glitch
Bmr012.A.dialogueact235	347.112	352.692	A	PhD	s.%-	+1	0	So {disfmarker} so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first uh whatever , up to that time to
Bmr012.G.dialogueact236	347.331	348.371	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And the only glitch {disfmarker}
Bmr012.E.dialogueact238	348.932	349.072	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact237	348.681	348.941	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	yeah .

Bmr012.C.dialogueact244	352.924	355.414	C	PhD	s	-1	0	So here 's the actual copy of the email
Bmr012.G.dialogueact246	353.885	355.025	G	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	we should say something about the glitch .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact247	355.025	356.155	G	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	He {disfmarker} he can say something about the glitch .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact248	355.834	357.074	C	PhD	h|s^bk	-1	0	um oh OK
Bmr012.E.dialogueact249	356.083	356.143	E	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah .

Bmr012.C.dialogueact251	357.164	359.254	C	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	so does this glitch occur at other {disfmarker}
Bmr012.E.dialogueact252	357.876	365.067	E	Grad	s	+1	2	There {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there 's an acoustic glitch that occurs where um the channels get slightly asynchronized
Bmr012.G.dialogueact253	358.595	359.425	G	Postdoc	s^r	-1	0	very small .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact254	360.938	361.148	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact255	362.506	362.866	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact258	365.393	365.703	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact256	365.305	365.685	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact257	365.377	374.167	E	Grad	s	+1	0	so the {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that problem has gone away in the original driver believe it or not when the SSH key gen ran the driver paused for a fraction of a second
Bmr012.B.dialogueact260	373.61	374.16	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr012.F.dialogueact259	373.34	373.88	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact261	374.897	376.577	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and so the channels get a little asynchronous
Bmr012.E.dialogueact262	376.577	381.037	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and so if you listen to it in the middle there 's a little part where it starts doing {disfmarker} doing click sounds .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact263	381.608	381.898	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr012.C.dialogueact264	381.623	383.323	C	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	And is it only once that that happens ?
Bmr012.E.dialogueact265	382.047	382.157	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	But

Bmr012.A.dialogueact303	406.905	407.565	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact302	406.595	409.905	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know , I mean I {disfmarker} I had no trouble hearing it and {disfmarker} and having time bins
Bmr012.E.dialogueact305	410.053	416.943	E	Grad	s^r	+1	0	I do remember seeing once the transcriber produce an incorrect XML file where one of the synch numbers was incorrect .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact304	409.905	411.165	G	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	but there was a {disfmarker}
Bmr012.G.dialogueact306	414.429	414.819	G	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact308	416.652	421.212	C	PhD	s	+1	0	Well , the {disfmarker} the synch time {disfmarker} the synch numbers have more significant digits than they should ,
Bmr012.F.dialogueact307	416.604	417.614	F	Grad	s^na	-1	0	That 's what happened .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact309	417.823	420.103	G	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr012.H.dialogueact310	417.946	418.246	H	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact312	418.84	420.26	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Where {disfmarker} where they weren't monotonic .
Bmr012.F.dialogueact311	418.535	418.905	F	Grad	%-	-1	0	There was {disfmarker}
Bmr012.F.dialogueact313	420.463	421.003	F	Grad	fg|%-	-1	0	yeah , I mean {disfmarker}
Bmr012.C.dialogueact314	421.212	421.482	C	PhD	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right ?
Bmr012.C.dialogueact315	421.482	424.152	C	PhD	s	+1	0	There 's things that are l in smaller increments than a frame .
Bmr012.H.dialogueact316	422.743	423.063	H	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact317	424.254	424.994	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Oh , interesting .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact321	425.224	431.704	C	PhD	s	-1	0	And so then , I mean you look at that and it 's got you know more than three significant digits in a synch time then that can't be right
Bmr012.E.dialogueact318	424.852	425.212	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh OK
Bmr012.E.dialogueact319	425.212	425.592	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	so that 's
Bmr012.F.dialogueact320	425.221	425.671	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact322	429.98	431.19	G	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact325	431.744	432.494	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact326	431.814	433.754	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so anyway it 's {disfmarker} it 's just {disfmarker}
Bmr012.E.dialogueact323	431.656	432.516	E	Grad	fg|s^na	-1	0	yeah sounds like a bug .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact324	431.66	432.34	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact327	433.914	435.394	C	PhD	s	-1	0	that 's why we only have twenty minutes
Bmr012.C.dialogueact328	435.394	437.684	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	but there 's a significant amount of {disfmarker}
Bmr012.F.dialogueact329	436.618	437.378	F	Grad	qy^2^d^rt	-1	0	Non - zero ?
Bmr012.F.dialogueact330	437.628	442.788	F	Grad	s	-1	0	Um there are like more {disfmarker} cuz there 's a lot of zeros I tacked on just because of the way the script ran ,
Bmr012.E.dialogueact331	439.257	440.517	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	The other one I saw was that it
Bmr012.E.dialogueact333	442.895	443.255	E	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr012.F.dialogueact332	442.788	444.108	F	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean but there were there was a point .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact334	444.989	445.699	C	PhD	s^na	-1	0	Yeah that was fine .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact336	445.989	446.849	C	PhD	s^na	-1	0	That {disfmarker} that was OK .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact335	445.801	448.761	E	Grad	s	-1	0	The other one I saw was non non - monotonic synch times
Bmr012.F.dialogueact337	447.213	447.603	F	Grad	%	-1	0	OK .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact338	448.761	450.701	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and that definitely indicra indicates a bug .
Bmr012.F.dialogueact339	449.306	449.606	F	Grad	fg	-1	0	Uh .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact340	449.9	451.51	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Well that would really be a problem ,
Bmr012.C.dialogueact341	451.51	451.86	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact342	451.86	457.37	C	PhD	s	+1	0	So anyway these are just the ones that are the prebug for one meeting .
Bmr012.F.dialogueact343	453.911	454.281	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact344	458.01	459.86	C	PhD	qw.%-	-1	0	um and what 's {disfmarker} which {disfmarker}
Bmr012.E.dialogueact345	458.615	460.575	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	So that 's very encouraging .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact346	459.86	462.36	C	PhD	s	+1	1	this is really encouraging cuz this is free recognition ,
Bmr012.B.dialogueact348	460.439	460.499	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr012.H.dialogueact347	460.149	460.389	H	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact349	461.033	461.283	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Cool .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact351	462.698	463.068	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact350	462.36	465.75	C	PhD	s	-1	0	there 's no I mean the language model for Switchboard is totally different
Bmr012.C.dialogueact352	465.75	469.64	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so you can see some like this Trent Lott which
Bmr012.D.dialogueact353	467.299	467.839	D	PhD	s^j	-1	0	Trent Lott .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact354	469.64	470.57	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	um I mean
Bmr012.C.dialogueact355	470.74	471.91	C	PhD	s	-1	0	these are sort of funny ones ,
Bmr012.D.dialogueact356	470.883	471.703	D	PhD	s	-1	0	It 'll get those though .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact357	471.91	474.86	C	PhD	s	-1	0	there 's a lot of perfect ones and good ones and all the references ,
Bmr012.C.dialogueact358	474.86	478.63	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	I mean you can read them and when we get more results you can look through and see
Bmr012.E.dialogueact359	477.389	481.348	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	I and as I said I would like to look at the lattices
Bmr012.A.dialogueact360	478.157	478.907	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact361	478.63	478.91	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	but
Bmr012.C.dialogueact362	479.5	480.44	C	PhD	s	-1	0	um it 's pretty good .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact363	481.348	484.438	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because it sounded like even the ones it got wrong it sort of got it right ?
Bmr012.C.dialogueact364	484.87	486.87	C	PhD	s^cs.%-	-1	0	Well so I guess we can generate
Bmr012.E.dialogueact365	484.968	485.868	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	Sounds likes ?
Bmr012.A.dialogueact367	486.864	493.434	A	PhD	s	+1	1	There are a fair number of errors that are , you know where {disfmarker} got the plural S wrong or the inflection on the verb wrong .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact366	486.719	487.859	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact368	487.64	488.51	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	um
Bmr012.E.dialogueact369	491.723	491.903	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr012.E.dialogueact370	491.903	492.503	E	Grad	qh^nd	-1	0	and who cares ?
Bmr012.E.dialogueact371	492.503	499.103	E	Grad	s	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and there were lots of {disfmarker} of course the " uh uh " - s , " in on " - s " of uh " - s .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact372	494.524	495.594	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	Mmm , so if {disfmarker}
Bmr012.C.dialogueact373	494.535	494.775	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	there 's {disfmarker}
Bmr012.C.dialogueact374	497.072	498.292	C	PhD	s^ar.%--	-1	0	No those are actually
Bmr012.A.dialogueact375	497.618	497.758	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact376	498.762	501.192	C	PhD	s	+1	1	a lot of the errors I think are out of vocabulary ,
Bmr012.A.dialogueact378	501.292	502.492	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact377	501.192	503.482	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so is it like PZM is three words ,
Bmr012.C.dialogueact379	503.482	504.772	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	it 's PZM ,
Bmr012.A.dialogueact380	504.352	505.392	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact381	504.772	505.662	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I mean there 's nothing
Bmr012.C.dialogueact383	506.042	508.572	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	There 's no language model for PZM or
Bmr012.E.dialogueact382	505.637	505.907	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact384	506.067	506.737	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Ri - ri right .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact385	508.572	509.292	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	um
Bmr012.E.dialogueact386	508.987	510.697	E	Grad	qy^bu^rt	-1	0	Did you say there 's no language for PZM ?
Bmr012.C.dialogueact387	510.792	512.242	C	PhD	s^aa.%-	-1	0	No language model , I mean those {disfmarker}
Bmr012.E.dialogueact388	512.745	515.185	E	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Do you mean {disfmarker} so every time someone says PZM it 's an error ?
Bmr012.E.dialogueact389	515.585	517.635	E	Grad	s^cs^j	-1	0	Maybe we shouldn't say PZM in these meetings .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact390	517.307	519.617	C	PhD	fg|s^df	-1	0	Well {disfmarker} well there 's all kinds of other stuff like Jimlet
Bmr012.C.dialogueact391	519.617	522.317	C	PhD	fh|%--	-1	0	and I mean um anyway there {disfmarker}
Bmr012.E.dialogueact392	519.876	521.116	E	Grad	s^bk^j	-1	0	Yeah , that 's right , Jimlet .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact393	522.214	523.374	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , we don't even know what that means ,
Bmr012.C.dialogueact394	522.317	526.247	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so {vocalsound} but this is really encouraging because
Bmr012.B.dialogueact396	523.374	523.604	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	so I
Bmr012.E.dialogueact395	523.271	524.231	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , that 's right .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact397	526.457	539.717	C	PhD	s	+1	0	so , I mean the bottom line is even though it 's not a huge amount of data um it should be uh reasonable to actually run recognition and be like within the scope of {disfmarker} of r reasonable s you know Switchboard
Bmr012.C.dialogueact398	539.717	545.917	C	PhD	s	+1	0	this is like h about how well we do on Switchboard - two data with the Switchboard - one trained {disfmarker} mostly trained recognizer
Bmr012.E.dialogueact399	544.769	545.209	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact400	545.917	551.747	C	PhD	s	+1	0	and Switchboard - two is {disfmarker} got sort of a different population of speakers and a different topic
Bmr012.E.dialogueact401	547.572	548.072	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Excellent .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact402	551.917	555.237	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and they 're talking about things in the news that happened after Switchboard - one
Bmr012.C.dialogueact403	555.237	557.017	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so there was @ @ so that 's great .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact404	556.052	556.192	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact405	557.172	560.172	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah so we 're in better shape than we were say when we did {disfmarker} had the ninety - three workshop
Bmr012.C.dialogueact406	557.697	558.077	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um
Bmr012.B.dialogueact407	560.402	563.242	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and we were all getting like seventy percent error on Switchboard .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact408	563.387	565.307	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact409	563.908	564.328	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh yeah
Bmr012.B.dialogueact411	564.434	564.744	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	you know

Bmr012.E.dialogueact415	566.094	569.804	E	Grad	s^na.%--	-1	0	Well especially for the very first run , I mean you {disfmarker}
Bmr012.A.dialogueact418	567.645	568.685	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Oh it 's the {disfmarker}
Bmr012.B.dialogueact416	567.393	567.853	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact417	567.598	568.418	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	eh um

Bmr012.E.dialogueact420	569.804	572.774	E	Grad	s	-1	0	the first run I ran of Switchboard I got a hundred twenty percent word error
Bmr012.E.dialogueact422	572.774	572.884	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	but
Bmr012.C.dialogueact423	574.063	576.203	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So and what al also this means is that
Bmr012.G.dialogueact424	575.28	575.46	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact426	576.203	576.663	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	um
Bmr012.E.dialogueact425	575.896	576.626	E	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	Not Switchboard ,
Bmr012.A.dialogueact428	576.72	577.59	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Well it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr012.C.dialogueact429	577.073	579.833	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean there 's a bunch of things in this note to various people
Bmr012.E.dialogueact427	576.626	578.636	E	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	uh Broadcast News .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact430	579.833	583.493	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	especially I guess um with Jane that {disfmarker} that would help for {disfmarker}
Bmr012.C.dialogueact431	583.493	593.403	C	PhD	s	-1	0	since we have this new data now uh in order to go from the transcripts more easily to um just the words that the recognizer would use for scoring .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact432	593.713	598.583	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I had to deal with some of it by hand but I think a lot of it can be automated s by {disfmarker}
Bmr012.B.dialogueact433	598.114	599.504	B	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	Oh one thing I guess I didn't get
Bmr012.B.dialogueact434	599.504	603.304	B	Professor	s^bs	-1	0	so you know the language model was straight from {disfmarker} from bigram from Switchboard
Bmr012.B.dialogueact435	603.304	606.114	B	Professor	qr^bu^d^rt.%-	+1	1	the acoustic models were also from Switchboard or {disfmarker} or
Bmr012.A.dialogueact436	605.624	605.944	A	PhD	s^aa	+1	1	Yeah .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact437	606.168	606.528	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact439	606.724	609.494	B	Professor	qy^bu^d	-1	0	So they didn't have anything from this acoustic data in yet ?
Bmr012.G.dialogueact438	606.55	607.71	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	That 's amazing .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact440	607.218	608.198	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Yeah , so that 's great .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact441	608.491	608.701	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	No .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact444	609.694	609.944	B	Professor	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact442	609.411	613.601	C	PhD	fg|s^rt	+1	1	And actually {disfmarker} we actually um used Switchboard telephone bandwidth models
Bmr012.G.dialogueact443	609.48	610.19	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	That 's amazing .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact448	614.244	616.484	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Well that 's {disfmarker} those are the only we ones there are ,
Bmr012.B.dialogueact445	613.917	615.017	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact446	613.971	614.601	C	PhD	s^e.%-	-1	0	which I guess
Bmr012.D.dialogueact447	613.997	614.777	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	I was just gonna say ,
Bmr012.C.dialogueact450	615.121	618.771	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so that 's the on that 's the only acoustic training data that we have a lot of
Bmr012.D.dialogueact449	614.777	615.107	D	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact452	616.484	616.654	A	PhD	%	-1	0	I mean
Bmr012.E.dialogueact451	616.262	616.532	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact453	617.83	618.04	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact454	618.771	620.021	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and I guess Ramana ,
Bmr012.C.dialogueact455	620.021	625.211	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so a guy at SRI said that um there 's not a huge amount of difference going from {disfmarker}
Bmr012.B.dialogueact457	625.621	626.131	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact456	625.371	627.331	C	PhD	s	-1	0	it 's {disfmarker} it 's not like we probably lose a huge amount
Bmr012.C.dialogueact458	627.331	627.921	C	PhD	s^bd^no	-1	0	but we won't know
Bmr012.C.dialogueact459	627.921	631.131	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because we don't have any full band models for s conversational speech .
Bmr012.D.dialogueact460	630.963	635.303	D	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's probably not as bad as going f using full band models on telephone band speech
Bmr012.C.dialogueact461	632.343	632.683	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact462	635.265	635.615	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Oh yeah .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact464	635.641	635.981	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr012.D.dialogueact463	635.303	635.543	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr012.A.dialogueact467	636.615	636.735	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact466	636.592	636.752	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr012.C.dialogueact465	636.201	637.641	C	PhD	fg|s.%-	-1	0	Right , so it 's {disfmarker} so
Bmr012.B.dialogueact468	636.752	642.336	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but for Broadcast News when we {disfmarker} we played around between the two there wasn't a huge loss .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact469	640.27	641.68	E	Grad	s^aa|s^ba^na	-1	0	Right , it was not a big deal .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact470	640.862	641.122	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah
Bmr012.A.dialogueact472	641.388	644.958	A	PhD	s	+1	0	I should {disfmarker} I should say that {disfmarker} the language model is not just Switchboard
Bmr012.C.dialogueact471	641.122	641.662	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	so I wou
Bmr012.C.dialogueact473	641.662	642.282	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	so that 's good .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact474	642.1	643.76	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Although combining em worked well .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact475	644.958	645.718	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	it 's also {disfmarker}
Bmr012.A.dialogueact476	646.608	650.608	A	PhD	s	+1	1	I mean there 's uh actually more data is from Broadcast News
Bmr012.A.dialogueact477	650.608	652.058	A	PhD	s^e	+1	0	but with a little less weight
Bmr012.C.dialogueact478	651.889	651.969	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact481	652.988	653.738	A	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	uh because
Bmr012.B.dialogueact479	652.565	653.345	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact480	652.729	654.169	C	PhD	s^j	-1	0	Like Trent Lott must have been from
Bmr012.A.dialogueact483	654.408	654.508	A	PhD	b	-1	0	mm - hmm ,
Bmr012.A.dialogueact484	654.668	654.768	A	PhD	b	-1	0	right .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact482	654.279	656.679	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I guess {vocalsound} Switchboard was before
Bmr012.A.dialogueact485	656.298	660.188	A	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	Um By the way just {disfmarker} for fun we also ran ,
Bmr012.C.dialogueact486	656.679	656.839	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	uh .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact487	658.973	659.363	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Good point .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact488	660.188	663.538	A	PhD	s^rt	+1	0	I mean our complete system starts by doing ge a gender detection
Bmr012.B.dialogueact489	663.791	664.371	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact490	664.328	666.388	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so just for the heck of it I ran that
Bmr012.E.dialogueact491	665.43	666.71	E	Grad	qy^d^rt	-1	0	And it said a hundred percent male ?
Bmr012.A.dialogueact492	667.088	671.818	A	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	um and it might be reassuring for everybody to know that it got all the genders right .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact493	671.251	672.351	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	The j
Bmr012.A.dialogueact495	672.068	672.568	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah so
Bmr012.E.dialogueact494	671.59	672.12	E	Grad	qy^bh^d^rt	-1	0	Oh it did ?
Bmr012.G.dialogueact496	673.1	674.22	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Oh that 's {disfmarker} I 'm glad .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact497	673.81	675.28	E	Grad	qy^d^j	-1	0	It got all two genders ?
Bmr012.C.dialogueact498	674.362	674.592	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah
Bmr012.C.dialogueact499	675.022	679.092	C	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	but you know Jane and Adam have you kn about equal performance
Bmr012.A.dialogueact500	676.498	676.608	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact501	676.608	676.858	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact502	679.092	681.242	C	PhD	fh|s^ba	-1	0	and uh and that 's interesting
Bmr012.C.dialogueact503	681.242	684.062	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	cuz I think the {disfmarker} their language models are quite different
Bmr012.C.dialogueact504	684.062	684.372	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	so
Bmr012.C.dialogueact505	684.562	693.992	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and I {disfmarker} I 'm pretty sure from listening to Eric that , you know given the words he was saying and given his pronunciation that the reason that he 's so much worse is the lapel .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact508	694.516	694.836	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact506	694.16	694.39	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact507	694.47	695.37	G	Postdoc	s^ba^na	-1	0	That makes a lot of sense ,
Bmr012.C.dialogueact509	695.092	699.962	C	PhD	fh|s^cs	-1	0	So it 's nice now if we can just sort of eliminate the lapel one when {disfmarker} when we get new microphones
Bmr012.G.dialogueact510	695.42	695.62	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact511	697.871	698.501	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Very possible .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact512	699.413	699.693	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah
Bmr012.B.dialogueact513	699.693	701.613	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I would bet on that too
Bmr012.C.dialogueact514	699.962	700.952	C	PhD	s	-1	0	that would be worth it
Bmr012.B.dialogueact516	701.613	706.663	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	cuz he certainly in that {disfmarker} when as a {disfmarker} as a burp user he was {disfmarker} he was a pretty uh strong one .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact515	701.352	701.812	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	um
Bmr012.C.dialogueact518	706.856	707.006	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	Yeah
Bmr012.E.dialogueact517	706.48	706.8	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Sheep .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact519	707.006	709.376	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	he {disfmarker} he {disfmarker} he sounded to me just from {disfmarker} he sounded like a ,
Bmr012.B.dialogueact520	707.869	708.119	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact521	709.376	710.566	C	PhD	qr	-1	0	what 's it a sheep or a goat ?
Bmr012.B.dialogueact524	711.061	711.411	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Sheep .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact522	710.69	711.01	E	Grad	s	-1	0	A sheep .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact525	711.266	711.626	C	PhD	s^bk^m	-1	0	Sheep ,
Bmr012.E.dialogueact523	711.01	712.61	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Baah .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact527	711.841	712.081	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact528	712.201	712.801	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Sheep is good .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact526	711.816	712.006	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	right .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact529	712.356	713.036	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Sounded good .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact530	713.691	714.091	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact531	713.696	716.796	C	PhD	fg|s^tc.%--	-1	0	Right so um so I guess the good news is that
Bmr012.G.dialogueact532	714.135	714.765	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact533	717.166	722.876	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and again this is without a lot of the sort of bells and whistles that we c can do with the SRI system
Bmr012.C.dialogueact534	722.876	728.916	C	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	and we 'll have more data and we can also start to maybe adapt the language models once we have enough meetings .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact535	729.356	733.886	C	PhD	s	+1	2	So this is only twenty minutes of one meeting with no {disfmarker} no tailoring at all .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact536	732.522	743.682	A	PhD	s	+1	0	I mean clearly there are um with just a small amount of uh actual meeting transcriptions uh thrown into the language model you can probably do quite a bit better
Bmr012.A.dialogueact538	743.682	745.472	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	because the {disfmarker}
Bmr012.C.dialogueact537	743.468	743.798	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact540	744.738	746.748	C	PhD	s	-1	0	The voca the vocabulary especially
Bmr012.E.dialogueact539	744.41	745.24	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	Or just dictionary .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact541	746.748	747.068	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact543	748.349	750.079	A	PhD	s^arp	-1	0	Not that much the vocabulary actually
Bmr012.C.dialogueact542	748.068	749.198	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah , so .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact544	750.079	752.079	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	I think {disfmarker} um well we have to see
Bmr012.A.dialogueact545	752.079	753.829	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker} it 's uh {disfmarker}
Bmr012.C.dialogueact546	752.803	753.103	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact547	753.763	754.583	C	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's pretty good
Bmr012.C.dialogueact548	755.013	756.283	C	PhD	fh|s.%-	-1	0	um so then
Bmr012.B.dialogueact549	755.832	757.322	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Have to add PZM and so on
Bmr012.E.dialogueact550	756.14	757.83	E	Grad	s	+1	2	And I have to try it on the far field mike
Bmr012.B.dialogueact551	757.322	757.512	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but
Bmr012.C.dialogueact553	758.163	758.683	C	PhD	s	-1	0	PZM
Bmr012.E.dialogueact552	757.83	758.06	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact554	758.683	765.603	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and then there 's things like for the transcription I got when someone has a digit in the transcript I don't know if they said , you know one one or eleven
Bmr012.C.dialogueact555	765.603	768.543	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and I don't know if they said Tcl or TCL .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact556	769.023	775.343	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	there 's things like that where , you know the um we 'll probably have to ask the transcribers to indicate some of those kinds of things
Bmr012.C.dialogueact557	775.343	777.743	C	PhD	s	-1	0	but in general it was really good
Bmr012.C.dialogueact558	777.743	778.623	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and I 'm hoping {disfmarker}
Bmr012.C.dialogueact559	778.913	781.263	C	PhD	s	+1	1	and this is {disfmarker} this is good news
Bmr012.C.dialogueact560	781.263	783.713	C	PhD	s^df	+1	2	because that means the force alignments should be good
Bmr012.C.dialogueact561	783.713	784.883	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and if the force alignments ,
Bmr012.C.dialogueact562	785.163	786.063	C	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	I mean it 's good news anyway
Bmr012.C.dialogueact563	786.063	789.373	C	PhD	s	+1	2	but if the force alignments are good we can get all kinds of information .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact564	790.013	793.043	C	PhD	s^e	+1	2	For example about , you know prosodic information
Bmr012.C.dialogueact565	793.043	797.483	C	PhD	s^e	+1	2	and speaker overlaps and so forth directly from the aligned times .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact566	798.513	800.213	C	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	Um so that 'll be something that
Bmr012.C.dialogueact567	800.923	808.933	C	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	actually in order to assess the forced alignment um we need s some linguists or some people to look at it and say are these boundaries in about the right place .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact568	809.453	810.963	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Because it 's just gonna give us time marks
Bmr012.D.dialogueact570	810.42	810.76	D	PhD	fg	-1	0	But you know {disfmarker}
Bmr012.E.dialogueact569	810.39	811.97	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Well we 've done that for one meeting .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact571	811.103	811.383	C	PhD	b	-1	0	so .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact572	813.648	814.798	C	PhD	s^aap	-1	0	For forced alignment .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact573	815.7	816.39	E	Grad	h|s^bk	-1	0	Uh oh oh
Bmr012.E.dialogueact574	816.39	817.07	E	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	f not for words
Bmr012.C.dialogueact575	816.993	817.763	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Ye - right .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact576	817.07	820.24	E	Grad	s^bs^fa	-1	0	I 'm sorry just for overlaps is we did it for not {disfmarker} not for words .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact577	818.423	818.863	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact578	819.273	830.823	C	PhD	qh	+1	0	So this would be like if you take the words um you know and force align them on all the individual close talk uh close talking mikes then how good are these sort of in reality
Bmr012.E.dialogueact579	829.68	829.97	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact580	830.823	831.763	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and then I was thinking it {disfmarker}
Bmr012.E.dialogueact581	831.19	835.18	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	So we might want to take twenty minutes and do a closer word level transcription .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact582	835.74	837.33	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	Maybe actually mark the word boundaries .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact583	838.062	838.302	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	Oh
Bmr012.C.dialogueact584	838.302	840.352	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	or {disfmarker} i have someone look at the alignments
Bmr012.C.dialogueact585	840.412	846.912	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	uh maybe a linguist who can say um you know roughly if these are OK and how far away they are .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact586	846.98	847.77	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact587	847.512	849.472	C	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	Um but I think it 's gotta be pretty good
Bmr012.C.dialogueact588	849.472	851.862	C	PhD	s^df	+1	0	because otherwise the word recognition would be really b crummy .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact589	851.36	852.36	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Right , right .

Bmr012.E.dialogueact597	864.89	865.94	E	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	That we 're starting so well ?
Bmr012.D.dialogueact598	865.971	869.241	D	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	yeah if we 're producing a database that everybody 's gonna do well on
Bmr012.B.dialogueact599	866.5	866.93	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Oh
Bmr012.E.dialogueact600	867.33	867.94	E	Grad	s^co^ng	-1	0	Don't worry about it

Bmr012.B.dialogueact603	871.779	872.209	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah ,
Bmr012.B.dialogueact604	872.209	875.229	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	which {disfmarker} I would {disfmarker} which {disfmarker} well n n n n
Bmr012.D.dialogueact606	872.42	874.07	D	PhD	qy^d^rt	-1	0	So the real value of the database is these ?

Bmr012.B.dialogueact609	876.37	878.76	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean there 's still just the w the percentages
Bmr012.B.dialogueact610	878.76	879.85	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and , I mean they 're not {disfmarker} a
Bmr012.B.dialogueact612	880.06	882.15	B	Professor	s	-1	0	as we 've talked about before there 's probably overlaps
Bmr012.C.dialogueact611	880.042	880.482	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	This i
Bmr012.C.dialogueact613	880.482	880.932	C	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact614	881.052	882.242	C	PhD	s	-1	0	This is not that good .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact615	882.62	886.91	B	Professor	s	-1	0	there 's probably overlaps in {disfmarker} in uh in fair number in Switchboard as well
Bmr012.B.dialogueact616	886.91	887.24	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so
Bmr012.B.dialogueact617	887.7	888.78	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but there 's other phenomena ,
Bmr012.B.dialogueact618	888.78	889.35	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it 's a meeting ,
Bmr012.B.dialogueact619	889.35	892.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it 's a different thing and there 's lots of stuff to learn with the close talking mikes
Bmr012.B.dialogueact620	892.65	893.55	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but uh
Bmr012.B.dialogueact621	893.72	896.14	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	2	yeah certainly I 'd like to see as soon as we could ,
Bmr012.B.dialogueact622	896.14	898.43	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	I mean maybe get some of the glitches out of the way
Bmr012.B.dialogueact623	898.43	902.44	B	Professor	s^cs.%--	+1	2	but soon as we could how well it does with say with the P Z Ms or maybe even one of the
Bmr012.C.dialogueact624	902.58	902.92	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact625	903.08	904.62	B	Professor	s^cs.%--	-1	0	and uh see if it 's , you know
Bmr012.B.dialogueact626	904.62	905.75	B	Professor	qy	-1	0	is it a hundred twenty percent
Bmr012.B.dialogueact627	905.75	906.24	B	Professor	s	-1	0	or maybe it 's not
Bmr012.B.dialogueact628	906.24	911.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	maybe if with some adaptation you get this down to fifty percent or forty - five percent or something
Bmr012.B.dialogueact629	911.1	914.07	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and then if for the PZM it 's seventy or something like that
Bmr012.B.dialogueact630	914.07	916.98	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that 's actually something we could sort of work with a little bit
Bmr012.C.dialogueact631	917.48	917.75	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact633	918.187	918.897	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so
Bmr012.C.dialogueact632	917.98	918.9	C	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	No I think it 's really ,
Bmr012.C.dialogueact634	918.9	921.13	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean this way we least have a baseline
Bmr012.C.dialogueact635	921.13	923.97	C	PhD	s	-1	0	we know that for instance the transcripts are very good
Bmr012.C.dialogueact636	923.97	930.83	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so once you can get to the words that the recognizer which is a total subset of the things you need to understand the {disfmarker} the text
Bmr012.C.dialogueact637	931.53	933.05	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um yeah they 're pretty good
Bmr012.C.dialogueact638	933.05	938.74	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so and {disfmarker} and it 's converting automatically from the XML to the chopping up the wave forms and so forth
Bmr012.C.dialogueact639	938.74	945.83	C	PhD	s	+1	0	it 's not the case that the end of one utterance is in the next segment and things like that which we had more problems with in Switchboard
Bmr012.C.dialogueact640	946.45	947.11	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so that 's good .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact641	947.8	948.9	C	PhD	fh|s^t1	-1	0	And um let 's see
Bmr012.C.dialogueact642	948.9	951.636	C	PhD	s	-1	0	there was one more thing I wanted to {disfmarker} to mention {disfmarker}
Bmr012.C.dialogueact643	951.636	952.326	C	PhD	s^t1	-1	0	I can't remember
Bmr012.C.dialogueact644	952.886	953.246	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	um
Bmr012.C.dialogueact645	956.436	957.226	C	PhD	s^fa	-1	0	Sorry can't remember .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact646	959.994	960.584	C	PhD	fh|%-	-1	0	anyway it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr012.G.dialogueact647	960.06	960.8	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Congratulations
Bmr012.G.dialogueact648	960.8	961.88	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	is really great .

Bmr012.C.dialogueact649	961.264	964.734	C	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	well it was , I mean I really didn't do this myself
Bmr012.E.dialogueact651	961.38	962.19	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Yeah , it 's really good .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact652	964.734	966.814	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	so Andreas set up this recognizer and {disfmarker}
Bmr012.C.dialogueact653	966.934	971.394	C	PhD	s	-1	0	by the way the recognizer all the files I 'm moving to SRI and running everything there
Bmr012.C.dialogueact654	971.394	974.194	C	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	so I brought back just these result files
Bmr012.C.dialogueact655	974.194	975.314	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	and people can look at them
Bmr012.C.dialogueact656	975.914	977.564	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	um so
Bmr012.A.dialogueact657	977.24	981.79	A	PhD	s	+1	1	We {disfmarker} we talked about setting up the SRI recognizer here .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact658	982.54	988.21	A	PhD	s	+1	0	That 's {disfmarker} you know if {disfmarker} if there are more machines um uh here
Bmr012.A.dialogueact659	988.21	995.669	A	PhD	s	+1	1	plus people can {disfmarker} could run their own uh you know variants of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of the recognition {pause} runs
Bmr012.A.dialogueact660	995.669	996.069	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	um
Bmr012.A.dialogueact661	996.069	996.909	A	PhD	s	-1	0	certainly doable .

Bmr012.B.dialogueact663	998.35	998.98	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah and {disfmarker}
Bmr012.B.dialogueact664	998.98	1001.02	B	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	well certainly if the recognition as opposed to training ,
Bmr012.B.dialogueact665	1001.02	1001.26	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact668	1001.91	1002.17	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr012.E.dialogueact687	1037.65	1038.56	E	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	That {disfmarker} that 's not the issue ,
Bmr012.C.dialogueact689	1038.97	1040.64	C	PhD	qy^bu^d^m^rt	-1	0	de audio data itself ?
Bmr012.E.dialogueact688	1038.56	1039.95	E	Grad	s	-1	0	it 's just the audio data itself ,
Bmr012.E.dialogueact690	1039.95	1043.21	E	Grad	s	-1	0	until people have a chance to edit it .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact691	1041.81	1042.43	G	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm , exactly .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact692	1042.59	1045.77	C	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Uh so well I can {disfmarker} I can protect my directories through there .

Bmr012.C.dialogueact695	1046.19	1050.2	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Right now they 're not {disfmarker} they 're in the speech group directories which {disfmarker} so I will {disfmarker}
Bmr012.G.dialogueact694	1045.78	1046.06	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Great .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact696	1050.2	1051.27	C	PhD	s	-1	0	I didn't know that actually .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact697	1051.35	1054.4	B	Professor	fg|s^co	+1	1	Yeah so we just have to go through this process of having people approve the transcriptions ,
Bmr012.C.dialogueact698	1052.75	1053.41	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah OK .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact699	1054.55	1055.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	say it 's OK .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact701	1054.89	1055.52	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Right OK .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact700	1054.67	1055.91	G	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	Yeah , we had to get them to approve em
Bmr012.G.dialogueact702	1055.91	1059.94	G	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	and then i cuz {disfmarker} cuz the other question I was gonna ask is if we 're having um you know it 's
Bmr012.G.dialogueact703	1060.24	1061.87	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but this {disfmarker} this meeting that you have , no problem
Bmr012.G.dialogueact704	1061.87	1064.19	G	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	cuz I {disfmarker} I well I mean I {disfmarker} I speak for myself
Bmr012.E.dialogueact705	1063.0	1063.34	E	Grad	s	-1	0	It 's us .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact706	1064.19	1066.82	G	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but I think that we didn't do anything that but
Bmr012.G.dialogueact707	1067.12	1070.53	G	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	well anyway so {vocalsound} uh I wouldn't be too concerned about it with respect to that
Bmr012.G.dialogueact708	1070.53	1072.51	G	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	although we should clear it with Eric and Dan of course
Bmr012.G.dialogueact709	1072.51	1079.29	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but these results are based on data which haven't had the uh haven't had the chance to be reviewed by the subjects
Bmr012.C.dialogueact710	1078.16	1078.82	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	That 's true .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact711	1079.29	1080.33	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and I don't know how that stands ,
Bmr012.G.dialogueact712	1080.33	1089.22	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I mean if you {disfmarker} if you get fantastic results and it 's involving {comment} data which {disfmarker} which later end up being lessened by , you know certain elisions , then I don't know
Bmr012.G.dialogueact713	1089.35	1090.34	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but I wanted to raise that issue ,
Bmr012.B.dialogueact715	1090.96	1091.27	B	Professor	fg|%--	-1	0	Well we ,
Bmr012.G.dialogueact714	1090.63	1091.16	G	Postdoc	s^tc	-1	0	that 's all .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact716	1091.27	1093.89	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	I mean once we get all this streamlined it may be sh it {disfmarker}
Bmr012.B.dialogueact717	1093.89	1095.12	B	Professor	s	-1	0	hopefully it will be fairly quick
Bmr012.B.dialogueact718	1095.28	1099.07	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but we get the transcriptions , people approve them and so on
Bmr012.B.dialogueact720	1099.07	1099.74	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	it 's just that we 're
Bmr012.E.dialogueact719	1098.96	1099.11	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Alright
Bmr012.E.dialogueact721	1099.11	1103.91	E	Grad	s^co	+1	1	we need to work at a system for doing that approval so that we can send people the transcripts
Bmr012.G.dialogueact722	1099.14	1099.34	G	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Great .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact723	1101.12	1102.04	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact724	1101.52	1101.74	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact725	1103.91	1105.66	E	Grad	s^co	-1	0	and get back any bleeps that they want
Bmr012.C.dialogueact726	1106.5	1109.6	C	PhD	fg|s^na	-1	0	Yeah actually the bleeps are also an issue I thought .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact727	1107.33	1109.91	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's gonna be a rare thing that there 's a bleep for the most part .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact728	1109.18	1111.67	A	PhD	s^tc	-1	0	U uh actually I had a question about the downsampling ,
Bmr012.A.dialogueact729	1111.79	1114.28	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um I don't know who , I mean how this was done
Bmr012.A.dialogueact730	1114.28	1119.37	A	PhD	qy	-1	0	but is {disfmarker} is there {disfmarker} are there any um {vocalsound} issues with downsampling
Bmr012.C.dialogueact731	1114.37	1115.04	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Don did this .

Bmr012.A.dialogueact759	1166.29	1170.88	A	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	So {disfmarker} so the other thing we should try is to just take the original wave forms ,

Bmr012.A.dialogueact761	1170.97	1173.01	A	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	I mean segment them but not downsample them .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact762	1173.04	1176.33	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Yeah we could {disfmarker} we could try that and {disfmarker} and compare

Bmr012.C.dialogueact782	1197.54	1200.7	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Well I mean that was {disfmarker} if it 's the same then we can downsample here
Bmr012.A.dialogueact783	1199.9	1200.72	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	I mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's just a

Bmr012.F.dialogueact790	1204.58	1207.37	F	Grad	s^cs^na	-1	0	I mean it 's not {disfmarker} i it wouldn't be a problem if you 're interested in it {disfmarker}
Bmr012.C.dialogueact791	1205.3	1206.03	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	We could try that .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact793	1207.88	1212.45	A	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah I mean it would be uh you know it would probably take uh about um you know
Bmr012.F.dialogueact792	1207.41	1207.68	F	Grad	%-	-1	0	it would {disfmarker}
Bmr012.A.dialogueact794	1212.66	1217.73	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	minus the transfer time it would {disfmarker} it would take uh you know ten minutes to try and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and
Bmr012.F.dialogueact795	1214.04	1214.35	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact796	1217.1	1218.3	E	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	It 's about a fifty minute drive ,
Bmr012.E.dialogueact797	1218.3	1218.57	E	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr012.A.dialogueact799	1220.7	1226.37	A	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	And {disfmarker} and if for some reason we see that it works better then we might investigate why
Bmr012.C.dialogueact798	1220.66	1222.04	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Well it takes more disk space too
Bmr012.C.dialogueact800	1222.04	1222.69	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	so I was just {disfmarker}
Bmr012.A.dialogueact801	1226.37	1227.97	A	PhD	fh|%-	-1	0	and , you know , what {disfmarker}
Bmr012.A.dialogueact803	1230.26	1231.08	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.F.dialogueact802	1230.2	1230.3	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr012.F.dialogueact804	1230.56	1231.89	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	In the front - end we could do that .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact805	1231.5	1231.86	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact806	1232.55	1234.33	B	Professor	qy^bu^d	-1	0	So you just train {disfmarker} just different filters
Bmr012.F.dialogueact807	1232.66	1233.12	F	Grad	fg	-1	0	Yeah , I {disfmarker}
Bmr012.B.dialogueact808	1234.33	1236.6	B	Professor	qy^bu^d.%-	-1	0	and so you 're just wondering whether the filter is
Bmr012.F.dialogueact809	1234.42	1235.69	F	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , I can imagine it would be {disfmarker}
Bmr012.A.dialogueact810	1235.12	1235.49	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact811	1236.14	1236.48	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact813	1237.2	1242.38	C	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	So we could try that with this particular twenty minutes of speech and sort of see if there 's any differences .
Bmr012.F.dialogueact812	1236.8	1237.61	F	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	I mean I guess there 's some {disfmarker}
Bmr012.A.dialogueact814	1241.87	1249.55	A	PhD	s	-1	0	You know a at some point someone might have optimized whatever filtering is done for the actual recognition um performance .
Bmr012.F.dialogueact815	1246.08	1246.33	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact816	1249.87	1251.1	A	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	So in other words
Bmr012.A.dialogueact818	1251.61	1252.18	A	PhD	s^m	-1	0	right ,
Bmr012.B.dialogueact817	1251.23	1251.49	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact820	1252.18	1252.5	A	PhD	fg	-1	0	so
Bmr012.E.dialogueact819	1251.78	1259.02	E	Grad	s	-1	0	It just seems to me that , you know small changes to the language model and the vocabulary will so swamp that that it may be premature to worry about that .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact821	1259.27	1262.14	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean so one is a half a percent better than the other
Bmr012.E.dialogueact822	1262.33	1264.15	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I don't think that gives you any information .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact823	1265.27	1268.9	C	PhD	fg|s^nd	-1	0	Well it 's just as easy to {disfmarker} to give you the sixteen K individual ,
Bmr012.E.dialogueact824	1267.43	1267.73	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact825	1268.9	1272.08	C	PhD	s	-1	0	it was just more disk space you know for storing them
Bmr012.B.dialogueact826	1271.56	1277.45	B	Professor	qr	+1	0	Are you {disfmarker} are you using uh uh mel cepstrum or PLP over there ?
Bmr012.C.dialogueact827	1272.13	1272.31	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	so
Bmr012.A.dialogueact828	1277.53	1278.16	A	PhD	s	+1	0	Mel cepstrum .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact829	1278.94	1279.88	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So probably doesn't matter .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact830	1282.61	1283.2	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Well we could try .
Bmr012.F.dialogueact831	1282.99	1283.65	F	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	There 's {disfmarker} there 's your answer .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact832	1283.8	1284.92	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but it wouldn't hurt to try ,
Bmr012.C.dialogueact833	1284.03	1284.78	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Could easily try
Bmr012.A.dialogueact834	1284.59	1286.44	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	That 's what I would assume but you never know ,
Bmr012.B.dialogueact835	1285.02	1285.12	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah .

Bmr012.B.dialogueact841	1288.8	1295.4	B	Professor	s	-1	0	PLP uses uh auto - regressive filtering and uh modeling and so it can be sensitive to the kind of filtering that you 're doing

Bmr012.C.dialogueact845	1303.19	1308.09	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Well we can try it if you generate like the same set of files just up to that point where we stopped anyway
Bmr012.C.dialogueact846	1308.09	1310.23	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	and just sti stick them somewhere
Bmr012.F.dialogueact847	1308.8	1310.32	F	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} it 's really not a problem .

Bmr012.B.dialogueact902	1371.4	1371.97	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact903	1371.41	1373.13	E	Grad	s	-1	0	And I have no idea what filter it 's using ,
Bmr012.F.dialogueact901	1371.19	1376.45	F	Grad	qy	-1	0	Is eight kilohertz {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is eighty kilohertz generally accepted as like standard for voice ?
Bmr012.E.dialogueact904	1373.13	1373.36	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	so
Bmr012.B.dialogueact906	1376.08	1377.38	B	Professor	s	-1	0	For telephone stuff .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact905	1376.03	1376.85	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Telephone .

Bmr012.F.dialogueact908	1376.89	1377.84	F	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Yeah that 's what I was gonna say ,
Bmr012.F.dialogueact909	1377.84	1378.32	F	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	I mean like {disfmarker}
Bmr012.B.dialogueact911	1379.41	1384.77	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's just that they were operating from Switchboard which was a completely telephone database
Bmr012.F.dialogueact910	1379.37	1379.9	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	so
Bmr012.F.dialogueact912	1383.37	1383.92	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , I see ,
Bmr012.F.dialogueact913	1383.92	1384.35	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	so .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact915	1384.77	1387.61	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	and so that was a standard for that sixteen s
Bmr012.F.dialogueact914	1384.73	1385.09	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact916	1385.98	1389.36	E	Grad	s	-1	0	So sixteen seems to be pretty typical for with this sort of thing .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact918	1388.59	1392.49	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	Sixteen is more common for {disfmarker} for uh broadband stuff that isn't {disfmarker}
Bmr012.F.dialogueact917	1388.21	1388.48	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact919	1392.92	1393.62	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	That isn't music .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact920	1394.23	1395.8	B	Professor	s	+1	0	that isn't music and isn't telephone ,
Bmr012.C.dialogueact921	1394.47	1404.65	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	And I guess if you 're comparing like {disfmarker} uh if you wanna run recognition on the PZM stuff you would want you don't want to downsample the wh that
Bmr012.B.dialogueact922	1396.36	1396.51	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact923	1404.3	1404.73	E	Grad	qw^rt	-1	0	Why is that ?
Bmr012.B.dialogueact925	1405.05	1405.5	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I don't know .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact924	1404.65	1404.83	C	PhD	qy^d^g.%	-1	0	right ?
Bmr012.C.dialogueact926	1406.16	1407.62	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Well I don I mean if it 's any better
Bmr012.B.dialogueact927	1408.32	1413.45	B	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	No actually I would think that you would {disfmarker} you would get better {disfmarker} you 'd get better high frequencies in the local mike .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact928	1409.67	1410.7	E	Grad	s	-1	0	All the way around I 'd think .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact929	1414.44	1415.31	B	Professor	fh|qh	-1	0	Uh but who knows ?
Bmr012.B.dialogueact932	1415.73	1418.13	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean we do {vocalsound} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we wanna find all this stuff out ,
Bmr012.C.dialogueact930	1415.43	1415.68	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah
Bmr012.C.dialogueact933	1415.78	1416.54	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	well we could try it .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact931	1415.66	1416.14	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact934	1418.13	1418.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we don't know .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact935	1418.14	1421.06	E	Grad	s	-1	0	We 're gonna have plenty of low frequency on the P Z Ms with the fans .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact936	1418.73	1419.01	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	OK .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact937	1420.72	1420.95	C	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact938	1421.39	1421.85	B	Professor	h|s^aa	-1	0	Uh yeah .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact939	1422.93	1423.26	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact940	1422.95	1423.09	C	PhD	fg	-1	0	Oh yeah
Bmr012.C.dialogueact941	1423.09	1427.27	C	PhD	s^tc.%--	-1	0	there was just one more thing I wanted to say which is totally unrelated to the recognition except that
Bmr012.C.dialogueact942	1427.27	1427.67	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	um
Bmr012.C.dialogueact943	1428.42	1430.63	C	PhD	s	-1	0	well {disfmarker} well it 's sort of related
Bmr012.C.dialogueact944	1430.67	1431.32	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	but um
Bmr012.C.dialogueact945	1431.59	1432.53	C	PhD	s	-1	0	good news also
Bmr012.C.dialogueact946	1432.99	1433.9	C	PhD	fh|s.%--	-1	0	uh I got {disfmarker}
Bmr012.C.dialogueact947	1434.26	1438.45	C	PhD	s	-1	0	well Chuck Fillmore agreed to record meetings but he had too many people in his meetings
Bmr012.C.dialogueact948	1438.45	1440.36	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and that 's too bad cuz they 're very animated
Bmr012.C.dialogueact949	1440.36	1445.77	C	PhD	s.%-	+1	0	and but uh Jerry also agreed so uh we 're starting on {disfmarker} on
Bmr012.A.dialogueact950	1445.41	1446.16	A	PhD	s^j	-1	0	They 're less animated .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact951	1447.28	1448.33	C	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	Well but he has fewer {disfmarker}
Bmr012.C.dialogueact952	1448.45	1450.26	C	PhD	s	-1	0	he {disfmarker} he won't have more than eight
Bmr012.C.dialogueact953	1450.26	1453.36	C	PhD	s	+1	2	and it 's a meeting on even deeper understanding , EDU ,
Bmr012.C.dialogueact954	1453.59	1454.59	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so that sounds interesting .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact956	1454.96	1457.01	C	PhD	s	-1	0	As a compliment to our front - end meeting
Bmr012.E.dialogueact955	1454.73	1455.35	E	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Dot EDU ?
Bmr012.C.dialogueact957	1457.99	1459.87	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	and um so that 's gonna start Monday
Bmr012.C.dialogueact958	1459.87	1473.74	C	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	and one of the things that I was realizing is um it would be really great if anyone has any ideas on some kind of time synchronous way that people in the meeting can make a comment to the person whose gonna transcribe it
Bmr012.C.dialogueact959	1474.28	1481.89	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	or {disfmarker} or put a {vocalsound} push a button or something when they wanna make a note about " oh boy you should probably erase those last few "
Bmr012.C.dialogueact960	1481.89	1485.76	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	or uh " wait I want this not to be recorded now "
Bmr012.C.dialogueact961	1485.76	1488.55	C	PhD	s^cs.%-	-1	0	or uh something like that s
Bmr012.B.dialogueact962	1487.02	1490.36	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Weren't we gonna do something with a pad at one point ?
Bmr012.G.dialogueact963	1490.07	1490.76	G	Postdoc	qy^d^rt	-1	0	The cross pads ?
Bmr012.E.dialogueact964	1490.79	1492.19	E	Grad	s^na	+1	1	Yeah , we could do it with the cross pads .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact965	1491.37	1498.04	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	Cuz I was thinking you know if {disfmarker} if the person who sets up the meeting isn't there and it 's a group that we don't know
Bmr012.C.dialogueact966	1498.49	1501.54	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um and this came up talking to {disfmarker} to Jerry also
Bmr012.C.dialogueact967	1501.54	1509.21	C	PhD	qy	-1	0	that you know is there any way for them to indicate {disfmarker} to make sure that the qu request that they have that they make explicitly get addressed somehow
Bmr012.B.dialogueact968	1508.82	1509.13	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact969	1509.21	1510.76	C	PhD	s	-1	0	so I don't know if anyone has ideas
Bmr012.C.dialogueact970	1510.76	1514.24	C	PhD	s^cs.%-	-1	0	or {disfmarker} you could even write down " oh it 's about three twenty five and " {disfmarker}
Bmr012.B.dialogueact971	1513.67	1517.66	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Well what I was just suggesting is {disfmarker} is we have these {disfmarker} this cross pad just for this purpose
Bmr012.E.dialogueact972	1516.42	1517.32	E	Grad	s^cs^na	-1	0	Yeah , and use that .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact974	1517.66	1518.28	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and just use that
Bmr012.E.dialogueact973	1517.32	1518.33	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Not a bad idea .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact976	1518.28	1519.05	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and if we sink it in {disfmarker}
Bmr012.C.dialogueact975	1517.99	1518.68	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That would be great .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact977	1519.05	1520.39	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	The other thing is eh
Bmr012.C.dialogueact978	1519.3	1519.75	C	PhD	s^ba^r	-1	0	That be great .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact979	1520.39	1524.09	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I don't know if you know this or if it 's a question for the mail to Dan
Bmr012.B.dialogueact980	1524.09	1531.2	B	Professor	qr^rt	+1	0	but is this thing of two eight channel boards a maximum for this setup or could we go to a third board ?
Bmr012.E.dialogueact981	1528.81	1529.24	E	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I don't know .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact982	1529.78	1530.37	E	Grad	s^no^r	-1	0	I don't know .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact983	1531.28	1532.64	E	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	I 'll send mail to Dan and ask .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact984	1532.64	1537.01	E	Grad	s	+1	0	I {disfmarker} I think that it 's the maximum we can do without a lot of effort
Bmr012.E.dialogueact985	1537.01	1540.97	E	Grad	s	+1	0	because it 's one board with two digital channels .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact986	1539.56	1540.33	B	Professor	s^bk^m	-1	0	Oh it is one board .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact987	1541.91	1542.57	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	E eight each .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact988	1542.64	1544.92	E	Grad	s	+1	0	So it {disfmarker} it takes two fibers in to the one board .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact989	1545.29	1548.8	E	Grad	s	+1	0	And so w I think if we wanna do that {disfmarker} more than that we 'd have to have two boards ,
Bmr012.E.dialogueact990	1549.12	1550.52	E	Grad	s	+1	0	and then you have the synchronization issue .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact991	1552.64	1553.95	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But that 's a question because that would {disfmarker}
Bmr012.B.dialogueact992	1554.1	1556.27	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	if it was possible cuz it is i
Bmr012.B.dialogueact993	1556.4	1560.4	B	Professor	s	+1	1	you know already we have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a group of people in this room that cannot all be miked
Bmr012.E.dialogueact994	1560.34	1560.55	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact995	1560.98	1562.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and it 's not just cuz we haven't been to the store ,
Bmr012.B.dialogueact996	1562.59	1562.78	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right
Bmr012.B.dialogueact997	1562.78	1563.22	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr012.D.dialogueact998	1562.92	1565.35	D	PhD	qw	-1	0	What is the limit on each of those f fiber channels ,
Bmr012.D.dialogueact999	1565.35	1566.02	D	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	is it the
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1000	1566.01	1566.22	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Eight .
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1001	1567.52	1568.84	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	It just {disfmarker} it 's eight channels come in ,
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1003	1568.84	1570.21	D	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	does it have do with the sampling rate ?
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1002	1568.8	1569.34	E	Grad	s.%	-1	0	It 's eight .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1004	1570.28	1570.86	E	Grad	s^no	-1	0	I have no idea .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1005	1572.62	1576.36	E	Grad	s	-1	0	But each {disfmarker} each fiber channel has eight {disfmarker} eight channels
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1006	1576.81	1580.52	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and there are two ch two fibers that go in to the card .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1007	1581.82	1582.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It might be a hard limitation ,
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1008	1582.15	1582.31	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	So
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1009	1582.94	1587.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean one thing is it {disfmarker} the whole thing as I said is {disfmarker} is all structured in terms of forty - eight kilohertz sampling
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1010	1587.59	1590.14	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so that pushes requirements up a bit
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1011	1588.94	1589.11	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1013	1590.14	1590.85	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1012	1589.67	1591.48	D	PhD	s	-1	0	I was just wondering if {disfmarker} if that could change .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1014	1590.37	1594.62	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean then we 'd also have to get another ADD and another mixer and all that sort of stuff .
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1015	1592.23	1593.13	D	PhD	s	-1	0	If we could drop that .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1016	1595.59	1596.43	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1017	1595.77	1597.26	E	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	So I {disfmarker} I 'll send a mail to Dan and ask him .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1018	1598.25	1598.53	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1019	1598.3	1599.31	E	Grad	qy^bu^t.%--	-1	0	OK on the uh
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1020	1599.31	1600.04	E	Grad	qy^rt^t	-1	0	are we done with that ?
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1021	1600.04	1603.71	E	Grad	s^t^tc	+1	1	So the oth topic is uh getting more mikes and different mikes ,
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1022	1604.07	1604.94	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so I got a quote
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1023	1605.17	1605.48	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	um
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1024	1606.33	1608.91	E	Grad	s	+1	0	We can fit {disfmarker} we have room for one more wireless
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1025	1609.36	1610.03	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and the wireless ,
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1026	1610.03	1612.96	E	Grad	s	-1	0	this unit here is three fifty {disfmarker} three hundred fifty dollars ,
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1027	1613.22	1616.65	E	Grad	s^co	-1	0	it {disfmarker} I didn't realize but we also have to get a tuner {disfmarker} the receiver {disfmarker} the other end ,
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1028	1616.65	1617.81	E	Grad	s	-1	0	that 's uh four thirty
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1029	1618.71	1620.67	E	Grad	fh|s.%-	-1	0	um and then also
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1031	1619.97	1621.0	C	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	For {disfmarker} for each ?
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1030	1619.76	1620.05	D	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	Wow .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1032	1621.33	1623.3	C	PhD	qy^bsc^bu^d^rt	-1	0	I mean the tuner is four thirty for each .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1033	1623.38	1623.62	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1034	1623.96	1624.38	C	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	Wow .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1035	1624.37	1626.04	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	And we just need one more so {disfmarker} so
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1036	1625.51	1626.95	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Yeah at least w we got the good ones .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1037	1627.1	1627.3	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1038	1628.23	1631.42	E	Grad	s	-1	0	So that 's you know something like seven hundred eighty bucks for one more of these .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1039	1629.12	1629.58	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1040	1631.29	1631.6	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1041	1631.76	1638.56	E	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	Um and then also um It turns out that the connector that this thing uses is proprietary of Sony
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1042	1638.71	1638.74	D	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1043	1639.32	1639.91	E	Grad	s	-1	0	believe it or not
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1044	1639.91	1641.97	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and Sony only sells this headset .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1045	1640.0	1640.7	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1046	1643.13	1652.2	E	Grad	s	-1	0	So if we wanna use a different set {disfmarker} headset the solution that the guy suggested and they {disfmarker} apparently lots of people have done is Sony will sell you the jack with just wires coming out the end
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1047	1652.2	1657.02	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and then you can buy a headset that has pigtail and solder it yourself .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1048	1657.87	1659.0	E	Grad	s	-1	0	And that 's the other solution
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1049	1659.0	1661.29	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and so the jacks are forty bucks apiece
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1050	1661.71	1669.66	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and the {disfmarker} he recommended um a crown CM three eleven AE headset for two hundred bucks apiece .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1051	1669.86	1671.9	B	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	There isn't this some sort of thing that plugs in ,
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1052	1671.9	1674.0	B	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	you actually have to go and do the soldering yourself ?
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1053	1674.42	1683.83	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Becau - the reason is the only {disfmarker} only thing you can get that will plug into this is this mike or just the connector .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1054	1680.49	1681.21	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	No I understand .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1055	1682.84	1688.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	The reason I ask is these sort of handmade uh wiring jobs fall apart in use
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1056	1689.36	1695.94	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so the other thing is to see if we can uh get them to do a custom job and put it together for this .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1057	1695.34	1697.05	E	Grad	s^na	-1	0	Oh I 'm sure they would , they would just charge us ,
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1058	1697.08	1698.64	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , and they 'd probably want quantity too ,
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1059	1697.32	1697.54	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	so .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1061	1699.09	1699.46	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Well
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1060	1698.64	1698.8	D	PhD	%	-1	0	they 'd
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1062	1700.06	1700.98	B	Professor	s^ar|s^ng	-1	0	no they 'll just charge us more ,
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1063	1701.15	1702.48	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	so it 's {disfmarker} this
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1064	1701.16	1701.46	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1065	1702.28	1708.61	E	Grad	qy	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so my question is should we go ahead and get na nine identical head - mounted crown mikes ?
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1066	1708.9	1712.9	B	Professor	s^arp^co	-1	0	Not before having one come here and have some people try it out .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1067	1712.7	1712.99	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1068	1714.1	1716.72	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Because there 's no point in doing that if it 's not gonna be any better .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1069	1716.86	1720.96	E	Grad	qw^cs	+1	0	So why don't we get one of these with the crown with a different headset ?
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1070	1721.57	1721.91	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1071	1722.41	1723.83	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and see if that works .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1072	1723.54	1726.21	B	Professor	s^2^cs	-1	0	And see if it 's preferable and if it is then we 'll get more .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1073	1725.48	1726.22	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Comfort .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1074	1726.06	1726.31	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr012.C.dialogueact1076	1728.42	1730.84	C	PhD	s	-1	0	Cuz I mean I think the microphones are OK
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1077	1730.84	1731.87	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	it 's just the {disfmarker} the
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1078	1731.01	1731.22	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Right ,
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1079	1731.22	1732.61	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	it 's just they 're not comfortable to wear .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1080	1734.24	1734.66	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1081	1734.4	1736.24	C	PhD	s^cs^j.%-	-1	0	Could make our own handbands and
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1082	1735.98	1739.61	E	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Um , and he said they don't have any of these in stock but they have them in LA
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1083	1739.66	1741.37	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and so it will take about a week to get here .

Bmr012.B.dialogueact1162	1827.54	1829.56	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	no it depends on the hand - held
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1161	1827.46	1827.96	E	Grad	qy^2^rt	-1	0	Is awful ?
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1163	1829.56	1837.59	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	but hand {disfmarker} many hand - helds are built wi with sort of uh anti - shock sort of things so that it {disfmarker} it is less uh susceptible to hand noises .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1165	1837.89	1840.95	B	Professor	s	-1	0	If you hold the lapel mike i you just get all k sorts of junk .

Bmr012.E.dialogueact1174	1848.16	1851.82	E	Grad	s^r	-1	0	I wonder if they have one that will hook up to this or whether again we 'll have to wire it ourselves .
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1175	1850.49	1851.89	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , you wouldn't want it to hook there
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1176	1851.89	1853.7	D	PhD	s	-1	0	you 'd just want it to hook into the receiver in the other room ,
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1177	1853.7	1854.02	D	PhD	qy^bu^d^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1178	1854.81	1855.2	B	Professor	s^ar|s.%--	-1	0	No that 's uh {disfmarker}

Bmr012.B.dialogueact1187	1865.06	1868.11	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But you need a ra but it has to correspond to the receiver .
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1188	1865.13	1866.43	D	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Have a little antenna coming out the bottom .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1189	1867.2	1870.65	E	Grad	s^cs^rt	-1	0	It 's gonna be much easier to get one of these and just plug in a mike ,
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1190	1870.65	1871.02	E	Grad	qy^bu^d^g^rt	-1	0	isn't it ?
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1191	1871.16	1872.23	D	PhD	s^ng.%--	-1	0	But then the mike has to h
Bmr012.A.dialogueact1192	1872.62	1873.65	A	PhD	qy	-1	0	Do you have to hand it around
Bmr012.A.dialogueact1193	1873.65	1874.7	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and if you have two pieces of
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1195	1874.1	1874.42	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	No no {disfmarker}

Bmr012.B.dialogueact1199	1875.65	1876.5	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	so this is a good point ,
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1200	1876.5	1879.43	B	Professor	s	+1	0	so yeah you have these {disfmarker} these mikes with a little antenna on the end
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1202	1879.43	1879.8	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right ?
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1201	1879.37	1879.67	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1203	1879.78	1882.47	E	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	And do you think you would be able to use the same receiver ?
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1204	1882.7	1883.29	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	I don't know .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1206	1883.59	1884.54	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	You 'll have to check with them ,
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1205	1883.51	1884.28	E	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	OK I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll ask .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1208	1884.54	1884.83	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1210	1884.91	1886.81	B	Professor	s^ba	+1	0	But that 's {disfmarker} that 's a great idea
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1209	1884.59	1885.36	D	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's just a frequency .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1207	1884.51	1884.67	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1211	1886.81	1891.32	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	and then just sort of have that as the {disfmarker} and then you can have groups of twenty people or whatever
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1212	1891.32	1892.03	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and uh
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1213	1891.56	1900.88	C	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah because there 's only I mean as Andreas pointed out actually I think in the large {disfmarker} the larger the group the less interaction {disfmarker} the less people are talking um over each other {disfmarker}
Bmr012.A.dialogueact1214	1893.44	1893.91	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Pretty soon .
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1215	1899.23	1899.6	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm , yeah .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1216	1900.88	1904.31	C	PhD	s	-1	0	it just {disfmarker} there might be a lot of people that speak once or twice
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1217	1904.31	1904.43	C	PhD	fh	-1	0	and
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1218	1905.58	1905.83	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr012.A.dialogueact1219	1910.4	1912.18	A	PhD	fg|s^tc	-1	0	Um Gotta go .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1220	1911.73	1912.31	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Off you go ,
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1221	1912.5	1912.77	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	yeah .

Bmr012.E.dialogueact1223	1913.46	1915.32	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so I guess people who have to leave can leave
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1224	1915.32	1917.91	E	Grad	qr^rt^t	-1	0	and do we have anything else to discuss or should we just do digits ?
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1225	1917.64	1920.6	G	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I thought of some extra {disfmarker} a couple of extra things I 'd like to mention .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1226	1919.32	1919.51	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1227	1921.17	1924.29	G	Postdoc	s	+1	0	One of them is to give you a status in terms of the transcriptions so far .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1228	1924.64	1929.11	G	Postdoc	fh|s	+1	0	So um as of last night um I 'd assigned twelve hours and they 'd finished nine
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1229	1926.59	1934.83	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	uh Yep ,
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1230	1929.2	1931.5	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and my goal was to have eleven done by the end of the month ,
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1231	1931.72	1933.28	G	Postdoc	s	+1	1	I think that by tomorrow we 'll have ten .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1232	1933.81	1934.53	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Uh it 's great {disfmarker}
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1234	1934.37	1934.83	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Pretty close ,

Bmr012.G.dialogueact1242	1940.22	1940.43	G	Postdoc	s^ft	-1	0	Thanks .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1243	1941.14	1946.55	G	Postdoc	s^cs^t	+1	2	And then um also an idea for another meeting , which would be to have the transcribers talk about the data
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1244	1947.26	1949.38	G	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	It 's sort of a {disfmarker} a little bit {disfmarker} a little bit
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1245	1948.02	1949.15	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That 's a great idea .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1247	1948.88	1949.66	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	Super idea .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1246	1948.6	1948.78	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep ,
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1248	1949.02	1949.98	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	that 'd be very interesting .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1250	1949.59	1953.68	C	PhD	s^ba^r	-1	0	That 's a great idea cuz I 'd like to g have it recorded so that we can remember all the little things ,
Bmr012.F.dialogueact1249	1949.44	1949.79	F	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1251	1950.22	1951.61	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	I 'd love to hear what they have to say .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1252	1952.82	1953.02	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1254	1953.84	1954.6	C	PhD	s^ba^r	-1	0	that 's a great idea .
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1253	1953.44	1957.78	D	PhD	s^cs^j	-1	0	So if we got them to talk about this meeting , it would be a meta {disfmarker} meta meeting .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1255	1954.7	1954.78	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1256	1955.4	1957.38	G	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , exa {vocalsound} exactly
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1257	1957.38	1958.88	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I guess {disfmarker} nested several layers ,
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1258	1958.59	1960.87	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Now you have eight transcribers and there 's ten of us
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1259	1959.28	1959.47	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	but
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1260	1960.87	1962.58	B	Professor	qw^d	-1	0	so how do we do this , is the only thing .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1261	1963.03	1964.91	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Or just have them talk amongst themselves .
Bmr012.D.dialogueact1262	1963.62	1964.6	D	PhD	s^2^cs	-1	0	Have them have their own meeting .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1264	1965.54	1966.16	C	PhD	%--	-1	0	And have
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1263	1965.37	1966.27	G	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Well that 's what I 'm thinking ,
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1266	1966.74	1967.23	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1265	1966.27	1966.57	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	yeah .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1267	1966.79	1969.69	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Have them talk about the data and they {disfmarker} and they 've made observations to me
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1268	1967.38	1968.64	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	that would be great .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1269	1969.69	1974.08	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	like they say uh you know this meeting that we think has so much overlap , in fact it does
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1270	1974.31	1976.87	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but there are other groups of similar size that have very little ,
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1271	1976.87	1978.67	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know it 's part of it 's {disfmarker} it 's the norm of the group and all that
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1272	1978.67	1981.0	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and they have various observations that would be fun , I think .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1273	1980.4	1981.22	C	PhD	s^ba	+1	0	That 's a great idea .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1274	1981.32	1982.72	E	Grad	s^ba	+1	0	Yeah , I 'd like to hear what they s say .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1275	1981.36	1981.51	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.C.dialogueact1276	1982.45	1982.87	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Be great .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1278	1983.13	1988.31	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	So maybe we could {disfmarker} they could have a meeting more or less without us that {disfmarker} to do this and we should record it
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1277	1982.65	1982.89	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1279	1988.71	1993.77	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and then maybe one or two of them could come to one of these meetings and {disfmarker} and could you know could tell us about it .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1280	1988.82	1989.03	G	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1281	1991.93	1992.78	E	Grad	s^2^cs	-1	0	Give us a status .

Bmr012.C.dialogueact1288	1996.77	2000.54	C	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} they will get to transcribe their own meeting but they also get paid for having a break
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1287	1996.61	1997.22	E	Grad	s	-1	0	That would be weird .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1286	1996.15	1996.5	G	Postdoc	qw.%-	-1	0	What {disfmarker} what
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1289	1998.42	1998.77	G	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	yeah that 's right .

Bmr012.B.dialogueact1301	2008.89	2009.24	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1302	2009.5	2015.32	G	Postdoc	s^rt^t	-1	0	And then I wanted to also um say something about the Fiscus uh uh John {disfmarker} John Fiscus visit tomorrow .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1303	2016.15	2018.87	G	Postdoc	s^rt	-1	0	And Which is to say that w it 'll be from nine to one
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1304	2019.12	2024.11	G	Postdoc	s^cc	-1	0	that I 'm going to uh uh offer the organization {disfmarker} allow him to uh adjust it if he wishes
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1305	2024.11	2026.08	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but to be basically in three parts ,
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1306	2026.08	2030.5	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	the acoustic part coming first which would be basically the room engineering aspects
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1307	2030.5	2031.85	G	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	um other things
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1308	2032.03	2033.95	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and he 'll be also presenting what NIST is doing
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1309	2034.11	2036.27	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and uh then uh
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1310	2036.27	2039.47	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	number two would be sort of a the {disfmarker} the transcription process
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1311	2039.47	2044.25	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so this would be a focus on like presegmentation and the modifications to the {disfmarker} the multitrans interface
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1312	2044.25	2048.25	G	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	which allows more refined encoding of the beginnings and ends of the overlapping segments
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1313	2049.01	2050.31	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	which uh Dave Gelbart 's been doing
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1314	2050.79	2054.48	G	Postdoc	fh|s	-1	0	and then um uh and of course the presegmentation Thilo 's been doing
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1315	2054.98	2056.38	G	Postdoc	fh|s.%--	-1	0	and then um the third part would {disfmarker}
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1316	2056.38	2059.66	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and again he has some stuff that 's i relevant with respect to NIST
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1317	2059.66	2062.1	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and then the third one would be focus on transcription standards
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1318	2062.1	2067.87	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so at NIST he 's interested in this establishment of a global encoding standard I guess I would say
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1319	2067.87	2068.45	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and I want it ,
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1320	2068.52	2069.04	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	you know k
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1321	2069.18	2069.29	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	yeah
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1322	2069.58	2074.81	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	see what they 're doing and also present what {disfmarker} what we 've chosen as ours and {disfmarker} and discuss that kind of thing .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1323	2075.97	2078.44	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And so but he 's only here until until one
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1324	2078.44	2080.85	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and actually we 're thinking of noon being uh lunch time
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1325	2080.85	2084.28	G	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so basically hoping that we can get as much of this done as possible before noon .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1326	2085.28	2085.43	G	Postdoc	%	-1	0	S
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1327	2088.74	2089.29	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	OK .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1328	2089.91	2091.68	G	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	And everybody who wants to attend is welcome .
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1329	2092.17	2092.35	G	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	So
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1331	2092.76	2093.84	E	Grad	fg|qw^rt	-1	0	Oh , where you 're gonna meet ?
Bmr012.G.dialogueact1330	2092.67	2092.79	G	Postdoc	b	-1	0	yeah .

Bmr012.G.dialogueact1333	2094.73	2101.0	G	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	but I 've also reserved the BARCO room um eh to figure out how that works in terms of like maybe having a live demonstration .
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1334	2101.55	2101.74	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK
Bmr012.B.dialogueact1335	2101.74	2103.59	B	Professor	qy^d^rt	-1	0	but the nine o ' cl nine o ' clock will be i be in here .

Bmr012.J.dialogueact1370	2146.46	2149.04	J	Grad	fg|s^rt^tc	+1	0	OK , my name is uh Espen Eriksen .
Bmr012.J.dialogueact1371	2149.52	2150.11	J	Grad	s^rt	+1	1	I 'm a Norwegian .
Bmr012.J.dialogueact1372	2150.9	2152.97	J	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	Um uh this is my second semester at Berkeley .
Bmr012.J.dialogueact1373	2154.05	2158.43	J	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	Currently I 'm taking uh my first graduate level courses in DSP
Bmr012.J.dialogueact1374	2159.58	2165.18	J	Grad	fh|s^rt	-1	0	and um when I come back to Norway I 'm gonna continue with the {disfmarker} more of a research project work {disfmarker} kind of work .
Bmr012.J.dialogueact1375	2165.8	2172.56	J	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	So this semester I 'm starting up with a {disfmarker} with a small project through uh Dave Gelbart which I 'm taking a course with
Bmr012.J.dialogueact1376	2173.04	2175.21	J	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	I got in touch with him and he told me about this project .
Bmr012.J.dialogueact1377	2175.97	2182.58	J	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	So with the help of uh Dan Ellis I 'm gonna do small project associated to this .
Bmr012.J.dialogueact1378	2183.74	2192.11	J	Grad	s^cc	+1	1	What I 'm gonna try to do is uh use {disfmarker} use ech echo cancellation to uh to handle the periods where you have overlapping talk .
Bmr012.J.dialogueact1379	2193.59	2195.21	J	Grad	s	-1	0	To try to do something about that .
Bmr012.J.dialogueact1380	2195.86	2199.44	J	Grad	s	-1	0	So currently I 'm um I 'm just reading up on echo cancellation ,
Bmr012.J.dialogueact1381	2199.44	2201.87	J	Grad	s	-1	0	s looking into the theory behind that
Bmr012.J.dialogueact1382	2202.4	2205.14	J	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	and then uh hopefully I get some results .
Bmr012.J.dialogueact1383	2206.29	2209.57	J	Grad	s	-1	0	So it {disfmarker} it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a project goes over the course of one semester .
Bmr012.E.dialogueact1384	2210.18	2210.37	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Great .
Bmr012.J.dialogueact1385	2210.6	2212.14	J	Grad	s	-1	0	So I 'm just here today to introduce myself .
