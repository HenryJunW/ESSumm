One of ICSI's research groups at Berkley met to discuss progress on the current project , a tourism based dialogue system.
The small group had visual aids which assisted their discussion.
They have conducted the first test with a human playing the part of both automated and human operator , which provided valuable feedback.
They discussed the development of the belief network that will be behind the system.
They touched on representation , ontology , interaction , and the desire for a generalised system.
They also talked about upcoming meetings with people from different groups , and how they could benefit.
