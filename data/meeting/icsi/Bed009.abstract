Bed009.B.dialogueact265	937.24	943.17	B	Grad	h|s.x	+1	1	um {disfmarker} so far I 've thought of it as sort of adding it onto the modeler knowledge module .
Bed009.F.dialogueact547	1687.11	1694.31	F	Professor	s	+1	2	We talked about this several times that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the input end is gonna need a fair amount of feedback from the planning end .
Bed009.F.dialogueact1002	2810.9	2830.7	F	Professor	s	+1	1	So we talked about the fact that There 're going to be a certain number of decisions That you want the knowledge modeler to make , that will be then fed to the function module , that does uh , route planning .
2	Bed009.s.2	The meeting was largely focused on SmartKom's decision making capacity and how to adapt this functionality to the tourist information domain.
Bed009.B.dialogueact56	263.865	271.58	B	Grad	s	+1	1	and then that can be sort of developed uh as needed when we get {disfmarker} enter the tourism domain .
Bed009.F.dialogueact348	1164.11	1171.71	F	Professor	s	+1	2	We probably won't do this early on , because the current focus is more on the decision making and stuff like that .
