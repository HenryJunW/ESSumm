A number of data issues were resolved:
After discussing the human-computer interaction Smartkom data , the group decide that different types of data can be included in the meeting corpus , but that it should be structured into different directories according to data type.
Some of the data storage problems can be overcome by backing up using the NW archive.
However , file reorganisation will be left until just before zero-level back up.
The group decide to use IBM transcription of the digits , in addition to automatic methods.
If IBM methods work , transcribers will check and comment these.
Discussion of demos for the July meeting has been postponed: the individuals concerned will meet independently.
