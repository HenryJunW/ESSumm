Bro010.C.dialogueact184	409.576	411.536	C	Professor	s	+1	2	was about and people have longer latency though

Bro010.C.dialogueact199	423.941	424.711	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so they were basically i mean 
Bro010.C.dialogueact200	424.711	425.061	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	they were basically i mean 
Bro010.C.dialogueact201	426.418	430.148	C	Professor	s	-1	0	they were more or less treating competition for performance and we were 
Bro010.C.dialogueact202	430.148	434.083	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and we were trading latency performance and they were dealing 
Bro010.C.dialogueact203	434.083	436.992	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and they were dealing with noise explicitly and we were in 
Bro010.C.dialogueact204	437.072	439.729	C	Professor	s	-1	0	to so i think of it is complimentary

Bro010.C.dialogueact210	444.807	450.964	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so everything that we did in a way was it was just adamantly insisting on going in with a brain damage system which 
Bro010.C.dialogueact211	450.964	453.734	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	a brain damage system which is something actually we've done a lot over the last fifteen years 
Bro010.C.dialogueact212	454.306	457.776	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh just be say well this is the way we should do it and 
Bro010.C.dialogueact213	457.926	458.846	C	Professor	s	-1	0	we should do it and then they do it and 
Bro010.C.dialogueact214	458.926	462.773	C	Professor	s	-1	0	then they do it and then someone else that's something that straightforward so 
Bro010.C.dialogueact215	462.773	466.323	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that straightforward so we it would this is a test that largely had as of noise and we did we 
Bro010.C.dialogueact216	466.323	470.873	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and we did we ever did absolutely nothing explicitly to handle it it it's always 
Bro010.A.dialogueact217	471.155	471.495	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	we just 
Bro010.C.dialogueact218	471.766	475.03	C	Professor	s	-1	0	we just uh you know up systems to be more discriminate 
Bro010.C.dialogueact219	475.954	478.994	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and uh we did this uh ross to like filtering which

Bro010.C.dialogueact222	483.806	486.266	C	Professor	s	-1	0	was annoys me did we actually did nothing 
Bro010.C.dialogueact223	487.255	488.375	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bro010.C.dialogueact224	489.994	494.554	C	Professor	s	-1	0	thee uh spectra subtraction schemes couple places did seem to seem to do and i stopped and so

Bro010.C.dialogueact227	497.218	500.638	C	Professor	s	-1	0	we're talking about putting putting some of that in the mocha still keeping some of our stuff i think you should 
Bro010.C.dialogueact228	500.638	504.012	C	Professor	s	-1	0	of our stuff i think you should be able to end up with a system that's been both clearly clearly the way 
Bro010.C.dialogueact229	504.012	510.413	C	Professor	s	-1	0	clearly clearly the way that we're operating this other stuff does involve some like see to to get rid of most of that you get down to forty 
Bro010.C.dialogueact230	510.413	513.683	C	Professor	s	+1	1	get down to forty fifty miles second street after uh what's the word 
Bro010.C.dialogueact231	514.565	519.265	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	don't think there's any good reason for it in the application actually i mean you're 
Bro010.C.dialogueact232	519.265	523.91	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean you're you're you're speaking to recognize here in a remote server 
Bro010.C.dialogueact233	524.729	532.993	C	Professor	s	-1	0	a quarter second person processing to clean it up doesn't seem like it's good deal these

Bro010.C.dialogueact235	532.993	534.333	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	good deal these are large vocabulary thinks of the decoder 
Bro010.C.dialogueact236	534.333	536.613	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	thinks of the decoder should take a really long time 
Bro010.A.dialogueact238	538.31	543.78	A	PhD	s^na	-1	0	and i don't think anybody's going to notice the difference between a quarter of a second latency and thirty millisecond of latency 
Bro010.C.dialogueact237	537.841	538.311	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	and i don't think anybody's

Bro010.A.dialogueact244	570.731	574.841	A	PhD	s	-1	0	we would look for the end of another it's based on the silence detector

Bro010.C.dialogueact527	1098.69	1105.41	C	Professor	s	-1	0	well that's i mean that's what differs from different different tasks and difference uh circus attraction methods i mean 
Bro010.A.dialogueact529	1105.59	1105.72	A	PhD	b	-1	0	i mean 
Bro010.C.dialogueact528	1105.41	1118.54	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	i mean if you have uh fair sure it's the noise is is quite stationery than the smartest thing to do is use as much data as possible to estimate the noise get a much 
Bro010.C.dialogueact530	1118.65	1120.69	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	get a much better estimates attracted 
Bro010.A.dialogueact531	1120.9	1121.26	A	PhD	b	-1	0	but if it's 
Bro010.C.dialogueact532	1121.46	1131.1	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so do you but if it's airing at all which is going to be the case for almost any real situation forgetting factor or something 
Bro010.A.dialogueact533	1131.55	1137.64	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	so do you is there some long windows it extends into the past over which you calculate the average 
Bro010.C.dialogueact534	1139.1	1142.36	C	Professor	s	+1	2	well there's a lot of different ways of computing noise spectrum so one 
Bro010.C.dialogueact535	1142.36	1148.16	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so one of the things that uh hans inspector hersh did 
Bro010.C.dialogueact536	1148.25	1149.8	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro010.C.dialogueact537	1151.26	1159.67	C	Professor	s	-1	0	was to uh take some period of of of speech and in each band uh tilted his degree 
Bro010.C.dialogueact538	1160.21	1166.15	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so you get a decent hissed a gram of these energies takes at least a few seconds 
Bro010.C.dialogueact539	1166.62	1169.12	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah you can't do with smaller amount but it's pretty rare 
Bro010.C.dialogueact540	1169.12	1169.87	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	but it's pretty rare 
Bro010.C.dialogueact541	1171.09	1177.91	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	and um in fact i think the newest standard method of determining signal noise ratio is based on that 
Bro010.A.dialogueact543	1178.86	1179.58	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	a couple of seconds so no 
Bro010.C.dialogueact542	1178.67	1179.09	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	a couple of seconds so no 
Bro010.C.dialogueact544	1179.9	1180.1	C	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	of seconds no it's based on this kind of massive 
Bro010.C.dialogueact545	1180.1	1181.19	C	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	it's based on this kind of massive sister gram acid 
Bro010.A.dialogueact547	1181.43	1181.72	A	PhD	b	-1	0	sister gram acid 
Bro010.C.dialogueact546	1181.19	1182.18	C	Professor	s^e^nd	-1	0	sister gram acid t. v. history 
Bro010.C.dialogueact548	1182.59	1183.52	C	Professor	s	-1	0	t. v. history gram 
Bro010.C.dialogueact549	1184.1	1189.72	C	Professor	s	-1	0	now if you have signaling his noise noisy basically have these two bumps and has to grab 
Bro010.C.dialogueact550	1190.22	1192.29	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	but what's she could approximate is to conscience 
Bro010.A.dialogueact551	1192.9	1194.7	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	but what's don't they overlap sometimes 
Bro010.C.dialogueact552	1194.67	1195.01	C	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	okay so 
Bro010.A.dialogueact553	1195.19	1195.42	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay so 
Bro010.C.dialogueact554	1195.75	1197.31	C	Professor	s	-1	0	okay yeah so you have a mixture too graphic i 
Bro010.A.dialogueact555	1197.42	1197.7	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah i 
Bro010.C.dialogueact556	1198.01	1198.11	C	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	new g. m. figure 
Bro010.C.dialogueact557	1198.11	1199.91	C	Professor	s	-1	0	new g. m. figure out what it is so 
Bro010.A.dialogueact558	1199.38	1199.79	A	PhD	b	-1	0	out what it is so 
Bro010.C.dialogueact559	1199.91	1202.47	C	Professor	s	-1	0	out what it is so so basically now you have this picture to gosh and she's you know 
Bro010.C.dialogueact560	1202.47	1203.8	C	Professor	s	-1	0	and she's you know what they are and 
Bro010.C.dialogueact561	1203.8	1204.35	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	what they are and uh i mean you 
Bro010.C.dialogueact562	1204.35	1204.8	C	Professor	s^fa	-1	0	uh i mean you 
Bro010.C.dialogueact563	1204.8	1206.1	C	Professor	s^bsc	-1	0	uh i mean you and 
Bro010.C.dialogueact564	1206.68	1207.42	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	and uh so the scares you 
Bro010.C.dialogueact565	1207.42	1212.6	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh so the scares you at the sickness and what the noise and and or g. is in that band in the spectrum and then you look 
Bro010.C.dialogueact566	1212.6	1213.93	C	Professor	s	-1	0	in the spectrum and then you look over the whole thing and 
Bro010.C.dialogueact567	1213.93	1215.0	C	Professor	s	-1	0	over the whole thing and then i have a noise factor 
Bro010.C.dialogueact568	1216.32	1219.83	C	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	so uh i've got controversial others use that kind of method and 
Bro010.C.dialogueact569	1219.95	1229.71	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	kind of method and the other thing to do is which is sort of more trivial obvious is too uh determine your magical means that that uh there's a speech and some period and then 
Bro010.C.dialogueact570	1229.71	1230.89	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and some period and then to expect from its 
Bro010.A.dialogueact571	1230.92	1231.25	A	PhD	b	-1	0	to expect from its uh 
Bro010.C.dialogueact572	1231.79	1232.04	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh but 
Bro010.C.dialogueact573	1232.72	1233.1	C	Professor	%--	-1	0	but you know 
Bro010.C.dialogueact574	1233.85	1236.54	C	Professor	s	-1	0	you know it's that that that's tricky do has mistakes 
Bro010.C.dialogueact575	1236.54	1237.57	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	do has mistakes uh and 
Bro010.C.dialogueact576	1237.57	1242.21	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	uh and if you've got enough time uh this other method appears to be some uh 
Bro010.C.dialogueact577	1242.89	1253.9	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	uh a variant that after just determining signal to noise ratio is to just you can do it a uh neutered of saying yeah mike thing to determine means only i 
Bro010.C.dialogueact578	1254.0	1255.02	C	Professor	s	-1	0	guess is the and so but just just 
Bro010.C.dialogueact579	1255.12	1257.01	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	but just just determine the means only don't worry about 
Bro010.C.dialogueact580	1257.5	1258.7	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	don't worry about the variance and 
Bro010.A.dialogueact581	1258.61	1259.08	A	PhD	b	-1	0	the variance and then just use those mean 
Bro010.C.dialogueact582	1258.91	1266.76	C	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	the variance and then just use those mean values as being uh sing always ratio napping 
Bro010.A.dialogueact583	1268.41	1269.46	A	PhD	qw.%--	-1	0	but what is a 
Bro010.A.dialogueact584	1270.39	1273.68	A	PhD	s	+1	2	it seems like this kind of thing could add to the latency 
Bro010.A.dialogueact585	1274.25	1279.84	A	PhD	s^df	+1	2	i mean depending on where the window was that you use to calculate signal nice ratio yeah 
Bro010.B.dialogueact586	1280.08	1280.34	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	sure 
Bro010.B.dialogueact587	1280.46	1280.7	B	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	sure

Bro010.C.dialogueact591	1283.98	1285.14	C	Professor	s^df	+1	2	okay because you don't like the future right 
Bro010.C.dialogueact592	1285.14	1285.43	C	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	okay right 
Bro010.A.dialogueact593	1285.91	1286.04	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay well i i guess that was my question right you just yeah

Bro010.B.dialogueact608	1298.27	1304.64	B	PhD	s	+1	2	i could eat um if you want to as a good estimation on on station reno is you have to look in uh in the future i mean 
Bro010.B.dialogueact609	1304.64	1315.28	B	PhD	fh	-1	0	in the future i mean if you take your window and if you're raised around this window but you can expect revenues commissions if the noise in in the middle of the window not at the end so

Bro010.B.dialogueact618	1321.05	1322.52	B	PhD	s	+1	2	just look in the past i guess it 
Bro010.B.dialogueact619	1322.52	1326.71	B	PhD	s	+1	2	the past i guess it works because the noise uh uh almost area but

Bro010.E.dialogueact807	1677.49	1685.82	E	Grad	fh|s^cc	+1	2	um but i'm uh looking into extending the work done by larry all 
Bro010.E.dialogueact808	1686.46	1692.15	E	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	um they they have a system that's uh multi band um system but they're multi band 
Bro010.E.dialogueact809	1692.15	1697.3	E	Grad	s	+1	1	but they're multi band is is a little different than the way that we've been doing multi band in the past where 
Bro010.E.dialogueact810	1697.3	1708.34	E	Grad	s^e	+1	1	where where we've been uh taking sub and teachers in training up these new and that's and on on phonetic targets and then combining 
Bro010.E.dialogueact811	1708.34	1710.86	E	Grad	s^e	+1	1	and then combining them some somehow down the line 
Bro010.E.dialogueact812	1711.37	1711.76	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	um 
Bro010.E.dialogueact813	1712.17	1723.19	E	Grad	s	+1	1	they're they're taking sub and features and training up by detector that detects for uh these fanatics teachers for example 
Bro010.E.dialogueact814	1723.68	1729.29	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	for example um he present um uh a detector to detects honor it's 
Bro010.E.dialogueact815	1730.53	1734.07	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and so what what it basically is is um it's there's at the 
Bro010.E.dialogueact816	1734.82	1738.95	E	Grad	s	-1	0	at the lowest level there it's it's an or get on it and get 
Bro010.E.dialogueact817	1739.14	1743.59	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	seats on each side band you have several independent tests to 
Bro010.E.dialogueact818	1743.96	1748.03	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	tests to test whether um there's the existence assignments in a sub and and and 
Bro010.E.dialogueact819	1748.62	1752.01	E	Grad	s	-1	0	and and um it keep combine by a soft and gate and then at the 
Bro010.E.dialogueact820	1752.48	1754.23	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and then at the at the higher level for every 
Bro010.E.dialogueact821	1754.62	1756.15	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	for every if um the higher 
Bro010.E.dialogueact822	1756.26	1756.65	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	um the higher 
Bro010.E.dialogueact823	1756.88	1759.69	E	Grad	s	-1	0	um the higher level there's day sauced four gate 
Bro010.E.dialogueact824	1760.22	1774.42	E	Grad	s	-1	0	uh so if if this detector do text um the presence of of dishonor and in any of the sub bands and the detect uh the war gate at the top says okay well this frame has evidences hundreds and 
Bro010.A.dialogueact826	1775.3	1777.94	A	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	what're what are some of the low level detectors that they use these are all 
Bro010.E.dialogueact825	1774.82	1775.6	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	what're what and these are all 
Bro010.E.dialogueact827	1778.14	1778.52	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	oh okay well the low 
Bro010.E.dialogueact828	1778.52	1782.3	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	oh okay well the low level detectors are logistic regression is

Bro010.E.dialogueact895	1923.81	1925.14	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	and uh so 
Bro010.E.dialogueact896	1925.14	1925.53	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	so 
Bro010.E.dialogueact897	1926.54	1928.76	E	Grad	s	+1	1	so that's just that's just one detector 
Bro010.E.dialogueact898	1929.0	1932.47	E	Grad	s	+1	1	they can imagine building many of these detectors on different features you get enough 
Bro010.E.dialogueact899	1932.47	1940.2	E	Grad	s	+1	1	features you get enough of these detectors together then you have enough information to do um higher level discrimination for example of discriminating 
Bro010.E.dialogueact900	1940.2	1942.69	E	Grad	s^e	+1	1	for example of discriminating between phones and 
Bro010.A.dialogueact901	1942.64	1943.14	A	PhD	b	-1	0	phones and then you keep 
Bro010.E.dialogueact902	1943.01	1947.21	E	Grad	s	+1	1	then you keep working your way up and so you you build a full recognize or so 
Bro010.A.dialogueact903	1945.73	1946.23	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and so you you build a full recognize 
Bro010.E.dialogueact904	1947.92	1954.24	E	Grad	fh|s	+1	1	cool or so um that's that's the direction which i'm i'm thinking about going in like 
Bro010.A.dialogueact905	1953.15	1953.48	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	cool in like 
Bro010.C.dialogueact906	1955.84	1957.85	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah a number of properties that i really liked i mean 
Bro010.C.dialogueact907	1957.85	1968.17	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	that i really liked i mean one is like going towards um they're bad information for phonetic features of some sort rather than just 
Bro010.C.dialogueact908	1968.17	1973.22	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	rather than just uh immediately going for it uh the uh typical sound it's another 
Bro010.A.dialogueact909	1972.88	1973.23	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	typical sound it's another 
Bro010.C.dialogueact910	1973.65	1981.12	C	Professor	s	-1	0	another thing i like about it is that shoot this thing is going to be trained explicitly trained for product of errors rule which 
Bro010.C.dialogueact911	1981.85	1986.69	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	which is what uh now and going out that fletcher observed in the twenties 
Bro010.A.dialogueact912	1986.83	1987.22	A	PhD	b	-1	0	the twenties uh for people 
Bro010.C.dialogueact913	1987.31	1990.91	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh for people listening to their ban stuff that's friday talk 
Bro010.C.dialogueact914	1991.7	1992.72	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	and then um 
Bro010.C.dialogueact915	1994.07	1998.11	C	Professor	fh|s.%--	-1	0	the of thing i like about is 
Bro010.C.dialogueact916	1999.17	2002.63	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	uh and was played around with this in a different kind of way a little bit but better smackdown 
Bro010.C.dialogueact917	2002.63	2005.07	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	a little bit but better smackdown 
Bro010.C.dialogueact918	2006.09	2008.38	C	Professor	s	-1	0	this issue of where the targets comfort 
Bro010.C.dialogueact919	2009.34	2022.91	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so in our case when we betray multi band things the way we get the targets for the individual bands is um that we get the fanatic the sound 
Bro010.A.dialogueact920	2022.81	2023.24	A	PhD	b	-1	0	sound and say okay we train every 
Bro010.C.dialogueact921	2022.91	2024.03	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	sound and say okay we train every but this is saying 
Bro010.C.dialogueact922	2024.36	2027.93	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but this is saying is okay that's maybe what our ultimate goal is 
Bro010.C.dialogueact923	2028.27	2033.25	C	Professor	s	-1	0	or not ultimate penalty but goal is getting these these sound units but but 
Bro010.C.dialogueact924	2033.25	2034.69	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	but but um 
Bro010.C.dialogueact925	2035.5	2038.81	C	Professor	qw.%--	-1	0	along the way how much should we uh 
Bro010.C.dialogueact926	2039.25	2042.23	C	Professor	qw^rt	-1	0	what should we be train these intermediate things for 
Bro010.C.dialogueact927	2043.02	2048.27	C	Professor	s^no	-1	0	because uh we don't know uh that's this is a particularly good feature and there's no way 
Bro010.C.dialogueact928	2048.27	2049.23	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and there's no way to someone in the audience 
Bro010.C.dialogueact929	2049.34	2056.32	C	Professor	s	-1	0	to someone in the audience just today was asking what couldn't you have people go through a mark the individual bands and say where the where it was on rent they're not but 
Bro010.A.dialogueact930	2056.54	2056.92	A	PhD	b	-1	0	not but 
Bro010.C.dialogueact931	2056.89	2065.96	C	Professor	s	-1	0	not but you know i i think having a bunch of people listening to critical band wide uh texas speech right turn with i think could be possible it's ouch 
Bro010.E.dialogueact932	2062.75	2062.97	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	uh ouch 
Bro010.C.dialogueact933	2065.96	2068.52	C	Professor	s^df	-1	0	could be possible it's all going to sound like like sign like see more or less lot of i 
Bro010.A.dialogueact934	2068.19	2068.84	A	PhD	b	-1	0	or less lot of i 
Bro010.C.dialogueact935	2068.52	2068.75	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	or less lot of i

Bro010.C.dialogueact940	2071.92	2076.73	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it's very hard for someone to to the person to make that determination 
Bro010.C.dialogueact941	2077.39	2078.35	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so um 
Bro010.C.dialogueact942	2079.03	2082.39	C	Professor	fh|s^no	-1	0	we don't really know how those should be labeled it 
Bro010.C.dialogueact943	2082.92	2093.49	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it could speed that you should not be paying that much attention to certain bands for certain just yourself so 
Bro010.A.dialogueact944	2092.59	2092.96	A	PhD	b	-1	0	just 
Bro010.C.dialogueact945	2093.49	2101.57	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yourself so um what we have been doing they're just sort of mixing it all together certainly much much cruder than that we train these 
Bro010.C.dialogueact946	2101.57	2104.84	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	than that we train these things up 
Bro010.C.dialogueact947	2104.84	2107.6	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i guess that experiment she probably done 
Bro010.C.dialogueact948	2107.6	2114.08	C	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	she probably done stuff for you done separate uh that are peace on the different yeah forced alignment on 
Bro010.E.dialogueact949	2113.54	2113.77	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	peace on the different yeah forced 
Bro010.E.dialogueact950	2113.77	2116.8	E	Grad	s^e^rt	-1	0	peace on the different yeah forced alignment on these up and labels 
Bro010.C.dialogueact951	2116.97	2117.16	C	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	you've and labels yeah 
Bro010.E.dialogueact952	2117.26	2117.45	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	you've yeah 
Bro010.C.dialogueact953	2118.08	2118.61	C	Professor	s	-1	0	done that did did 
Bro010.C.dialogueact954	2118.61	2119.9	C	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	done that did did that help all 
Bro010.E.dialogueact955	2120.37	2123.6	E	Grad	h|s^aap	-1	0	um it helps for wondered one iterations but 
Bro010.E.dialogueact956	2123.6	2127.31	E	Grad	s^arp	-1	0	so iterations but um anything after that 
Bro010.C.dialogueact957	2127.86	2132.0	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so uh so that may or may it that aspect of it in may or may not be helpful because in the sense that same 
Bro010.C.dialogueact958	2132.0	2136.94	C	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	because in the sense that same sort of thing you're taking global information and the 
Bro010.C.dialogueact959	2137.6	2141.04	C	Professor	s	-1	0	how do they measure but this is this is uh i i think a little more drew 
Bro010.A.dialogueact960	2141.56	2144.13	A	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	how do they measure the performance their detector well he's like 
Bro010.C.dialogueact961	2141.66	2141.79	C	Professor	%-	-1	0	how do they measure 
Bro010.C.dialogueact962	2144.51	2149.82	C	Professor	s	-1	0	well he's like he's just actually looking at uh the confusion between son rent and then 
Bro010.A.dialogueact963	2150.76	2151.17	A	PhD	b	-1	0	so you can apply 
Bro010.C.dialogueact964	2151.26	2152.85	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so you can apply that to recognition if he 
Bro010.C.dialogueact965	2152.85	2154.31	C	Professor	s	-1	0	that to recognition if he did he did it's it's 
Bro010.C.dialogueact966	2154.58	2155.36	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it's it's just one 
Bro010.C.dialogueact967	2155.85	2160.99	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	just one of the concerns and the audience actually was 
Bro010.C.dialogueact968	2161.38	2165.57	C	Professor	s	-1	0	he he did a comparison too are all four all the the nasty 
Bro010.C.dialogueact969	2165.57	2172.36	C	Professor	s	-1	0	four all the the nasty old standard recognize no filter bank at the fountain nature demands and so forth and 
Bro010.C.dialogueact970	2172.93	2175.08	C	Professor	s	-1	0	forth and um it didn't do nearly as well especially in in 
Bro010.C.dialogueact971	2175.08	2176.6	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	especially in in noise 
Bro010.C.dialogueact972	2177.16	2177.73	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but the one the 
Bro010.C.dialogueact973	2177.73	2182.7	C	Professor	s	-1	0	but the one the good questions from the audience was well yeah but that wasn't trained for that i mean 
Bro010.C.dialogueact974	2182.8	2192.57	C	Professor	s	-1	0	for that i mean disuse a very smooth uh stuck drama low it's something that you know has evolved as being generally a good thing for speech recognition 
Bro010.C.dialogueact975	2193.61	2196.41	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	but if you knew that what you're going to do is just exxon or it's not so not it's 
Bro010.C.dialogueact976	2196.41	2204.7	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	not so not it's not it's is is almost like forced on voice except i guess that the voice stops or also called lobster joints 
Bro010.C.dialogueact977	2204.97	2205.39	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	joints 
Bro010.C.dialogueact978	2205.6	2206.21	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro010.C.dialogueact979	2207.14	2211.03	C	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	it's but with the exception of the stops i guess it's pretty much the same as wasting at least right so 
Bro010.A.dialogueact981	2211.28	2211.8	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	right so 
Bro010.C.dialogueact980	2211.03	2211.28	C	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right so 
Bro010.C.dialogueact982	2211.48	2212.15	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	right so 
Bro010.C.dialogueact983	2213.37	2213.68	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro010.C.dialogueact984	2214.65	2215.57	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	so um if 
Bro010.C.dialogueact985	2215.95	2217.06	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	um if you knew you were doing that if you're doing something say 
Bro010.C.dialogueact986	2217.06	2223.33	C	Professor	s	-1	0	if you're doing something say for you wouldn't use the same kind of features she would do something 
Bro010.C.dialogueact987	2223.33	2228.06	C	Professor	s	-1	0	she would do something that was sensitive to the period is uh and 
Bro010.C.dialogueact988	2228.74	2231.02	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh and so in that sense it was not fair test 
Bro010.C.dialogueact989	2231.35	2231.72	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bro010.C.dialogueact990	2232.4	2233.98	C	Professor	s	-1	0	so i think that the question was right 
Bro010.C.dialogueact991	2234.11	2236.14	C	Professor	s	-1	0	it was and that's that's not for test unless it was on it was 
Bro010.C.dialogueact992	2236.14	2242.59	C	Professor	s	-1	0	unless it was on it was interesting because uh this is what we are actually using for speech recognition these develops 
Bro010.C.dialogueact993	2242.59	2243.65	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	these develops and 
Bro010.C.dialogueact994	2243.65	2258.7	C	Professor	s	-1	0	didn't they and says that perhaps even you know trying to use them the best way we can't that that that we ordinarily do with you know gutsy mixtures dress and so forth you you don't uh actually do that well in determining whether something is honored or not which means 
Bro010.A.dialogueact995	2252.48	2252.93	A	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	didn't they dress and so 
Bro010.C.dialogueact996	2258.7	2263.26	C	Professor	s^e	-1	0	didn't they also do or not which means you're going to make errors between similar sounds that are so center drops 
Bro010.A.dialogueact997	2263.19	2265.88	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	didn't they also do some kind of an oracle experiment 
Bro010.A.dialogueact998	2266.28	2274.83	A	PhD	qy^d^e^rt	-1	0	where they said if we could detect dishonor it's perfectly and then show how it would improve speech recognition 
Bro010.A.dialogueact999	2275.25	2277.36	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	i thought i remember hearing about an experiment like that

Bro010.A.dialogueact1107	2444.0	2451.48	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um we just talked about some possible features that could be marked by humans and

Bro010.A.dialogueact1110	2453.17	2459.2	A	PhD	s	-1	0	because of having maybe some extra transcriber time we thought we could go through and mark some portion of the data for that and

Bro010.E.dialogueact1112	2459.84	2460.39	E	Grad	b	-1	0	and uh that's not 
Bro010.C.dialogueact1114	2460.44	2464.73	C	Professor	s	-1	0	uh yeah that's not an immediate problem and then we don't immediately have a lot of extra scraper time but 
Bro010.A.dialogueact1115	2464.59	2464.78	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	yeah scraper time but 
Bro010.A.dialogueact1117	2465.08	2465.29	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	right but uh 
Bro010.C.dialogueact1116	2464.73	2469.85	C	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah right scraper time but but uh in long term i guess truck it's going to continue the dialogue with you 
Bro010.C.dialogueact1118	2469.85	2470.84	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	with you 
Bro010.C.dialogueact1119	2471.76	2473.92	C	Professor	s	-1	0	i'm definitely and global undertake some 
Bro010.A.dialogueact1120	2473.69	2476.36	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i'm definitely interested in this area too uh acoustic 
Bro010.A.dialogueact1121	2476.5	2479.26	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	too uh acoustic the 
Bro010.C.dialogueact1122	2477.85	2478.12	C	Professor	b	-1	0	the

Bro010.C.dialogueact1130	2489.47	2495.96	C	Professor	fh|qy^co^d^rt^tc	+1	2	so uh what i paid two two minutes about what right 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1131	2494.98	2495.23	F	Grad	s^bk.%-	-1	0	right 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1132	2496.48	2496.65	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah okay so 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1133	2496.65	2496.99	F	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah okay so 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1134	2496.99	2497.77	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	yeah okay so um 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1135	2498.31	2502.89	F	Grad	s	+1	2	we're interested in um methods for farm makes speech recognition and um 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1136	2502.89	2508.16	F	Grad	s^e	+1	2	and um mainly uh methods to deal with the reverberations in the farming signals so um 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1137	2508.16	2509.07	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	so um one 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1138	2509.95	2515.71	F	Grad	s^e	+1	1	one approach would be um say m. s. g. in l. p. like was used in aurora wine and and 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1139	2515.71	2523.71	F	Grad	s	+1	1	wine and and um there are other approaches which actually attempt to remove the reverberations instead of being robust to it like an s. g. 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1140	2524.26	2536.11	F	Grad	s	+1	1	and so we're interested in um comparing the performance of um a robust approach like m. s. g. with these um speech enhancement or dinner do you refer d. reverberations approaches

Bro010.B.dialogueact1143	2544.01	2545.94	B	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	uh do your operation i agree

Bro010.B.dialogueact1145	2548.25	2550.12	B	PhD	qy^e^rt	-1	0	they saw to choose one microphone so severing

Bro010.B.dialogueact1147	2550.82	2551.76	B	PhD	qy^d^e^rt	-1	0	so severing microphone it 
Bro010.B.dialogueact1149	2551.76	2551.95	B	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	microphone it 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1150	2552.05	2552.46	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay well um 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1151	2552.46	2553.14	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	okay well um there was some 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1152	2553.56	2560.93	F	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	having there was some things that was done by um a guy named carlos i forget his last name who worked with he neck who um 
Bro010.C.dialogueact1153	2561.02	2561.57	C	Professor	s	-1	0	done it 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1154	2562.09	2562.33	F	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay who 
Bro010.C.dialogueact1156	2562.94	2563.25	C	Professor	b	-1	0	okay who um 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1155	2562.84	2563.69	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	okay who um 
Bro010.B.dialogueact1157	2564.13	2564.76	B	PhD	b	-1	0	um it was 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1158	2564.44	2570.44	F	Grad	s	-1	0	um it was like ross uh in the sense of it was empty called volition by filtering um 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1159	2571.03	2573.29	F	Grad	s	-1	0	except he used a longer time window like a sack 
Bro010.B.dialogueact1160	2573.27	2573.61	B	PhD	b	-1	0	like a sack 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1161	2573.73	2574.91	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	like a sack and maybe and 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1162	2574.91	2581.68	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	and maybe and the reason for that is ross this time window is too short to um include the whole um revert variation 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1163	2582.27	2583.16	F	Grad	s^no	-1	0	um i don't know what you call the reverberations response 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1164	2583.22	2584.63	F	Grad	s	-1	0	the reverberations response 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1165	2585.75	2587.4	F	Grad	s	-1	0	if if you see if you see what i mean the reverberations 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1166	2587.78	2597.46	F	Grad	s^df	-1	0	mean the reverberations filter for my mouth to that mike it's like it's got it's too long in the in the time domain for the um for the rest of filtering to take care of it 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1167	2598.18	2598.97	F	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1168	2599.66	2605.78	F	Grad	s	-1	0	then there are a couple of others speech announcing approaches which having being tried for speech recognition yeah but interesting 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1169	2605.78	2607.18	F	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah but interesting try for having spent which um 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1170	2607.18	2617.51	F	Grad	s^e	-1	0	which um have these assumptions that um you can do l. p. c. um and now says of the of the signal you got to the far microphone and and 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1171	2617.51	2622.3	F	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and and the um all pull filter that you get out of that should be good it's 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1172	2622.87	2628.73	F	Grad	s^e^rt	-1	0	it's justy um expectation signal there's going to be distorted by the reverberations 
Bro010.F.dialogueact1173	2629.29	2633.67	F	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	and so you can try and reconstruct a better expectations signal

Bro010.C.dialogueact1178	2651.79	2652.52	C	Professor	fh	-1	0	been chasing so uh we 
Bro010.C.dialogueact1179	2653.04	2654.13	C	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	have and when we're saying 
Bro010.C.dialogueact1180	2654.5	2657.87	C	Professor	s	+1	1	and when we're saying these just now we do have a close microphone signal and 
Bro010.C.dialogueact1181	2657.87	2659.96	C	Professor	s	+1	1	signal and then there's the distant microphone signal 
Bro010.C.dialogueact1182	2660.57	2667.85	C	Professor	s	+1	1	and you could as a kind of baseline say okay given that we have both of these uh we should be able to do uh cancellation 
Bro010.C.dialogueact1183	2668.55	2679.98	C	Professor	s	+1	1	so that uh essentially identify the system inbetween anytime very just between the two microphones and and and and read and denver 
Bro010.C.dialogueact1184	2680.99	2685.15	C	Professor	s	+1	1	or or cancel it out to to some some reasonable approximation
