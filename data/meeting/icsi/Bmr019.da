Bmr019.F.dialogueact61	88.04	88.3	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact63	88.47	92.07	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And I don't have {disfmarker} and I don't , um , have a cell phone
Bmr019.D.dialogueact64	92.052	92.612	D	PhD	qy^br^d^rt	-1	0	A cell phone ?
Bmr019.F.dialogueact65	92.07	94.59	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so I can't be having a conference call while driving .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact67	94.989	95.679	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	R r right .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact66	94.681	95.501	C	Postdoc	s^ar|s^ba	-1	0	No . {comment} It 's not good .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact69	95.679	96.279	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	So we have to {disfmarker} we {disfmarker}
Bmr019.C.dialogueact68	95.611	96.151	C	Postdoc	s^ba^r	-1	0	That 's not good .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact70	95.821	98.361	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Plus , it would make for interesting noise {disfmarker} background noise .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact71	97.366	98.336	B	Professor	%	-1	0	
Bmr019.E.dialogueact72	98.434	98.684	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact73	98.851	99.171	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker}
Bmr019.B.dialogueact74	99.866	104.416	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So we have to equip him with a {disfmarker} with a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} with a head - mounted , uh , cell phone
Bmr019.E.dialogueact75	101.848	104.658	E	Grad	fg|s^cs^j	-1	0	Ye - we and we 'd have to force you to read lots and lots of digits ,
Bmr019.B.dialogueact76	104.416	104.736	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker}
Bmr019.E.dialogueact78	104.848	107.088	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	so it could get real {disfmarker} {vocalsound} real car noise .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact77	104.63	105.1	F	PhD	s^aa^j	-1	0	Oh , yeah .
Bmr019.D.dialogueact79	105.425	105.845	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact80	105.81	106.27	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Oh , yeah .
Bmr019.G.dialogueact81	106.109	106.639	G	Grad	s^j^na	-1	0	Take advantage .
Bmr019.D.dialogueact82	109.349	110.609	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	And with the kids in the background .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact83	109.45	110.15	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I 'll let {disfmarker} I 'd let {disfmarker}
Bmr019.D.dialogueact84	110.789	111.019	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact85	110.89	113.29	F	PhD	s^j	-1	0	I let , uh , my five - year - old have a try at the digits ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact86	113.29	113.4	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	eh .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact87	113.984	114.304	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact88	116.01	118.02	E	Grad	fg|s^t^tc	-1	0	So , anyway , I can talk about digits .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact89	118.02	120.77	E	Grad	qr	-1	0	Um , did everyone get the results or shall I go over them again ?
Bmr019.E.dialogueact90	121.753	127.063	E	Grad	s	+1	1	I mean that it was basically {disfmarker} the only thing that was even slightly surprising was that the lapel did so well .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact91	127.802	132.22	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	Um , and in retrospect that 's not as surprising as maybe i
Bmr019.E.dialogueact92	132.44	135.01	E	Grad	s	-1	0	it shouldn't have been as surprising as I {disfmarker} as {disfmarker} as I felt it was .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact93	136.123	138.443	E	Grad	s	-1	0	The lapel mike is a very high - quality microphone .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact94	138.889	145.809	E	Grad	s	-1	0	And as Morgan pointed out , that there are actually some advantages to it in terms of breath noises and clothes rustling {pause} if no one else is talking .
Bmr019.D.dialogueact96	146.29	146.49	D	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact95	145.918	146.388	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact98	147.089	148.709	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um , so , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr019.G.dialogueact97	146.785	146.995	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact100	149.0	153.99	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Well , it 's {disfmarker} Yeah , sort of the bre the breath noises and the mouth clicks and so forth like that , the lapel 's gonna be better on .
Bmr019.G.dialogueact99	148.872	149.212	G	Grad	%-	-1	0	It 's g it {disfmarker}
Bmr019.D.dialogueact101	149.608	150.418	D	PhD	s	-1	0	Or the cross - talk .
Bmr019.D.dialogueact102	153.792	153.972	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact103	154.493	156.973	B	Professor	s	-1	0	The lapel is typically worse on the {disfmarker} on clothes rustling ,
Bmr019.B.dialogueact104	157.353	159.033	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	but if no one 's rustling their clothes ,
Bmr019.E.dialogueact105	159.13	161.83	E	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Right . I mean , a lot of people are just sort of leaning over and reading the digits ,
Bmr019.B.dialogueact106	161.333	162.543	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr019.E.dialogueact107	161.83	165.28	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so it 's {disfmarker} it 's a very different task than sort of the natural .
Bmr019.D.dialogueact108	163.731	163.961	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.D.dialogueact109	164.461	167.481	D	PhD	s^na	-1	0	You don't move much during reading digits , I think .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact111	165.596	165.806	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact110	165.28	165.57	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact112	167.324	167.644	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact113	167.43	167.93	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.G.dialogueact114	167.825	173.455	G	Grad	s	-1	0	Probably the fact that it picks up other people 's speakers {disfmarker} other people 's talking is an indication of that it {disfmarker} the fact it is a good microphone .
Bmr019.D.dialogueact115	170.117	170.307	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact117	174.031	177.511	B	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	Right . So in the digits , in most {disfmarker} most cases , there weren't other people talking .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact116	173.719	174.039	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact119	174.479	174.709	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.G.dialogueact118	174.284	174.534	G	Grad	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact121	177.511	177.651	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact120	177.443	180.293	F	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	D do the lapel mikes have any directionality to them ?
Bmr019.B.dialogueact122	180.982	182.122	B	Professor	s^nd|s^ar	-1	0	There typically don't , no .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact123	182.19	187.934	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Because I {disfmarker} I suppose you could make some that have sort of {disfmarker} that you have to orient towards your mouth ,
Bmr019.E.dialogueact125	188.151	189.141	E	Grad	s	-1	0	They have a little bit ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact124	187.934	188.774	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and then it would {disfmarker}
Bmr019.E.dialogueact126	189.141	190.751	E	Grad	s	-1	0	but they 're not noise - cancelling .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact127	190.751	191.521	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	So , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr019.B.dialogueact128	191.822	193.662	B	Professor	s	-1	0	They 're {disfmarker} they 're intended to be omni - directional .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact129	193.769	194.049	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact131	194.875	197.985	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And th it 's {disfmarker} and because you don't know how people are gonna put them on , you know .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact130	194.85	195.17	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact132	197.379	197.659	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact133	198.469	203.022	E	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	So , also , Andreas , on that one the {disfmarker} the back part of it should be right against your head .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact134	203.593	206.023	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	And that will he keep it from flopping aro up and down as much .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact135	206.36	207.34	F	PhD	s	-1	0	It is against my head .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact136	207.09	207.4	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact137	207.905	208.175	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact138	209.294	212.634	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Um . Yeah , we actually talked about this in the , uh , front - end meeting this morning , too .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact140	212.924	213.684	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	Much the same thing ,
Bmr019.E.dialogueact139	212.682	212.942	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact141	213.684	214.344	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and it was {disfmarker}
Bmr019.B.dialogueact142	214.907	230.407	B	Professor	s^rt	+1	0	uh , I mean , there the point of interest to the group was primarily that , um , {vocalsound} the , uh {disfmarker} the system that we had that was based on H T K , that 's used by , you know , {pause} all the participants in Aurora , {vocalsound} was so much worse {vocalsound} than the {disfmarker} than the S R
Bmr019.E.dialogueact143	225.089	225.589	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Everybody .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact144	230.407	247.411	B	Professor	s	+1	1	And the interesting thing is that even though , {vocalsound} yes , it 's a digits task and that 's a relatively small number of words and there 's a bunch of digits that you train on , {vocalsound} it 's just not as good as having a {disfmarker} a l very large amount of data and training up a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a nice good big {vocalsound} HMM .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact145	247.411	250.991	B	Professor	s	+1	1	Um , also you had the adaptation in the SRI system , which we didn't have in this .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact146	251.62	254.4	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um . So . Um .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact147	254.239	254.939	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And we know {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact148	255.354	257.894	F	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	Di - did I send you some results without adaptation ?
Bmr019.E.dialogueact149	258.103	258.293	E	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact151	258.803	262.193	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I s I think Stephane , uh , had seen them .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact150	258.773	260.293	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Or if you did , I didn't include them ,
Bmr019.E.dialogueact152	260.433	260.943	E	Grad	s^df.%-	-1	0	cuz it was {disfmarker}
Bmr019.B.dialogueact153	262.193	262.593	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact154	262.85	264.07	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Yeah , I think I did , actually .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact155	264.75	268.3	F	PhD	s	+1	1	So there was a significant loss from not doing the adaptation .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact156	268.69	268.97	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact157	269.23	269.62	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact158	270.38	271.83	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	A {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a couple percent or some
Bmr019.F.dialogueact159	271.83	272.13	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	I mean {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact160	273.185	274.935	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	Well , I don't know it {disfmarker} Overall {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact161	276.172	277.242	F	PhD	s^no	-1	0	Uh , I {disfmarker} I don't remember ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact162	277.242	284.516	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but there was {disfmarker} {nonvocalsound} there was a significant , um , loss or win {comment} from adaptation {disfmarker} with {disfmarker} with adaptation .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact163	285.57	287.07	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	And , um ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact164	288.2	289.56	F	PhD	s	-1	0	that was the phone - loop adaptation .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact165	289.56	300.435	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And then there was a very small {disfmarker} like point one percent on the natives {disfmarker} uh , win from doing , um , you know , adaptation to {pause} the recognition hypotheses .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact166	301.306	305.046	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And {pause} I tried both means adaptation and means and variances ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact167	305.046	308.316	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and the variances added another {disfmarker} or subtracted another point one percent .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact168	308.316	311.32	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So , {vocalsound} it 's , um {disfmarker} that 's the number there .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact169	311.36	316.952	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Point six , I believe , is what you get with both , uh , means and variance adaptation .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact170	312.005	312.285	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact171	317.632	320.612	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	But I think one thing is that , uh , I would presume {disfmarker}
Bmr019.B.dialogueact172	320.712	326.019	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	Hav - Have you ever t {vocalsound} Have you ever tried this exact same recognizer out on the actual TI - digits test set ?
Bmr019.F.dialogueact173	328.95	330.16	F	PhD	qw^br	-1	0	This exact same recognizer ?
Bmr019.F.dialogueact174	330.16	330.41	F	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact175	331.008	332.208	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	It might be interesting to do that .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact176	332.208	333.928	B	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	Cuz my {disfmarker} my {disfmarker} cuz my sense ,
Bmr019.B.dialogueact177	334.574	334.934	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact178	334.802	340.002	F	PhD	s	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but , I have {disfmarker} I mean , people {disfmarker} people at SRI are actually working on digits .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact179	335.98	337.46	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I bet it would do even slightly better .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact180	340.452	346.63	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I could {disfmarker} and they are using a system that 's , um {disfmarker} you know , h is actually trained on digits ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact181	347.2	355.32	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	um , but h h otherwise uses the same , you know , decoder , the same , uh , training methods , and so forth ,
Bmr019.B.dialogueact182	350.316	350.656	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact183	355.32	358.25	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	and I could ask them what they get {pause} on TI - digits .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact184	357.375	361.105	B	Professor	s^bk|s^cs^ng	+1	1	Yeah , bu although I 'd be {disfmarker} I think it 'd be interesting to just take this exact actual system
Bmr019.B.dialogueact185	361.105	362.475	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	so that these numbers were comparable
Bmr019.F.dialogueact186	361.438	362.238	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact188	362.475	363.785	B	Professor	s^cs^e	+1	1	and try it out on TI - digits .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact187	362.278	364.148	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , Adam knows how to run it ,
Bmr019.B.dialogueact191	364.39	364.63	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact189	364.127	365.067	E	Grad	s^aa|s^ba	-1	0	Yeah . No problem .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact190	364.278	366.841	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	so you just make a f
Bmr019.B.dialogueact192	365.01	365.25	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact193	365.47	365.71	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact194	366.04	369.61	B	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	Cuz our sense from the other {disfmarker} from the Aurora , uh , task is that {disfmarker}
Bmr019.E.dialogueact195	366.53	367.62	E	Grad	s	-1	0	And try it with TI - digits ?
Bmr019.F.dialogueact196	368.596	369.366	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact197	369.61	375.28	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	I mean , cuz we were getting sub one percent {vocalsound} numbers on TI - digits also with the tandem thing .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact198	372.251	373.071	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact200	375.28	377.87	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So , {vocalsound} one {disfmarker} so there were a number of things we noted from this .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact199	374.993	375.703	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact201	377.87	380.66	B	Professor	s	+1	0	One is , yeah , the SRI system is a lot better than the HTK {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact202	380.527	380.797	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact203	381.389	383.979	B	Professor	s	-1	0	this , you know , very limited training HTK system .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact204	383.319	383.959	F	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact205	384.422	395.563	B	Professor	s	+1	3	Uh , but the other is that , um , the digits {vocalsound} recorded here in this room with these close mikes , i uh , are actually a lot harder than the {pause} studio - recording TI - digits .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact207	395.973	402.743	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I think , you know , one reason for that , uh , might be that there 's still {disfmarker} even though it 's close - talking , there still is some noise and some room acoustics .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact206	395.923	396.663	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact208	401.525	402.305	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact209	403.109	410.099	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And another might be that , uh , I 'd {disfmarker} I would presume that in the studio , uh , uh , situation recording read speech that if somebody
Bmr019.B.dialogueact210	410.655	415.765	B	Professor	s	-1	0	did something a little funny or n pronounced something a little funny or made a little {disfmarker} that they didn't include it ,
Bmr019.E.dialogueact211	413.948	414.668	E	Grad	qy^2^bu^d^rt	-1	0	They didn't include it .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact212	415.765	416.865	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	they made them do it again .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact213	416.27	421.09	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Whereas , I took out {pause} the ones that I noticed that were blatant {disfmarker} that were correctable .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact214	420.444	420.624	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact215	421.572	422.332	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact216	422.011	424.611	E	Grad	s	-1	0	So that , if someone just read the wrong digit , I corrected it .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact218	424.79	425.35	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact217	424.611	430.43	E	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	And then there was another one where Jose couldn't tell whether {disfmarker} I couldn't tell whether he was saying zero or six .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact219	430.49	432.14	E	Grad	s	-1	0	And I asked him and he couldn't tell either .
Bmr019.I.dialogueact220	431.939	432.129	I	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact221	432.905	433.835	E	Grad	s	-1	0	So I just cut it out .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact223	434.853	435.163	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact222	434.686	438.856	E	Grad	s	-1	0	You know , so I just e edited out the first , i uh , word of the utterance .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact224	438.916	442.516	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Um , so there 's a little bit of correction but it 's definitely not as clean as TI - digits .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact225	442.899	445.429	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	So my expectations is TI - digits would , especially {disfmarker}
Bmr019.E.dialogueact226	446.42	448.91	E	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	I think TI - digits is all {pause} American English .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact229	449.391	449.771	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact227	448.91	449.18	E	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr019.E.dialogueact228	449.18	451.28	E	Grad	s	-1	0	So it would probably do even a little better still
Bmr019.E.dialogueact230	452.68	453.39	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	on the SRI system ,
Bmr019.E.dialogueact231	453.39	454.23	E	Grad	s^bd^cs	-1	0	but we could give it a try .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact232	453.678	453.968	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	Well .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact233	454.458	461.558	F	PhD	s	+1	0	But {pause} remember , we 're using a telephone bandwidth front - end here , uh , on this , uh {disfmarker} on this SRI system ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact234	461.558	465.72	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so , {vocalsound} um , I was {disfmarker} I thought that maybe that 's actually a good thing
Bmr019.F.dialogueact235	465.72	468.56	F	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	because it {disfmarker} it gets rid of some of the {disfmarker} uh , the noises ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact236	469.42	477.308	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	um , you know , in the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} below and above the {disfmarker} um , the , you know , speech bandwidth
Bmr019.B.dialogueact237	472.327	472.767	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact238	476.943	477.203	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact239	477.308	478.65	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	and , um ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact240	479.25	489.66	F	PhD	s	+1	1	I suspect that to get sort of the last bit out of these higher - quality recordings you would have to in fact , uh , use models that , uh , were trained on wider - band data .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact241	489.76	491.41	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	And of course we can't do that or {disfmarker}
Bmr019.E.dialogueact242	491.942	492.962	E	Grad	qw^rt	-1	0	Wha - what 's TI - digits ?
Bmr019.E.dialogueact243	492.962	493.392	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	I thought t
Bmr019.B.dialogueact244	493.625	494.465	B	Professor	s^na|s^aa	-1	0	It 's wide - band , yeah .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact245	494.465	495.865	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} in fact , we looked it up
Bmr019.E.dialogueact246	494.54	495.22	E	Grad	s^bk^m	-1	0	It is wide - band .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact247	495.22	495.42	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact248	495.865	498.355	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and it was actually twenty kilohertz sampling .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact249	498.3	498.88	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , that 's right .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact250	499.0	499.93	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I did look that up .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact251	499.127	499.417	F	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact252	499.93	502.89	E	Grad	s^df^no	-1	0	I couldn't remember whether that was TI - digits or one of the other digit tasks .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact253	500.437	500.777	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact254	501.71	501.94	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact255	502.805	503.715	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but , I would {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact256	503.715	504.045	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact257	504.045	505.415	F	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker} it 's easy enough to try ,

Bmr019.F.dialogueact266	511.824	523.235	F	PhD	s	-1	0	one issue with {disfmarker} with that is that {vocalsound} um , the system has this , uh , notion of a speaker to {disfmarker} which is used in adaptation , variance norm uh , you know , both in , uh , mean and variance normalization
Bmr019.F.dialogueact267	523.235	526.55	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and also in the VTL {pause} estimation .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact268	524.001	524.421	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact269	526.62	526.95	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr019.E.dialogueact270	527.632	529.532	E	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , I noticed the script that extracted it .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact271	527.835	528.145	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	Do y ?
Bmr019.F.dialogueact272	528.205	528.415	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	Is {disfmarker} ?
Bmr019.F.dialogueact273	528.825	535.072	F	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	So does {disfmarker} so th so does {disfmarker} does , um , {vocalsound} the TI - digits database have speakers that are known ?
Bmr019.E.dialogueact274	534.207	534.407	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .

Bmr019.F.dialogueact276	536.067	541.877	F	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	And is there {disfmarker} is there enough data or a comparable {disfmarker} comparable amount of data to {disfmarker} to what we have in our recordings here ?
Bmr019.E.dialogueact277	538.03	538.65	E	Grad	s^no	-1	0	That I don't know .

Bmr019.E.dialogueact280	543.06	545.4	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and how many speakers per utterance .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact281	543.482	543.802	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact283	545.471	550.221	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Well , the other thing would be to do it without the adaptation and compare to these numbers without the adaptation .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact284	550.846	551.116	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	That would {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact285	550.901	560.492	F	PhD	s^bk|s^df^ng	+1	0	Right . Uh , but I 'm not so much worried about the adaptation , actually , than {disfmarker} than the , um , {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} the , uh , VTL estimation .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact286	560.689	560.929	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact287	560.942	568.312	F	PhD	s^e	+1	2	If you have only one utterance per speaker you might actually screw up on estimating the {disfmarker} the warping , uh , factor .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact288	568.312	569.882	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So , um {disfmarker}
Bmr019.E.dialogueact289	570.053	572.613	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I strongly suspect that they have more speakers than we do .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact291	573.713	574.693	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	So , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact290	573.47	575.12	F	PhD	s^bk|s^nd	-1	0	Right . But it 's not the amount of speakers ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact292	575.12	576.93	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	it 's the num it 's the amount of data per speaker .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact293	576.926	581.026	E	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	Right . So we {disfmarker} we could probably do an extraction that was roughly equivalent .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact294	578.19	578.37	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact295	579.976	580.186	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact296	581.66	582.37	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact297	581.66	582.13	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr019.E.dialogueact298	583.553	589.753	E	Grad	s	-1	0	So , although I {disfmarker} I sort of know how to run it , there are a little {disfmarker} a f few details here and there that I 'll have to {pause} dig out .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact299	587.089	587.429	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	OK .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact300	587.749	588.119	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	The key {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact301	588.74	593.46	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So th the system actually extracts the speaker ID from the waveform names .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact302	593.679	594.399	E	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	Right . I saw that .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact303	594.033	597.493	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And there 's a {disfmarker} there 's a script {disfmarker} and that is actually all in one script .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact304	597.493	600.093	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So there 's this one script that parses waveform names
Bmr019.F.dialogueact305	600.563	605.287	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and extracts things like the , um , speaker , uh , ID
Bmr019.F.dialogueact306	605.287	607.467	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	or something that can stand in as a speaker ID .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact307	607.467	619.074	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	So , we might have to modify that script to recognize the , um , speakers , {vocalsound} um , in the {disfmarker} in the , uh , um , {vocalsound} TI - digits {pause} database .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact308	611.42	611.67	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact309	617.956	618.206	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact310	619.607	620.437	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	And that , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact311	620.709	629.62	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	Or you can fake {disfmarker} you can fake {pause} names for these waveforms that resemble the names that we use here for the {disfmarker} for the meetings .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact312	628.339	628.519	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact313	629.77	632.56	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	That would be the , sort of {disfmarker} probably the safest way to do {disfmarker}
Bmr019.E.dialogueact314	631.67	633.64	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	I might have to do that anyway to {disfmarker} to do {disfmarker}
Bmr019.E.dialogueact315	633.64	637.91	E	Grad	s^df	+1	1	because we may have to do an extract to get the {pause} amount of data per speaker about right .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact316	638.187	638.517	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact317	639.042	641.942	E	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	The other thing is , isn't TI - digits isolated digits ?
Bmr019.F.dialogueact318	639.353	639.533	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact319	642.402	643.232	E	Grad	qrr	-1	0	Or is that another one ?
Bmr019.E.dialogueact320	643.232	646.112	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	I 'm {disfmarker} I looked through a bunch of the digits t corp corpora ,
Bmr019.E.dialogueact321	646.382	647.492	E	Grad	s^df^e	-1	0	and now they 're all blurring .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact322	648.251	648.621	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact323	648.33	651.73	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Cuz one of them was literally people reading a single digit .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact324	653.751	655.701	E	Grad	s	-1	0	And then others were connected digits .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact325	655.928	658.368	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah . Most of TI - digits is connected digits , I think .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact326	657.655	657.915	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact327	658.368	660.778	B	Professor	s	-1	0	The {disfmarker} I mean , we had a Bellcore corpus that we were using .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact329	660.778	663.414	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It was {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that 's {disfmarker} that was isolated digits .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact328	660.644	661.954	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Maybe it 's the Bell Gram .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact330	662.869	663.439	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	Bell Digits .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact331	664.156	664.446	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Alright .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact333	664.883	665.213	B	Professor	fh.%	-1	0	Um .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact332	664.83	681.603	F	PhD	s	+1	0	By the way , I think we can improve these numbers if we care to compr improve them {vocalsound} by , um , {vocalsound} not starting with the Switchboard models but by taking the Switchboard models and doing supervised adaptation on a small amount of digit data collected in this setting .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact334	680.707	680.867	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact335	682.129	685.419	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Because that would adapt your models to the room acoustics
Bmr019.F.dialogueact336	685.419	688.699	F	PhD	s^df^e	-1	0	and f for the far - field microphones , you know , to the noise .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact337	689.4	692.97	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And that should really improve things , um , further .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact338	694.176	699.826	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And then you use those adapted models , which are not speaker adapted but sort of acous you know , channel adapted {disfmarker}
Bmr019.E.dialogueact339	698.53	699.3	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Channel adapted .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact340	700.166	703.016	F	PhD	s	-1	0	use that as the starting models for your speaker adaptation .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact341	703.333	715.438	B	Professor	fg|s^ng	-1	0	Yeah . {vocalsound} But the thing is , uh {disfmarker} I mean , w when you {disfmarker} it depends whether you 're ju were just using this as a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a starter task for {disfmarker} you know , to get things going for conversational or if we 're really interested i in connected digits .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact342	715.438	716.478	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And I {disfmarker} I think the answer is both .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact344	716.993	721.623	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And for {disfmarker} for connected digits over the telephone you don't actually want to put a whole lot of effort into adaptation
Bmr019.F.dialogueact343	716.62	718.03	F	PhD	s^ng^no	-1	0	Well , I don't know .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact345	721.623	724.382	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because {vocalsound} somebody {pause} gets on the phone and says a number
Bmr019.B.dialogueact346	724.382	725.382	B	Professor	s^df^e	-1	0	and then you just want it .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact347	726.299	727.299	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	You don't {disfmarker} don't , uh {disfmarker}

Bmr019.F.dialogueact351	727.88	735.285	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Um , but , you know , I {disfmarker} uh , my impression was that you were actually interested in the far - field microphone , uh , problem ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact352	735.285	735.555	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	I mean .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact353	735.925	736.365	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact354	736.89	739.79	F	PhD	s	-1	0	you want to {disfmarker} you want to {disfmarker} That 's the obvious thing to try .

Bmr019.C.dialogueact422	827.376	829.436	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	We {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we think that this has spikes on it ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact423	828.918	832.588	A	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's this thing 's {disfmarker} This is too big for my head .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact424	829.436	831.026	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so it 's not as good acoustically ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact425	830.616	832.046	F	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , basically your ears are too big .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact426	831.276	831.426	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact427	832.046	832.956	F	PhD	s^bd	-1	0	I mean , mine are too .

Bmr019.A.dialogueact429	833.609	836.079	A	PhD	s^ar|s	-1	0	No , my {disfmarker} my {disfmarker} But this is too big for my head .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact431	836.669	839.673	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So , I mean , {comment} {comment} it doesn't {disfmarker} you know , it 's sit
Bmr019.F.dialogueact430	836.656	836.966	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker}
Bmr019.C.dialogueact432	841.634	843.254	C	Postdoc	s^cs.%--	-1	0	Well , if you 'd rather have this one then it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact433	844.672	845.052	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact434	847.31	847.55	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact435	847.92	848.35	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Oh , well .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact436	849.2	850.25	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	It 's {pause} great .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact437	849.424	854.12	E	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	So the {disfmarker} To get that , uh , pivoted this way , it pivots like this .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact438	854.982	855.542	A	PhD	s	-1	0	No this way .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact440	855.882	856.182	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact439	855.659	855.859	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact441	855.919	856.309	E	Grad	s	-1	0	There you go .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact442	856.74	857.98	C	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	And there 's a screw that you can tighten .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact443	857.261	857.561	E	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	And then it {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact445	858.239	858.559	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact444	858.011	858.261	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact446	858.659	860.089	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I already {pause} tried to get it close .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact447	859.712	860.132	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Good .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact448	860.458	862.878	E	Grad	s	-1	0	So if it doesn't bounce around too much , that 's actually good placement .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact450	863.483	864.063	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact449	863.252	863.722	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	That looks good .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact451	864.048	865.448	E	Grad	s	-1	0	But it looks like it 's gonna bounce a lot .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact452	868.343	869.233	B	Professor	qw^t^tc	-1	0	So , where were we ?
Bmr019.B.dialogueact453	869.233	871.093	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact454	869.444	869.654	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .

Bmr019.B.dialogueact458	874.675	876.485	B	Professor	s	-1	0	um , factor of two ,
Bmr019.B.dialogueact459	878.107	878.697	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bmr019.B.dialogueact461	879.257	880.157	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Oh , yeah . I know what I was go w
Bmr019.F.dialogueact460	878.831	880.951	F	PhD	qw^rt.%-	-1	0	What k u By the way , wh what factor of two did you {disfmarker} ?
Bmr019.B.dialogueact463	880.976	881.656	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , no , no .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact462	880.951	881.311	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	I mean {disfmarker}
Bmr019.B.dialogueact464	881.656	885.686	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It 's tha that {disfmarker} that we were saying , you know , well is {disfmarker} how much worse is far than near , you know .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact465	884.52	885.44	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , th OK .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact466	885.686	887.556	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And I mean it depends on which one you 're looking at ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact467	885.75	886.51	F	PhD	s	-1	0	That factor of two .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact469	887.556	890.307	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	but for the everybody , it 's {vocalsound} little under a factor or two .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact468	887.5	887.94	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact470	890.822	903.549	B	Professor	fg|s	+1	1	Yeah . I {disfmarker} I know what I was thinking was that maybe , uh , i i we could actually t t try at least looking at , uh , some of the {disfmarker} the large vocabulary speech from a far microphone ,
Bmr019.B.dialogueact471	903.549	904.509	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	at least from the good one .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact472	903.682	904.472	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact473	905.159	908.539	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , before I thought we 'd get , you know , a hundred and fifty percent error or something ,
Bmr019.B.dialogueact475	908.539	914.602	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	but if {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if , uh {disfmarker} if we 're getting thirty - five , forty percent or something , {vocalsound} u um {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact474	908.197	909.517	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact476	914.0	922.659	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Actually if you run , though , on a close - talking mike over the whole meeting , during all those silences , you get , like , four hundred percent word error .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact477	920.604	921.064	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact478	922.731	923.711	B	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Right . I understand .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact479	923.711	925.521	B	Professor	s^df.%-	-1	0	But doing the same kind of limited thing {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact480	925.159	926.599	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	Or {disfmarker} or some high number .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact481	926.676	927.196	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah , sure .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact482	927.526	928.346	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	Get all these insertions .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact483	928.346	934.941	B	Professor	s^cs^df.%-	+1	1	But I 'm saying if you do the same kind of limited thing {vocalsound} as people have done in Switchboard evaluations or as {disfmarker} a
Bmr019.A.dialogueact484	929.25	929.51	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact485	934.303	936.743	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Where you know who the speaker is and there 's no overlap ?
Bmr019.A.dialogueact487	937.18	939.19	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^e^rt	-1	0	And you do just the far - field for those regions ?
Bmr019.B.dialogueact486	936.981	937.381	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact488	940.086	942.116	B	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yeah . The same sort of numbers that we got those graphs from .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact490	942.116	942.406	B	Professor	qy^d^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr019.E.dialogueact489	941.69	945.27	E	Grad	s^bu	+1	1	Could we do exactly the same thing that we 're doing now , but do it with a far - field mike ?
Bmr019.B.dialogueact491	945.427	946.407	B	Professor	s^aa|s.%-	-1	0	Yeah , do it with one of {disfmarker} on
Bmr019.E.dialogueact492	945.74	947.86	E	Grad	s^df	+1	0	Cuz we extract the times from the near - field mike ,
Bmr019.E.dialogueact493	947.86	949.81	E	Grad	s	+1	1	but you use the acoustics from the far - field mike .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact494	949.533	950.693	A	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Right . I understand that .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact495	950.693	953.603	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I just meant that {disfmarker} so you have {pause} three choices .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact496	953.603	964.967	A	PhD	s	-1	0	There 's , um {disfmarker} You can use times where that person is talking only from the transcripts but the segmentations were {disfmarker} were synchronized .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact497	965.437	973.189	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Or you can do a forced alignment on the close - talking to determine that , the you know , within this segment , these really were the times that this person was talking
Bmr019.A.dialogueact498	973.189	975.419	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and elsewhere in the segment other people are overlapping
Bmr019.A.dialogueact499	975.419	976.749	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and just front - end those pieces .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact500	977.578	979.078	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Or you can run it on the whole data ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact501	979.078	981.227	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	which is {disfmarker} which is , you know , a {disfmarker}
Bmr019.B.dialogueact502	980.272	989.04	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but how did we get the {disfmarker} how did we determine the links , uh , that we 're testing on in the stuff we reported ?
Bmr019.A.dialogueact503	989.34	994.01	A	PhD	s	+1	1	In the H L T paper we took {pause} segments that are channel {disfmarker} time - aligned ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact504	994.15	997.09	A	PhD	s	-1	0	which is now h being changed in the transcription process ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact505	997.09	997.78	A	PhD	s	-1	0	which is good ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact506	998.296	1003.19	A	PhD	s:s	+1	1	and we took cases where the transcribers said there was only one person talking here ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact507	1003.23	1007.37	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because no one else had time {disfmarker} any words in that segment
Bmr019.A.dialogueact508	1007.37	1008.77	A	PhD	s:s	+1	1	and called that " non - overlap " .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact509	1007.42	1007.73	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	And tha
Bmr019.B.dialogueact510	1008.77	1011.27	B	Professor	s^bu	+1	0	And that 's what we were getting those numbers from .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact511	1010.38	1010.67	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact513	1011.72	1013.19	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	Tho - good {disfmarker} the good numbers .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact512	1011.63	1011.93	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact514	1013.27	1017.04	A	PhD	s	+1	1	The bad numbers were from {pause} the segments where there was overlap .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact515	1016.31	1017.6	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	Well , we could start with the good ones .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact517	1017.99	1018.38	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact516	1017.6	1023.08	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	But anyway {disfmarker} so I think that we should try it once with {vocalsound} the same conditions that were used to create those ,
Bmr019.B.dialogueact518	1023.08	1026.25	B	Professor	s^cs^e	+1	0	and in those same segments just use one of the P Z
Bmr019.A.dialogueact519	1025.77	1027.28	A	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	Right . So we {disfmarker} we can do that .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact521	1027.34	1027.57	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact520	1027.29	1033.89	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	And then , you know , I mean , the thing is if we were getting , uh {disfmarker} what , thirty - five , forty percent , something like that on {disfmarker} on that particular set ,
Bmr019.B.dialogueact522	1034.7	1036.96	B	Professor	qh	-1	0	uh , does it go to seventy or eighty ?
Bmr019.A.dialogueact524	1037.43	1037.77	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact523	1036.96	1039.39	B	Professor	qh	-1	0	Or , does it use up so much memory we can't decode it ?
Bmr019.A.dialogueact525	1039.88	1044.22	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	It might also depend on which speaker th it is and how close they are to the PZM ?
Bmr019.B.dialogueact526	1040.07	1040.7	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact527	1044.22	1046.16	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I don't know how different they are from each other .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact528	1044.82	1048.52	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	You want to probably choose the PZM channel that is closest to the speaker .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact529	1046.86	1047.74	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	To be best {disfmarker}
Bmr019.D.dialogueact531	1048.24	1048.5	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact530	1048.22	1051.21	E	Grad	s	-1	0	For this particular digit ones , I just picked that one .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact532	1048.83	1049.07	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	f
Bmr019.B.dialogueact533	1049.41	1049.83	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact534	1051.41	1051.78	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact536	1051.78	1053.79	A	PhD	s^bu	-1	0	So we would then use that one , too ,
Bmr019.E.dialogueact537	1051.88	1052.18	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact535	1051.7	1052.42	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact538	1052.92	1054.16	B	Professor	s	-1	0	This is kind of central .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact539	1053.79	1053.82	A	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bmr019.B.dialogueact540	1054.32	1056.28	B	Professor	s	-1	0	You know , it 's {disfmarker} so i but I would {disfmarker} I 'd pick that one .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact541	1056.28	1058.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	It 'll be less good for some people than for other ,
Bmr019.B.dialogueact542	1058.17	1062.82	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	but I {disfmarker} I 'd like to see it on the same {disfmarker} exact same data set that {disfmarker} that we did the other thing on .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact543	1058.85	1059.25	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	Actually {disfmarker}
Bmr019.E.dialogueact544	1061.44	1063.04	E	Grad	s	+1	0	I sh actually should 've picked a different one ,
Bmr019.B.dialogueact545	1062.82	1062.97	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	Right ?
Bmr019.E.dialogueact546	1063.04	1065.8	E	Grad	s^df	+1	0	because {pause} that could be why the PDA is worse .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact547	1066.65	1069.24	E	Grad	s^df	+1	1	Because it 's further away from most of the people reading digits .
Bmr019.D.dialogueact548	1067.24	1068.2	D	PhD	s^2^na|s^aa	-1	0	It 's further away . Yeah .
Bmr019.D.dialogueact549	1069.9	1070.1	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact550	1070.54	1071.65	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	That 's probably one of the reasons .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact551	1070.57	1070.93	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact552	1072.83	1073.41	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact553	1073.33	1077.17	A	PhD	fg|s^cs	-1	0	Well , yeah . You could look at , I guess , that PZM or something .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact554	1075.93	1076.2	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact555	1077.29	1088.77	B	Professor	s^df^ng	-1	0	But the other is , it 's very , uh {disfmarker} I mean , even though there 's {disfmarker} I 'm sure the f f the {disfmarker} the SRI , uh , front - end has some kind of pre - emphasis , it 's {disfmarker} it 's , uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} still , th it 's picking up lots of low - frequency energy .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact556	1084.76	1085.29	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact557	1088.91	1092.24	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So , even discriminating against it , I 'm sure some of it 's getting through .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact558	1093.36	1093.8	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact559	1094.55	1095.25	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	But , yeah , you 're right .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact560	1095.25	1096.79	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	Prob - a part of it is just the distance .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact561	1097.96	1099.6	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	And aren't these pretty bad microphones ?
Bmr019.E.dialogueact562	1099.65	1099.86	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	Yep .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact563	1100.37	1100.55	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	I mean {disfmarker}
Bmr019.B.dialogueact564	1100.46	1101.4	B	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	Well , they 're bad .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact565	1102.62	1104.75	B	Professor	s^df^ng	-1	0	But , I mean , if you listen to it , it sounds OK . You know ?
Bmr019.B.dialogueact567	1106.76	1107.07	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	u Yeah .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact566	1106.64	1113.13	E	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah . When you listen to it , uh , the PZM and the PDA {disfmarker} Yeah , th the PDA has higher sound floor
Bmr019.E.dialogueact568	1113.13	1114.02	E	Grad	s	-1	0	but not by a lot .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact569	1114.02	1118.67	E	Grad	s^e	-1	0	It 's really pretty {disfmarker} uh , pretty much the same .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact570	1116.8	1119.47	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I just remember you saying you got them to be cheap on purpose .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact571	1120.25	1121.71	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	Cheap in terms of their quality .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact572	1121.71	1121.95	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact573	1122.19	1123.82	B	Professor	s	-1	0	Well , they 're {pause} twenty - five cents or so .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact574	1122.26	1125.85	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Th - we wanted them to be {disfmarker} to be typical of what would be in a PDA .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact575	1123.93	1124.04	B	Professor	b.x	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact577	1126.25	1126.59	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact576	1125.91	1129.14	E	Grad	s	-1	0	So they are {disfmarker} they 're not the PZM three hundred dollar type .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact578	1129.14	1130.18	E	Grad	s	-1	0	They 're the twenty - five cent ,
Bmr019.B.dialogueact579	1130.66	1130.9	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact580	1131.58	1132.99	E	Grad	s	-1	0	buy them in packs of thousand type .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact582	1134.42	1134.55	A	PhD	s^bk.%	-1	0	I see .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact581	1134.26	1137.09	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But , I mean , the thing is people use those little mikes for everything
Bmr019.B.dialogueact584	1137.09	1138.7	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because they 're really not bad .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact583	1136.66	1137.6	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	Everything .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact586	1139.13	1139.57	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact585	1139.06	1147.48	B	Professor	s^j	-1	0	I mean , if you 're not {vocalsound} doing something ridiculous like feeding it to a speech recognizer , they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they {disfmarker} you know , you can hear the sou hear the sounds just fine .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact587	1147.39	1147.77	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact588	1147.54	1148.07	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	You know , it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr019.B.dialogueact589	1148.64	1152.31	B	Professor	s	-1	0	They {disfmarker} I mean , i it 's more or less the same principles as these other mikes are built under ,
Bmr019.B.dialogueact590	1152.31	1154.34	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it 's just that {pause} there 's less quality control .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact591	1154.45	1156.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	They just , you know , churn them out and don't check them .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact592	1158.18	1160.61	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Um . So .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact593	1163.06	1165.38	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	So that was {disfmarker} Yeah . So that was i interesting result .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact594	1165.38	1170.8	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So like I said , the front - end guys are very much interested in {disfmarker} in this is as {disfmarker} as well
Bmr019.B.dialogueact595	1170.8	1170.96	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	and
Bmr019.F.dialogueact596	1171.42	1172.84	F	PhD	qw	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so , but where is this now ?
Bmr019.F.dialogueact597	1172.84	1174.68	F	PhD	qw^e	+1	0	I mean , what 's {disfmarker} where do we go from here ?
Bmr019.E.dialogueact599	1174.88	1176.42	E	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yeah . That was gonna be my question .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact598	1174.68	1175.07	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	I mean ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact600	1175.46	1178.4	F	PhD	s	-1	0	we {disfmarker} so we have a {disfmarker} we have a {disfmarker} a system that works pretty well
Bmr019.F.dialogueact601	1178.4	1183.3	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but it 's not , you know , the system that people here are used to using {disfmarker} to working with .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact603	1183.63	1186.34	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	Well , I think what we wanna do is we want to {disfmarker} eh ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact602	1183.3	1184.68	F	PhD	qw	-1	0	So what {disfmarker} what do we do now ?
Bmr019.B.dialogueact604	1186.34	1188.41	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and we 've talked about this in other {pause} contexts {disfmarker}
Bmr019.B.dialogueact605	1188.41	1193.29	B	Professor	s	+1	1	we want to {vocalsound} have the ability to feed it different features .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact606	1193.88	1194.34	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact607	1194.44	1201.0	B	Professor	s	+1	0	And then , um , {vocalsound} from the point of view of the front - end research , it would be s uh , substituting for HTK .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact608	1194.45	1194.79	F	PhD	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact609	1201.29	1201.62	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact610	1202.21	1203.33	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I think that 's the key thing .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact611	1203.53	1207.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And then if we can feed it different features , then we can try all the different things that we 're trying there .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact612	1203.59	1208.07	F	PhD	b	-1	0	OK . Alright .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact613	1208.16	1219.72	B	Professor	s	+1	1	And then , um , uh , also Dave is {disfmarker} is thinking about using the data in different ways , uh , to {vocalsound} um , uh , explicitly work on reverberation
Bmr019.F.dialogueact614	1214.82	1215.28	F	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact615	1219.72	1224.39	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	starting with some techniques that some other people have {pause} found somewhat useful , and {disfmarker} Yeah .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact616	1223.17	1223.47	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact617	1224.11	1232.46	F	PhD	s^bu	+1	1	So {disfmarker} so the key {pause} thing that 's missing here is basically the ability to feed , you know , other features {vocalsound} i into the recognizer
Bmr019.B.dialogueact619	1232.87	1233.09	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact618	1232.46	1234.4	F	PhD	s^bu^e	+1	1	and also then to train the system .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact620	1234.52	1234.76	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact621	1235.5	1235.74	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact622	1235.74	1238.16	F	PhD	s^no	-1	0	And , uh , es I don't know when Chuck will be back
Bmr019.F.dialogueact623	1238.24	1241.09	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	but that 's exactly what he {disfmarker} he 's gonna {disfmarker}
Bmr019.B.dialogueact624	1239.13	1239.32	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	H h
Bmr019.B.dialogueact625	1239.32	1240.98	B	Professor	s	-1	0	He 's {disfmarker} he 's sort of back ,
Bmr019.B.dialogueact626	1240.98	1244.13	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but he drove for fourteen hours an and wasn't gonna make it in today .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact627	1242.89	1243.38	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact628	1243.96	1248.27	F	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	So , I think that 's one of the things that he said he would be working on .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact629	1248.62	1248.92	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact631	1250.8	1251.04	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact630	1250.65	1253.0	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Just sort of t to make sure that {pause} we can do that
Bmr019.B.dialogueact633	1253.57	1253.8	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact632	1253.15	1255.02	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	and {disfmarker} Um .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact634	1260.58	1260.84	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact635	1261.54	1269.02	F	PhD	s	+1	0	It 's {disfmarker} uh , I mean , the {disfmarker} the front - end is f i tha that 's in the SRI recognizer is very nice in that it does a lot of things on the fly
Bmr019.F.dialogueact636	1269.02	1278.92	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	but it unfortunately {pause} is not {pause} designed and , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} like the , uh , ICSI system is , where you can feed it from a pipeline of {disfmarker} of the command .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact637	1278.92	1286.56	F	PhD	s.%--	+1	0	So , the {disfmarker} what that means probably for the foreseeable future is that you have to , uh , dump out , um {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact638	1287.12	1291.44	F	PhD	s	+1	0	you know , if you want to use some new features , you have to dump them into individual files
Bmr019.F.dialogueact639	1292.04	1293.98	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and {pause} give those files to the recognizer .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact640	1294.05	1295.37	E	Grad	s	+1	0	We do {disfmarker} we tend to do that anyway .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact641	1295.63	1296.03	F	PhD	s^bk^rt	-1	0	OK .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact642	1296.51	1296.7	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact643	1296.88	1300.12	E	Grad	s	-1	0	So , although you {disfmarker} you can pipe it as well , we tend to do it that way
Bmr019.E.dialogueact644	1300.12	1304.29	E	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because that way you can concentrate on one block and not keep re - doing it over and over .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact645	1304.11	1304.52	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , OK .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact647	1307.47	1307.67	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact646	1307.35	1307.69	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Alright .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact648	1309.15	1310.13	B	Professor	fg|%-	-1	0	Yeah . So I 've {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}
Bmr019.E.dialogueact649	1310.01	1312.63	E	Grad	s	-1	0	So tha that 's exactly what the P - file {pause} is for .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact650	1313.01	1313.26	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact651	1313.49	1319.36	F	PhD	fg|s	+1	0	Yeah , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the cumbersome thing is {disfmarker} is , um {disfmarker} is that you actually have to dump out little {disfmarker} little files .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact652	1314.04	1314.22	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact653	1319.36	1324.47	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So for each segment that you want to recognize {vocalsound} you have to {pause} dump out {pause} a separate file .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact654	1324.58	1324.85	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Uh - huh .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact655	1325.54	1329.03	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Just like i th like th as if there were these waveform segments ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact656	1329.03	1331.15	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but instead you have sort of feature file segments .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact657	1333.2	1333.9	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	But , you know {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact658	1336.17	1336.46	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact659	1339.17	1339.37	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Cool .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact660	1340.45	1343.51	B	Professor	fg|qo^d^e	-1	0	OK . So the s the {disfmarker} the next thing we had on the agenda was something about alignments ?
Bmr019.A.dialogueact661	1345.1	1345.39	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact662	1346.41	1347.43	A	PhD	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	Yes , we have {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact663	1348.42	1348.67	A	PhD	s^bd^no	-1	0	I don't know ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact664	1348.67	1349.73	A	PhD	qy^cs^rt	-1	0	did you wanna talk about it ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact665	1349.73	1350.0	A	PhD	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bmr019.A.dialogueact666	1350.2	1351.96	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I can give a {disfmarker} I was just telling this to Jane
Bmr019.A.dialogueact667	1351.96	1365.35	A	PhD	s	+1	2	and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} W we {disfmarker} we were able to get some definite improvement on the forced alignments by looking at them first and then realizing the kinds of errors {pause} that were occurring
Bmr019.A.dialogueact668	1365.35	1366.76	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	and um ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact669	1367.19	1373.3	A	PhD	s	-1	0	some of the errors occurring very frequently are just things like the first word being moved to as early as possible in the recognition ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact670	1373.3	1378.51	A	PhD	s	-1	0	which is a um , I think was both a {disfmarker} a pruning {pause} problem
Bmr019.A.dialogueact671	1378.51	1384.74	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and possibly a problem with needing constraints on word locations .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact672	1384.74	1386.82	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And so we tried both of these st things .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact673	1386.82	1387.53	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	We tried saying {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact674	1388.4	1388.68	A	PhD	s^bk^no	-1	0	I don't know ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact675	1388.68	1396.22	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I got this {vocalsound} whacky idea that {disfmarker} just from looking at the data , that when people talk {pause} their words are usually chunked together .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact676	1397.33	1400.87	A	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's not that they say one word and then there 's a bunch of words together .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact677	1401.2	1404.88	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	They 're {comment} might say one word and then another word far away if they were doing just backchannels ?
Bmr019.A.dialogueact678	1405.27	1411.9	A	PhD	s	-1	0	But in general , if there 's , like , five or six words and one word 's far away from it , that 's probably wrong on average .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact679	1411.9	1413.56	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So , um {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact680	1414.68	1418.75	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And then also , ca the pruning , of course , was too {disfmarker} too severe .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact681	1418.41	1419.72	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	So that 's actually interesting .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact682	1419.72	1422.54	F	PhD	s	-1	0	The pruning was the same value that we used for recognition .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact683	1423.25	1429.91	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And we had lowered that {disfmarker} we had used tighter pruning after Liz ran some experiments showing that , you know , it runs slower
Bmr019.F.dialogueact684	1429.91	1432.09	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	and there 's no real difference in {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact686	1431.35	1434.07	A	PhD	s^ng.%--	+1	1	Actually it was better with {disfmarker} slightly better or about th
Bmr019.E.dialogueact685	1431.24	1431.76	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	No gain .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact688	1434.07	1435.48	A	PhD	s^e^ng	+1	0	it was the same with tighter pruning .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact687	1433.65	1433.94	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact689	1435.01	1438.64	F	PhD	s	+1	0	So for free recognition , this {disfmarker} the lower pruning value is better .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact691	1439.0	1445.32	A	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's probably cuz the recognition 's just bad en at a point where it 's bad enough that {disfmarker} that you don't lose anything .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact690	1438.97	1439.18	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	You {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact692	1442.19	1442.41	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Correct .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact693	1443.67	1443.88	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact694	1445.01	1452.15	F	PhD	fg|s	+1	1	Um , but it turned out for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} to get accurate alignments it was really important to open up the pruning significantly .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact695	1451.26	1451.58	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact696	1452.37	1452.64	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact697	1452.75	1460.31	F	PhD	fh|s^df	-1	0	Um {pause} because otherwise it would sort of do greedy alignment , um , in regions where there was no real speech yet from the foreground speaker .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact698	1460.49	1460.9	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact699	1461.22	1464.84	F	PhD	s	+1	1	Um , {vocalsound} so that was one big factor that helped improve things
Bmr019.F.dialogueact700	1464.84	1466.83	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and then the other thing was that ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact701	1467.78	1474.79	F	PhD	s	+1	1	you know , as Liz said the {disfmarker} we f enforce the fact that , uh , the foreground speech has to be continuous .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact702	1474.79	1480.99	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	It cannot be {disfmarker} you cannot have a background speech hypothesis in the middle of the foreground speech .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact703	1481.22	1483.83	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	You can only have background speech at the beginning and the end .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact704	1484.46	1486.15	A	PhD	fg|s^arp	-1	0	Yeah . I mean , yeah , it isn't always true ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact705	1486.15	1489.33	A	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	and I think what we really want is some clever way to do this ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact706	1489.33	1495.15	A	PhD	s.%--	+1	0	where , um , you know , from the data or from maybe some hand - corrected alignments from transcribers that
Bmr019.A.dialogueact707	1495.69	1504.25	A	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	things like words that do occur just by themselves {pause} a alone , like backchannels or something that we did allow to have background speech around it {disfmarker}
Bmr019.D.dialogueact708	1501.41	1501.6	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact709	1504.6	1505.8	A	PhD	s	+1	1	those would be able to do that ,
Bmr019.C.dialogueact710	1504.88	1505.2	C	Postdoc	s^fa.%	-1	0	Sorry .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact711	1505.8	1507.56	A	PhD	s	+1	1	but the rest would be constrained .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact712	1508.67	1512.79	A	PhD	s	+1	0	So , I think we have a version that 's pretty good for the native speakers .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact713	1512.79	1514.72	A	PhD	s^no	-1	0	I don't know yet about the non - native speakers .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact714	1515.71	1516.76	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	And , um ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact715	1517.83	1523.7	A	PhD	s	-1	0	we basically also made noise models for the different {disfmarker} sort of grouped some of the {pause} mouth noises together .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact716	1524.44	1526.82	A	PhD	fh|s	+1	0	Um , so , and then there 's a background speech model .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact717	1527.47	1528.36	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And we also {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact718	1528.46	1530.83	A	PhD	s	-1	0	There was some neat {disfmarker} or , interesting cases ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact719	1530.83	1534.56	A	PhD	s	-1	0	like there 's one meeting where , {vocalsound} um , Jose 's giving a presentation
Bmr019.A.dialogueact720	1534.56	1538.51	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	and he 's talking about , um , the word " mixed {pause} signal "
Bmr019.A.dialogueact721	1538.51	1542.08	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	and someone didn't understand , uh , that you were saying " mixed " {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact722	1542.33	1542.92	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I think , Morgan .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact724	1543.48	1548.11	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	And so your speech - ch was s saying something about mixed signal .
Bmr019.H.dialogueact723	1543.26	1543.9	H	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah , yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact725	1548.11	1552.86	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And the next turn was a lot of people saying " mixed " ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact726	1552.86	1554.94	A	PhD	s^e:s	-1	0	like " he means mixed signal " or " I think it 's mixed " .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact727	1554.94	1557.84	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And the word " mixed " in this segment occurs , like , a bunch of times .
Bmr019.H.dialogueact728	1555.01	1555.66	H	PhD	%-	-1	0	Sh
Bmr019.A.dialogueact729	1558.39	1560.07	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And Chuck 's on the lapel here ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact730	1560.07	1561.32	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and he also says " mixed "
Bmr019.A.dialogueact731	1561.32	1562.46	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	but it 's at the last one ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact732	1562.46	1565.89	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	and of course the aligner th aligns it everywhere else to everybody else 's " mixed " ,
Bmr019.H.dialogueact733	1565.74	1565.96	H	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact734	1566.39	1567.65	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	cuz there 's no adaptation yet .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact735	1567.65	1571.17	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So there 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think there 's some issues about {disfmarker} u
Bmr019.A.dialogueact736	1571.17	1574.39	A	PhD	s^cs^rt	+1	1	We probably want to adapt at least the foreground speaker .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact737	1574.39	1579.01	A	PhD	s	+1	1	But , I guess Andreas tried adapting both the foreground and a background generic speaker ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact738	1579.01	1582.41	A	PhD	s^ba	+1	1	and that 's actually a little bit of a f funky model .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact739	1582.41	1584.19	A	PhD	s	+1	1	Like , it gives you some weird alignments ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact740	1584.19	1588.24	A	PhD	s^df	+1	1	just because often the background speakers match better to the foreground than the foreground speaker .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact741	1584.89	1585.15	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	Oh {disfmarker}
Bmr019.D.dialogueact742	1587.68	1587.87	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact744	1588.24	1589.4	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So there 's some things there ,
Bmr019.H.dialogueact743	1587.96	1588.37	H	PhD	b	-1	0	Oh .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact745	1589.64	1593.32	A	PhD	s^df^e	-1	0	especially when you get lots of the same words , uh , occurring in the {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact746	1592.41	1592.84	F	PhD	fg|%-	-1	0	Well , the {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact747	1593.69	1597.39	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I think you can do better by {vocalsound} uh , cloning {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact748	1597.39	1598.79	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so we have a reject phone .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact749	1599.43	1608.09	F	PhD	s	+1	1	And you {disfmarker} and what we wanted to try with {disfmarker} you know , once we have this paper written and have a little more time , {vocalsound} uh , t cloning that reject model
Bmr019.F.dialogueact750	1608.09	1613.65	F	PhD	s	+1	1	and then one copy of it would be adapted to the foreground speaker to capture the rejects in the foreground ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact751	1613.65	1614.72	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	like fragments and stuff ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact752	1614.72	1617.66	F	PhD	s	+1	1	and the other copy would be adapted to the background speaker .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact753	1618.5	1620.23	A	PhD	fg|s.%-	-1	0	Right . I mean , in general we actually {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact754	1619.01	1619.28	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact755	1620.51	1624.29	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	Right now the words like {pause} partial words are {pause} reject models
Bmr019.A.dialogueact757	1624.85	1627.1	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and you normally allow those to match to any word .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact756	1624.45	1624.78	F	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact758	1627.1	1629.65	A	PhD	s	-1	0	But then the background speech was also a reject model ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact759	1630.08	1632.54	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and so this constraint of not allowing rejects in between {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact760	1632.54	1634.42	A	PhD	s	-1	0	you know , it needs to differentiate between the two .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact761	1634.42	1638.48	A	PhD	s	+1	1	So just sort of working through a bunch of debugging kinds of issues .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact762	1634.99	1635.23	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact763	1639.21	1642.47	A	PhD	s.%--:s.%--	-1	0	And another one is turns , like people starting with {vocalsound} " well I think "
Bmr019.A.dialogueact764	1642.47	1644.53	A	PhD	s.%--:qo.%--	-1	0	and someone else is {pause} " well how about " .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact765	1644.52	1648.98	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	So the word " well " is in this {disfmarker} in this {pause} segment multiple times ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact766	1648.98	1652.99	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and as soon as it occurs usually the aligner will try to align it to the first person who says it .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact767	1653.46	1660.58	A	PhD	s	-1	0	But then that constraint of sort of {disfmarker} uh , proximity constraint will push it over to the person who really said it in general .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact768	1659.78	1661.85	E	Grad	qy	-1	0	Is the proximity constraint a hard constraint ,
Bmr019.E.dialogueact769	1661.85	1664.86	E	Grad	qrr.%--	-1	0	or did you do some sort of probabilistic weighting distance , or {disfmarker} ?
Bmr019.F.dialogueact770	1663.72	1664.53	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	We {disfmarker} we didn't {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact772	1664.7	1666.18	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Right now it 's a kluge .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact771	1664.58	1664.99	F	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact773	1664.99	1665.47	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	We {disfmarker} w
Bmr019.F.dialogueact774	1666.31	1666.69	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	OK .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact775	1666.75	1673.24	F	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	We {disfmarker} it 's straightforward to actually just have a {disfmarker} a penalty that doesn't completely disallows it but discourages it .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact776	1673.83	1678.77	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	But , um , we just didn't have time to play with , you know , tuning yet another {disfmarker} yet another parameter .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact777	1676.88	1677.69	E	Grad	s^2	-1	0	The ve level .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact778	1677.69	1678.02	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact779	1678.69	1679.08	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact780	1679.09	1683.43	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And really the reason we can't do it is just that we don't have a {disfmarker} we don't have ground truth for these .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact781	1683.66	1688.42	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	So , {vocalsound} we would need a hand - marked , um , {vocalsound} word - level alignments
Bmr019.F.dialogueact782	1688.48	1692.78	F	PhD	s^cs^e	+1	1	or at least sort of the boundaries of the speech betw you know , between the speakers .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact783	1693.33	1695.61	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	Um , and then use that as a reference
Bmr019.F.dialogueact784	1695.61	1701.33	F	PhD	s	+1	1	and tune the parameters of the {disfmarker} of the model , uh , to op to get the best {pause} performance .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact785	1700.46	1700.87	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact786	1700.81	1707.0	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	G given {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean , I wa I wa I was gonna ask you anyway , uh , how you assessed that things were better .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact787	1703.18	1703.84	F	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact788	1707.62	1708.8	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I looked at them .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact789	1708.8	1711.66	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I spent two days {disfmarker} um , in Waves {disfmarker}
Bmr019.B.dialogueact790	1708.94	1709.25	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact791	1711.92	1713.1	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Oh , it was painful
Bmr019.A.dialogueact792	1713.1	1716.42	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because {vocalsound} the thing is , you know the alignments share a lot in common ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact793	1716.42	1716.74	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact794	1717.1	1720.05	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And you 're {disfmarker} yo you 're looking at these segments where there 's a lot of speech .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact795	1720.05	1721.49	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , a lot of them have a lot of words .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact797	1722.11	1723.08	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Not by every speaker
Bmr019.B.dialogueact796	1721.75	1722.09	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact798	1723.08	1725.17	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but by some speaker there 's a lot of words .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact801	1725.16	1725.56	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	No , not {disfmarker}
Bmr019.B.dialogueact799	1724.83	1725.06	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact802	1725.56	1731.31	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	I mean that if you look at the individual segments from just one person you don't see a lot of words ,
Bmr019.H.dialogueact800	1725.1	1726.98	H	PhD	%-	-1	0	Ju
Bmr019.B.dialogueact803	1729.34	1729.58	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact806	1731.31	1733.53	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	but altogether you 'll see a lot of words up there .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact805	1731.16	1731.41	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact804	1730.95	1731.45	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.D.dialogueact808	1733.53	1733.69	D	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact807	1733.53	1736.09	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And so the reject is also mapping and pauses {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact809	1736.69	1738.02	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	So I looked at them all in Waves
Bmr019.A.dialogueact810	1738.02	1740.04	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and just lined up all the alignments ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact811	1740.16	1742.21	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and , at first it sort of looked like a mess
Bmr019.A.dialogueact812	1742.21	1745.81	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	and then the more I looked at it , I thought " OK , well it 's moving these words leftward
Bmr019.A.dialogueact813	1745.81	1747.88	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	and {disfmarker} " You know , it wasn't that bad .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact814	1747.88	1749.32	A	PhD	s	-1	0	It was just doing certain things wrong .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact815	1749.32	1749.68	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact816	1749.99	1753.79	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	But , I don't , you know , have time to l {comment} to look at all of them
Bmr019.A.dialogueact817	1753.79	1757.83	A	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	and it would be really useful to have , like , a {disfmarker} a transcriber who could use Waves ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact818	1758.39	1763.56	A	PhD	s^cs^e	-1	0	um , just mark , like , the beginning and end of the foreground speaker 's real words {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact819	1763.56	1765.97	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	like , the beginning of the first word , the end of the last word {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact821	1765.97	1768.97	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and then we could , you know , do some adjustments .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact820	1765.67	1765.74	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact822	1766.84	1767.44	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	I {disfmarker} OK .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact823	1767.44	1768.29	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I have to ask you something ,
Bmr019.C.dialogueact824	1771.54	1776.48	C	Postdoc	s^cs^df	-1	0	is i does it have to be Waves ? Because if we could benefit from what you did , incorporate that into the present transcripts , {comment} that would help .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact825	1772.47	1772.8	F	PhD	s^ar	-1	0	No .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact826	1776.87	1780.27	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	And then , um , the other thing is , I believe that I did hand
Bmr019.C.dialogueact827	1780.42	1784.43	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So . One of these transcripts was gone over by a transcriber
Bmr019.C.dialogueact828	1784.43	1791.18	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and then I hand - marked it myself so that we do have , uh , the beginning and ending of individual utterances .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact830	1791.7	1793.12	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Um , I didn't do it word level ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact829	1791.39	1791.72	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact831	1793.12	1793.87	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but in terms {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact833	1794.25	1794.63	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact832	1793.87	1795.92	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So I {disfmarker} so for {disfmarker} for one of the N S A groups .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact834	1795.92	1803.42	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And also I went back to the original one that I first transcribed and {disfmarker} and did it w uh , w uh , utterance by utterance for that particular one .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact835	1803.42	1804.28	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	So I think you do have {disfmarker}
Bmr019.C.dialogueact836	1804.62	1807.83	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	if that 's a sufficient unit , I think that you do have hand - marking for that .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact837	1807.83	1811.31	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But it 'd be wonderful to be able to {vocalsound} benefit from your Waves stuff .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact838	1809.44	1809.7	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact839	1809.99	1812.2	F	PhD	s	-1	0	We don't care what {disfmarker} what tool you use .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact840	1812.38	1815.03	A	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah . I mean , if {disfmarker} if you can , um {disfmarker} if you wanna {disfmarker}
Bmr019.C.dialogueact841	1812.4	1812.65	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact842	1812.65	1813.54	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I used it in Transcriber
Bmr019.F.dialogueact843	1812.68	1813.14	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	U uh {disfmarker}
Bmr019.C.dialogueact844	1813.54	1814.38	C	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	and it 's {disfmarker} it 's in the {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact845	1815.26	1818.58	A	PhD	s	-1	0	well , Jane and I were {disfmarker} just in terms of the tool , talking about this .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact846	1818.58	1820.8	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I guess Sue had had some {pause} reactions .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact847	1820.8	1824.96	A	PhD	s	+1	1	You know , interface - wise if you 're looking at speech , you wanna be able to know really where the words are .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact849	1824.96	1829.13	A	PhD	s	+1	0	And so , {vocalsound} we can give you some examples of sort of what this output looks like ,
Bmr019.C.dialogueact848	1824.68	1825.15	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah , that 's right .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact850	1825.61	1826.56	C	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	Middle of the word , or {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact851	1829.19	1834.58	A	PhD	s^cs	+1	1	um , and see if you can in maybe incorporate it into the Transcriber tool some way ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact852	1834.64	1834.82	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	or {disfmarker}
Bmr019.C.dialogueact853	1834.99	1837.8	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Well , I th I 'm thinking just ch e e incorporating it into the representation .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact854	1836.01	1836.45	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact855	1837.88	1839.16	C	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	I mean , if it 's {disfmarker} if it 's {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact856	1838.64	1840.46	A	PhD	s	-1	0	You mean like {disfmarker} Yeah , word start insights .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact857	1839.47	1842.58	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	if you have start points , if you have , like , time tags ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact858	1841.73	1842.3	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact859	1842.58	1843.36	C	Postdoc	s^rt	-1	0	which is what I assume .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact860	1843.36	1844.28	C	Postdoc	qy.%--	-1	0	Isn't that what {disfmarker} what you {disfmarker} ?
Bmr019.C.dialogueact861	1844.51	1845.55	C	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	Well , see , Adam would be {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact862	1844.89	1845.76	F	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah , whatever you use .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact864	1846.16	1846.48	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact863	1845.76	1854.64	F	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , we convert it to this format that the , um , NIST scoring tool unders uh , CTM . Conversation Time - Marked file .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact865	1854.97	1857.2	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and then that 's the {disfmarker} that 's what the {disfmarker}
Bmr019.E.dialogueact866	1857.41	1859.52	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I think Transcriber , uh , outputs CTM .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact867	1860.59	1860.76	C	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	If it {disfmarker} ?
Bmr019.C.dialogueact868	1860.85	1861.12	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact871	1861.35	1861.69	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact870	1861.12	1862.07	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	So you would know this more than I would .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact869	1861.0	1861.49	E	Grad	s^am	-1	0	I think so .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact873	1862.22	1862.72	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	So , I mean {disfmarker}
Bmr019.C.dialogueact874	1862.26	1864.78	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	It seems like she {disfmarker} if she 's g if she 's moving time marks around ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact872	1861.78	1862.0	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact875	1864.99	1871.04	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	since our representation in Transcriber uses time marks , it seems like there should be some way of {disfmarker} of using that {disfmarker} benefitting from that .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact876	1867.78	1868.05	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact877	1870.28	1877.51	A	PhD	fg|s	+1	1	Yeah , it wou the advantage would just be that when you brought up a bin you would be able {disfmarker} if you were zoomed in enough in Transcriber to see all the words ,
Bmr019.B.dialogueact878	1875.98	1876.43	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact879	1877.51	1880.53	A	PhD	s	+1	1	you would be able to , like , have the words sort of located in time ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact880	1881.02	1881.83	A	PhD	s	-1	0	if you wanted to do that .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact881	1881.07	1886.63	B	Professor	s^rt	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so if we e e even just had a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} It sounds like w we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we almost do .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact882	1882.19	1882.36	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact883	1886.92	1888.16	B	Professor	s^bk^m	-1	0	Uh , if we {disfmarker} We have two .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact884	1887.09	1887.63	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	We have two .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact885	1888.16	1888.35	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact886	1888.79	1893.89	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	Just ha uh , trying out {pause} the alignment {vocalsound} procedure that you have on that
Bmr019.A.dialogueact887	1892.36	1892.65	A	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact888	1893.89	1897.08	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you could actually get something , um {disfmarker} uh , uh , get an objective measure .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact890	1897.99	1898.49	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact889	1897.53	1898.08	F	PhD	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact891	1898.96	1901.05	A	PhD	s^bu.%--	-1	0	You mean on {disfmarker} on the hand - marked , um {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact892	1901.51	1905.68	A	PhD	s	+1	1	So we {disfmarker} we only r hav I only looked at actually alignments from one meeting that we chose ,
Bmr019.B.dialogueact893	1901.6	1901.84	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact894	1905.68	1906.75	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	I think MR four ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact895	1907.02	1908.49	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	just randomly , um {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact896	1909.66	1910.12	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact897	1910.66	1911.84	F	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	Actually , not randomly .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact898	1911.68	1912.76	A	PhD	s^m^na	-1	0	Not randomly {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact899	1911.84	1914.86	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	We knew {disfmarker} we knew that it had these insertion errors from {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact900	1913.33	1916.78	A	PhD	s	-1	0	It had sort of {pause} average recognition performance in a bunch of speakers
Bmr019.F.dialogueact901	1914.86	1915.14	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact902	1915.78	1916.09	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact903	1916.78	1918.83	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and it was a Meeting Recorder meeting .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact904	1919.38	1919.81	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact905	1919.84	1922.01	A	PhD	s	-1	0	But , yeah , we should try to use what you have .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact906	1922.01	1925.9	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I did re - run recognition on your new version of MR one .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact907	1924.91	1925.36	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Oh , good .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact908	1925.96	1929.59	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I mean the {disfmarker} the one with Dan {pause} Ellis in it {vocalsound} and Eric .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact909	1926.1	1926.51	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	Good !
Bmr019.C.dialogueact910	1927.64	1929.07	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Uh - huh . Yeah , exactly . Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr019.G.dialogueact911	1929.75	1931.95	G	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	I don't think that was the new version .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact912	1930.44	1930.69	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact913	1931.22	1931.42	A	PhD	%--	-1	0	That {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact914	1931.42	1932.72	A	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah , actually it wasn't the new new ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact916	1932.72	1933.83	A	PhD	s	-1	0	it was the medium new .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact915	1932.6	1932.86	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact917	1933.83	1937.18	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but we would {disfmarker} we should do the {disfmarker} the latest version .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact918	1933.92	1934.16	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr019.G.dialogueact919	1936.07	1936.52	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact921	1937.4	1938.77	A	PhD	s	-1	0	It was the one from last week .
Bmr019.G.dialogueact920	1936.91	1942.42	G	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	You {disfmarker} did you adjust the {disfmarker} the utterance times , um , for each channel ?
Bmr019.C.dialogueact922	1941.02	1941.31	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact923	1942.62	1943.11	C	Postdoc	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	Yes , I did .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact924	1943.11	1952.94	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And furthermore , I found that there were a certain number where {disfmarker} {vocalsound} not {disfmarker} not a lot , but several times I actually {vocalsound} moved an utterance from {vocalsound} Adam 's channel to Dan 's or from Dan 's to Adam 's .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact925	1952.94	1953.92	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	So there was some speaker identif
Bmr019.C.dialogueact926	1954.22	1960.98	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And the reason was because {vocalsound} I transcribed that at a point before {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , before we had the multiple audio available
Bmr019.C.dialogueact927	1961.09	1961.17	C	Postdoc	%--	-1	0	f
Bmr019.C.dialogueact928	1961.17	1962.68	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so I couldn't switch between the audio .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact929	1962.68	1965.04	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I transcribed it off of the mixed channel entirely ,
Bmr019.C.dialogueact930	1965.04	1967.68	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	which meant in overlaps , I was at a {disfmarker} at a terrific disadvantage .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact931	1966.79	1967.23	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact932	1967.76	1968.11	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact933	1967.96	1970.91	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	In addition it was before the channelized , uh , possibility was there .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact934	1971.16	1976.52	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And finally I did it using the speakers of my , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of {disfmarker} you know , off the CPU on my {disfmarker} on my machine
Bmr019.C.dialogueact935	1976.52	1977.54	C	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	cuz I didn't have a headphone .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact937	1977.84	1978.28	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact936	1977.54	1978.4	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	So it @ @ , like , I mean {disfmarker}
Bmr019.C.dialogueact938	1978.73	1983.47	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Yeah , I {disfmarker} I mean , i in retrospect {vocalsound} it would 've been good to ha {vocalsound} have got I should 've gotten a headphone .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact939	1983.56	1991.12	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But in any case , um , thi this is {disfmarker} this was transcribed in a {disfmarker} in a , {vocalsound} uh , less optimal way than {disfmarker} than the ones that came after it ,
Bmr019.C.dialogueact940	1991.18	1995.97	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and I was able to {disfmarker} you know , an and this meant that there were some speaker identif identifications
Bmr019.C.dialogueact942	1995.97	1997.53	C	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	which were changes .
Bmr019.G.dialogueact941	1995.83	1998.93	G	Grad	s	+1	1	Well , I know there were some speaker labelling problems , um , after interruptions .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact943	1997.87	1998.09	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact944	1998.68	1999.13	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	Fixed that .
Bmr019.G.dialogueact945	1998.93	1999.98	G	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Is that what you 're referring to ?
Bmr019.G.dialogueact946	1999.98	2003.3	G	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	I mean , cuz there 's this one instance when , for example , you 're running down the stairs .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact947	2000.52	2001.14	C	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	Oh , well {disfmarker}
Bmr019.G.dialogueact948	2003.3	2004.4	G	Grad	s	-1	0	I remember this meeting really well .

Bmr019.G.dialogueact966	2023.72	2024.43	G	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Is that what you 're talking about ?
Bmr019.G.dialogueact967	2024.43	2027.06	G	Grad	qrr	-1	0	Or were there mislabellings as far as , like , the a Adam was {disfmarker} ?
Bmr019.C.dialogueact968	2027.28	2029.02	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	That was fixed , um , before {disfmarker}
Bmr019.C.dialogueact969	2029.34	2031.34	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	i i i I think I I think I understood that pretty {disfmarker}
Bmr019.G.dialogueact970	2029.68	2031.21	G	Grad	fg|s^df	-1	0	Yeah . Cuz I thought I let you know about that .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact971	2031.34	2031.97	C	Postdoc	s^ft	-1	0	Thank you for mentioning .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact973	2031.97	2035.35	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Yeah , no , tha that {disfmarker} That I think went away a couple of versions ago ,
Bmr019.G.dialogueact972	2031.76	2032.15	G	Grad	s^fw	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.G.dialogueact974	2034.59	2034.96	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact976	2035.35	2036.02	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but it 's good to know .
Bmr019.G.dialogueact975	2034.96	2037.78	G	Grad	s	+1	1	But you 're actually saying that certain , uh , speakers were mis mis - identified .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact977	2037.13	2045.98	C	Postdoc	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah . So , with {disfmarker} under {disfmarker} um , uh , listening to the mixed channel , there were times when , as surprising as that is , I got Adam 's voice confused with Dan 's and vice versa {disfmarker}
Bmr019.G.dialogueact978	2044.27	2044.61	G	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	OK .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact979	2045.98	2047.07	C	Postdoc	s^bd^df	-1	0	not for long utterances ,
Bmr019.G.dialogueact980	2046.11	2046.33	G	Grad	b	-1	0	OK .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact981	2046.95	2047.37	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact982	2047.07	2048.63	C	Postdoc	s^bd^e	-1	0	but jus just a couple of places ,
Bmr019.B.dialogueact983	2048.94	2049.36	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact984	2049.36	2050.88	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and embedde embedded in overlaps .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact985	2050.88	2056.68	C	Postdoc	s	+1	0	The other thing that was w interesting to me was that I picked up a lot of , um , backchannels which were hidden in the mixed signal ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact987	2056.93	2057.45	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact986	2056.68	2058.37	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	which , you know , I mean , you c not {disfmarker} not too surprising .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact988	2058.69	2059.73	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	But the other thing that {disfmarker}
Bmr019.C.dialogueact989	2060.07	2061.3	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	I {disfmarker} I hadn't thought about this ,
Bmr019.C.dialogueact990	2061.3	2066.45	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but I thou I wanted to raise this when you were {disfmarker} uh , with respect to also a strategy which might help with the alignments potentially ,
Bmr019.C.dialogueact991	2066.45	2066.86	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	but that 's {disfmarker}
Bmr019.C.dialogueact992	2067.79	2079.62	C	Postdoc	s	+1	1	When I was looking at these backchannels , they were turning up usually {disfmarker} {vocalsound} very often in {disfmarker} w well , I won't say " usually " {disfmarker} but anyway , very often , I picked them up in a channel {vocalsound} w which was the person who had asked a question .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact993	2080.0	2082.94	C	Postdoc	s:qy	-1	0	S so , like , someone says " an and have you done the so - and - so ? "
Bmr019.C.dialogueact994	2083.46	2084.76	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And then there would be backchannels ,
Bmr019.C.dialogueact995	2084.76	2086.32	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but it would be the person who asked the question .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact996	2086.32	2088.28	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Other people weren't really doing much backchannelling .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact997	2088.74	2090.73	C	Postdoc	s:s	-1	0	And , you know , sometimes you have the {disfmarker} Yeah , uh - huh .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact998	2089.6	2090.63	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Well , that 's interesting .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1000	2091.4	2091.85	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact999	2091.05	2092.3	C	Postdoc	s^bd	-1	0	I mean , i it wouldn't be perfect ,
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1001	2092.3	2097.23	C	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	but {disfmarker} but it does seem more natural to give a backchannel when {disfmarker} when you 're somehow involved in the topic ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1002	2093.43	2094.78	A	PhD	s^ar|s^ba	-1	0	No , that 's really interesting .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1004	2097.48	2097.85	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1003	2097.23	2100.49	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and the most natural way is for you to have initiated the topic by asking a question .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1005	2099.5	2099.98	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	Well ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1007	2101.28	2102.22	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	That 's interesting .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1006	2100.99	2101.31	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	I think {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1008	2101.31	2107.1	F	PhD	s^ar|s	-1	0	No . I think it 's {disfmarker} actually I think what 's going on is backchannelling is something that happens in two - party conversations .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1009	2107.08	2107.3	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1010	2107.1	2111.35	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	And if you ask someone a question , you essentially initiating a little two - party conversation .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1011	2110.89	2110.95	C	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1012	2111.54	2113.31	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , actu Yeah , when we looked at this {disfmarker}
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1014	2112.07	2112.68	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1013	2111.98	2114.39	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So then you 're {disfmarker} so and then you 're expected to backchannel
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1015	2114.39	2117.29	F	PhD	s^df	-1	0	because the person is addressing you directly and not everybody .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1016	2115.81	2116.32	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Exactly .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1017	2117.23	2118.01	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Exactly my point .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1019	2118.01	2120.08	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	An - and so this is the expectation thing that {disfmarker} uh , uh ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1018	2117.82	2118.02	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1020	2118.02	2118.49	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1021	2118.66	2118.96	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1022	2118.91	2119.12	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1024	2120.08	2120.72	C	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	just the dyadic {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1023	2119.86	2120.09	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1025	2120.72	2130.63	C	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	But in addition , you know , if someone has done this analysis himself and isn't involved in the dyad , but they might also give backchannels to verify what {disfmarker} what the answer is that this {disfmarker} that the {disfmarker} the answerer 's given {disfmarker}
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1026	2121.99	2122.13	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	H
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1028	2129.91	2130.29	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1027	2129.85	2131.73	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	I tell you , I say {disfmarker} I say " uh - huh " a lot ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1029	2130.62	2130.86	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	It 's {disfmarker}
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1030	2131.51	2131.87	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	There you go .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1031	2132.05	2133.08	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , but it 's interesting
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1032	2133.08	2133.81	A	PhD	s^df.%-	-1	0	cuz , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1033	2133.55	2134.84	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	while people are talking to each other .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1035	2135.44	2137.87	A	PhD	s^ng:s	+1	1	But there are fewer {disfmarker} I think there are fewer " uh - huhs " .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1034	2135.01	2135.41	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	There you go .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1036	2135.75	2135.91	C	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1037	2136.71	2136.86	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1038	2138.01	2144.88	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , just from {disfmarker} We were looking at word frequency lists to try to find the cases that we would allow to have the reject words in between in doing the alignment .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1039	2145.21	2147.52	A	PhD	s	-1	0	You know the ones we wouldn't constrain to be next to the other words .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1040	2145.45	2146.06	C	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	Oh , yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1041	2148.3	2151.32	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	And " uh - huh " is not as frequent
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1042	2152.03	2153.78	A	PhD	s	-1	0	as it sort of would be in Switchboard ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1043	2153.78	2157.86	A	PhD	s^e	+1	0	if you looked at just a word frequency list of one - word short utterances .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1044	2157.86	2159.22	A	PhD	s:s	+1	1	And " yeah " is way up there ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1045	2159.22	2159.96	A	PhD	s:s	-1	0	but not " uh - huh " .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1046	2159.96	2160.83	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And so I was thinking
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1047	2161.57	2166.67	A	PhD	s	-1	0	thi it 's not like {pause} you 're being encouraged by everybody else to keep {pause} talking in the meeting .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1048	2166.67	2168.14	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And uh , that 's all , I I 'll stop there ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1049	2168.14	2170.09	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	cuz I I think what you say makes a lot of sense .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1050	2168.19	2168.73	C	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	Well , that 's right .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1051	2168.73	2169.14	C	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	And that would {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1053	2170.15	2170.88	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	But it was sort of {disfmarker}
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1052	2170.03	2170.79	C	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	Well , an
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1054	2170.87	2173.4	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And what you say is the {disfmarker} is the re uh , o other side of this ,
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1055	2173.4	2178.91	C	Postdoc	s^e	-1	0	which is that , you know , so th there are lots of channels where you don't have these backchannels , w when a question has been asked
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1056	2178.95	2180.1	C	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	and {disfmarker} and these {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1057	2179.48	2179.83	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1058	2179.98	2183.31	A	PhD	s	-1	0	There 's just probably less backchannelling in general ,
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1059	2180.48	2180.59	C	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1060	2182.3	2183.42	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	So that 's good news , really .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1061	2183.7	2188.99	A	PhD	s	-1	0	even if you consider every other person altogether one person in the meeting ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1062	2189.07	2190.27	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but we 'll find out anyway .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1063	2190.27	2198.56	A	PhD	s	+1	1	We were {disfmarker} I guess the other thing we 're {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} I should say is that we 're gonna , um try {disfmarker} compare this type of overlap analysis to Switchboard ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1065	2199.16	2199.51	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	where {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1064	2198.94	2199.59	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	And
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1066	2199.64	2200.3	A	PhD	s^m^na	+1	0	and CallHome ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1067	2200.3	2208.19	A	PhD	qrr	+1	1	where we have both sides , so that we can try to answer this question of , you know , {vocalsound} is there really more overlap in meetings or is it just because we don't have the other channel in Switchboard
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1069	2201.39	2202.0	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1068	2201.37	2201.81	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1070	2208.19	2209.44	A	PhD	s	+1	0	and we don't know what people are doing .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1071	2210.02	2211.42	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Try to create a paper out of that .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1072	2212.02	2215.03	B	Professor	fg|s^df	-1	0	Yeah . I mean , y y you folks have probably {pause} already told me ,
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1073	2215.03	2218.5	B	Professor	qy	+1	0	but were {disfmarker} were you intending to do a Eurospeech submission ,
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1074	2218.5	2218.53	B	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	or {disfmarker} ?
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1075	2219.68	2221.07	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	Um , you mean the one due tomorrow ?
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1076	2221.33	2221.55	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1077	2221.97	2225.93	A	PhD	s^bk|s	-1	0	Yeah . Well , we 're still , like , writing the scripts for doing the research ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1078	2226.02	2227.89	A	PhD	s^na	-1	0	and we will {disfmarker} Yes , we 're gonna try .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1079	2226.43	2226.86	C	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1080	2229.6	2234.74	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And I was telling Don , do not {pause} take this as an example of how people should work .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1081	2234.99	2235.95	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	Do as I say ,
Bmr019.G.dialogueact1082	2235.31	2235.76	G	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	That 's r
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1083	2235.94	2237.71	A	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	So , {comment} we will try .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1084	2235.95	2237.08	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	don't do as I do .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1085	2237.08	2237.34	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1087	2237.71	2239.02	A	PhD	s	-1	0	It 'll probably be a little late ,
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1086	2237.6	2237.85	E	Grad	fg	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1089	2239.06	2240.08	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but I 'm gonna try it .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1088	2239.04	2239.6	E	Grad	s	-1	0	It is different .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1090	2239.6	2242.85	E	Grad	s	-1	0	In previous years , Eurospeech only had the abstract due by now ,
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1091	2242.85	2243.78	E	Grad	s	-1	0	not the full paper .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1093	2243.77	2244.16	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.G.dialogueact1092	2243.31	2243.67	G	Grad	b.%	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1094	2244.35	2245.55	E	Grad	s	-1	0	And so all our timing was off .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1095	2245.55	2247.09	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I 've given up on trying to do digits .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1096	2247.09	2250.31	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I just don't think that what I have so far makes a Eurospeech paper .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1097	2251.13	2253.14	A	PhD	s^rt	-1	0	Well , I 'm no We may be in the same position ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1098	2253.14	2255.26	A	PhD	s	+1	1	and I figured {vocalsound} we 'll try ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1099	2255.26	2261.63	A	PhD	s.%--	+1	1	because that 'll at least get us to the point where we have {disfmarker} We have this really nice database format that Andreas and I were working out that {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1100	2262.02	2263.17	A	PhD	s	-1	0	It {disfmarker} it 's not very fancy .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1101	2263.17	2265.84	A	PhD	s	+1	0	It 's just a ASCII line by line format ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1102	2265.84	2267.45	A	PhD	s	-1	0	but it does give you information {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1103	2266.7	2268.88	F	PhD	s	+1	1	It 's the {disfmarker} it 's the spurt format .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1104	2269.04	2270.96	A	PhD	s:s	+1	0	It {disfmarker} Yeah , we 're calling these " spurts " after Chafe .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1105	2270.96	2275.47	A	PhD	s^df	+1	1	I was trying to find what 's a word for {pause} a continuous region with {pause} pauses around it ?
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1106	2272.25	2272.6	C	Postdoc	b.%	-1	0	Hmm .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1107	2275.58	2279.18	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	Yeah . I know that th the Telecom people use {disfmarker} use " spurt " for that .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1108	2275.61	2275.93	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Good .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1109	2278.79	2279.3	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	They do ?
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1112	2279.44	2279.83	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Oh !
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1111	2279.4	2279.78	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	Yes .

Bmr019.B.dialogueact1114	2280.28	2283.22	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And that 's {disfmarker} I mean , I {disfmarker} I was using that for a while when I was doing the rate of speech stuff ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1115	2280.9	2281.44	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	I would jus
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1116	2283.22	2288.05	B	Professor	s^df.%--:s.%--	-1	0	because I {disfmarker} because I looked up in some books and I found {disfmarker} OK , I wanna find a spurt {vocalsound} in which {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1117	2283.91	2284.82	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	Ah , right !
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1118	2287.48	2289.19	A	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's just , like , defined by the acoustics .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1119	2288.05	2293.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and {disfmarker} an because {disfmarker} cuz it 's another question about how {pause} many pauses they put in between them .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1120	2291.49	2291.92	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	Horrible .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1121	2292.58	2293.05	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1122	2293.5	2296.78	B	Professor	qo	-1	0	But how fast do they do {pause} the words within the spurt ?
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1123	2296.71	2297.17	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1124	2296.78	2296.99	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1127	2297.38	2299.97	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , that 's what we were calling spurt ,
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1126	2297.22	2297.74	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	It 's gonna {disfmarker}
Bmr019.G.dialogueact1125	2296.83	2297.91	G	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	you know " Burst " also ?

Bmr019.G.dialogueact1129	2298.27	2299.67	G	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	Isn't " burst " is used also ?
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1130	2299.97	2300.49	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so {disfmarker}
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1131	2300.7	2304.91	E	Grad	s	-1	0	Spurt has the horrible name overloading with other {disfmarker} with hardware at ICSI .

Bmr019.B.dialogueact1133	2304.69	2305.83	B	Professor	s^na|s^aa	-1	0	Just very locally , yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1135	2306.04	2310.39	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , well , Chafe had this wor I think it was Chafe , or somebody had a {disfmarker} the word " spurt " originally ,
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1134	2305.83	2306.83	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	But {disfmarker} but that just {disfmarker}

Bmr019.A.dialogueact1137	2310.39	2310.98	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	and so I {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1139	2311.59	2312.83	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	But tha that 's good to know .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1138	2311.56	2311.87	C	Postdoc	%-	-1	0	Actually {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1140	2313.06	2313.83	A	PhD	qy	-1	0	Was thi it 's Chafe ?
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1142	2313.63	2316.27	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Well , see , I know S Sue wrote about spurts of development .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1141	2313.52	2314.6	F	PhD	s^cs.%-	-1	0	So maybe we should talk {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1143	2315.26	2316.04	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	Maybe it was Sue {disfmarker} ?

Bmr019.C.dialogueact1144	2316.52	2318.11	C	Postdoc	s^ba^rt	-1	0	But , in any case , I think it 's a good term ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1148	2318.62	2322.06	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So we have spurts and we have spurt - ify dot shell and spurt - ify
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1149	2318.75	2318.99	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1147	2318.4	2318.82	C	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	and , uh {disfmarker}
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1146	2318.33	2318.63	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Hmm !
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1152	2321.73	2322.48	B	Professor	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1150	2321.46	2322.93	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And ma maybe {disfmarker} maybe Chafe did .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1151	2321.71	2321.94	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1155	2323.08	2324.9	A	PhD	s	-1	0	And then it 's got all {disfmarker} it 's a verb now .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1154	2322.93	2324.2	C	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	I know {disfmarker} I know Ch - Chafe dealt with {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1153	2322.47	2323.04	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	So s
Bmr019.G.dialogueact1156	2323.2	2323.87	G	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	That 's cool .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1157	2324.31	2325.08	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	W uh , w
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1158	2324.98	2326.57	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	Chafe speaks about intonation units .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1159	2326.72	2327.52	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yes . Right .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1160	2327.28	2328.61	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	But maybe he speaks about spurts as well
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1161	2327.49	2327.79	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	We
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1162	2328.61	2329.03	C	Postdoc	s^no	-1	0	and I just don't know .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1163	2329.03	2329.37	C	Postdoc	s^co	-1	0	Yeah , go ahead .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1165	2329.5	2330.6	E	Grad	s:s	-1	0	I 've heard " burst " also .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1164	2329.2	2329.98	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	So what we 're doing {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1166	2329.98	2334.91	F	PhD	s^bd^df	-1	0	uh , this {disfmarker} this is just {disfmarker} maybe someone has s some {disfmarker} some ideas about how to do it better ,
Bmr019.G.dialogueact1167	2330.89	2331.35	G	Grad	b	-1	0	Mmm .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1168	2334.91	2338.76	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but we {disfmarker} So we 're taking these , uh , alignments from the individual channels .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1169	2339.59	2340.09	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	We 're {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1170	2340.79	2344.0	F	PhD	s	+1	0	from each alignment we 're producing , uh , one of these CTM files ,
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1172	2344.35	2344.67	C	Postdoc	b	-1	0	Great .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1171	2344.0	2349.0	F	PhD	s	+1	0	which essentially has {disfmarker} it 's just a linear sequence of words with the begin times for every word and the duration .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1174	2350.62	2353.0	A	PhD	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	It looks like a Waves label file almost . Right ?
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1173	2350.14	2351.16	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and of course {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1176	2353.14	2353.46	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	It 's just {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1175	2352.71	2356.19	F	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	Right . But it has {disfmarker} one {disfmarker} the first column has the meeting name ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1177	2356.42	2358.44	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so it could actually contain several meetings .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1178	2358.44	2358.75	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1179	2359.37	2360.64	F	PhD	s	+1	0	And the second column is the channel .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1180	2361.5	2366.53	F	PhD	s	+1	0	Third column is the , um , start times of the words and the fourth column is the duration of the words .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1181	2367.53	2368.39	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	And then we 're ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1182	2369.74	2370.47	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	um {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1183	2372.0	2379.43	F	PhD	fg|s	+1	0	OK . Then we have a messy alignment process where we actually insert into the sequence of words the , uh , tags
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1184	2379.43	2382.12	F	PhD	s^e	+1	0	for , like , where {disfmarker} where sentence {disfmarker} ends of sentence ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1185	2382.43	2383.53	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	question marks ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1186	2383.53	2385.58	F	PhD	fh|s^e	-1	0	um , {vocalsound} various other things .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1187	2385.59	2387.34	A	PhD	fg|s.%--	-1	0	Yeah . These are things that we had Don {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1188	2385.79	2386.07	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	Uh .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1189	2387.34	2392.22	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So , Don sort of , um , propagated the punctuation from the original transcriber {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1190	2388.19	2388.48	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1191	2392.22	2397.65	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so whether it was , like , question mark or period or , {vocalsound} um , you know , comma and things like that ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1192	2397.65	2406.93	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and we kept the {disfmarker} and disfluency dashes {disfmarker} uh , kept those in because we sort of wanna know where those are relative to the spurt overlaps {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1193	2400.38	2400.62	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1194	2406.57	2406.74	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1196	2407.31	2408.49	A	PhD	s^bsc	-1	0	sp overlaps ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1195	2406.84	2410.53	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So {disfmarker} so those are actually sort of retro - fitted into the time alignment .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1197	2408.49	2408.6	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	or {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1198	2411.43	2414.93	F	PhD	s	+1	1	And then we merge all the alignments from the various channels
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1199	2414.93	2416.39	F	PhD	s	+1	1	and we sort them by time .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1200	2418.56	2425.43	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And then there 's a {disfmarker} then there 's a process where you now determine the spurts .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1201	2426.11	2429.26	F	PhD	s	-1	0	That is {disfmarker} Actually , no , you do that before you merge the various channels .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1202	2429.26	2431.77	F	PhD	s	-1	0	So you {disfmarker} you id identify by some criterion ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1203	2431.87	2432.93	F	PhD	s	-1	0	which is pause length {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1204	2433.39	2436.25	F	PhD	s	-1	0	you identify the beginnings and ends of these spurts ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1205	2436.25	2439.4	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and you put another set of tags in there to keep those straight .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1206	2437.96	2438.38	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1207	2440.05	2444.77	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And then you merge everything in terms of , you know , linearizing the sequence based on the time marks .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1208	2445.45	2450.31	F	PhD	s	-1	0	And then {vocalsound} you extract the individual channels again ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1209	2450.31	2454.24	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but this time you know where the other people start and end talking {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1210	2454.58	2456.23	F	PhD	s	-1	0	you know , where their spurts start and end .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1211	2457.23	2462.6	F	PhD	s	+1	1	And so you extract the individual channels , uh , one sp spurt by spurt as it were .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1212	2463.17	2468.76	F	PhD	s	+1	1	Um , and inside the words or between the words you now have begin and end {pause} tags for overlaps .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1213	2468.9	2479.33	F	PhD	s	+1	0	So , you {disfmarker} you basically have everything sort of lined up and in a form where you can look at the individual speakers and how their speech relates to the other speakers ' speech .
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1214	2478.92	2479.11	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1215	2479.89	2482.4	A	PhD	s	-1	0	Uh , I mean , I think that 's actually really u useful also
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1216	2479.97	2480.35	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	And {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1217	2482.4	2494.17	A	PhD	qo^df	+1	0	because even if you weren't studying overlaps , if you wanna get a transcription for the far - field mikes , how are you gonna know which words from which speakers occurred at which times relative to each other ?
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1218	2494.17	2499.34	A	PhD	s	+1	0	You have to be able to {pause} get a transcript like {disfmarker} like this anyway , just for doing far - field recognition .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1219	2499.34	2499.65	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	So ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1220	2500.44	2501.91	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	you know , it 's {disfmarker} it 's sort of {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1221	2500.87	2501.15	F	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1222	2502.45	2504.4	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I thi it 's just an issue we haven't dealt with before ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1223	2504.4	2506.95	A	PhD	s^e.x	-1	0	how you time - align things that are overlapping anyway .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1225	2508.68	2509.42	C	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	That 's wonderful .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1224	2508.58	2508.97	F	PhD	fg	-1	0	So {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1228	2509.62	2511.49	A	PhD	s	-1	0	I mean , i I never thought about it before ,
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1226	2509.22	2509.48	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	Well {disfmarker}
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1227	2509.5	2510.23	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	And {disfmarker} and we {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1231	2511.49	2511.67	A	PhD	%-	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1229	2511.12	2511.93	E	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	Y yes .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1230	2511.24	2511.42	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	In {disfmarker}
Bmr019.E.dialogueact1232	2511.93	2520.39	E	Grad	s	-1	0	I mean , s when I came up with the original data {disfmarker} suggested data format based on the transcription graph , there 's capability of doing that sort of thing in there .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1233	2520.06	2520.47	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1235	2520.73	2523.39	A	PhD	s	-1	0	But you can't get it directly from the transcription .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1234	2520.69	2520.98	C	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	Mm - hmm .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1237	2520.98	2521.48	C	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	Yeah , that 's right .

Bmr019.A.dialogueact1240	2525.93	2527.39	A	PhD	s	-1	0	But it 's , you know {disfmarker} It 's clean ,

Bmr019.E.dialogueact1242	2528.56	2528.76	E	Grad	b	-1	0	Right .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1244	2529.23	2529.72	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	Um .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1243	2528.79	2530.18	F	PhD	s	-1	0	Well , there 's lots of little things .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1245	2530.18	2533.48	F	PhD	s	-1	0	It 's like there 're twelve different scripts which you run
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1246	2533.48	2535.06	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and then at the end you have what you want .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1247	2535.06	2536.04	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	But , um ,
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1248	2536.67	2540.02	F	PhD	s	-1	0	at the very last stage we throw away the actual time information .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1249	2540.02	2545.64	F	PhD	s	+1	0	All we care about is whether {disfmarker} that there 's a certain word was overlapped by someone else 's word .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1250	2546.01	2551.39	F	PhD	s	+1	0	So you sort of {disfmarker} at that point , you discretize things into just having overlap or no overlap .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1251	2552.05	2556.61	F	PhD	s^df	+1	0	Because we figure that 's about the level of analysis that we want to do for this paper .

Bmr019.F.dialogueact1253	2557.33	2563.64	F	PhD	s:qw	-1	0	But if you wanted to do a more fine - grained analysis and say , you know , how far into the word is the overlap , you could do that .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1255	2563.7	2564.17	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1254	2563.64	2565.45	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	It 's just {disfmarker} it 'll just require more {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1256	2564.74	2566.85	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	Just {pause} sort of huge .
Bmr019.F.dialogueact1257	2566.26	2567.24	F	PhD	s	-1	0	you know , slightly different {disfmarker}
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1258	2567.75	2572.02	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	What 's interesting is it 's exactly what , um , i in discussing with , um , Sue about this ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1259	2568.41	2568.79	A	PhD	b	-1	0	Yeah .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1260	2572.42	2578.29	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	um , she , um , i i i indicated that that {disfmarker} you know , that 's very important for overlap analysis .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1261	2577.44	2578.78	A	PhD	s^aa.x|s	-1	0	Yeah . It 's {disfmarker} it 's nice to know ,

Bmr019.A.dialogueact1263	2578.78	2583.48	A	PhD	s.x	-1	0	and also I think as a human , like , I don't always hear these in the actual order that they occur .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1264	2583.48	2586.16	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So I can have two foreground speakers ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1265	2586.16	2590.57	A	PhD	s^e	-1	0	you know , Morgan an and {vocalsound} um , Adam and Jane could all be talking ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1266	2590.57	2593.79	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and I could align each of them to be starting their utterance at the correct time ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1267	2593.79	2595.54	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and then look where they are relative to each other ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1268	2595.54	2597.02	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and that 's not really what I heard .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1269	2597.31	2598.48	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	And that 's another thing she said .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1270	2598.47	2599.78	A	PhD	s^df	-1	0	Cuz it 's just hard to do .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1271	2598.48	2600.84	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	This is {disfmarker} This is Bever 's {disfmarker} Bever 's effect ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1273	2601.34	2601.96	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	Y Yeah .
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1272	2601.14	2607.2	C	Postdoc	s	-1	0	when {disfmarker} where {disfmarker} In psy ps psycho - linguistics you have these experiments where people have perceptual biases a as to what they hear ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1274	2602.03	2602.45	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	It 's sort of {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1276	2607.65	2611.61	A	PhD	s^aa|s	-1	0	Yeah , you sort of move things around until you get to a {pause} low information point
Bmr019.C.dialogueact1275	2607.37	2610.03	C	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} Not the best {disfmarker}
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1277	2611.61	2613.26	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and yo then you can bring in the other person .
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1278	2613.26	2617.87	A	PhD	s	-1	0	So it 's {vocalsound} actually not even possible , I think , for any person to listen to a mixed signal ,
Bmr019.A.dialogueact1279	2618.06	2620.95	A	PhD	s	-1	0	even equalize , and make sure that they have all the words in the right order .

Bmr019.B.dialogueact1454	2836.58	2840.01	B	Professor	s	-1	0	I mean , for the evaluations , yes , we 'll run a version that hasn't been touched .

Bmr019.B.dialogueact1456	2840.55	2845.19	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But , uh , one of the reasons I have him messing around with that , because I think it 's sort of an open question that we don't know the answer to .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1457	2845.19	2850.64	B	Professor	s	-1	0	People always say very glibly {vocalsound} that i if you s show improvement on a bad system , that doesn't mean anything ,

Bmr019.B.dialogueact1460	2855.37	2857.95	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And I {disfmarker} I 've always sort of felt that that depends .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1461	2858.53	2863.95	B	Professor	s	-1	0	You know , that if some peopl If you 're actually are getting at something that has some {pause} conceptual substance to it , it will port .

Bmr019.B.dialogueact1463	2864.33	2870.77	B	Professor	s	-1	0	And in fact , most methods that people now use were originally tried with something that was not their absolute {pause} best system at some level .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1464	2871.31	2873.63	B	Professor	s	-1	0	But of course , sometimes it doesn't , uh , port .
Bmr019.B.dialogueact1465	2873.63	2875.3	B	Professor	s	-1	0	So I think that 's {disfmarker} that 's an interesting question .
