The final english SmartKom demo will be presented to the whole institute once the system is de-bugged and stabilised.
After the demo , the focus of research can switch towards purely scientific goals , including issues on ontology , deep semantic constructions , execution engines etc.
Moreover , a new system will be designed for the project and at least some parts of it should be built.
Similarly , the construction analyser should be a single , general tool working for both the tourist domain and child language modelling.
The focus for the next meeting will be on the belief-net , of which a working demo should be complete in the next few weeks.
Since there are not enough data , its connections and weights will have to be designed.
Although JavaBayes has been the tool of choice until now , the possibility that Hugin could be a better option should be investigated.
In order to promote the collaboration with EML , the group-ware server there will be updated with all progress being made in the two sites.
A talk on some of the issues will also be organised to take place at DFKI.
