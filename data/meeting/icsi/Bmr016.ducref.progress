A test set of digits data totalling two hours is nearly complete.
Digit extraction has been performed on roughly half of this data.
Future work may involve experimenting with the reading of digits in different prosodic groupings.
Preliminary ASR results were discussed.
Subsequent efforts will involve generating a better channel-based segmentation , and possibly doing echo cancellation , to improve recognition on the close-talking microphone data.
Filename conventions are being standardized.
Transcription checking procedures have been formalized , including a spell check , producing an exhaustive list of forms identified in the data , attributing every utterance to the appropriate speaker ID , glossing spoken forms with their full orthographic counterparts , e.g . 'cuz' and 'because' , transcribing acronyms , and encoding comments , i.e . glosses , vocalic and non-vocalic non-speech events , pragmatic cues , and the standardization of spoken forms , e.g . 'mm-hmm'.
Scripts will be used to convert a channelized master copy into forms that are appropriate for doing both recognition and linguistic analysis.
Coordinated efforts are in progress between the transcriber pool and speaker mn014 to fine-tune presegmented output to handle data from a variety of speakers and regions of speaker overlap.
