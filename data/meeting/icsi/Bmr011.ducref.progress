Modifications are being made to multi-trans to enable tight time markings at the boundaries of overlapping speech segments , and facilitate the transcription of such segments.
Pre-segmentation continues to be very beneficial to the transcription effort.
Work by speaker mn014 is in progress to compare the energies of different channels for detecting speech/non-speech portions , facilitating transcriptions,and potentially providing speaker identification information.
Efforts are being developed to create a cross-correlation setup linking recorded data with a map of where individual speakers were seated.
The transcriber pool has been performing within the expected range of work completed per the amount of time spent transcribing.
IBM has a team of people employed to transcribe meeting data , and who are transcribing single versus multiple channels.
The group discussed the potential for assigning additional tasks to ICSI's transcriber pool , including tagging more fine-grained acoustic information , and discourse and disfluency tagging.
