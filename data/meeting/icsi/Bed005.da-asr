Bed005.F.dialogueact13	145.11	145.93	F	PhD	s^m^na	-1	0	right wheeler still 
Bed005.B.dialogueact15	154.69	159.741	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	so uh probably after today that shouldn't come up in this meeting this 
Bed005.B.dialogueact16	159.741	164.101	B	Professor	s	-1	0	up in this meeting this this this should be you know there's a there's another thing going on of gathering data and 
Bed005.B.dialogueact17	164.576	167.216	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and that's pretty much independent of this bought 
Bed005.B.dialogueact18	167.638	171.348	B	Professor	s	-1	0	bought um i just want to make sure we're all together on this what 
Bed005.B.dialogueact19	171.813	190.084	B	Professor	s:s	+1	2	on this what we think it's going to happen is that uh in parallel starting about now we're going to get say to where are you working with me robert draft a note that we're going to send out to various cog psych another classes saying here's an opportunity to be a subject contact 
Bed005.B.dialogueact20	190.671	191.831	B	Professor	s^e:s	-1	0	contact say 
Bed005.B.dialogueact21	192.446	197.676	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then to be a certain number of uh hours during the week which she will be available and we'll 
Bed005.B.dialogueact22	197.676	199.676	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and we'll bring in people roughly 
Bed005.B.dialogueact23	199.676	200.696	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	people roughly how many robert 
Bed005.B.dialogueact24	201.271	201.801	B	Professor	qy^e	-1	0	we we know oh fifty 
Bed005.C.dialogueact25	201.482	203.732	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	we we know okay so we're oh fifty was a sort of a first 
Bed005.B.dialogueact26	202.972	205.512	B	Professor	s^bk|s	+1	0	okay so we're looking for a total of fifty people not necessarily was a sort of a first 
Bed005.B.dialogueact27	205.712	208.242	B	Professor	s	+1	1	people not necessarily by any means all students but we'll we'll start 
Bed005.B.dialogueact28	208.242	210.222	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but we'll we'll start with with that in parallel 
Bed005.B.dialogueact29	210.705	214.235	B	Professor	s	+1	1	in parallel with that we're going to need to actually do the script 
Bed005.B.dialogueact30	215.134	227.422	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so i guess it's a plane ever meeting friday afternoon uh with uh jane and maybe liz and whoever on actually getting the script worked out but 
Bed005.B.dialogueact31	227.992	235.053	B	Professor	s	+1	3	out but what i'd like to it's okay is this too i say start recruiting in parallel and possibly start running subjects next week week after 
Bed005.B.dialogueact32	235.773	237.243	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	week after the spring break and people 
Bed005.B.dialogueact33	237.243	239.863	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and people look at them some subjects next door 
Bed005.C.dialogueact34	239.06	239.57	C	Grad	b.%	-1	0	next door 
Bed005.B.dialogueact35	239.863	240.703	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	next door if 
Bed005.C.dialogueact36	240.562	242.662	C	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	oh okay then we if if they would not be here for spring break so 
Bed005.B.dialogueact37	242.62	243.49	B	Professor	s^bk|s^cs	-1	0	oh okay then we won't do that spring break so 
Bed005.C.dialogueact38	242.662	242.932	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	oh okay then we spring break so 
Bed005.B.dialogueact39	243.84	244.04	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	won't do that so that's easy 
Bed005.B.dialogueact40	244.11	244.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so that's easy 
Bed005.B.dialogueact41	245.89	246.89	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed005.B.dialogueact42	249.38	252.032	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	so is is that makes sense to everybody yeah also 
Bed005.C.dialogueact43	251.944	252.204	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	makes sense to everybody yeah also 
Bed005.C.dialogueact44	252.724	259.831	C	Grad	s	-1	0	also um buff and i will um do something of which i may kindly ask you to to do the same thing which 
Bed005.C.dialogueact45	259.831	264.381	C	Grad	s	+1	1	do the same thing which is we going to check out our social infrastructure for possible subjects meaning 
Bed005.C.dialogueact46	264.381	268.071	C	Grad	s	-1	0	meaning um conservatives gymnastic classes preschooler parents 
Bed005.C.dialogueact47	268.071	269.791	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	preschooler parents and so forth 
Bed005.C.dialogueact48	270.18	272.31	C	Grad	s	-1	0	they also sometimes a flexible schedules so if you 
Bed005.C.dialogueact49	272.713	276.533	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	so if you happen to be sort of in a non students social stacking and you know people 
Bed005.C.dialogueact50	276.533	279.273	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	stacking and you know people may be interested in being subjects we also 
Bed005.C.dialogueact51	279.774	283.824	C	Grad	s	-1	0	we also considered using the berkeley high school and the their teachers maybe 
Bed005.C.dialogueact52	284.476	287.316	C	Grad	s	-1	0	that's a good idea and get them interested in 
Bed005.B.dialogueact53	286.41	286.98	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	that's a good idea 
Bed005.C.dialogueact54	288.324	289.754	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um so 
Bed005.C.dialogueact55	289.915	292.085	C	Grad	s	-1	0	oh yeah that's so that's as far as our brainstorming was concerned 
Bed005.B.dialogueact56	292.354	293.714	B	Professor	s^aa|s^ba^r	-1	0	oh yeah that's was great i 
Bed005.C.dialogueact57	298.699	299.099	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	but 
Bed005.C.dialogueact58	299.937	302.647	C	Grad	s^cc^rt	-1	0	but i'll just make the first draft of the uh no it's the 
Bed005.C.dialogueact59	303.017	303.647	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	right up north in it to you 
Bed005.C.dialogueact60	303.647	304.567	C	Grad	s^cc	-1	0	right up north in it to you and say and then 
Bed005.C.dialogueact61	304.567	305.007	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	and say and then 
Bed005.B.dialogueact62	306.04	307.48	B	Professor	qh^cs	-1	0	and money also copy jane 
Bed005.C.dialogueact63	310.882	311.502	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um i we 
Bed005.C.dialogueact64	311.872	317.822	C	Grad	qy	-1	0	um i we have we concluded that uh these these forums are sufficient for us unnecessary 
Bed005.B.dialogueact65	318.46	320.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh i think they're necessary 
Bed005.B.dialogueact66	321.149	322.159	B	Professor	s	+1	1	just the permission form uh 
Bed005.C.dialogueact67	321.878	322.268	C	Grad	b	-1	0	just the permission form uh 
Bed005.B.dialogueact69	322.919	324.039	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh there has to be one and i think we just going to use 
Bed005.C.dialogueact68	322.618	323.368	C	Grad	b	-1	0	uh there has to be one 
Bed005.B.dialogueact70	324.039	325.949	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and i think we just going to use it as it is 
Bed005.B.dialogueact71	326.049	327.659	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.C.dialogueact72	326.129	326.499	C	Grad	b.%	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.C.dialogueact73	328.382	329.052	C	Grad	qy	-1	0	well yeah there's one tricky yeah every minute 
Bed005.B.dialogueact74	329.06	329.38	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	well yeah there's one tricky 
Bed005.B.dialogueact75	329.57	332.227	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	well yeah there's one tricky part about um 
Bed005.B.dialogueact76	332.867	333.877	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed005.B.dialogueact77	334.107	335.167	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	they have the right 
Bed005.B.dialogueact78	336.156	336.826	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed005.B.dialogueact79	337.806	343.686	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	it's the last part if you agree to participate love the opportunity to have anything excise would you prefer not to have included in the data set

Bed005.B.dialogueact81	345.28	348.71	B	Professor	s	-1	0	now that we had to be included for this other one which

Bed005.C.dialogueact83	349.11	349.47	C	Grad	b	-1	0	might have 
Bed005.B.dialogueact84	351.75	354.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you know about something in this case it doesn't really make sense 
Bed005.B.dialogueact85	355.426	364.196	B	Professor	fh|s:s	+1	0	um so what i'd like to do is also have our subject sign a waiver saying i don't want to see the final transcript if they 
Bed005.C.dialogueact86	364.167	365.007	C	Grad	b	-1	0	if they don't if they said no i'm not

Bed005.B.dialogueact91	374.134	375.414	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so we might actually um 
Bed005.B.dialogueact92	375.414	375.964	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed005.B.dialogueact93	377.625	380.045	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	c. j. may say that you know you can't do this uh on 
Bed005.B.dialogueact94	380.045	382.735	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh on the same form we need a separate form but anyway 
Bed005.B.dialogueact95	382.735	390.855	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	a separate form but anyway i i i'd like to um added a little and think that initial saying i don't i don't want to see the final transcript but other

Bed005.E.dialogueact138	471.52	472.28	E	Grad	qrr	-1	0	yeah we can show right well about at all ever going to see that 
Bed005.B.dialogueact139	472.141	472.301	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right well that 
Bed005.C.dialogueact140	472.641	480.761	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	right well we the first thing we did is we we tried to do dude changed the the house and into yvonne well running or runs that 
Bed005.B.dialogueact141	480.092	480.362	B	Professor	b	-1	0	or runs 
Bed005.C.dialogueact143	481.529	484.399	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and we noticed that whatever we tried to do it had no effect 
Bed005.E.dialogueact142	481.307	481.517	E	Grad	b	-1	0	and we noticed 
Bed005.C.dialogueact145	485.452	486.202	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and we up myself 
Bed005.E.dialogueact144	485.36	485.64	E	Grad	b	-1	0	and we up myself 
Bed005.C.dialogueact147	487.299	491.899	C	Grad	s	+1	0	and uh the reason was that the posse completely ignores the burp

Bed005.C.dialogueact149	493.355	499.63	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so this sentence sentence is isis the the same output just think person property 
Bed005.E.dialogueact148	493.119	493.199	E	Grad	b	-1	0	so this 
Bed005.E.dialogueact150	494.169	495.369	E	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	sentence just think person property 
Bed005.C.dialogueact151	500.34	506.38	C	Grad	s^e^rt	-1	0	um even if you you fine it's um aw it on of this this basic i see

Bed005.C.dialogueact160	515.27	516.75	C	Grad	s	-1	0	said it it does look get that but all 
Bed005.E.dialogueact161	515.3	515.65	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	said it it 
Bed005.C.dialogueact162	516.75	519.36	C	Grad	s	-1	0	does look get that but all the rest just simply frosting on the cake and 
Bed005.C.dialogueact163	519.96	521.71	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and this optimum for that part for 
Bed005.E.dialogueact164	520.354	520.674	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	this optimum for 
Bed005.B.dialogueact165	522.434	525.684	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	so you should you you i i going to show us the little templates

Bed005.A.dialogueact254	697.849	698.519	A	Grad	b.%	-1	0	as well and um 
Bed005.C.dialogueact255	697.992	699.292	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	as well and um one thing i was wondering was 
Bed005.B.dialogueact257	699.336	699.996	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	one thing i was wondering was 
Bed005.D.dialogueact256	699.25	703.68	D	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	+1	1	one thing i was wondering was those functions there are those things that modified m. t. basically 
Bed005.C.dialogueact258	703.901	704.111	C	Grad	s^aa	+1	0	basically okay 
Bed005.D.dialogueact259	704.278	704.548	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bed005.C.dialogueact260	706.106	707.666	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and that's that's next to but we'll get 
Bed005.B.dialogueact262	707.875	708.365	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	next to but we'll get to that in a second 
Bed005.C.dialogueact261	707.666	708.926	C	Grad	s	-1	0	next to but we'll get to that in a second 
Bed005.B.dialogueact264	709.861	709.931	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	and so this 
Bed005.C.dialogueact263	709.561	711.581	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and so this means um 
Bed005.C.dialogueact265	712.799	715.719	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	this and see i've not optional 
Bed005.C.dialogueact266	716.269	719.449	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	want i like as well maybe in there but me out 
Bed005.C.dialogueact267	719.449	720.839	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so in there but me out not be in there 
Bed005.B.dialogueact268	721.08	725.16	B	Professor	s^bu^rt:s	-1	0	so the point is if it says this and see it also work and see in this 
Bed005.E.dialogueact269	721.704	722.484	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	so the point is if it says this and

Bed005.C.dialogueact271	726.242	726.502	C	Grad	b	-1	0	the other order

Bed005.D.dialogueact295	763.17	765.976	D	Grad	s|s^f	+1	0	but there one was this percentage signs right 
Bed005.D.dialogueact296	766.565	768.355	D	Grad	qw	-1	0	yeah so i mean lately and have them because 
Bed005.C.dialogueact298	768.741	769.091	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah have them because if you didn't happen 
Bed005.D.dialogueact297	768.355	769.795	D	Grad	s^df.%-	-1	0	yeah have them because if you didn't happen 
Bed005.C.dialogueact299	770.24	771.03	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i tell you why because it gives you 
Bed005.C.dialogueact300	771.03	772.82	C	Grad	s	-1	0	because it gives you a score 
Bed005.E.dialogueact301	773.295	773.575	E	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.C.dialogueact303	774.201	783.34	C	Grad	s	+1	0	and the value of the score is i assume i guess the more of these outcomes things actually in there the higher their score it is okay that's the main purpose 
Bed005.D.dialogueact302	773.853	774.663	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	and the value 
Bed005.D.dialogueact304	780.505	780.865	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	the higher their score okay 
Bed005.D.dialogueact307	781.356	782.656	D	Grad	s|s^bk	-1	0	it is that's the main purpose 
Bed005.E.dialogueact306	781.262	781.772	E	Grad	s	-1	0	that's the main purpose 
Bed005.F.dialogueact305	781.06	781.44	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	that's the main purpose

Bed005.C.dialogueact311	791.22	792.66	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	it's doing something 
Bed005.C.dialogueact312	793.76	794.3	C	Grad	s^bsc	-1	0	some things 
Bed005.C.dialogueact313	795.18	796.14	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and it's very flexible 
Bed005.C.dialogueact314	797.149	797.919	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i just tried to 
Bed005.E.dialogueact315	797.438	797.818	E	Grad	b	-1	0	i just tried to

Bed005.C.dialogueact323	804.7	809.498	C	Grad	fg|s^tc	+1	0	okay and that's hope that the generation will not be more difficult to even though the generator

Bed005.C.dialogueact326	815.044	815.224	C	Grad	b	-1	0	that means 
Bed005.C.dialogueact327	815.434	819.514	C	Grad	s	-1	0	that means they may need two hours and twenty minutes from time in our ten minutes 
Bed005.B.dialogueact330	820.931	821.081	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	i hope

Bed005.C.dialogueact484	1241.69	1242.61	C	Grad	qw	-1	0	well what's the sentence 
Bed005.B.dialogueact485	1243.48	1244.3	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i went to teacher you to see 
Bed005.C.dialogueact486	1244.48	1245.69	C	Grad	s^m|s^aa	-1	0	you to see here 
Bed005.C.dialogueact487	1248.09	1251.53	C	Grad	s^cs:s^am	-1	0	where is it's playing that should also be a reference to something maybe 
Bed005.C.dialogueact488	1253.39	1254.9	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	or this is through that um 
Bed005.C.dialogueact489	1257.23	1257.34	C	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah we 
Bed005.C.dialogueact490	1257.77	1264.79	C	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah we changed and so we you know we add something to the disc or status that the user wants to change something that we're sort of done before

Bed005.C.dialogueact492	1267.71	1270.78	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and that whatever is being changed has something to do with the cinema 
Bed005.A.dialogueact493	1271.55	1274.31	A	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	that whatever it takes is in three was it actually changes the state not uh

Bed005.B.dialogueact499	1279.93	1280.26	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	i seen it it it runs 
Bed005.B.dialogueact500	1280.26	1283.71	B	Professor	s	-1	0	seen it it it runs around looking for discourse status tags 
Bed005.B.dialogueact501	1284.79	1286.93	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and doing whatever it does with them 
Bed005.B.dialogueact502	1287.55	1289.16	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and other people's northers tax

Bed005.B.dialogueact504	1295.29	1304.65	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	so yeah i definitely think it's it's worth the exercise of trying to actually add something that isn't there

Bed005.C.dialogueact508	1307.9	1309.81	C	Grad	s^na.x	+1	0	just yeah can understanding compete understanding and um 
Bed005.B.dialogueact509	1309.29	1310.63	B	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	yeah can understanding what's going on then and um 
Bed005.B.dialogueact510	1310.97	1318.0	B	Professor	s^t^tc	-1	0	what's going on then the next thing we talked about is actually um thing out how to add her own tags and stuff like that 
Bed005.C.dialogueact511	1318.26	1318.57	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.C.dialogueact512	1319.8	1320.39	C	Grad	s^tc	-1	0	pun number two i 
Bed005.C.dialogueact513	1321.04	1324.08	C	Grad	s	+1	1	got the n. c. out for the routes today i 
Bed005.C.dialogueact514	1325.11	1326.2	C	Grad	s	-1	0	said i got some more this is sort of 
Bed005.C.dialogueact515	1326.54	1327.37	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	this is sort of the uh 
Bed005.C.dialogueact516	1327.37	1329.5	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	the uh 
Bed005.C.dialogueact517	1339.35	1339.57	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	mm interesting 
Bed005.C.dialogueact518	1339.57	1340.04	C	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	mm interesting it's just going up it's 
Bed005.C.dialogueact519	1340.04	1340.85	C	Grad	s	-1	0	it's just going up it's 
Bed005.C.dialogueact520	1340.85	1343.83	C	Grad	s	-1	0	it's just going up it's not going 
Bed005.C.dialogueact521	1351.62	1362.79	C	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	so this is somewhat i got today is the then you'll um i'm three out for um the maps 
Bed005.B.dialogueact522	1363.23	1363.46	B	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.C.dialogueact523	1364.3	1366.1	C	Grad	s	-1	0	uh and dressing like samples so this to see 
Bed005.C.dialogueact524	1366.1	1369.61	C	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	so this to see x. amount as a sort of what it would look like later on you know 
Bed005.C.dialogueact525	1369.88	1372.18	C	Grad	s	-1	0	on you know it you can see it on the solution and 
Bed005.C.dialogueact526	1372.9	1376.89	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and as a sport it's sort of this the the structure of the map requests 
Bed005.C.dialogueact527	1377.58	1378.12	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.C.dialogueact528	1379.84	1380.91	C	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	it's not very interesting 
Bed005.C.dialogueact529	1381.76	1385.81	C	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	and here it is the more interesting stuff classes their ballots 
Bed005.C.dialogueact530	1386.57	1387.69	C	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	route adam ends 
Bed005.C.dialogueact531	1388.26	1390.98	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and again as he thought it's really simple this 
Bed005.C.dialogueact532	1390.98	1396.22	C	Grad	s	-1	0	really simple this is sort of the um um parameters we have 
Bed005.C.dialogueact533	1396.7	1400.96	C	Grad	s	-1	0	we have the found objects into objects and so forth 
Bed005.C.dialogueact534	1401.48	1403.0	C	Grad	s	-1	0	plans of interest to them the weight 
Bed005.C.dialogueact535	1404.03	1404.89	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bed005.C.dialogueact536	1405.85	1409.16	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	i asked them whether or not we could um a 
Bed005.C.dialogueact537	1409.74	1411.58	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	a i was a little bit 
Bed005.C.dialogueact538	1412.33	1418.08	C	Grad	s	-1	0	it seems to me that this way of doing it this other prospective step backwards from the way we've done it before it seems to me 
Bed005.C.dialogueact539	1418.08	1418.19	C	Grad	%--	-1	0	it seems to me 
Bed005.C.dialogueact540	1418.57	1420.63	C	Grad	s	-1	0	it seems to me that some notions were missing 
Bed005.B.dialogueact542	1421.78	1422.02	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	so they said did your so these uh these uh 
Bed005.C.dialogueact541	1421.43	1422.69	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	so they said did your so these uh these uh 
Bed005.B.dialogueact543	1422.33	1424.66	B	Professor	s^bu	+1	0	so they said did your friends back it you email these uh that 
Bed005.C.dialogueact544	1424.69	1424.94	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	you email that 
Bed005.C.dialogueact545	1424.94	1426.09	C	Grad	s^na	-1	0	you email so this is not a complicated negotiation that we're doing this 
Bed005.B.dialogueact546	1425.48	1427.46	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	so this is not a complicated negotiation this is we're doing this 
Bed005.B.dialogueact548	1427.72	1429.66	B	Professor	s^bu|qy^d^g	-1	0	this is not seven committees or anything right no this 
Bed005.C.dialogueact547	1427.69	1427.83	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	this is 
Bed005.C.dialogueact549	1429.75	1432.06	C	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	or anything right great so this is just no this is very words 
Bed005.B.dialogueact550	1432.07	1432.33	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	great so this is just 
Bed005.B.dialogueact551	1432.43	1433.4	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	great so this is just plain it it's a design 
Bed005.B.dialogueact552	1433.84	1435.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	plain it it's a design thing not a political thing once yeah 
Bed005.B.dialogueact554	1435.86	1438.4	B	Professor	s	-1	0	thing once we we can just sort of agree on what ought to be done yeah 
Bed005.C.dialogueact553	1435.67	1435.83	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	thing once yeah 
Bed005.B.dialogueact556	1439.23	1439.39	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	exactly 
Bed005.C.dialogueact555	1439.13	1439.67	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	exactly 
Bed005.C.dialogueact557	1440.42	1441.18	C	Grad	fg	-1	0	and um 
Bed005.C.dialogueact558	1442.23	1443.2	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	and uh 
Bed005.C.dialogueact559	1443.72	1447.3	C	Grad	s	-1	0	will be uh so did you understand is very simple the you have 
Bed005.C.dialogueact560	1447.3	1448.51	C	Grad	s^rt	+1	1	the you have a wrapped and you got 
Bed005.C.dialogueact561	1448.71	1450.2	C	Grad	s	+1	0	a wrapped and you got it up in different pieces 
Bed005.C.dialogueact562	1451.08	1456.71	C	Grad	s:s	+1	1	and every every element of that of that every second week on about them and 
Bed005.C.dialogueact563	1457.62	1460.55	C	Grad	s^rt	+1	0	and so for me to be we cut up in three different steps 
Bed005.C.dialogueact564	1461.07	1464.56	C	Grad	s	+1	0	and every step as if i'm up checked where you start to object where you 
Bed005.C.dialogueact565	1464.57	1467.91	C	Grad	s	+1	1	object where you where years and in some points of interest in on the 
Bed005.C.dialogueact566	1468.88	1477.02	C	Grad	s	-1	0	put him i missing here and then maybe it was just me being stupid is i didn't get the the notion of the government oh of the whole route really 
Bed005.C.dialogueact567	1477.35	1480.17	C	Grad	s	-1	0	really was that straightforward it be for me and 
Bed005.C.dialogueact568	1480.87	1481.77	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and some other stuff and i 
Bed005.C.dialogueact569	1481.77	1487.4	C	Grad	s	+1	0	some other stuff and i suggested that they should maybe good kind enough to do two things for us is a one 
Bed005.C.dialogueact570	1487.4	1497.59	C	Grad	s^rt:s^rt	+1	1	us is a one um i was advocating uh some tax for actions scheme uh and true mister approach 
Bed005.C.dialogueact571	1498.35	1498.71	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	and 
Bed005.C.dialogueact572	1502.99	1514.88	C	Grad	fh|s.%--	-1	0	and also um since you had suggested that that um we figure out if we ever find them a reason wanted to got directed to the g. i. s. and the planner 
Bed005.C.dialogueact573	1515.58	1516.47	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	i'll talk we can do it now what's the state 
Bed005.C.dialogueact574	1516.47	1519.53	C	Grad	s	-1	0	do it now what's the state of the art tough getting two entrances um what's 
Bed005.C.dialogueact575	1519.53	1521.11	C	Grad	qh	-1	0	um what's the syntax for that time got getting too 
Bed005.C.dialogueact576	1521.11	1525.57	C	Grad	qh	-1	0	time got getting too stepsons and calculating dose on the spot 
Bed005.C.dialogueact577	1526.27	1528.58	C	Grad	s	+1	0	and the approximate anyhow is the default 
Bed005.C.dialogueact578	1529.07	1530.33	C	Grad	s	+1	0	that's all they do with these days wherever 
Bed005.C.dialogueact579	1530.7	1538.4	C	Grad	s.x	+1	0	days wherever you find a route planner and does nothing but get to the closest part where the street network is at minimum distance with your budgets and 
Bed005.B.dialogueact580	1531.3	1531.68	B	Professor	b	-1	0	you find a route

Bed005.B.dialogueact583	1542.49	1543.77	B	Professor	fg|s^ba	-1	0	well no this is important but 
Bed005.B.dialogueact584	1543.77	1548.49	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	this is important but uh what again it's kind of mm almost managerial point 
Bed005.B.dialogueact585	1549.11	1549.87	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	um 
Bed005.B.dialogueact586	1554.19	1555.18	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	you're in the midst of this you know better but it 
Bed005.B.dialogueact587	1555.18	1555.76	B	Professor	s^df^e	-1	0	this you know better but it 
Bed005.B.dialogueact588	1555.76	1564.07	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	this you know better but it it's it's probably a good idea to lick to minimize the number of change requests we make of them so it seemed 
Bed005.B.dialogueact589	1564.49	1567.67	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	so it seemed to be what we ought to do is get our story together 
Bed005.B.dialogueact590	1568.78	1569.15	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	okay and think about something 
Bed005.B.dialogueact591	1569.15	1574.23	B	Professor	s^cs^e	+1	1	and think about something internally before asking them to make changes 
Bed005.C.dialogueact592	1575.06	1575.42	C	Grad	b	-1	0	or 
Bed005.B.dialogueact593	1575.82	1575.97	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	or 
Bed005.B.dialogueact594	1576.06	1577.47	B	Professor	qy	-1	0	is it just makes sense to you guys that 
Bed005.B.dialogueact595	1577.47	1579.71	B	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	to you guys that i mean you're you're doing the the interactions but it seemed 
Bed005.B.dialogueact596	1579.71	1588.03	B	Professor	s^cs^df.%--	-1	0	the interactions but it seemed to me that what we ought to do is come up with a uh something where you um 
Bed005.B.dialogueact597	1590.18	1592.56	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and i i don't know who smoke working with closely and probably 
Bed005.B.dialogueact598	1592.69	1593.42	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	closely and probably john oh okay 
Bed005.B.dialogueact599	1593.98	1594.36	B	Professor	s^f	-1	0	john oh okay uh 
Bed005.B.dialogueact600	1594.9	1596.32	B	Professor	s	-1	0	uh take what they have 
Bed005.B.dialogueact601	1598.33	1600.07	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	send it to everybody saying this is what they have this is what we think we 
Bed005.B.dialogueact602	1600.07	1601.63	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	this is what we think we should have 
Bed005.B.dialogueact603	1602.28	1602.56	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	okay and then having 
Bed005.B.dialogueact604	1602.62	1606.65	B	Professor	s.%--:s.%--	-1	0	okay and then having to an iterations within our group saying huh well okay 
Bed005.B.dialogueact605	1606.99	1607.3	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	well okay and get our 
Bed005.B.dialogueact606	1607.51	1609.55	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and get our best idea of what we should add 
Bed005.C.dialogueact607	1609.88	1610.13	C	Grad	b	-1	0	should add and then go back 
Bed005.B.dialogueact608	1610.49	1611.53	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then go back to that 
Bed005.B.dialogueact609	1612.76	1613.02	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	because there are i don't know it just makes 
Bed005.B.dialogueact610	1613.02	1613.68	B	Professor	s^bd^no	-1	0	are i don't know it just makes 
Bed005.B.dialogueact611	1613.68	1614.73	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	are i don't know it just makes sense to you or 
Bed005.B.dialogueact612	1614.73	1614.91	B	Professor	qrr.%--	-1	0	sense to you or 
Bed005.C.dialogueact613	1615.17	1617.13	C	Grad	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	yeah especially if we want sort 
Bed005.C.dialogueact614	1617.94	1624.7	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	sort of what i might feeding was we we sort of reserve something that hasn't and okay naval that's 
Bed005.C.dialogueact615	1624.92	1627.59	C	Grad	s	-1	0	naval that's that was my first sort of step 
Bed005.B.dialogueact616	1627.02	1627.38	B	Professor	b	-1	0	of step 
Bed005.C.dialogueact617	1628.1	1628.45	C	Grad	%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.C.dialogueact618	1629.16	1632.83	C	Grad	s	-1	0	no matter how we want to call it there's a sort of alternate and and 
Bed005.B.dialogueact620	1633.23	1633.46	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right if we get 
Bed005.C.dialogueact619	1632.83	1645.73	C	Grad	s	-1	0	right right that's right so so yeah and and if we get something in there that is a structure in elaborate and and and and and complex enough to to prove maybe enable the whole simulation one of these days that would be the perfect was 
Bed005.B.dialogueact621	1642.4	1642.65	B	Professor	b	-1	0	right one of these 
Bed005.B.dialogueact622	1644.72	1645.1	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	that's right so so yeah be the perfect was 
Bed005.B.dialogueact623	1645.1	1645.29	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	so so yeah perfect was 
Bed005.B.dialogueact624	1645.29	1646.19	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	so so yeah the problem isn't the perfect was 
Bed005.B.dialogueact625	1646.19	1648.74	B	Professor	s	+1	0	the problem isn't the short red grange optimization it's 
Bed005.B.dialogueact626	1648.74	1651.79	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it's just sort of one or two year kind of thing okay 
Bed005.B.dialogueact627	1651.79	1655.4	B	Professor	s^f|qh	+1	1	kind of thing okay well this class of things we think we like try to do in a year or two how 
Bed005.B.dialogueact628	1655.92	1658.03	B	Professor	qh	-1	0	two how how would we try to characterize as in what we want to request now 
Bed005.B.dialogueact629	1658.03	1662.19	B	Professor	qw	+1	0	in what we want to request now it's going to leave enough space to do all that stuff right now uhhuh yep 
Bed005.C.dialogueact630	1661.65	1661.95	C	Grad	b	-1	0	to do all that stuff uhhuh 
Bed005.B.dialogueact632	1662.55	1662.79	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	right now yep 
Bed005.C.dialogueact631	1662.14	1662.39	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right now yep 
Bed005.B.dialogueact633	1662.91	1664.32	B	Professor	s	-1	0	right now but that requires some thought yep 
Bed005.C.dialogueact634	1665.25	1665.41	C	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.B.dialogueact635	1666.57	1671.62	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so that sounds like a great thing to do as the priority item 
Bed005.B.dialogueact636	1672.55	1674.24	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	um this is i can do it 
Bed005.C.dialogueact637	1674.39	1674.53	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	it 
Bed005.B.dialogueact638	1675.5	1685.0	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so you so you guys will send to the rest of us a version of um this 
Bed005.B.dialogueact639	1685.6	1688.16	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	we suggest yes i guess it improvements and be uh description 
Bed005.A.dialogueact640	1687.55	1689.56	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	we suggest yes i guess it improvements in description well 
Bed005.A.dialogueact641	1689.56	1689.9	A	Grad	%--	-1	0	in well 
Bed005.B.dialogueact642	1689.79	1690.07	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	in well yeah so they 
Bed005.B.dialogueact643	1690.07	1690.2	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yeah so they 
Bed005.B.dialogueact644	1690.47	1694.08	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	yeah so they be uh not everyone uh reach german so if you 
Bed005.B.dialogueact645	1694.08	1694.58	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so if you 
Bed005.B.dialogueact646	1695.1	1695.83	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.A.dialogueact647	1696.23	1696.9	A	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.B.dialogueact648	1697.57	1701.84	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	uh change the description to uh english 
Bed005.A.dialogueact649	1701.63	1701.9	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	english 
Bed005.B.dialogueact650	1702.46	1704.92	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bed005.B.dialogueact651	1706.57	1707.01	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	then then yeah then with some suggestions 
Bed005.B.dialogueact652	1707.01	1710.12	B	Professor	fh|qh^cs	-1	0	yeah then with some suggestions about where where do we go from here 
Bed005.A.dialogueact654	1711.6	1711.75	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	uh 
Bed005.B.dialogueact653	1711.57	1715.98	B	Professor	s	+1	0	uh this and this of course is just the action and it 
Bed005.B.dialogueact655	1715.98	1717.97	B	Professor	s	+1	1	action and it it's important to worry about the language and but 
Bed005.B.dialogueact656	1717.97	1724.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	about the language and but for the moment just uh for the class of of things we might want to try to encompass 
Bed005.B.dialogueact657	1725.42	1726.34	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.A.dialogueact658	1727.22	1731.29	A	Grad	s	-1	0	and the scope of this is beyond uh approach and this service yeah oh yeah yeah yeah this is 
Bed005.A.dialogueact660	1731.29	1731.74	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah yeah yeah yeah this is 
Bed005.B.dialogueact659	1730.82	1731.73	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	and this service yeah oh yeah yeah yeah this is 
Bed005.B.dialogueact661	1731.73	1738.59	B	Professor	s	+1	1	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah this is this is everything that that um you know um we might want to do in the next couple of years 
Bed005.A.dialogueact662	1735.85	1736.27	A	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah you know um 
Bed005.A.dialogueact663	1740.81	1741.33	A	Grad	s^bu.%--	-1	0	so what would okay 
Bed005.C.dialogueact664	1740.83	1741.09	C	Grad	b.%	-1	0	so what would okay 
Bed005.A.dialogueact665	1741.66	1741.97	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	would okay 
Bed005.B.dialogueact666	1744.48	1745.48	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we don't i mean that's an issue we don't know what 
Bed005.B.dialogueact667	1745.48	1746.54	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	yeah an issue we don't know what 
Bed005.A.dialogueact668	1746.87	1747.27	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah yeah that i just 
Bed005.A.dialogueact669	1747.27	1747.77	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	yeah that i just 
Bed005.A.dialogueact670	1751.28	1751.65	A	Grad	s^df.%--	-1	0	but the yeah okay 
Bed005.A.dialogueact671	1751.65	1752.06	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	but the yeah okay that i just this 
Bed005.A.dialogueact672	1752.12	1752.65	A	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	that i just this 
Bed005.A.dialogueact673	1752.95	1756.96	A	Grad	s	-1	0	that i just this x. m. l. stuff here just has to do with source past goal type stuff 
Bed005.A.dialogueact674	1757.48	1760.49	A	Grad	s	-1	0	in terms of traveling through heidelberg or right 
Bed005.C.dialogueact675	1758.81	1759.44	C	Grad	b	-1	0	traveling through heidelberg 
Bed005.A.dialogueact677	1760.79	1762.82	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	or travel specifically right 
Bed005.B.dialogueact676	1760.64	1760.94	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	or right 
Bed005.A.dialogueact678	1763.57	1765.64	A	Grad	qy	-1	0	so but the so is the domain greater than that 
Bed005.B.dialogueact679	1766.1	1766.39	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	okay no i think 
Bed005.A.dialogueact681	1766.81	1767.42	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay no i think i think the i think the 
Bed005.B.dialogueact680	1766.76	1770.65	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	okay no i think i think the i think the idea is sad 
Bed005.B.dialogueact682	1772.38	1773.89	B	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	well it it's difficult but i 
Bed005.B.dialogueact683	1773.89	1777.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	okay it's difficult but i think we don't need to get beyond it terrorists in heidelberg it 
Bed005.A.dialogueact684	1777.12	1777.43	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay heidelberg it 
Bed005.B.dialogueact685	1777.94	1786.54	B	Professor	s	+1	1	okay heidelberg it seems to me we can get all the complexity we want in actions and in language without going outside of course in heidelberg 
Bed005.B.dialogueact686	1787.46	1787.82	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	okay 
Bed005.B.dialogueact687	1788.18	1793.69	B	Professor	s	-1	0	but you know it depending what people are interested in one could have uh two hours one could 
Bed005.B.dialogueact688	1793.69	1800.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	hours one could have um explanations of why something is is you know why why was this done or really no 
Bed005.B.dialogueact689	1800.17	1800.33	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	or really no 
Bed005.B.dialogueact690	1800.33	1801.84	B	Professor	s	-1	0	or really no there's no end 
Bed005.B.dialogueact691	1802.3	1808.52	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	to the complexity you can build and to the uh what the in heidelberg might ask 
Bed005.A.dialogueact692	1807.87	1808.37	A	Grad	b	-1	0	might ask 
Bed005.B.dialogueact693	1809.34	1818.29	B	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	so at least unless somebody else wants to to suggest otherwise i think the general domain we don't have to to uh broadened 
Bed005.B.dialogueact694	1819.18	1820.49	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	this person heidelberg 
Bed005.B.dialogueact695	1823.44	1826.38	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and it's something somebody comes up with that can't be done that way then sure whoa look 
Bed005.B.dialogueact696	1826.38	1827.45	B	Professor	s	-1	0	sure whoa look at that but 
Bed005.B.dialogueact697	1827.52	1829.81	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	at that but 
Bed005.B.dialogueact698	1831.84	1833.32	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i just thought i'd be surprised that 
Bed005.B.dialogueact699	1833.9	1837.97	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	that there's any important issues that 
Bed005.B.dialogueact700	1839.06	1840.58	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bed005.B.dialogueact701	1841.47	1847.35	B	Professor	s^ba^cs	-1	0	i mean if if you want to uh pushes into reference problems that would be great okay 
Bed005.F.dialogueact702	1847.59	1847.86	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bed005.B.dialogueact703	1848.18	1851.33	B	Professor	s	-1	0	okay so this is his specially is preference 
Bed005.C.dialogueact704	1850.27	1850.85	C	Grad	b	-1	0	is preference 
Bed005.B.dialogueact705	1851.93	1854.59	B	Professor	qh^e	-1	0	and you know what what are these things referring to not only 
Bed005.B.dialogueact706	1854.59	1856.37	B	Professor	s	-1	0	to not only an hour for a but uh 
Bed005.B.dialogueact707	1856.37	1863.22	B	Professor	s	-1	0	for a but uh more generally the this whole issue of uh referring expressions and 
Bed005.B.dialogueact708	1863.22	1867.45	B	Professor	qh	-1	0	and what is it that they're actually dealing with in the world 
Bed005.C.dialogueact709	1867.51	1868.08	C	Grad	b	-1	0	world and again this 
Bed005.B.dialogueact710	1868.16	1871.61	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and again this is like in the database this is also pretty well formed because there 
Bed005.B.dialogueact711	1871.61	1873.05	B	Professor	s	+1	0	formed because there is an apology 
Bed005.B.dialogueact712	1874.07	1875.96	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and the database and stuff so 
Bed005.B.dialogueact713	1875.96	1881.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and stuff so it isn't like um you know the evening star or stuff like that 
Bed005.F.dialogueact714	1880.9	1881.21	F	PhD	b	-1	0	or stuff like that 
Bed005.B.dialogueact715	1881.43	1881.97	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	that 
Bed005.B.dialogueact716	1882.2	1885.71	B	Professor	s	+1	0	all the entities do have concrete reference although 
Bed005.B.dialogueact718	1885.97	1889.13	B	Professor	s	+1	1	reference although the the to get out of the language may not be trivial there aren't 
Bed005.F.dialogueact717	1885.85	1886.21	F	PhD	b	-1	0	reference although the the 
Bed005.B.dialogueact720	1889.65	1896.71	B	Professor	s	-1	0	there aren't really deep mysteries abouts um what what things the system knows about i 
Bed005.F.dialogueact719	1889.3	1889.51	F	PhD	b	-1	0	there aren't 
Bed005.F.dialogueact721	1896.97	1897.16	F	PhD	b	-1	0	knows about i can have both problem

Bed005.C.dialogueact786	2048.96	2056.11	C	Grad	s	-1	0	something or maybe we should address one of these days is too did most of the work people actually always do is look at some statements and analyze 
Bed005.C.dialogueact787	2056.11	2057.77	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and analyze stuff 
Bed005.C.dialogueact788	2058.06	2060.61	C	Grad	s	-1	0	but its abstracts or newspapers something like this but

Bed005.E.dialogueact839	2160.92	2162.28	E	Grad	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	yes yeah eat yeah i guess so and then here 
Bed005.B.dialogueact840	2161.63	2161.96	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yes eat yeah i guess 
Bed005.E.dialogueact841	2162.28	2165.66	E	Grad	s	-1	0	so and then here you are it's uh the person is getting information and they may or

Bed005.E.dialogueact843	2171.21	2178.14	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	right i think that's one of the things that's interesting is is they're just course patterns probably don't follow follow quite as many logical 
Bed005.B.dialogueact844	2176.95	2178.69	B	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	right i think that's one of the things that's interesting is is as many logical 
Bed005.B.dialogueact846	2178.69	2185.9	B	Professor	s	+1	0	that's interesting is is in a sort of over arching story we we worked it out for the as you say this the storytelling scenario 
Bed005.E.dialogueact845	2178.49	2178.72	E	Grad	fh	-1	0	that's interesting is is 
Bed005.E.dialogueact847	2183.19	2183.47	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	for the as you 
Bed005.B.dialogueact849	2186.26	2189.92	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and i think it's really worth thinking through what it looks like what 
Bed005.E.dialogueact848	2186.16	2187.05	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	and i think it's really worth thinking through 
Bed005.B.dialogueact851	2189.92	2191.64	B	Professor	qh^e	+1	0	what it looks like what is the same spec mean et cetera right 
Bed005.E.dialogueact850	2189.48	2190.38	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	what it looks like what is the same spec mean 
Bed005.E.dialogueact852	2190.38	2190.85	E	Grad	%-	-1	0	is the same spec mean 
Bed005.E.dialogueact853	2191.9	2199.5	E	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	et cetera right because for a while we're thinking well how can we change the um dated to sort of illicit illicit um actions that are more like what we are used to but 
Bed005.E.dialogueact854	2199.88	2203.06	E	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	well i don't know i mean maybe maybe that's what we'll do used to but obviously we would rather you know try to figure out what 
Bed005.B.dialogueact855	2201.8	2202.51	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	well i don't know i mean maybe you know try to figure out what 
Bed005.B.dialogueact856	2202.51	2205.37	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i don't know i mean maybe maybe that's what we'll do is is we can do anything 
Bed005.B.dialogueact857	2205.72	2206.85	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we can do anything we want with it being 
Bed005.B.dialogueact859	2206.85	2211.39	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	we want with it being once d. have fulfilled these requirements

Bed005.B.dialogueact862	2212.5	2217.5	B	Professor	s^f|s	-1	0	okay and the one for next uh summers just half down and and the other half 
Bed005.B.dialogueact863	2217.5	2222.13	B	Professor	s	-1	0	down and and the other half is this um generation thing which we think is much different so once that

Bed005.B.dialogueact865	2222.47	2228.45	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so once that stuff and all the rest of it is uh sort of you know what we want the research 
Bed005.B.dialogueact866	2229.24	2234.47	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and we can do we can do all sorts of things that don't fit into their framework at all 
Bed005.B.dialogueact867	2235.81	2238.03	B	Professor	s	-1	0	there's no reason why we're we're constrained to do that if we can

Bed005.C.dialogueact874	2259.81	2264.44	C	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	oh i effect we need and free free tickets ten your perspective we need to do that they 
Bed005.C.dialogueact875	2264.99	2265.61	C	Grad	s^df.%--	-1	0	do that they cost

Bed005.C.dialogueact877	2266.99	2273.77	C	Grad	s	-1	0	assuming we have this and we we tend in that case that you do have these wonderful stories and historical anecdotes and 
Bed005.B.dialogueact878	2270.42	2270.66	B	Professor	b	-1	0	that you do have these 
Bed005.C.dialogueact879	2273.77	2276.08	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and nice jumping out of windows and and tons of 
Bed005.E.dialogueact880	2273.94	2274.36	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	and nice jumping 
Bed005.C.dialogueact881	2276.08	2277.39	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and and tons of stuff so 
Bed005.C.dialogueact882	2277.92	2279.47	C	Grad	s	-1	0	stuff so that the databases she which 
Bed005.C.dialogueact883	2280.12	2286.69	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and if we want to answer a question on that we actually have to go one step before that and understand that 
Bed005.C.dialogueact885	2287.7	2290.61	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	no do me doing sensitive information extraction and 
Bed005.E.dialogueact884	2287.21	2287.76	E	Grad	b	-1	0	no do 
Bed005.E.dialogueact886	2288.99	2289.22	E	Grad	b	-1	0	me doing sensitive information extraction

Bed005.C.dialogueact891	2292.26	2309.93	C	Grad	qh	-1	0	um this has been uh deep that researchers actually there was is is part of the on to do isn't something for the future is how can we sort of run our our taxes are content turing machine that will enable i say that too retrieve for answer questions what sensibly 
Bed005.F.dialogueact890	2291.94	2292.89	F	PhD	%-	-1	0	right yeah so um 
Bed005.F.dialogueact892	2292.89	2293.33	F	PhD	b	-1	0	um this has been uh 
Bed005.E.dialogueact893	2305.28	2305.88	E	Grad	b	-1	0	enable i say 
Bed005.E.dialogueact894	2308.37	2308.9	E	Grad	b	-1	0	answer questions 
Bed005.B.dialogueact895	2310.28	2310.48	B	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bed005.B.dialogueact896	2310.79	2311.02	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah it's right uh so uh 
Bed005.B.dialogueact897	2311.02	2311.13	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	it's right uh so uh 
Bed005.B.dialogueact898	2311.13	2311.75	B	Professor	qw^t3	-1	0	it's right uh so uh 
Bed005.F.dialogueact899	2311.22	2312.99	F	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	it's right uh so uh oh there's that much about that 
Bed005.F.dialogueact900	2312.99	2313.86	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	oh there's that much about that so 
Bed005.F.dialogueact901	2314.78	2322.36	F	PhD	qw.%-	+1	0	okay so yeah this what is it the basics of it as the teal um to get us to do uh uh but it's not a big so you become 
Bed005.B.dialogueact902	2319.84	2320.42	B	Professor	b	-1	0	but it's not a big so 
Bed005.B.dialogueact903	2321.83	2322.13	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay so yeah this you become 
Bed005.B.dialogueact904	2322.13	2322.98	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so yeah this 
Bed005.B.dialogueact905	2322.98	2324.48	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so yeah this is what happened is there's 
Bed005.B.dialogueact906	2324.98	2326.25	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	is there's this uh there was describing 
Bed005.B.dialogueact907	2326.33	2327.31	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	there was describing the 
Bed005.B.dialogueact908	2327.77	2329.7	B	Professor	s	+1	0	the there's two packages or say 
Bed005.B.dialogueact909	2329.7	2332.02	B	Professor	s	+1	0	packages or say uh hope parse or there's a particular piece 
Bed005.B.dialogueact910	2332.02	2334.74	B	Professor	s	+1	0	a particular piece of this big system 
Bed005.B.dialogueact911	2335.06	2340.37	B	Professor	s	+1	1	which in german uh takes these two sentence templates and produces x. m. l. structures 
Bed005.B.dialogueact913	2341.06	2345.29	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and one of our jobs was to make the english equivalent of that that 
Bed005.F.dialogueact912	2340.6	2340.89	F	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.B.dialogueact914	2345.79	2347.95	B	Professor	s	+1	4	that these guys did in a in a day 
Bed005.F.dialogueact915	2345.84	2346.38	F	PhD	b	-1	0	that these guys did 
Bed005.F.dialogueact916	2348.23	2348.51	F	PhD	b	-1	0	the other 
Bed005.B.dialogueact917	2348.79	2358.18	B	Professor	s	+1	0	the other thing is at the other end roughly at the same level there's something that takes uh x. m. l. structures produces an output x. m. l. structure which he is 
Bed005.B.dialogueact918	2358.18	2361.11	B	Professor	s	+1	0	which he is instructions for the generator okay 
Bed005.F.dialogueact919	2361.25	2361.54	F	PhD	b	-1	0	okay 
Bed005.B.dialogueact920	2361.98	2362.39	B	Professor	s^f	-1	0	okay and then there's the 
Bed005.B.dialogueact921	2362.56	2364.03	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and then there's the language generator and then after that as as 
Bed005.B.dialogueact922	2364.03	2374.78	B	Professor	s	+1	0	and then after that as as synthesizer that goes from an x. m. l. structure too uh language generation to actual specifications for synthesizer 
Bed005.B.dialogueact923	2374.78	2382.26	B	Professor	s	+1	1	again there's one module in which there's one piece that we have to convert english right 
Bed005.F.dialogueact924	2374.98	2375.56	F	PhD	b	-1	0	again there's one module 
Bed005.F.dialogueact925	2382.23	2382.51	F	PhD	b	-1	0	right 
Bed005.F.dialogueact926	2382.67	2382.9	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	right 
Bed005.B.dialogueact927	2383.42	2383.69	B	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.B.dialogueact928	2385.32	2385.46	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay it is 
Bed005.B.dialogueact929	2385.46	2391.85	B	Professor	s	-1	0	okay it is it this is oh well was viewed as a kind of um a minor thing 
Bed005.B.dialogueact930	2392.19	2393.56	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	necessary but but not right 
Bed005.F.dialogueact931	2393.87	2394.1	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	not okay right 
Bed005.B.dialogueact932	2394.38	2394.69	B	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	okay 
Bed005.F.dialogueact933	2394.44	2394.71	F	PhD	b	-1	0	okay 
Bed005.B.dialogueact934	2395.16	2405.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and much more interesting is the fact that they started doing as we we are you know inheriting this system and does all of these other things that's great 
Bed005.F.dialogueact935	2395.25	2395.73	F	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	and that's great 
Bed005.F.dialogueact936	2404.41	2404.74	F	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.B.dialogueact937	2406.16	2407.84	B	Professor	s	-1	0	not precisely what we want and that's 
Bed005.B.dialogueact938	2407.84	2412.65	B	Professor	s	-1	0	what we want and that's that's where it it gets difficult and i 
Bed005.B.dialogueact939	2412.65	2416.86	B	Professor	s	-1	0	difficult and i i don't pretend to understand you know what i think we really ought to do 
Bed005.C.dialogueact940	2421.27	2421.61	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay 
Bed005.C.dialogueact941	2422.85	2424.08	C	Grad	fg|s^rt^t^tc	-1	0	so if you know about that but uh 
Bed005.C.dialogueact942	2424.45	2425.87	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	but uh um 
Bed005.C.dialogueact943	2426.93	2427.07	C	Grad	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.C.dialogueact944	2428.05	2432.35	C	Grad	s^cc^rt	-1	0	the sort of and i would take up that responsibility 
Bed005.C.dialogueact945	2433.1	2436.05	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and uh um get a first draft of that no we 
Bed005.C.dialogueact946	2436.65	2441.53	C	Grad	s^t	-1	0	no we have of um just i think two more for things 
Bed005.B.dialogueact947	2441.96	2442.15	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	things 
Bed005.C.dialogueact948	2443.26	2450.9	C	Grad	fh|qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	you guys that have started fighting uh on the base that noisy or front 
Bed005.D.dialogueact949	2449.28	2449.91	D	Grad	b.%	-1	0	or 
Bed005.D.dialogueact950	2451.52	2454.44	D	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah i thought i should um talk a little like that because it might be 
Bed005.D.dialogueact951	2454.44	2461.87	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	okay like that because it might be a good uh right that's true to have in general for uh problems that you know month though but you know 
Bed005.B.dialogueact952	2458.59	2459.41	B	Professor	s^ba|s^bk	-1	0	okay general for uh problems that 
Bed005.B.dialogueact953	2461.77	2461.91	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	but you know 
Bed005.B.dialogueact954	2462.21	2462.86	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	and what's the other one so 
Bed005.B.dialogueact955	2462.86	2464.41	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	and what's the other one so they're just you know with the agendas and the 
Bed005.C.dialogueact956	2464.37	2465.54	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and the paper i think 
Bed005.C.dialogueact957	2465.62	2466.51	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	oh yeah i've got a couple paper i think maybe 
Bed005.B.dialogueact958	2466.2	2466.53	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	oh yeah i've got a couple maybe 
Bed005.B.dialogueact959	2466.53	2468.55	B	Professor	s	-1	0	oh yeah i've got a couple new new papers as well so i i've maybe 
Bed005.B.dialogueact960	2468.55	2470.26	B	Professor	s	-1	0	as well so i i've been in contact with move so probably 
Bed005.B.dialogueact961	2470.26	2477.06	B	Professor	s	-1	0	move so probably let's put the doctor like i do i understand better uh what do you do was a little embarrassing 
Bed005.B.dialogueact962	2477.06	2478.12	B	Professor	s	-1	0	was a little embarrassing because all this was in his thesis 
Bed005.B.dialogueact963	2478.12	2479.31	B	Professor	s	-1	0	because all this was in his thesis and i was honor's thesis 
Bed005.B.dialogueact964	2479.31	2480.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and i was honor's thesis committee 
Bed005.B.dialogueact965	2481.16	2484.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so i even really knew this one time but i 
Bed005.F.dialogueact966	2482.65	2482.79	F	PhD	b	-1	0	i 
Bed005.B.dialogueact967	2484.87	2489.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	one time but i i i i if part of what i haven't figured out yet is is how all this goes together so they 
Bed005.B.dialogueact968	2489.74	2492.29	B	Professor	s^cc	-1	0	together so they got some more stuff from the time 
Bed005.B.dialogueact969	2493.12	2495.26	B	Professor	qh^cs.%-	-1	0	and so when we just do thee uh 
Bed005.D.dialogueact970	2495.87	2496.19	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	uh so 
Bed005.D.dialogueact971	2497.02	2497.43	D	Grad	fg	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.D.dialogueact972	2498.23	2500.02	D	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	i is there like where they can use 
Bed005.B.dialogueact973	2501.12	2502.1	B	Professor	s^aa|s.%-	-1	0	yeah i you could uh partially issues 
Bed005.D.dialogueact974	2501.13	2501.53	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	yeah i you could uh 
Bed005.E.dialogueact975	2501.7	2501.86	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah i you could uh 
Bed005.B.dialogueact977	2502.41	2502.81	B	Professor	s.%	-1	0	partially issues 
Bed005.D.dialogueact976	2502.36	2503.36	D	Grad	qrr	-1	0	probably just partially issues this 
Bed005.B.dialogueact978	2503.45	2504.4	B	Professor	s^am	-1	0	probably just as easy i this 
Bed005.B.dialogueact979	2504.4	2504.62	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	as easy i 
Bed005.F.dialogueact980	2504.41	2504.65	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	as easy i 
Bed005.D.dialogueact981	2504.95	2505.31	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	you can put the microphone as easy i 
Bed005.A.dialogueact982	2505.55	2506.82	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	you can put the microphone in your pocket

Bed005.A.dialogueact984	2511.96	2513.25	A	Grad	s	-1	0	i was in being you in your pocket because i don't have one 
Bed005.A.dialogueact985	2513.25	2514.03	A	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because i don't have one 
Bed005.E.dialogueact986	2515.09	2516.03	E	Grad	s|qy^d^g	-1	0	that's why they invented pocket peace 
Bed005.B.dialogueact987	2515.82	2517.32	B	Professor	s	-1	0	exactly that's why they invented pocket peace 
Bed005.A.dialogueact989	2517.69	2518.22	A	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	exactly

Bed005.D.dialogueact992	2519.78	2527.73	D	Grad	fg|s^tc	+1	0	so um call that uh we want to have this kind of structure in our business 
Bed005.D.dialogueact993	2528.47	2532.43	D	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	namely that um you have you know it's that several times right so 
Bed005.D.dialogueact994	2532.81	2533.26	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	right so the 
Bed005.D.dialogueact995	2533.96	2535.21	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	the i mean the sort of 
Bed005.D.dialogueact996	2536.73	2540.52	D	Grad	s^rt	+1	1	the typical example is that um these are all a bunch of q.'s for something and this 
Bed005.D.dialogueact997	2540.72	2542.74	D	Grad	s	+1	1	for something and this is in the fact that like to conclude 
Bed005.D.dialogueact998	2543.34	2543.7	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	so i 
Bed005.D.dialogueact999	2544.18	2547.96	D	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	like let's just look at the kids were in um this is actually be find lacks prejudices

Bed005.D.dialogueact1021	2565.76	2566.17	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	so i mean 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1022	2566.78	2569.44	D	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	so i mean we like to take all these various cues right so this one might like i only 
Bed005.F.dialogueact1023	2568.64	2569.21	F	PhD	s^e^t3	-1	0	take all these various cues right so this one might like i only 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1024	2569.44	2570.7	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	right so this one might be say uh new terminology 
Bed005.E.dialogueact1026	2570.64	2571.54	E	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	be say uh but like new terminology 
Bed005.F.dialogueact1025	2570.27	2570.49	F	PhD	b	-1	0	be say uh new terminology 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1028	2571.89	2572.2	C	Grad	b.%	-1	0	but like i don't i haven't heard that before 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1027	2571.87	2573.2	D	Grad	s	-1	0	but like i don't want to tell you i haven't heard that before 
Bed005.E.dialogueact1029	2572.36	2573.35	E	Grad	s^t3	-1	0	i don't want to tell you i haven't heard that before 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1030	2573.2	2573.55	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	want to tell you 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1031	2573.55	2574.33	D	Grad	s^no	-1	0	want to tell you i don't to be like 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1032	2574.33	2576.62	D	Grad	s^df^rt	-1	0	i don't to be like this isn't the way that he is but they 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1033	2576.62	2581.3	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	that he is but they see that's what someone mentioned uh admission fees 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1034	2583.48	2584.21	D	Grad	s^ba^bd	-1	0	yeah it takes too long right to see a mark 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1035	2584.21	2585.36	D	Grad	s:s	-1	0	long right to see a mark if 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1036	2585.87	2593.29	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	if the things that i'm mark you know um that was another thing that says it's um 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1037	2594.56	2596.46	D	Grad	s^rt.%--	-1	0	it's always or not at the moment 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1038	2597.59	2598.39	D	Grad	s^bk|s	-1	0	i you know it's right 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1039	2598.9	2599.15	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	know it's right and b. uh problem 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1040	2599.15	2603.48	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and b. uh problem that we're having was that you know given and know what this to the n. 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1041	2604.18	2610.06	D	Grad	s	+1	0	given and know it's and for the thought of the see things here we need to specify see times uh to the in probably these that 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1042	2610.6	2610.82	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	that 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1043	2611.31	2613.33	D	Grad	s	-1	0	that's just giving these all body which they may not be for example they could 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1044	2613.33	2614.77	D	Grad	s	-1	0	be for example they could be time of david's keys 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1045	2614.77	2619.16	D	Grad	s	-1	0	be time of david's keys you could uh say you know morning afternoon evening night so it this could be 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1046	2619.16	2620.31	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so it this could be more so it's 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1047	2620.9	2621.63	D	Grad	s	-1	0	more so it's a lot 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1048	2622.41	2624.89	D	Grad	s	+1	2	and it's hard probably spent here which is kind of a pain 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1049	2625.51	2630.35	D	Grad	fh|s	+1	3	so noisy always way to uh sort of vila this 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1050	2631.04	2632.06	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.D.dialogueact1051	2632.9	2633.74	D	Grad	qw^t1	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.D.dialogueact1052	2634.39	2647.48	D	Grad	s:s	-1	0	so the idea is that uh let's call these uh want to see two c. three and c. four and eat for cause and effect 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1053	2652.87	2654.71	D	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah yes have these into you know it's 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1054	2658.57	2658.73	D	Grad	s^f	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.D.dialogueact1055	2661.27	2666.26	D	Grad	s	-1	0	well actually the idea first all is that each of these things has uh quote unquote distinguish state which means that this 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1056	2666.26	2669.42	D	Grad	s	-1	0	which means that this is this even if you don't really know anything but it's right 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1057	2669.42	2669.58	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	but it's right 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1058	2669.58	2669.81	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	but it's right 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1059	2670.24	2678.88	D	Grad	s	+1	0	so for example if we were you know if the thing is a lot of money or not or if that just doesn't seem relevant then that would be so distinct the distinguished disinterested 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1060	2678.88	2682.92	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	the distinguished disinterested entity you know if there's something for the person talking about did mission see 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1061	2683.37	2685.55	D	Grad	s	-1	0	you know if they didn't talk what that would be the distinguished it 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1063	2686.42	2689.03	C	Grad	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	so this is offensive for we have stinky fault so yeah 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1062	2686.3	2686.78	D	Grad	%-	-1	0	so so 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1064	2689.36	2690.0	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah that's what they do and 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1065	2689.98	2690.26	C	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	yeah that's what they do and 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1066	2690.14	2691.86	D	Grad	s	-1	0	that's what they do and they use in that paper 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1067	2691.11	2691.42	C	Grad	b	-1	0	they use in that paper 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1068	2692.51	2695.27	D	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	so the idea is that um you have these untreated no it's right you one 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1069	2695.27	2697.66	D	Grad	s^rt:s^rt	-1	0	so this right you one you too eat three eighty before 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1070	2697.88	2699.91	B	Professor	s^bu	+1	0	so this is the heck run paper you're working with good eighty before 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1072	2699.91	2700.12	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	you're working with good 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1071	2699.51	2699.75	D	Grad	s^aa	+1	0	you're working with good 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1073	2701.05	2710.13	D	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	+1	0	so it is in each of these t. i. is resents walked this would be if all the other ones when distinguished it right so for example 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1074	2710.57	2714.12	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so for example that was a person i mean what the thing that they talk or the non market but none of the other 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1075	2714.44	2716.49	D	Grad	s^e	-1	0	but none of the other confusion usually apply 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1076	2717.9	2719.36	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	then this would be 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1077	2720.52	2724.39	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	be this is just represent probably should be should have this assuming 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1078	2724.92	2727.75	D	Grad	s	-1	0	this assuming that the skew was turned on and the other one just didn't apply 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1079	2728.55	2733.32	D	Grad	s	+1	0	so you know design mark and not not isn't really profitable then this would represent probably shouldn't maybe this case 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1080	2733.32	2743.27	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	maybe this case maybe we just maybe decide that if the things that i'm marking we don't know anything else i'm going to include that um they want of you would probably be you know point uh for they want entered 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1081	2743.47	2748.9	D	Grad	s	-1	0	they want entered would probably the uh would probably point five and 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1082	2748.96	2750.97	D	Grad	s	-1	0	five and they want to approach it probably point one day 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1083	2751.69	2751.93	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right so they 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1084	2751.93	2753.96	D	Grad	s	+1	1	right so they up with these little tables each of those 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1085	2755.1	2755.38	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	okay 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1086	2756.25	2760.88	D	Grad	s^df	+1	1	and the final thing is that um this is a domestic function of these 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1087	2761.57	2763.2	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so we were incessantly probably these we 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1088	2764.02	2766.65	D	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	just have to um see what function this is right 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1089	2767.16	2774.16	D	Grad	s:s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	so we can let this be um gee if you want come eat too e. t. before and our 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1090	2774.73	2778.39	D	Grad	s^rt:s	-1	0	and our example g. would be um uh majority vote 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1091	2780.22	2780.57	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1092	2782.11	2789.72	B	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	well okay so the so the important point he is not what the g. function is 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1093	2790.21	2799.32	B	Professor	s	+1	0	the important point is that um there's it's a general kind of idea of short cutting the full c. p. t. flow conditional 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1094	2799.32	2802.35	B	Professor	s^e	+1	1	flow conditional probability table with some function 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1095	2803.17	2803.51	B	Professor	s^f	-1	0	okay which 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1096	2803.59	2807.09	B	Professor	s	-1	0	okay which would you choose appropriately for each case so depending on 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1097	2807.09	2812.46	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so depending on what your situation is their different functions which are most appropriate and 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1098	2813.05	2814.23	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	so i gave 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1099	2814.67	2819.15	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so i gave buster copy of this sort of ninety two paper it and 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1101	2819.47	2820.84	B	Professor	s^bu	-1	0	it and you got one robert i don't 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1100	2819.33	2819.79	D	Grad	b.%	-1	0	it and 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1102	2820.84	2822.01	B	Professor	s^no	-1	0	you got one robert i don't know who else has seen it there's i mean 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1103	2822.24	2822.95	D	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	there's i mean 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1104	2823.32	2823.59	D	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah it's 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1105	2823.71	2825.77	D	Grad	s	-1	0	sure yeah it's i come in and breeze 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1106	2824.44	2825.01	B	Professor	s^ba	-1	0	sure i come in and breeze 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1107	2826.11	2826.57	B	Professor	s^m^na	-1	0	it chart 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1108	2826.73	2826.97	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	it chart 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1109	2827.31	2830.47	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	so um you you read it how you 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1110	2830.84	2832.47	D	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	read it okay so you should take a look how you can you stick with it 
Bed005.A.dialogueact1112	2832.36	2832.59	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	okay so you should take a look 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1111	2832.12	2833.09	B	Professor	s^bk|s^cs	-1	0	okay so you should take a look and up you but at some 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1113	2833.09	2834.82	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and up you but at some point in life i yeah i think 
Bed005.E.dialogueact1114	2834.17	2834.34	E	Grad	%--	-1	0	point in life i yeah i think 
Bed005.E.dialogueact1115	2834.34	2834.55	E	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	point in life i yeah i think 
Bed005.E.dialogueact1116	2834.55	2835.37	E	Grad	s^na|s^aa	-1	0	point in life okay i yeah i think 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1117	2835.87	2836.21	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay and 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1118	2836.79	2839.1	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	and so you other guys can decide how interested isn't okay 
Bed005.E.dialogueact1119	2836.83	2837.08	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	and so you other guys 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1120	2839.3	2841.11	B	Professor	fg|s^ba	-1	0	isn't that isn't real hard and okay 
Bed005.F.dialogueact1121	2839.44	2840.09	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	isn't that isn't real hard okay 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1122	2841.38	2844.39	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	and uh one of the questions 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1123	2844.6	2849.06	B	Professor	qw	-1	0	one of the questions is my prosper is how much of this this job the base support yeah 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1124	2849.76	2850.73	D	Grad	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	yeah it's a good question um 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1125	2850.73	2856.02	D	Grad	h|s	+1	0	it's a good question um out so we wanted basically java support that you mystic uh functions and 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1126	2856.21	2856.43	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	and 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1127	2856.63	2865.06	D	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right so the little handout and um in a sense it said we can make it supported by um nine or the uh answering you know probably that one and it was right 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1128	2865.2	2867.69	B	Professor	s^aa|s.%--	-1	0	right so the little handout that little thing that i sent i sent a message 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1129	2867.69	2871.73	B	Professor	s.%--:s	-1	0	that i sent i sent a message saying uh here's a way to take 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1130	2872.1	2879.38	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	one thing you could do which is kind of in a way stupid is take this determining stick function and use it to build the c. p. t. 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1131	2880.41	2882.14	B	Professor	s	+1	1	so it but holidays won't do it for you that 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1132	2881.51	2881.8	C	Grad	b.%	-1	0	won't do it for you 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1133	2882.96	2886.54	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	that you can convert all that into what the c. p. t. would be 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1134	2887.34	2896.16	B	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh and what i sent out about a week ago with an idea of how to do that for um evidence combination so one of one function 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1135	2896.16	2901.18	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so one of one function that you could use is your g. function isn't as evidence combined you just take 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1136	2901.18	2913.18	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	you just take the uh if each of the if each of the ones has his own little table like that then you could take the uh strength of each of those times it's little paper when you'd add up the total 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1137	2913.18	2917.2	B	Professor	s^cs^e	-1	0	when you'd add up the total evidence for thee and hey i don't 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1138	2914.71	2915.08	D	Grad	b	-1	0	evidence for thee 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1139	2917.48	2918.7	D	Grad	s^nd	-1	0	i don't think you do this because 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1141	2918.7	2926.51	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	think you do this because jesus function from that that 
Bed005.E.dialogueact1140	2918.47	2919.26	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	think you do this because jesus function 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1142	2919.43	2919.62	B	Professor	b	-1	0	jesus function 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1143	2927.11	2927.39	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.D.dialogueact1144	2928.14	2928.32	D	Grad	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	right so there's no 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1145	2928.45	2929.65	D	Grad	s	-1	0	right so there's no numbers there's just 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1146	2929.65	2934.38	D	Grad	s	-1	0	no no i'm saying is numbers there's just quickly but this well and if it's if uh you 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1147	2933.14	2933.69	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	if it's if uh you 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1148	2934.12	2937.93	B	Professor	s^ar|s.%--	-1	0	no no i'm saying is there there is a even 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1149	2937.93	2944.99	B	Professor	s	-1	0	there is a even if if if if you decide what what is appropriate is probably the government's combination you can write a function that doesn't 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1150	2944.99	2947.09	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	that doesn't was actually one of the examples he's got in there

Bed005.B.dialogueact1152	2952.36	2961.44	B	Professor	qy	-1	0	it's it's clear that you might like to be able to shortcuts the whole conditional probability type 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1153	2962.82	2970.24	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i mean it's some seems very puzzling in some sense where we will be like you to not be hopes so of some of this stuff because we 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1154	2970.83	2972.89	C	Grad	s^df	-1	0	because we don't have the access to the information

Bed005.B.dialogueact1156	2973.5	2973.76	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	right that's one 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1157	2973.76	2976.37	B	Professor	qh	-1	0	right that's one of the problems is is because we're the wherewithal come from is 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1158	2974.89	2975.1	C	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	of the problems is is because we're the wherewithal come 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1159	2976.53	2976.88	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	from is 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1160	2976.74	2977.13	D	Grad	%--	-1	0	from is all right would not 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1162	2977.13	2977.53	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	all right would not 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1163	2977.53	2979.22	D	Grad	s^m.%--	-1	0	all right would not be able to observe 
Bed005.E.dialogueact1161	2977.04	2977.29	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	all right would not 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1164	2980.24	2980.46	D	Grad	qw^br	-1	0	what 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1165	2980.99	2986.54	C	Grad	s	-1	0	if it's uh it disco discourse initiative phrase we would have nothing in the discourse astray what 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1166	2988.27	2991.37	C	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	so if if we ever want to wonder what the french well it seemed to be not be able to obsessive know 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1167	2989.2	2989.56	D	Grad	b.%	-1	0	we ever want to wonder 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1168	2990.08	2992.18	D	Grad	s^bk|qy^bu^d	-1	0	what the french well it seemed to be not be able to obsessive know that's find that 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1169	2992.18	2992.62	D	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	that's find that 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1170	2992.62	2994.2	D	Grad	s^df	-1	0	yeah so this things that's find that is isn't i thought thing 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1171	2993.27	2995.31	B	Professor	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah so this things for this they is isn't i thought thing 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1172	2995.67	3004.04	B	Professor	s	+1	0	for this they they did basements in general are quite good at saying if you have no current information about this variable just take the prior for that 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1173	3004.98	3006.37	B	Professor	s^f|s	-1	0	so that that's what the real good at so if you don't 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1174	3006.64	3013.91	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	at so if you don't have any information but the discourse you just use your priors of of whatever the discourse 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1175	3014.42	3014.75	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1176	3014.75	3019.02	B	Professor	s	-1	0	especially whatever it's probably stick leave whatever would be and it's just it's not a great 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1177	3019.02	3020.66	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and it's just it's not a great estimate but 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1178	3019.16	3019.43	C	Grad	b.%	-1	0	and it's just it's not a great 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1179	3020.66	3022.27	B	Professor	s	-1	0	estimate but it's the best when you have 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1180	3023.14	3023.94	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	and summer so 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1181	3023.94	3024.68	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and summer so that they're good at the other 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1182	3024.68	3027.5	B	Professor	qh	-1	0	that they're good at the other problem is how do you feel in all these numbers and 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1183	3027.99	3029.26	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and i think that's what he was getting at yeah so specifically in 
Bed005.E.dialogueact1184	3028.02	3028.44	E	Grad	b.%	-1	0	i think that's what he was getting yeah 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1185	3028.73	3028.83	D	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	i think that's what he was getting yeah 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1187	3029.16	3032.33	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	at so specifically in this case you have to have this many numbers whereas in this case is 
Bed005.E.dialogueact1186	3028.89	3029.06	E	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	i think that's what he was getting at yeah so specifically in 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1188	3032.33	3035.55	D	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	whereas in this case is that that piece of this ceases says fifty for this right you 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1190	3036.2	3036.95	C	Grad	b.%	-1	0	have to have just 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1189	3035.94	3037.47	D	Grad	s^rt	-1	0	this right you have to have just three and 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1191	3038.6	3039.86	D	Grad	s	-1	0	so this is much more than that 
Bed005.A.dialogueact1192	3041.98	3042.72	A	Grad	s^2	-1	0	aesthetically

Bed005.B.dialogueact1203	3053.5	3054.16	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	basements so 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1204	3054.16	3054.45	B	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	so 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1205	3054.45	3058.07	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	so no you a funny way of referring to speak lies 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1206	3058.07	3061.76	B	Professor	s^df:s	-1	0	lies is only one instance yeah this 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1207	3061.85	3063.31	D	Grad	fg|s:s	-1	0	that would actually isn't that always yeah this isn't a noisy or anymore 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1208	3062.92	3064.32	B	Professor	s^na:s	-1	0	yeah that would actually isn't that always you are supposed to think of isn't a noisy or anymore 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1209	3064.32	3066.5	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	yeah you are supposed to think of of a way to it the 
Bed005.A.dialogueact1210	3065.16	3065.5	A	Grad	b	-1	0	of a way 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1211	3067.03	3069.1	D	Grad	s:s	-1	0	yeah whatever yeah so noise yard my paranoid 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1212	3068.87	3069.44	B	Professor	s^aa|s^bd	-1	0	yeah whatever yeah so paranoid 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1213	3069.44	3069.64	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	whatever yeah so 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1214	3069.94	3072.03	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but my whatever yeah so um 
Bed005.A.dialogueact1215	3072.72	3074.73	A	Grad	s^df.%--	-1	0	but my my was more the we just uh 
Bed005.A.dialogueact1216	3074.88	3078.41	A	Grad	s	-1	0	uh than all that right that things can many of a function that combines them in 
Bed005.A.dialogueact1217	3078.41	3078.88	A	Grad	%-	-1	0	them in 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1218	3079.15	3080.33	B	Professor	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	yeah it it it escalated so it's also 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1219	3080.33	3089.1	B	Professor	s	-1	0	right so it's also more or less like although uh it isn't necessarily some it's you know some of weights or anything like that i mean you could 
Bed005.A.dialogueact1220	3088.81	3089.09	A	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right or anything like that i mean you could 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1221	3089.56	3090.4	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	i mean you could have i 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1222	3090.94	3096.91	B	Professor	s:s	+1	0	have i like the function really is one that's essentially says uh take the max 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1223	3097.69	3098.12	D	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	well the or

Bed005.B.dialogueact1230	3107.51	3113.11	B	Professor	s.%--	+1	0	and i i think that's the standard way people get around thee 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1231	3113.69	3114.6	B	Professor	s	-1	0	once their ways of 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1232	3114.6	3118.58	B	Professor	s	+1	0	once their ways of breaking this up and just to to sub that's and stuff like that but 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1233	3118.64	3120.17	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	like that but um

Bed005.B.dialogueact1235	3124.03	3127.76	B	Professor	s^ba	+1	1	think we definitely think is a great idea that to to pursue that

Bed005.C.dialogueact1239	3133.38	3138.38	C	Grad	s	-1	0	they i mean you you can always she usually that that i'm not grasping everything correctly but but 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1240	3138.38	3151.48	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	but but seems attractive to me i'm men and the last discussion we had worse that we find out i mean stuff it's getting these part four part five point one oh see four 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1241	3152.57	3157.77	C	Grad	s	-1	0	not because you know it's in denmark or not but we we we david this whatever object type

Bed005.C.dialogueact1243	3162.68	3165.61	C	Grad	s:s	-1	0	point too if it's a cost it's played age point one point one if it's 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1244	3165.61	3170.74	C	Grad	s^rt:s	-1	0	point one if it's uh uh town hall it's point two point three point five

Bed005.D.dialogueact1251	3178.04	3179.08	D	Grad	qw	-1	0	well in the well it'd be stored the question 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1252	3179.08	3179.61	D	Grad	s	-1	0	well in the the question 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1253	3179.69	3181.52	C	Grad	s	-1	0	oh well in the beginning we write up if that's high we know we have the question 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1255	3181.71	3181.95	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	oh that's high we know we have 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1254	3181.52	3183.0	C	Grad	s	-1	0	oh yeah yeah so that's high we know we have twenty object types everybody we write it down and it's 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1256	3182.59	3182.79	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah twenty object types everybody 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1257	3183.0	3184.68	C	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah so well they we write it down and it's at five 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1258	3183.54	3183.75	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah so we write it down and it's 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1259	3183.75	3184.26	B	Professor	fg|%--	-1	0	yeah so well they we write it down and it's at five 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1260	3184.82	3185.43	B	Professor	s	-1	0	well they said that because there's it's at five 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1261	3185.43	3187.97	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	said that because there's it's a pretty point about this got to get in right now 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1263	3188.29	3195.2	B	Professor	s	+1	0	which is the hierarchy that comes with the on pathology is just what you want for this so that 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1262	3187.91	3188.34	D	Grad	b	-1	0	to get in right now which is 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1264	3195.29	3204.71	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so that uh if you know about it let's say particular town hall that it's one that is a monument then that would be stored there 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1265	3205.19	3207.48	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	if you don't you look up to higher key 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1266	3208.26	3214.81	B	Professor	s:s	+1	1	so you you you may or that they did have this little factor of uh you know approach about or even of what's 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1267	3214.81	3218.71	B	Professor	s:s	+1	0	or even of what's okay so we have to even factor for for various kinds of landmarks if 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1268	3219.01	3221.19	B	Professor	s	+1	1	you know first i said decline market put their if you 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1269	3221.74	3225.6	B	Professor	s	+1	1	their if you don't you just got to hierarchy too the first place you find one 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1270	3225.85	3226.11	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	you find one so did 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1271	3226.62	3228.09	D	Grad	qy^rt	-1	0	absolutely so did absurdity on television 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1272	3228.12	3228.61	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	absolutely

Bed005.B.dialogueact1275	3231.07	3231.2	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	but in any case 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1276	3231.2	3234.7	B	Professor	s	+1	0	but in any case view it logically as being in the on apology it's part 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1277	3234.7	3240.04	B	Professor	s:s	+1	1	on apology it's part of what you know about hey an object is it's even factor 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1278	3240.72	3241.11	D	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	and if you if 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1280	3241.44	3244.16	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and if you if if you know about a specific topic you put there this is part of it that 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1279	3241.43	3242.6	D	Grad	b	-1	0	and if you if if you know about a specific 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1281	3244.27	3245.69	B	Professor	s	-1	0	this is part of it that i was doing 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1282	3246.33	3250.23	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so we get to whoa that we'll see what he says about that and 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1283	3247.75	3248.05	D	Grad	b	-1	0	that we'll see 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1284	3250.61	3253.29	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that and then if you if it isn't there it's tired if you don't do anything 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1285	3253.29	3259.18	B	Professor	s	-1	0	tired if you don't do anything except it's it's it's it's a building that up at the highest thing you have to put what about to prior you don't know 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1286	3259.18	3266.02	B	Professor	s	-1	0	you don't know anything else about a building uh you just take whatever youre crude approximation is up to that level which might be equal 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1287	3264.1	3264.57	D	Grad	b	-1	0	crude approximation 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1288	3266.02	3268.11	B	Professor	s	-1	0	which might be equal or whatever it is so

Bed005.B.dialogueact1290	3269.03	3274.86	B	Professor	s	+1	0	that's a very pretty relationship between these locals actors and the apology 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1291	3275.24	3280.0	B	Professor	s	-1	0	it seems to be the obvious thing to do in the last we find a reason to do something different 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1292	3281.78	3282.04	D	Grad	b	-1	0	just make sense so 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1293	3282.53	3283.44	B	Professor	qy^rt	-1	0	just make sense to you so yeah 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1294	3282.7	3282.94	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	just make sense so

Bed005.D.dialogueact1297	3284.9	3286.47	D	Grad	s^bu	-1	0	so we have but we want to do got does she have to get whoever's 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1298	3286.47	3288.44	D	Grad	s^bu.%-	-1	0	indicate got does she have to get whoever's doing the uh other key to get 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1299	3288.71	3289.03	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	indicate so that's another thing we're going key to get into 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1301	3289.03	3292.85	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	so that's another thing we're going to need to do is is too either into 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1300	3288.73	3289.72	D	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	indicate so that's another thing we're going key to get into 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1302	3293.59	3298.94	B	Professor	s	+1	0	or need some way to you know get pay guinea neon apology or hatfields or 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1303	3298.94	3302.03	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	or some way too or @reject@ it may be 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1304	3302.16	3306.91	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	it may be that's all we can do is um some of our own hash tables it 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1305	3307.87	3309.87	B	Professor	s	-1	0	did but you know there's always a way to do that 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1306	3309.87	3310.71	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	way to do that just a question of 
Bed005.A.dialogueact1308	3311.4	3315.39	A	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	i have some object name too you know uh the probabilities or whatever right and 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1307	3311.23	3311.29	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	i have some object 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1309	3312.79	3312.87	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	name too 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1310	3313.42	3313.76	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	you know uh 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1311	3315.19	3315.27	B	Professor	%-	-1	0	or whatever right and 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1312	3315.46	3315.71	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	or whatever right and 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1313	3315.93	3316.63	B	Professor	fg	-1	0	or whatever right and so 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1314	3316.84	3316.9	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	so 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1315	3317.5	3317.96	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	but it's 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1316	3317.65	3320.23	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	but it's uh most actually especially a rough 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1317	3321.12	3325.64	C	Grad	s	-1	0	forget the mechanism that would be sort of the wonderful apart and then 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1318	3325.64	3328.89	C	Grad	s	-1	0	apart and then how to make it work is is the second part in 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1319	3328.89	3339.02	C	Grad	s	-1	0	the second part in the sense that i mean the guy was doing on prodigy is appointed rice that it was taken another through two to three days because they're having really 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1320	3339.02	3342.45	C	Grad	s	-1	0	because they're having really trouble getting the upper level 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1321	3342.45	3342.62	C	Grad	%--	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.C.dialogueact1322	3343.22	3343.73	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	right now 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1323	3344.4	3358.77	C	Grad	s	+1	1	the reason is given the crowd but uh the the the projects that all carry their own tax on the me and on all history they're really trying to build one talking about prodigies that covers all the e. mail projects and that's 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1324	3358.77	3360.7	C	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	projects and that's uh sort of a tough cookie that have a 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1325	3360.7	3362.83	C	Grad	s	-1	0	a tough cookie that have a tougher than they figured i could 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1326	3362.83	3364.5	C	Grad	s	-1	0	right figured i could if i told him so it's 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1327	3364.49	3364.75	B	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right so it's 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1329	3364.98	3365.26	B	Professor	b	-1	0	right so it's but nevertheless 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1328	3364.67	3364.85	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	right so it's 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1330	3365.48	3369.58	C	Grad	s	+1	0	but nevertheless it's going to be there by and by the uh next monday and i would show 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1331	3369.58	3374.71	C	Grad	s	-1	0	monday and i would show you what's what some examples from that for powers and stuff 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1332	3375.51	3376.39	C	Grad	fh	-1	0	and um 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1333	3378.03	3387.88	C	Grad	s	+1	0	i don't think is ever going to be indian prodigy is sort of you know the like you heard of people entering all of sudden looking at on hudson approaching turnouts 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1334	3388.23	3390.68	C	Grad	s^df	+1	0	especially since we're dealing with their case space in an instant 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1335	3390.68	3392.3	C	Grad	s^df^e	+1	0	space in an instant basement reggie so they would 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1336	3392.69	3398.94	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so they would be nothing on on that town hall or on the parts of town hall or on the i'd worked when i was 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1337	3398.94	3400.82	C	Grad	s	-1	0	i'd worked when i was just be information on tunnel is 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1338	3401.32	3404.12	B	Professor	qh^df	-1	0	well they they how what are they going to do with instances when you you but what well that's 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1339	3401.4	3401.78	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	well they but what 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1340	3404.36	3405.2	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	when you you well that's 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1341	3404.39	3405.22	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	when you you well that's 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1342	3404.8	3405.22	C	Grad	b	-1	0	when you you well that's 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1343	3406.48	3408.32	C	Grad	s	-1	0	that's that's a different question i mean the depressed 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1344	3408.32	3412.97	C	Grad	qh^rt	-1	0	i mean the depressed they had to make a decide question do we take apologies that have instances or 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1345	3412.97	3415.93	C	Grad	qh^e	-1	0	have instances or just one that does not that just the types 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1346	3416.15	3416.41	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay and 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1347	3417.0	3422.83	C	Grad	s	+1	0	so it's just the decision wasn't types on that subject type based we know after we adopted instances 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1348	3423.37	3424.47	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	and this 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1350	3425.67	3427.73	B	Professor	qw^df	-1	0	but but what this mark i'm going to do about that 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1349	3425.43	3425.75	C	Grad	%-	-1	0	but but what 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1351	3429.13	3430.72	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because they have instances all the time 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1352	3432.32	3436.55	C	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	yeah the the on tonnage it's really not a smart come 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1353	3437.07	3438.33	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	in in enough itself that's more something 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1354	3438.33	3442.92	C	Grad	s	-1	0	that's more something that i keep those and and you know 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1355	3443.19	3445.76	C	Grad	s	-1	0	but so it's a complete the email 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1356	3445.9	3448.5	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but uh smart comes going to need an apology yes 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1357	3448.69	3451.03	C	Grad	s^aa|s	-1	0	i understand yes i know a lot of people are aware of that 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1358	3451.75	3453.84	B	Professor	s^bk|qy^df	-1	0	i understand doing anything about it 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1359	3455.51	3456.26	C	Grad	h	-1	0	okay 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1360	3456.67	3457.04	B	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	okay political problem 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1361	3457.23	3458.25	B	Professor	s	-1	0	political problem we won't worry about it 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1362	3458.25	3458.97	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we won't worry about it 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1363	3459.48	3464.05	C	Grad	s^ar|s	-1	0	no but that they're i i still think that there is enough information in there for example 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1364	3464.51	3465.98	C	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	for example whether 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1365	3466.38	3469.95	C	Grad	s	-1	0	okay so it isn't know about the twenty optic types aren't divorced 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1366	3470.24	3472.45	C	Grad	s	-1	0	that's just in their only twenty optic types and so forth 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1367	3473.64	3477.69	C	Grad	s	-1	0	and it was know if any of always have institutional meanings 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1368	3478.21	3483.0	C	Grad	s	-1	0	so in a sense i used to institutions for some in some sense i i 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1369	3484.1	3486.69	C	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	which makes them in trouble right in a sense 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1370	3486.8	3487.35	C	Grad	s^e	-1	0	anyway right in a sense 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1372	3487.89	3487.95	B	Professor	b.%	-1	0	anyway 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1373	3487.95	3489.12	B	Professor	fg|s.%--	-1	0	anyway so we may have to this is it hoping we 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1371	3487.74	3487.87	C	Grad	s^f	-1	0	anyway 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1375	3489.23	3489.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	this is it hoping we 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1374	3488.74	3488.88	C	Grad	b.%	-1	0	so we may have to 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1376	3490.0	3491.46	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	may have to build another day just contractually 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1377	3490.27	3490.49	C	Grad	b	-1	0	may have to build another 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1378	3491.87	3493.36	B	Professor	s	-1	0	day just contractually we know what should be done 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1379	3494.21	3501.93	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	when we see what people have done it may turn out that the easiest thing to do is to build a a separate thing that that just tells it 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1380	3502.53	3506.55	B	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	like it it it may be that the the instance would like 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1381	3506.64	3511.44	B	Professor	s	-1	0	instance would like to build our own instance uh things that types and then it goes off yeah it's everything just doing 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1382	3509.3	3509.95	D	Grad	fg|%--	-1	0	things yeah it's 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1383	3510.28	3511.07	D	Grad	s^aa|s.%-	-1	0	that types and then it goes off everything just doing 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1384	3511.44	3513.59	B	Professor	s	-1	0	types and then it goes off the apology much of its tights with a little 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1385	3513.59	3514.66	B	Professor	s	-1	0	of its tights with a little they just record 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1386	3515.02	3521.63	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and so we do in that case is you know our instance gadget have are easy ace 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1387	3522.43	3525.48	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and if there isn't one would get the pipe and then the have 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1388	3525.48	3527.17	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then the have deviation types of would have our own little 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1389	3527.17	3531.11	B	Professor	s	-1	0	of would have our own little uh easy a tree and then 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1391	3531.7	3534.52	B	Professor	s	-1	0	and then for other uh the actors that we need to would have 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1390	3531.21	3531.4	D	Grad	b	-1	0	and then 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1392	3531.72	3532.02	D	Grad	b	-1	0	and then for other 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1393	3534.52	3539.51	B	Professor	s	-1	0	we need to would have our own little things that whenever we needed one we just usually i told you to get the type 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1394	3534.77	3535.22	D	Grad	b.%	-1	0	we need to would have our own little things 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1396	3540.11	3542.1	B	Professor	s^fe	-1	0	and then would have sure whatever we do to say opposites that type of thing 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1395	3539.76	3540.15	D	Grad	b.%	-1	0	the type and then would have sure whatever 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1397	3542.1	3546.85	B	Professor	s:s^fe	+1	1	that type of thing and we want it's t. v. a. sector it's that 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1398	3547.95	3549.47	B	Professor	s	-1	0	so i think we can handle that and then but the 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1399	3549.47	3557.84	B	Professor	s	+1	1	that and then but the combination functions and whether we can put those in java bays and all that sort of stuff is uh is a bigger deal

Bed005.B.dialogueact1401	3558.96	3560.69	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i think that's where we have to get technically clever 
Bed005.A.dialogueact1403	3562.39	3566.97	A	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	we could just steal the classes in java is and then interface to them with their own code 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1402	3561.9	3562.34	D	Grad	fh	-1	0	we could just steal the 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1404	3567.41	3569.0	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	well that the quite understand the closet and 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1405	3568.35	3571.28	D	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah i mean it's it cute that the quite understand the closet and

Bed005.A.dialogueact1430	3612.24	3613.82	A	Grad	s^ar|s^df.%--	-1	0	know but i mean what a little but 
Bed005.A.dialogueact1431	3613.82	3616.44	A	Grad	s	-1	0	what a little but so you could have four different base that's it you're running and then run 
Bed005.A.dialogueact1432	3616.54	3620.34	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	running and then run your own write your own function that would take yeah put of those four and make your 
Bed005.A.dialogueact1433	3620.69	3622.45	A	Grad	s^e	-1	0	and make your own g. function as i was saying yeah that's fine if it if it 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1434	3621.91	3622.56	B	Professor	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	own g. function as i was saying yeah that's fine if it if it 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1435	3622.56	3623.83	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	was saying that's fine if it if it comes only at the end but suppose 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1436	3623.83	3624.96	B	Professor	qh	-1	0	comes only at the end but suppose one wanted him bed 
Bed005.A.dialogueact1437	3626.05	3628.59	A	Grad	s	-1	0	then they needed to break all your business up in the smaller basements with all 
Bed005.A.dialogueact1438	3628.59	3629.26	A	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	with all the 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1439	3630.21	3630.4	B	Professor	%--	-1	0	oh that yeah that's a truly 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1440	3630.4	3631.96	B	Professor	s^bk|s^ba	-1	0	oh that yeah that's a truly horrible way to do it one 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1441	3631.96	3632.7	B	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	yeah horrible way to do it one would hope 
Bed005.A.dialogueact1442	3632.71	3633.57	A	Grad	s^bk|s^df.%-	-1	0	yeah but i just would hope yeah yeah yeah i 
Bed005.C.dialogueact1443	3632.71	3633.38	C	Grad	b.%	-1	0	yeah but i just would hope yeah yeah yeah i 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1444	3633.46	3634.39	B	Professor	s^bk|s^na	-1	0	but i just yeah yeah yeah i you 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1445	3634.92	3637.89	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	you you may hate java basis and the only packaging time let's 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1446	3637.89	3641.91	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	packaging time let's see if there's another package it's more civilized about this 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1447	3642.01	3642.92	D	Grad	%	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bed005.B.dialogueact1448	3645.21	3647.94	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that's trainee is we're talking to in this 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1449	3645.53	3645.65	D	Grad	b.%	-1	0	that's trainee 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1450	3648.22	3654.61	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because he said that he actually did hack some combining functions in the java based but 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1452	3655.02	3662.84	B	Professor	s	-1	0	he doesn't remember listen i talked me didn't remember whether was he in easy thing a natural thing i really had to do some violence to it to make it work 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1451	3654.57	3654.84	D	Grad	b	-1	0	based but 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1453	3663.68	3664.54	B	Professor	fh	-1	0	uh but he did 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1454	3664.76	3665.53	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but he did do it 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1455	3665.63	3665.7	D	Grad	b.%	-1	0	do it 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1456	3666.51	3669.74	D	Grad	s^no	+1	0	i don't see why d. a combined fox of the directly hack into job is i mean they're 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1457	3669.74	3671.23	D	Grad	s^df	+1	0	into job is i mean they're used to create tables so we can just 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1458	3671.23	3675.41	D	Grad	s	+1	0	do it is is to so we can just make our own and functions that creates people and x. amount of 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1459	3674.2	3679.48	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	do it is is to just converted into a into a into a c. p. david use it it's people and x. amount of 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1460	3679.9	3680.83	B	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	use it it's blown up it's so 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1461	3680.83	3682.2	B	Professor	s^bd	-1	0	blown up it's so it's it's huge but 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1462	3682.2	3686.86	B	Professor	s^df	-1	0	but it doesn't require any data sitting or complication i 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1463	3684.33	3685.02	D	Grad	b.%	-1	0	data sitting 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1464	3686.59	3686.72	D	Grad	b	-1	0	or complication i 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1465	3686.94	3690.6	D	Grad	s^nd.%--	-1	0	or complication i don't think i mean the fact that it blows up in a huge issue in the sense that i 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1466	3691.02	3691.48	D	Grad	s	-1	0	mean okay so say it blows 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1467	3691.48	3692.51	D	Grad	s|qy^d^f^g	-1	0	mean okay so say it blows up right to say is like 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1468	3692.51	3697.04	D	Grad	s	-1	0	up right to say is like uh you know ten ten fifteen uh things it's going to be like to 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1469	3697.13	3699.26	D	Grad	s	-1	0	it's going to be like to to be that isn't so bad 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1470	3699.26	3700.36	D	Grad	s	-1	0	isn't so bad 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1471	3701.03	3701.75	B	Professor	s^na	-1	0	i understand i'm just saying 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1472	3701.75	3702.81	B	Professor	s^df.%--	-1	0	i understand i'm just saying that did well that 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1473	3702.92	3703.98	B	Professor	s	-1	0	that did well that was a that was my note 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1474	3704.59	3706.05	B	Professor	s^e	-1	0	little no i said said that said 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1476	3706.89	3711.35	B	Professor	s:s	-1	0	said here's what you take the logical g. function and turn it into a c. p. t. 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1475	3706.57	3707.01	D	Grad	b	-1	0	said here's what you take 
Bed005.D.dialogueact1477	3711.67	3712.12	D	Grad	b	-1	0	t. i mean that the 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1478	3712.51	3714.56	B	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean that the max the evidence combining function 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1479	3715.76	3716.57	B	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so i could do that and maybe that's 
Bed005.B.dialogueact1480	3716.57	3717.59	B	Professor	s^am^cs	-1	0	do that and maybe that's what we'll do
