The semantic specification requires some adjustments.
Amongst other things "cause" has to be added as another X-schema.
Linguistic hedging will also be encoded as a demarcation of evidentiality or speaker confidence.
Mental spaces can be tackled with mechanisms that can also deal with context issues ( time , space etc . ): creating a base space and rules of interaction with other interconnected spaces.
However , the complexity of these mechanisms has to be bound as well: it is necessary to define the range of constructions to be studied.
Given the domains currently used ( tourist , child language learning ) , some features , like speaker attitude , are not of equal importance at this stage.
On the other hand , it was decided for the inheritance between constructions to be left out for now , as the notation can be rendered more elegant later on.
Finally , a preliminary presentation on the idea of how to use Bayes-nets for construal will take place in the next meeting.
