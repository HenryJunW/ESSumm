The construction formalism is not yet complete as to the semantic constraints -the terminology has also been met with objections- and does not deal with mental spaces.
On their own , constructions can only give limited information regarding mental spaces: forms can provide cues to create a different mental space , but the semantic nuances are defined by context.
It is not decided at this stage whether the necessary values should be coded within the construction or as part of construal.
Other issues concern focus and stress: focus is seen as an information structure device , but there has been no suggestion as to how to predict its effects or break it down in possible focused elements; as to stress , it may not be useful as a form value , as it shows the focus exponent , but not what the focus is on.
Moving to the semantic specification , the analysis still needs mechanisms to deal with causality , as well as mental spaces and bindings between them.
Additionally , how referring expressions are linked to referents or even how mental spaces affect this linking are still to lay down in detail.
