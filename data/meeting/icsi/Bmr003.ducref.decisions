The group will obtain a copy of the Corpus of Spoken American English ( CSAE ) from the LDC to compare the methods and conventions used by UC Santa Barbara with those being considered for the Meeting Recorder project.
Speakers fe008 and me011 will experiment with pre-segmentation procedures in hopes of facilitating the transcription process.
Speaker fe008 will perform the transcription for one meeting ( 40-60 minutes of data ) as a pilot project.
A tentative decision was made to put speaker fe008 in charge of the in-house transcription effort.
Modifications to the Transcriber source code , e.g . adjusting the delay between the audio play function and the inputting of time boundaries , may be undertaken by the BMR group.
An initiative for creating an internal BMR project website was discussed , along with ideas for providing web access to external organizations , such as the University of Washington.
A cabinet will be built to house wires and other electronic equipment used in the recording setup.
A laptop and wireless modem will be avaiable to participants for monitoring the recording progress.
