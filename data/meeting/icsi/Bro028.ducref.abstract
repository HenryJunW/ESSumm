ICSI's Meeting Recorder Group met to discuss their progress in various aspects of the Aurora Project , but also to hear more about other developments relevant to the group.
On the Aurora Project , there were reports on a project conference call , the status of the tandem neural networks , and progress with the Mississippi State recognizer.
The latency limit has been set , and the group's system is performing very well , but is a little over.
On the larger vocabulary task , there are still a few issues to resolve before work can really get started.
The group heard of the plan of one of it's member's work into intermediate classifiers , and also of how a visiting research student's work into auditory models can be applied to their work.
