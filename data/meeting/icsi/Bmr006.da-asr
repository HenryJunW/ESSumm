Bmr006.B.dialogueact10	10.39	17.5	B	Grad	z	-1	0	it is but all all i know is that it seems like every time i am up here after a meeting and i start it it works fine 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact11	18.54	22.94	B	Grad	z	-1	0	and if i'm up here in i started and we're all sitting here waiting to have a meeting it gives me that error message and 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact12	22.94	29.15	B	Grad	z	-1	0	fixing to get news write it down me that error message and i have not yet sat down with been able to get that error message the point where i can sit down and find out where it's occurring in the code yep 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact13	28.133	29.593	A	PhD	z	-1	0	fixing to get news write it down it's occurring in the code yep 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact14	29.958	30.698	B	Grad	z	-1	0	write it down yep we well 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact17	31.374	32.304	B	Grad	z	-1	0	one of these days was it applies okay what's on pasta 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact15	31.049	31.299	D	Professor	z	-1	0	one of these days was it applies 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact16	31.097	32.077	E	Postdoc	z	-1	0	one of these days was it applies okay what's on pasta

Bmr006.D.dialogueact23	36.31	44.64	D	Professor	fg|s^t^tc	-1	0	so that so the uh the new procedural change just got suggested i think it's a good idea is that um we do they did recordings at the end 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact24	45.3	55.07	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and that way if we're recording somebody elses uh meeting and the number the participants have to run off to some other meeting don't have the time uh then they can run off and they will get 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact25	55.58	58.27	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and they will get so much somewhat fewer uh such as digits but um 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact26	58.27	65.5	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	but um i think that we will cut into people's time uh someone's on strict time uh less 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact27	66.443	68.583	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	so i think i think we should start doing 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact28	70.2	78.83	D	Professor	fh|s	+1	0	um so uh let's see we were having discussion the other day i mean we should bring that up about uh the nature of the data they were collecting 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact29	79.758	89.739	D	Professor	fh|s.%--	+1	0	uh that uh we should have a fair amount of data that is um collected for the same meeting so that we can 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact30	90.349	90.799	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact31	90.799	91.199	D	Professor	s^no	-1	0	yeah what what 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact32	91.529	93.429	D	Professor	qw^rt	-1	0	yeah what what were some of know about that 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact33	93.999	94.199	D	Professor	qy.%--	-1	0	about that 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact34	95.79	97.39	F	PhD	h|s	-1	0	um well okay i'll back up um at 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact36	97.713	98.003	D	Professor	b	-1	0	up um at the previous 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact35	97.7	104.83	F	PhD	s	-1	0	up um at the previous at last week's meeting this meeting i was right and how about wanting to get more data and 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact37	104.83	108.48	F	PhD	s	-1	0	to get more data and i i talked about the fifteen and and adam um 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact38	108.68	119.2	F	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	um and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on the state uh um central avenue this new student does does want to work with us the the guy that was 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact40	119.494	119.984	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	the the guy that was 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact39	119.2	120.91	F	PhD	s	-1	0	the the guy that was at the last meeting 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact41	121.17	121.51	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	and he's already 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact42	121.392	122.712	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and he's already funded part-time so we'll be 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact43	122.712	125.942	F	PhD	s	-1	0	funded part-time so we'll be paying him only for us half of the normal part-time 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact44	126.58	126.95	A	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr006.F.dialogueact45	126.72	127.82	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	and what yeah 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact46	127.927	129.417	B	Grad	qw^rt	-1	0	and what interested in specifically yeah so he comes 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact47	128.11	128.52	F	PhD	%--	-1	0	interested in specifically so 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact48	129.473	131.573	F	PhD	s	+1	0	he comes from a signal processing background but i 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact49	131.573	132.743	F	PhD	s	-1	0	background but i liked it a lot because he's 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact50	132.743	140.6	F	PhD	s	+1	0	liked it a lot because he's very interested in higher level things like language and just one season all kinds of it maybe positive he's 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact51	138.689	139.229	B	Grad	b	-1	0	season all kinds of it maybe 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact53	140.994	141.534	B	Grad	s^ba	-1	0	positive he's getting it's even in that 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact52	140.6	142.19	F	PhD	s	-1	0	positive he's getting it's even in that anyway i thought 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact54	142.57	150.62	F	PhD	fh|s^cs^rt	-1	0	anyway i thought okay maybe we should have enough data so that she starts he'd be starting in january next semester that we have you know enough data work with 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact55	150.987	151.177	B	Grad	b	-1	0	work with but 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact56	151.78	166.53	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	but um gain an atom brought up to a lot of good points that just posting i know to berkeley people have haven't come down here has some problems in that you mean you need to make sure that the speakers are you want and at the meeting type is what you want and so forth 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact57	167.04	170.12	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	so i thought about that and i think it's still possible um 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact58	170.28	180.83	F	PhD	fh|s^cs	+1	3	one offs um but i'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about in here then sort of uh missed much of a bunch of one one time 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact59	179.95	180.38	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	one offs one one time 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact60	181.238	185.26	F	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah just because it would be very hard too process the data in all senses boats 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact61	185.26	194.88	F	PhD	s	-1	0	boats to get the um figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it like i was talking to morning about 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact62	195.26	197.38	F	PhD	s^e	-1	0	things like summer station i was meeting about i mean 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact63	197.93	204.978	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	i mean it's very different if you have a group that just giving a report on what they did that week versus coming to a decision and so forth so 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact64	204.978	226.63	F	PhD	fh|s	+1	1	and so forth so then i was um talking to morgan about um new propose work in this area service separate issue from what student would be working on where i was think of doing some kind of summers nation of meetings are trying to find cues in they irises and then the other into patterns like in 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact65	226.69	229.3	F	PhD	s^e	+1	0	patterns like in numbers of overlaps i'm amount of speech rock 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact66	229.72	244.754	F	PhD	s	+1	1	rock hughes from the interaction that can be measured from the signals and from the diff different microphones that point too hot hotspots in the meeting or things or stuff is going on that might be important for someone to tend to tend to listen to 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact67	245.86	257.16	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	2	and that uh regard i thought we definitely we will need it'd be it'd be nice for us to have a bunch of date uh from a few different domain are two different kinds of meetings of this this meeting 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact68	257.16	258.79	F	PhD	s	-1	0	of this this meeting is one of them although 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact69	258.79	261.17	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	is one of them although i'm not sure i could participate if i 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact70	262.08	267.21	F	PhD	s	-1	0	you know i would feel very strange thing part of i mean that you're in analyzing later for things like summer station um 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact71	266.293	266.813	B	Grad	b	-1	0	like summer station 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact72	267.977	271.087	F	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	um and then there's mothers that munch that morgan mentioned like the front and meeting 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact73	271.087	274.907	F	PhD	s^e^rt	+1	0	right yep like the front and meeting and maybe in that working group meeting 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact74	272.521	272.821	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right and maybe 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact75	274.29	274.42	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yep group meeting 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact76	275.23	277.93	B	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	that we're we're hoping that they'll let us start recording regularly so 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact77	275.23	280.547	F	PhD	s	+1	0	that we're we're hoping that they'll let us start recording regularly so so if that were the case and i think we'd have enough but 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact78	278.2	278.33	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	so if that were the 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact79	280.737	281.277	B	Grad	b	-1	0	enough but basically for anything 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact80	280.947	298.06	F	PhD	s	-1	0	enough but basically for anything where you're trying to get a summer a station or some kind of meeting meaning out of the meeting um it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings we didn't really have a good grasp what does it mean to summarize but rather 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact81	295.917	296.187	B	Grad	b	-1	0	have a good grasp what 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact82	298.06	303.73	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	but rather we should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summary 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact83	304.65	308.48	F	PhD	s^co	-1	0	and then we need a couple that of we don't want to just have one group because that 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact84	308.48	313.793	F	PhD	s^co^e	-1	0	yeah we have a lot of overlap so so group because that might be very specific to that particular group but three or four different times 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact86	312.57	317.69	B	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and uh morning meeting so so three or four different times see 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact85	312.56	313.31	D	Professor	fg	-1	0	yeah we have a lot of overlap so so three or four different times 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact88	318.399	318.839	C	PhD	b	-1	0	i've never listened to 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact87	317.902	321.542	F	PhD	s	-1	0	meeting we've we've only had three see i've never listened to the data for the fun and meeting 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact90	320.96	322.39	B	Grad	s	-1	0	we've we've only had three so and meeting 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact89	320.806	321.086	D	Professor	b	-1	0	we've we've only had three and meeting 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact91	322.49	322.72	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact92	322.512	322.932	F	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact93	323.81	324.79	F	PhD	s	-1	0	but maybe that's enough so 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact94	324.79	326.96	F	PhD	s	-1	0	that's enough so internalized thinking more data but 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact95	326.96	332.546	F	PhD	s	+1	1	more data but also data where we sold some parameters concentrate fairly similar like a 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact97	332.593	333.083	B	Grad	b	-1	0	similar like a meeting about 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact96	332.546	339.69	F	PhD	s^e	+1	0	similar like a meeting about of people doing a certain kind of work where at least half the participants each time are the same 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact98	340.439	340.699	B	Grad	fg	-1	0	know that 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact99	340.58	342.94	D	Professor	fg|s^na	-1	0	know that i mean just you the other side to that 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact100	342.94	345.31	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	the other side to that sake because i i don't disagree with that but i think 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact101	345.66	347.62	D	Professor	s^aap	-1	0	but i think there's a complimentary piece too too 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact102	348.28	355.71	D	Professor	fh|s^nd	+1	1	uh for other kinds of research particularly the acoustic oriented research i actually feel the opposite me 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact103	356.27	357.9	D	Professor	s^cs^nd	-1	0	i'd like to have lots of different people right 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact104	356.44	356.86	F	PhD	b	-1	0	i'd like to have lots right 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact105	358.205	358.545	F	PhD	b	-1	0	as many right 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact106	358.79	366.083	D	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	as many people hear it and talking about that kind of things that you're just talking about you would have thought too few people from my point you know i'd like to have many different speakers right 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact107	366.083	367.563	D	Professor	s^cs^nd	+1	2	know i'd like to have many different speakers 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact108	368.32	378.0	D	Professor	fh|s.%--	+1	2	so um i think i would also very much like has to have a fair amount uh really random scattered beating somebody coming down to campus and and uh i mean sure if we can right 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact109	375.769	376.549	C	PhD	b	-1	0	coming down to campus and 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact110	378.0	380.35	D	Professor	s	-1	0	mean sure if we can get more from them fine but if we only get one right 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact111	378.17	378.76	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	mean sure if we can right 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact112	378.952	379.412	F	PhD	b	-1	0	mean sure if we can get more from them right 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact113	380.35	388.3	D	Professor	s	+1	0	fine but if we only get one or two from each group still could be useful could stick we just because we have close and distant microphones for different people cancun yeah i definitely agree with 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact114	384.78	386.19	F	PhD	s^aa|s^na	-1	0	we just because we have close and distant microphones yeah i definitely agree with 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact115	385.991	386.771	C	PhD	b	-1	0	close and distant microphones definitely agree with 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact116	386.333	386.773	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	and distant microphones 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact117	386.65	387.07	F	PhD	s^aa^r	-1	0	and distant microphones for different people 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact118	388.416	388.976	C	PhD	b	-1	0	cancun 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact119	388.721	395.811	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	cancun yeah that that the the issues that i think adam and i raise for more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact120	396.49	397.95	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	because i think if you just say and 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact121	397.95	409.57	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	think if you just say and and in particular my suggestion wise to advertise to linguistics grad students because there you have sought people who would have proficiency enough in english that that uh i would be useful for for purposes you know but 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact122	403.462	403.802	D	Professor	b	-1	0	there you have sought 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact123	409.84	414.59	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you know but you know i think i've been i've i've gathered data from undergrad at on campus and she 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact124	414.59	424.369	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	where you want it on campus and she just posted granted like undergrads i think you get such a mixed bag that would be hard to know how much conversation you have at all and then the english you'd have would that language models would be really hard to build because it would not really 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact125	420.942	421.822	D	Professor	fg|s.%-	-1	0	where you want it at all and then the english you'd have 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact126	424.369	427.749	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	well to build because it would not really be could be dinner language rather than 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact127	427.248	433.11	D	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	well okay uh first place i i i don't think we just want to have random people come down and talk to one another i think there should 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact129	433.11	438.4	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	i think there should be a meeting that has some colin point because i i think that's where we're investigating so it has to be it a preexisting 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact128	432.909	433.229	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	and talk to one another i think there should 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact130	437.74	442.53	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	right yep we're investigating so so i was okay it has to be it a preexisting meeting like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway that's i think 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact131	438.4	438.73	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	so be it a preexisting

Bmr006.E.dialogueact150	475.191	477.141	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	it just simply fluency i mean i deal with 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact152	477.756	478.106	D	Professor	b	-1	0	i mean i deal with people on on 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact151	477.371	489.55	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you're not talking about foreign language i mean i deal with people on on campus who i think sometimes people undergraduates um in computer science uh have language skills that make you know that they're they're fluency in the writing skills are not so strong

Bmr006.D.dialogueact154	488.721	490.561	D	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah it just you're not talking about foreign language at all you're just talking are not so strong 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact155	490.203	491.603	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	yeah it just talking about at all you're just talking about

Bmr006.B.dialogueact158	493.288	494.248	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	all have the same but i i just think but 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact159	494.773	497.98	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i just think but you know it's like when you get into the graduate level uh no problem 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact160	498.08	499.09	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	yeah then we're completely gone i mean i'm not saying accents i'm saying i'm saying 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact161	498.622	499.462	C	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah then we're completely gone i mean i'm not saying accents i'm saying i'm saying 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact162	498.763	500.083	D	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah then we're completely gone it's i mean i'm not saying accents i'm saying i'm saying fluency 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact163	499.09	500.95	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	we're completely gone it's i'm saying i'm saying fluency 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact165	500.264	500.994	B	Grad	b	-1	0	it's fluency 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact164	500.133	504.64	D	Professor	s	-1	0	it's that the habits already burnt and but fluency well the same phone see 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact166	501.18	501.87	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	well 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact167	502.96	503.89	E	Postdoc	s^df^r	-1	0	that the habits already the same phone see 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact168	504.78	504.95	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	burnt and but 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact169	505.31	511.42	B	Grad	s^cs	+1	1	well i think that um i think the only thing that we should in the advertisement is that the meeting should be in english 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact171	512.725	523.758	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and and i think if it's a preexisting meeting and it's held in english i i think it's probably okay if a few of the people don't have not particularly good english skills okay not 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact170	512.36	512.57	D	Professor	b	-1	0	and 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact172	523.556	527.446	E	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	skills okay not tank and i see the other aspect of this from my perspective which is that 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact173	527.446	533.204	E	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	which is that um there's there's this this issue you have a corpus out there should be used for for multiple things because it's so expensive 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact174	533.204	534.744	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	right things because it's so expensive to put together 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact175	534.718	534.998	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	right to put together 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact176	534.88	535.15	D	Professor	b	-1	0	right to put together and if people 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact177	535.287	537.297	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	and if people want to approach um 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact178	537.696	538.056	E	Postdoc	fh	-1	0	um so i know 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact179	538.056	540.316	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	so i know you know just the idea 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact180	540.316	545.716	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	know just the idea of computational linguistics and probably the grammar is and all may not be the folks this group 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact181	546.163	546.533	D	Professor	b	-1	0	but the idea 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact182	546.23	558.2	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but the idea of language models which are fun you know generally speaking uh you know terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent or an hour invested in preparing the data if you 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact183	555.626	555.976	D	Professor	b	-1	0	or an hour 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact184	557.183	557.833	D	Professor	b	-1	0	in preparing the data 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact185	558.806	570.56	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	if you have a choice between people who are probably more precision in um it more fluent more more close to being academic english then it would seem to me to be a good thing 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact186	571.55	572.83	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	i guess i 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact187	573.3	573.53	D	Professor	b	-1	0	huh because otherwise 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact189	573.53	574.11	D	Professor	%	-1	0	huh because otherwise you you don't have the ability 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact188	573.43	575.63	E	Postdoc	s.%--	-1	0	huh because otherwise you you don't have the ability to have 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact190	576.129	579.329	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	uh so if you if you have a bunch of if he like that's the worst possible case if you have people 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact191	579.329	592.7	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	case if you have people who are using english as a as an intro language because they they don't uh they can't speak in their native languages and but they're into language isn't really a match to any existing uh language model 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact192	587.345	587.765	D	Professor	b	-1	0	but they're into 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact193	593.303	594.603	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	okay well that's the worst case scenario 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact194	594.108	594.188	C	PhD	b	-1	0	well that's scenario 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact195	594.188	594.248	C	PhD	b	-1	0	well that's scenario 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact196	594.663	597.473	D	Professor	s	-1	0	well that's pretty much what you're going to have in the networking or scenario and 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact197	595.293	595.553	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	pretty much what you're going and 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact198	598.419	598.709	B	Grad	b	-1	0	because because 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact199	598.463	602.513	D	Professor	s	-1	0	because because they're part of the network group is almost entirely germans in spanish well but the thing 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact200	599.38	599.62	E	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	they're part of the network well 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact201	601.998	602.218	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	germans in spanish but the thing 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact202	602.743	608.123	E	Postdoc	s^df.%--	-1	0	but the thing is i think the these people are of high enough level in their in their language proficiency it and i'm not checked 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact203	607.914	608.204	D	Professor	s^bk	-1	0	proficiency it and i'm not checked 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact204	608.383	609.753	E	Postdoc	s^df	+1	0	it and i'm not checked into accents i'm i'm 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact206	610.088	610.538	D	Professor	b	-1	0	just thinking that 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact205	609.753	620.867	E	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	into accents i'm i'm just thinking that we have to think at a at a higher level view could we have a language model a grammar a grammar basically that um would be uh a possibility so 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact207	617.342	617.712	D	Professor	b	-1	0	that um 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact208	620.867	633.001	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	possibility so you so if you want to bring them i like down draft he's model and and do some top down stuff it to help the the bottom up in merced things or whatever uh it seems like um i don't see that there's an argument i i i'm what i think 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact209	627.473	627.983	D	Professor	b	-1	0	up in merced 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact210	633.151	647.83	E	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	0	i i i'm what i think is that why not have the corpus so expensive to put together uh useful for the widest range of of central core things that people generally use corporate four and which are you know using caucasian linguistics 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact211	634.589	635.099	D	Professor	b	-1	0	is that why not have the corpus 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact212	648.05	651.47	E	Postdoc	s^bs	-1	0	that's that's which which includes both top down and bottom up 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact214	649.192	650.332	C	PhD	s	-1	0	which which includes both top down and bottom 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact213	649.191	649.511	D	Professor	b	-1	0	which which includes 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact215	652.07	652.71	C	PhD	b	-1	0	okay well 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact216	652.48	654.76	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	okay well it it let's let's see what we can get i mean 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact217	654.87	667.02	D	Professor	s	+1	1	what we can get i mean it it's i think that if we're aiming at at uh groups of graduate students and professors and so forth are talking about things together and it's on the berkeley campus probably most of it be okay but okay yes that's fine that's fine exactly my point in my in my not to lose 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact218	660.01	661.68	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	so forth are talking about things together that's fine 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact219	662.09	662.58	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	and it's on the berkeley that's fine 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact220	666.13	666.49	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	be okay exactly my point 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact221	666.49	671.36	E	Postdoc	s	+1	1	be okay but okay exactly my point in my in my not to lose was i think undergrads are if he if he population i definitely agree with that 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact222	667.02	667.27	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	but okay in my in my not to lose 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact223	667.56	667.93	D	Professor	b	-1	0	but okay in my in my not to lose 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact225	671.333	671.763	D	Professor	b	-1	0	definitely agree with that 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact224	670.891	673.591	F	PhD	s^na	-1	0	well not to mention he if he population gradually that's i definitely agree with that i mean for this purpose 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact226	672.671	672.941	D	Professor	b	-1	0	i mean for this 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact229	673.588	681.22	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	well not to mention the fact that i would be hesitant certainly could take anyone under eighteen probably even then anyone under twenty one gradually that's just fine purpose

Bmr006.C.dialogueact237	687.183	687.313	C	PhD	b	-1	0	you have to 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact236	686.804	688.151	F	PhD	b	-1	0	because of the consent form you have to get find their parent 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact238	687.753	689.983	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	you have to get find their parent to sign for them

Bmr006.F.dialogueact244	691.567	693.997	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i have a uh um question well 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact245	693.997	705.797	F	PhD	s.%-	+1	0	they're they're you know they're just they're uh assessing whether they should do that question well maureen you were mentioning that mari may not use the cook equipment from i. b. m. if they found something else because 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact246	701.39	708.52	D	Professor	s	-1	0	they're they're you know they're just they're uh assessing whether they should do that or you do something else hopefully over the next few weeks because i mean one 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact247	708.425	717.0	F	PhD	qy^cs	+1	0	few weeks because i mean one remote possibility is that if we if we inherited that equipment if she weren't using it could be set up a room in the linguistics department and and 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact248	717.59	728.212	F	PhD	s^cs	+1	0	and and i mean there there may be a lot more or or insight crank wherever and and other building where we could um record people there i think we have a better 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact249	728.212	729.422	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i think i think we have a better chance 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact250	729.86	733.59	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	i think we need a real motivated partner to do that we need to find chance right but 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact252	733.66	735.96	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	to do that we need to find some on campus was interested in this right but

Bmr006.F.dialogueact255	736.61	737.62	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	but if they're worth it to i mean 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact256	737.8	745.7	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	it to i mean it's a remote possibility then um you know one of us who don't go out there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here so just 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact257	743.491	743.691	B	Grad	b	-1	0	the meeting or something 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact258	745.7	750.443	F	PhD	s	-1	0	well the other thing yeah the other thing that i was hoping to do in down here so just uh just thought of standup not using the 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact259	746.73	755.094	D	Professor	fg|s	+1	0	right well the other thing yeah the other thing that i was hoping to do in the first place was to turn into some kind of portable thing so could we went around uh just thought of standup not using the 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact260	753.698	753.978	B	Grad	b	-1	0	right portable thing so

Bmr006.B.dialogueact263	758.81	762.32	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so i know that spaces really scarce on at least in c. s. and 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact265	762.97	766.4	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and to to actually find a room that we could use regularly might be very difficult you may not need a sucker

Bmr006.F.dialogueact267	765.981	767.731	F	PhD	s^arp	-1	0	might be very difficult that's true you may not need a sucker you know the idea 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact268	767.656	768.046	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	that's true true you know the idea is if they have a meeting 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact270	767.811	768.201	D	Professor	b	-1	0	that's true true you know the idea is if they have a meeting 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact269	767.731	776.32	F	PhD	s	-1	0	that's true true well maybe john you know the idea is if they have a meeting room and they can guarantee that the equipment will be safe and so forth and if one of us up there to record the meeting once a week or something 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact271	768.486	768.686	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	true is if they have a meeting 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact272	772.948	773.358	B	Grad	b	-1	0	will be safe and so forth and if one of 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact273	775.993	776.233	B	Grad	b	-1	0	well maybe john the meeting once a week or something 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact274	776.62	779.41	D	Professor	s	-1	0	well maybe john and i just put it in and smell it on or something 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact275	777.661	778.121	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	and i just put it in and smell it on or 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact276	779.381	779.661	B	Grad	b	-1	0	something 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact277	779.41	779.67	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	something 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact278	780.056	781.766	F	PhD	s^na	-1	0	i i think it's not out of the question 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact280	782.033	785.053	B	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah i think it would be interesting because i we could regularly get another meeting um 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact279	781.876	782.186	D	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah i think it would be interesting because out of the question um 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact281	782.046	782.546	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah i think it would be interesting because um 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact282	782.931	783.311	F	PhD	fh	-1	0	yeah i think it would be interesting because i we could regularly um 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact284	786.072	787.69	B	Grad	s	-1	0	another type of me 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact283	786.063	786.583	C	PhD	b	-1	0	another type 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact285	787.762	788.092	F	PhD	b	-1	0	of me but i think 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact287	788.44	801.2	C	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	right but i think you need to i know the pool table routine the but they were it and boom boom boom and maurice if you she has this recording process yeah i from like see 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact286	788.42	788.64	F	PhD	b	-1	0	but i think 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact288	794.262	795.042	B	Grad	b	-1	0	boom boom boom 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact289	799.851	800.091	D	Professor	b	-1	0	yeah i from like see 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact292	801.5	801.81	B	Grad	b	-1	0	right 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact290	801.31	804.56	C	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	right and pro rodeo you know they've 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact291	801.455	801.765	D	Professor	b	-1	0	right 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact293	804.56	825.712	C	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah but i think if we if we want know they've you you onto to the court it and she i mean out of all the crass that it continuous u. t. u. you and it eat agree it and basic word to it the book they it up if they said phone saying some people are on do you have poop recall don't do we say it just kind also it'd be like 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact294	809.738	810.018	D	Professor	b	-1	0	that it continuous u. t. u. 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact295	819.61	820.19	B	Grad	fg	-1	0	yeah but saying some people are on 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact296	824.94	829.48	B	Grad	s	-1	0	i think if we if we want to just record with the tabletop microphones that's easy kind also it'd be like well yeah 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact297	828.302	829.142	C	PhD	b	-1	0	microphones that's easy well yeah 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact299	830.082	830.352	B	Grad	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	right that's very 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact300	830.422	831.302	B	Grad	s	-1	0	right that's very easy but that's not the 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact298	830.031	830.591	C	PhD	b	-1	0	right that's very 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact301	831.302	833.202	B	Grad	s	-1	0	easy but that's not the corpus that we're collecting actually 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact302	833.311	833.521	C	PhD	b	-1	0	actually 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact303	833.664	837.564	D	Professor	s	-1	0	actually that's it raises an interesting point they can our discussions maybe worth repeating 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact304	838.054	842.024	D	Professor	s	-1	0	realize that um we're talking about this said okay there's these different things i want to do it so 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact305	842.854	853.504	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	so um it's true that we want to be selective in some ways and the way that you're speaking about with uh not having inter mine uh and and uh these other issues but on 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact306	853.844	859.344	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but on the other hand it's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus satisfy all of it so it's 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact307	859.344	866.994	D	Professor	s	-1	0	of it so it's pretty examples that we want to have a fair amount it's done with a small not recorded with a small um tight number of types of meetings 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact308	867.5	871.85	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but we can also have another part that's uh just one or two meetings of each of a arrange of them that's 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact309	871.85	872.83	D	Professor	s	-1	0	arrange of them that's okay too 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact310	873.38	881.084	D	Professor	fh|s	+1	1	uh we realized in discussion that the other thing is about this business of distant and close microphones i mean we 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact311	881.524	884.554	D	Professor	s	+1	0	i mean we really want to have a substantial amount recorded this way that's what we did 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact312	884.554	885.304	D	Professor	s	-1	0	this way that's what we did it but 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact313	885.875	892.565	D	Professor	s	+1	0	it but what about for these these issues of summer as a nation a lot of these higher level things you don't really need a distant microphone 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact314	893.77	894.0	F	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah really right i mean like i think 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact315	894.0	895.23	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	yeah really need to close microphone mean like i think there's 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact317	894.67	896.58	B	Grad	s^nd	+1	0	yeah really need to close microphone you mean mean like i think there's yeah you actually 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact316	894.511	895.181	D	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah really need to close microphone mean like i think there's 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact318	895.078	895.438	C	PhD	b	-1	0	need to close microphone there's 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact319	896.287	899.657	F	PhD	s^na	-1	0	you mean yeah yeah you don't it doesn't you just need some microphone which one did you mean yeah you actually don't really even need any fancy max fun 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact320	897.2	898.06	E	Postdoc	qw	-1	0	you don't it which one did you mean don't really even need any fancy 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact321	897.822	900.877	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	yeah yeah yeah you don't it doesn't you just need some microphone somewhere which one did you mean don't really even need any fancy max fun can you can 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact323	899.738	900.528	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah yeah yeah doesn't you just need some microphone somewhere max fun can you can 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact322	899.657	902.047	F	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah yeah yeah tape recorder doesn't you just need some microphone somewhere yeah max fun can you can use found day you you 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact325	901.372	901.892	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	tape recorder yeah use found day 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact324	901.096	901.646	C	PhD	b	-1	0	tape recorder yeah use found day 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact327	901.57	901.8	D	Professor	b	-1	0	tape recorder yeah use found day 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact326	901.543	901.903	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	tape recorder yeah use found day 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact328	902.317	902.477	C	PhD	b	-1	0	you you 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact329	902.737	903.467	F	PhD	s	-1	0	he's a microphone you you can you can you 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact330	903.368	904.238	D	Professor	s	-1	0	he's a microphone but can you can you um 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact331	903.597	903.907	F	PhD	s	-1	0	he's a microphone can you can you 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact334	904.403	905.193	B	Grad	b	-1	0	but um but i think 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact333	904.238	904.528	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	but um 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact332	903.907	909.152	F	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	he's a microphone but can you can you um but i think that any data that we spend a lot of effort to collect each person 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact335	906.725	906.955	D	Professor	b	-1	0	that any data 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact336	909.322	922.522	F	PhD	s^co	+1	0	each person who's interested in we have a because we have a bunch of different um plants and perspectives on one of these before um they need to be taking charge of making sure they're getting enough of the kind of data that they want 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact337	922.618	922.868	D	Professor	b	-1	0	want 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact338	923.47	929.78	F	PhD	s	+1	0	not enough for others right and so in my case um i think there were there's enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact339	928.918	930.148	B	Grad	s^2|s^aa	-1	0	not enough for others right projects and not enough for others and so i'm looking and thinking 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact340	930.04	936.85	F	PhD	s	-1	0	and so i'm looking and thinking well i'd be glad to walk over and record people and so forth if it's to help that and my interest in other 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact341	936.2	936.79	B	Grad	b	-1	0	and my interest in other 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact342	936.85	941.9	F	PhD	s^co	+1	0	right so that and my interest in other people need to do that for themselves uh or at least discussed that we can find some optimal 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact343	939.459	940.159	D	Professor	s^bk|s.%-	-1	0	right so that or at least discussed that we can 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact344	941.744	942.464	C	PhD	b	-1	0	but it it embrace find some optimal 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact345	942.26	949.47	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but it it embrace next i think it's relevant exactly for this idea out there that if you think about well gee we have this really complicated setup to do well maybe you don't 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact347	950.48	950.67	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah for some maybe if if 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact348	950.67	951.27	B	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	yeah for some of it maybe if if if really all you right 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact346	950.31	961.161	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	yeah for some of it maybe if if if really all you want is to have a recording that's good enough to get a uh transcription from later you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording i mean we right 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact349	951.758	952.218	F	PhD	b	-1	0	of it if really all you want is to have a right 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact350	961.43	961.56	B	Grad	b	-1	0	i mean we 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact351	961.441	964.421	D	Professor	s^cs.%-	-1	0	i mean we we could have a fairly could it that machine and well i agree with tina though 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact352	963.26	965.93	F	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	could it that machine and well i agree with tina though on the other hand it 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact353	964.386	964.996	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and tina though 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact354	966.38	973.25	F	PhD	s	-1	0	so that maybe truth you may say for instance summer station or something that sounds very language oriented you may say well 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact355	973.25	976.64	F	PhD	s	-1	0	you may say well oh yeah you that from transcript of a radio show i mean you don't 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact356	976.64	978.02	F	PhD	s	-1	0	radio show i mean you don't even need to speak but 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact357	977.196	977.416	D	Professor	b	-1	0	even need to speak 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact358	978.57	985.78	F	PhD	s^cs.%--	-1	0	but what you what i was thinking as long term what would be needed to be able to pick up on um but 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact359	985.83	990.4	F	PhD	s	-1	0	um but he just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to be able to determine i thought accuser 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact360	990.4	991.85	F	PhD	s	-1	0	i thought accuser not going to happen so 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact362	991.961	992.191	B	Grad	b	-1	0	not going to happen so i do 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact363	992.195	992.465	D	Professor	b	-1	0	i do 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact361	991.85	1002.4	F	PhD	s	+1	0	special yep not going to happen so i do think that long term you should always try to satisfy the greatest number of of interest and have this parallel information which is really what makes this purpose powerful otherwise you 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact364	993.033	993.173	C	PhD	b	-1	0	think that long term 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact365	1001.44	1001.86	B	Grad	qy^2^d^rt	-1	0	special purpose powerful 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact366	1002.37	1002.6	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yep otherwise you 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact367	1002.45	1005.58	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	yep i i i agree uh otherwise you know lots of other states can propose this study 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact368	1002.49	1006.53	F	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	yep i i i agree uh but otherwise you know lots of other states can propose this study so 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact369	1005.67	1016.73	D	Professor	fh|s^co	+1	0	i agree uh but i i think that he uh we can't really underestimate the difficulty it's been really do understand the difficulty of getting a up like this up this study so 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact370	1016.92	1017.25	B	Grad	b	-1	0	like this up and so 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact371	1017.7	1021.6	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and so i it took quite a while to get that togetherness oh will just do it up there start 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact372	1018.18	1018.56	F	PhD	b	-1	0	i it took quite 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact373	1021.6	1026.18	D	Professor	s	+1	1	it up there start something simple you throw away a lot of these dimensions then you can do that right away talking about something 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact374	1026.4	1029.72	D	Professor	s	-1	0	talking about something that has all of these different facets we have here 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact375	1030.14	1037.53	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	it won't happen quickly it won't be easy and there's all sorts of issues about you know keeping the equipment safe or else calling it around and also to so then may we should try to 
Bmr006.F.dialogueact376	1036.59	1039.13	F	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	it around and also to i think the first priority so then may we should try to bring people here i mean that's that's 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact378	1039.11	1039.34	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	think the first priority i mean that's that's 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact377	1038.88	1042.74	D	Professor	s^na	+1	0	i think the first priority should be to get try to get people to come here we're bring people here i mean that's that's okay

Bmr006.D.dialogueact457	1141.99	1143.58	D	Professor	s	-1	0	up towards the gall are saying look you know you're going to get this is not 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact458	1143.58	1144.37	D	Professor	s	-1	0	to get this is not need and you got to go home 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact459	1144.37	1145.38	D	Professor	s	-1	0	need and you got to go home with and it's actually

Bmr006.B.dialogueact594	1350.79	1355.2	B	Grad	s	-1	0	prices and well i well what happened is that we we bought all the racks and just for mandated go for years according to days and a data go got 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact595	1355.2	1358.17	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and a data go got bought by another company and doubled their prices 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact596	1358.27	1358.33	A	PhD	s^fe	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr006.C.dialogueact597	1358.79	1359.04	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and so 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact598	1359.73	1361.6	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and so uh we're looking into other vendors we 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact599	1361.6	1363.97	B	Grad	s	-1	0	vendors we buy we of course i mean days 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact600	1361.79	1362.03	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	vendors we buy we of course 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact602	1364.24	1364.65	A	PhD	b	-1	0	so 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact601	1364.18	1364.35	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact603	1367.04	1378.32	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i was looking at the uh uh roar data and um first first look at it there were basically three directors on there that could be moved one 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact604	1378.8	1385.36	A	PhD	s	-1	0	one was called the roar one with spanish with carmen spanish stuff and the other one was um spine 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact605	1384.74	1385.26	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	um spine 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact606	1386.17	1395.01	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	and so um i wrote to dan and he was very concerned that be spine stuff was moving to a non backed up desk so 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact607	1395.67	1403.27	A	PhD	fh|s	-1	0	so um i realize that what probably not all of that treatment just c. d. rom type it uh the static data so 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact608	1403.94	1408.28	A	PhD	s	-1	0	data so i moved that and then um i ask him to check out and see if it was okay for actually 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact609	1408.47	1412.16	A	PhD	s	-1	0	for actually deleted the old stuff um i haven't heard back i told he could deleted 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact610	1412.19	1415.94	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i told he could deleted you want i haven't checked today it's if you believe it or not 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact611	1416.47	1423.71	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and then carmen stuff i realized that when i had copied all of her stuff to x. a. i had copied stuff there that was kind hammock data and 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact612	1424.04	1428.22	A	PhD	s	-1	0	so had to redo that one and just copy over the static data and so 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact613	1428.86	1431.68	A	PhD	s	-1	0	and so i need to get with her now and delete the old stuff off the desk and then i 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact614	1431.68	1433.53	A	PhD	s	-1	0	the desk and then i would have done you know the or or stuff i have to meet with 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact615	1433.53	1436.08	A	PhD	s	-1	0	or stuff i have to meet with uh stefan so 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact616	1436.12	1436.36	A	PhD	fh	-1	0	so 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact617	1436.97	1443.98	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so but uh year figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you're clearing up from the broadcast news 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact618	1444.68	1448.93	D	Professor	s	-1	0	but we have some other disk some of which are using for uh but 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact619	1448.93	1452.37	D	Professor	qy	-1	0	yep so so uh for uh but i really do have some other 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact620	1450.94	1451.23	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yep so have some other 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact621	1451.85	1457.0	B	Grad	fg|s	-1	0	so so uh we have space on the current disc right now where meeting recorder is and that's probably 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact623	1457.44	1459.33	B	Grad	s	-1	0	is that the one and that's probably not for about four meetings so 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact622	1457.21	1457.65	D	Professor	b	-1	0	and that's probably 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact625	1459.56	1461.46	A	PhD	qy^rt	-1	0	is that the one that has is that d. c. so yeah 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact624	1459.4	1459.8	D	Professor	b	-1	0	is that the one so 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact626	1459.96	1460.19	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	is that the one that has is that d. so 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact627	1461.56	1461.75	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	c. yeah 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact628	1462.12	1462.56	B	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	no no 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact629	1463.24	1465.49	B	Grad	s	-1	0	well it's wherever the meeting recorder currently as i think it's t. 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact630	1465.49	1466.31	B	Grad	s	-1	0	as i think it's t. i 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact631	1467.18	1467.46	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay but i if i don't 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact632	1467.46	1470.57	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	okay but i if i'm moving from a roars on the d. c. desk that was i don't remember i think it's 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact633	1467.75	1468.46	B	Grad	s	-1	0	okay but i if i'm moving from a roars i don't remember 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact634	1470.42	1472.58	B	Grad	s	-1	0	that was okay do you think i think it's east it's whatever that one is i just don't 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact635	1472.43	1473.03	A	PhD	s	-1	0	okay do you think one is i just don't remember it might be d. c. 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact636	1472.58	1474.26	B	Grad	s^am	-1	0	okay do you think one is i just don't remember it might be d. c. and 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact637	1473.23	1473.4	A	PhD	b	-1	0	remember it might be d. c. 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact638	1474.54	1477.46	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and that has enough room for about four meetings right now yeah i mean 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact640	1477.82	1482.05	B	Grad	s	-1	0	now yeah i mean we were at a hundred percent and we dropped down to eighty six for reasons i don't understand um someone 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact639	1477.61	1477.93	D	Professor	b	-1	0	now yeah i mean 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact641	1482.43	1484.45	B	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	um someone deleted something somewhere and so 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact642	1484.89	1486.22	B	Grad	s	-1	0	somewhere and so we have some room again and then 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact643	1486.75	1489.55	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and then with the broadcast news that's five or six more meeting so you know we have 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact644	1489.55	1490.85	B	Grad	s	-1	0	meeting so you know we have a couple of weeks 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact645	1491.78	1494.93	B	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	uh so yeah i think i think grew okay until we got the new disc 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact646	1496.65	1496.75	C	PhD	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr006.A.dialogueact647	1497.79	1508.38	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	so should um one question i have for you was um we need probably should move the or or uh and and all that other stuff off of may be recorded desk is there 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact648	1508.79	1511.8	A	PhD	qy.%-	-1	0	is there another backed up disk that you know of that we should put it onto 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact649	1511.46	1513.21	B	Grad	s	-1	0	of that we should put it onto the broadcast news one that's probably 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact650	1513.75	1518.95	B	Grad	s	-1	0	okay right like do you that's probably the best thing to do and that way we consolidate meeting recorder onto one disc rather than spreading them out 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact651	1514.41	1514.83	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	okay the best thing to do 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact652	1517.35	1517.88	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	right onto one disc rather 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact653	1518.73	1518.93	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	like do you than spreading them out 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact654	1518.93	1520.48	A	PhD	qy	-1	0	like do you know what happened with this guy than spreading them out no 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact656	1520.75	1520.92	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	guy no 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact655	1520.38	1520.55	B	Grad	s^ar	-1	0	guy no 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact657	1521.11	1523.53	B	Grad	s^no	-1	0	i often i mean i can tell you i just don't know off the top of my head 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact658	1522.14	1522.41	A	PhD	b	-1	0	don't know off the top 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact659	1522.57	1522.73	A	PhD	b	-1	0	don't know off the top 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact660	1523.57	1524.72	A	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	i often don't of my head but so we 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact661	1524.32	1529.34	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	don't but so we could just just do that at the end of today wants the archive is completed and i verified it 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact662	1529.32	1529.65	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	it 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact663	1530.66	1531.85	B	Grad	s	-1	0	so there was plenty of disk

Bmr006.B.dialogueact974	2398.33	2398.92	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	yeah so they do i i 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact975	2398.79	2403.2	D	Professor	s.%--	-1	0	yeah so they do i i mean i think the other thing i want to i mean this is i think a good thing to do to sort of look at these things at least two it i 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact976	2403.43	2405.02	D	Professor	s	-1	0	two it i i there i would do i take just 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact977	2405.48	2411.19	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	2	i take just a few features instead of taking all the messy caesar all the p. p. l. p.'s whatever i think a couple okay

Bmr006.D.dialogueact979	2412.01	2412.27	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	like like she wants 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact980	2412.27	2415.5	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	like like she wants you to something like that so that you can visualize 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact982	2416.26	2416.53	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and look at these different 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact981	2416.2	2418.91	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	and look at these different examples and look at scatter plots 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact983	2419.2	2419.39	C	PhD	b	-1	0	because it before 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact984	2419.61	2426.81	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	because it before you do build up any kind of sense a class of fires just take a look in two dimensions and how these things are split apart 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact986	2427.5	2427.89	C	PhD	b	-1	0	that i think will 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact985	2427.47	2433.11	D	Professor	s	-1	0	that i think will give you a lot of inside of what is likely to be useful feature when you put it to a more complicated crossfire the second 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact987	2433.13	2433.41	C	PhD	b	-1	0	the second 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact988	2433.89	2441.04	D	Professor	s	-1	0	the second thing is once you actually get to the point of buildings the fires what this black so far as the top rope properties so if you just looking 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact989	2441.43	2457.15	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	1	context and so if you just looking at frame of time you don't know anything about you know the structure of it overtime and so you may want to build his feel the market model of some sort uh or or else have features that really are based on um on on some bigger chunk of time i think it's a 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact990	2446.75	2447.54	C	PhD	b	-1	0	context so you may want to build his 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact991	2447.83	2448.53	B	Grad	x	-1	0	context and may want to build his feel the market 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact992	2450.44	2451.01	C	PhD	b	-1	0	uh or or else 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact993	2453.92	2454.36	C	PhD	b	-1	0	are based on um 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact994	2457.53	2458.92	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i think it's a good place to start 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact995	2459.23	2471.47	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	but don't but anyway that's my suggestion is don't just you know throw and twenty features at to deltas adult adult and all that into some classify or even even if it's scanners neighbors you still won't know what it's doing even you know center and that 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact996	2460.59	2461.36	C	PhD	b	-1	0	that's my suggestion is don't just you know

Bmr006.D.dialogueact998	2472.03	2475.85	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	uh i think to know what it is to have a better feeling for was doing you want to look at it 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact999	2476.16	2482.95	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	you want to look at at some picture that you're issue here's these things uh uh our our for some separation

Bmr006.E.dialogueact1054	2748.89	2749.05	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	i i think in any event we agreed 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1056	2752.03	2757.57	D	Professor	s^df	+1	0	because what we had before for for uh speaker changed action did not include these overlaps so 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1057	2757.99	2758.38	C	PhD	b	-1	0	so the first things to 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1058	2758.02	2761.28	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	2	the first things to to to build something else detected overlaps right 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1059	2761.51	2761.66	C	PhD	b	-1	0	right 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1060	2761.63	2761.75	D	Professor	qy^d^f^g^rt	-1	0	right 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1061	2762.39	2769.68	D	Professor	fh|s^co.%--	-1	0	jeeze so again i think the first thing to do to detect it overlaps just to look at these uh in in in in well 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1063	2768.51	2769.05	B	Grad	s^t1	-1	0	jeeze in in in in well 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1062	2768.08	2768.22	C	PhD	b	-1	0	jeeze in in in 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1064	2769.79	2773.86	D	Professor	fh|s^nd	-1	0	in well again the things you've written up there i think are way too way too big 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1065	2772.62	2772.84	C	PhD	b	-1	0	there i think are way too 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1066	2774.5	2779.34	D	Professor	s^nd	-1	0	okay sorry about say tall tall order uh have cc's or something like that's way too much you want to look 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1068	2779.83	2780.07	C	PhD	b	-1	0	much you want to look at oh you'd be 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1067	2779.34	2780.24	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	much you want to look at oh you'd be 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1069	2780.8	2783.4	D	Professor	s^ng	-1	0	at oh you'd be able to do is put into a crossfire and see how well does whereas 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1070	2783.51	2783.7	C	PhD	b	-1	0	whereas 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1071	2784.04	2797.92	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	you read enough i think if you have things if you pick one or two dimensional things or three if you ever fancy display uh and look at how the the different classes separate themselves out to have much more insight about what's going on 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1072	2797.64	2798.3	C	PhD	s^na	-1	0	you read enough about what's going on well 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1073	2798.97	2801.56	D	Professor	s	-1	0	well you'll you'll get a feeling for what's happening you know so if you look 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1075	2801.8	2802.04	C	PhD	b	-1	0	you know so if you look at suppose you 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1074	2801.56	2816.85	D	Professor	s	+1	0	you know so if you look at suppose you look at first and second order castro coefficients for some one of these kinds of things and you find that the first orders much more effective than the second you know you look at the third there's not and not too much there you may just take first second orchestral coefficients right 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1076	2811.14	2811.57	C	PhD	b	-1	0	know you look at the third 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1078	2817.22	2817.55	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and without 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1077	2816.85	2817.28	D	Professor	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	coefficients right and without 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1079	2817.28	2823.13	D	Professor	s	+1	0	and without p. c. i think i'll p. c. per se is tell you much more than and then the other maybe uh 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1080	2823.66	2839.77	D	Professor	fh|s	+1	2	uh and uh on the other hand l. p. c. residual energy and you know p. c. residual say how well uh you order l. p. c. model setting in which should be pretty poorly for two two more people speaking at the same time it should be pretty well for for for one and 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1081	2836.2	2836.41	C	PhD	b	-1	0	people speaking at the same 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1082	2838.05	2838.36	C	PhD	b	-1	0	well for for 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1084	2840.04	2840.36	C	PhD	b	-1	0	so 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1083	2839.87	2855.47	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	for one and so i again if you take a few of these things that are are are um promising features and look at them in pairs i think you have much more of a sense of okay i now have doing a bunch of these analyses i now have 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1085	2855.47	2858.17	D	Professor	s^cs^e	-1	0	i now have ten likely candidates and then you can do decision 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1086	2858.25	2861.25	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	i've and then you can do decision trees or whatever to see how they come by 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1087	2858.76	2858.93	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and then you can do decision 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1088	2860.59	2860.78	C	PhD	b	-1	0	to see how they come by 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1090	2861.95	2862.62	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i've got a question 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1089	2861.82	2862.08	C	PhD	b	-1	0	i've got a question

Bmr006.C.dialogueact1096	2871.41	2874.15	C	PhD	s	-1	0	and i would like to you know what is your opinion and it 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1097	2874.56	2887.69	C	PhD	s^cc	-1	0	very and it would be studying nipping at such moments i i would i he would paint poo poo we'd say if what i speech they they they make what i said just peachy the speech it they they make such the speech what what 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1098	2883.78	2883.96	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	they they

Bmr006.B.dialogueact1101	2887.87	2888.73	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	very mixed the speech that that makes 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1102	2888.51	2890.34	C	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	mixed that that makes makes a speech it next you

Bmr006.C.dialogueact1105	2891.63	2899.37	C	PhD	s	-1	0	right white because they're this but to stuff she's moving and it's it's pretty uh pretty much korea they flew clampitt with it p. d. a. the 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1106	2899.63	2899.89	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right d. a. the 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1107	2899.94	2903.32	C	PhD	s	-1	0	right d. a. the speech five is it it would be you d. c. caller i it's messier 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1108	2903.45	2903.73	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	caller i it's messier

Bmr006.E.dialogueact1110	2904.27	2905.81	E	Postdoc	s^bu	-1	0	if because it and they that the d. a.'s messy 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1112	2905.12	2911.56	C	PhD	s^e	-1	0	yeah because it and they know you say too is because they segment annoys the ratio in these days so a.'s messy 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1113	2909.79	2910.11	D	Professor	b	-1	0	in these days 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1114	2911.93	2913.97	B	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah i think that that's a good way to start so um i don't know 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1115	2912.01	2913.68	C	PhD	fh|s^no	-1	0	i think that that's a good way to start um i don't know 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1116	2914.2	2914.48	B	Grad	%-	-1	0	but i haven't 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1117	2914.69	2930.39	C	PhD	s	-1	0	but it'll be interesting in itself to see but i think that would i haven't no they eat that's it didn't cover sides with the with the study was days weeds and d. c. the speech i mean speech and we walk is that thirty with it it p. d. a. five 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1118	2924.99	2927.11	B	Grad	s	-1	0	it'll be interesting in itself to see and we walk is that thirty 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1120	2930.49	2932.0	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but i think that would be an interesting result five it what i i mean what what did 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1119	2930.39	2940.71	C	PhD	qw.%-	-1	0	but i think that would be an interesting result five it what i i mean what what did they say it's well they real incitement to cool police the ratio and and we well i think i think i think it's not a it's 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1121	2930.75	2932.49	D	Professor	%	-1	0	but i think that would be an interesting result five it what i i mean what what did 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1122	2938.73	2942.41	D	Professor	fg|s^aap	-1	0	and and we well i think i think i think it's not a it's not at all unreasonable it makes sense 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1123	2942.41	2944.82	D	Professor	s	-1	0	it makes sense to start with the simpler signal 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1124	2945.38	2955.2	D	Professor	s^df	-1	0	because if you have features which don't aren't even helpful in the high signal no and there's no point putting them into posten ratio one i think anyway and 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1125	2955.13	2955.32	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1126	2955.95	2977.18	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	and so if you can get uh again my prescription would be that you would with a mixed signal you would take a collection of possible uh features look at them look at how these different classes that you parked separate themselves and then collect uh in tears and i collect ten of them or something and then proceed with a bigger crossfire and you 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1127	2970.67	2970.86	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1128	2975.72	2975.99	C	PhD	b	-1	0	proceed with 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1129	2977.62	2980.81	D	Professor	s^cs	+1	0	and you can get that to work well then you go to the other signal 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1130	2981.42	2985.07	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and you and you know they won't work as well but how you know how much and then you can re 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1132	2982.1	2982.45	B	Grad	b	-1	0	you know they won't work as 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1131	2981.7	2981.97	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and you and 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1133	2985.08	2987.14	C	PhD	b	-1	0	but i i think it would be interesting and then you can re off the mines and so 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1134	2985.6	2987.32	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	but i i think it would be interesting and then you can re off the mines and so 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1135	2987.13	2989.94	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	but i i think it would be interesting to try a couple with both 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1136	2990.22	2996.55	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	because i will be interesting to see if some teachers work well with close mixed in i don't hi guys that yeah guys that's well it's it's it's 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1137	2990.37	2990.77	D	Professor	b	-1	0	because i will be 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1138	2994.91	2996.08	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	in i don't hi guys that yeah guys that's well it's it's it's 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1139	2995.62	3004.95	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	i don't guys that yeah guys but that's well it's it's it's it's true that it also it could be useful to do this exploratory analysis where you're looking at scatter plots and so on in both cases sure 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1140	2997.27	2997.5	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	but it's true that it also 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1141	3003.09	3003.47	B	Grad	b	-1	0	and so on in both 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1142	3005.21	3012.61	C	PhD	s	-1	0	i i hate they seemed it then and is it i'm at the we found into it and walk we've both and it speech five bucks it 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1143	3006.02	3006.23	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	it then and 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1144	3012.69	3022.21	C	PhD	qw	+1	0	speech five bucks it what does is it innovation know they shouldn't that four months when you you use in there and it speech fire they p. d. a. speech fives and 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1145	3016.86	3017.22	D	Professor	b	-1	0	that four months when 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1146	3022.39	3023.18	C	PhD	s^no	-1	0	and i'll watch it's i 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1147	3022.53	3022.79	D	Professor	b	-1	0	and 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1148	3023.18	3025.73	C	PhD	s	-1	0	i'll watch it's i i see need to would be time 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1149	3026.26	3036.12	C	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	because they people are it and different groups of houses and say we just kind of thrown in is that he's not p. c. and to consult because you you i i mean 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1150	3036.34	3044.13	C	PhD	s	-1	0	i i mean i've seen today and the speech fight it for on the t. v. um some by if you curvy cause you 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1151	3044.13	3047.66	C	PhD	s^df	-1	0	right yeah cause you you go see this but uh the store on 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1152	3047.02	3047.35	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yeah store on 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1154	3047.96	3049.85	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	yeah they're totally hidden store on because you squirt dog's club right 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1153	3047.91	3054.41	C	PhD	s	-1	0	yeah they're totally hidden store on because you squirt dog's club right i it is it but i meet difficulty big chain when did you go to see the well that 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1155	3048.13	3048.36	D	Professor	b	-1	0	they're totally because you squirt dog's

Bmr006.D.dialogueact1157	3053.89	3068.22	D	Professor	fg|s^cs^na	+1	2	are probably better yeah when did you go to see the i suppose yeah that i i i i that would put to that they know you it well that that that's another reason why very simple features things like energy and things things like carmen this day and residual energy are uh yeah are are better use and very complex ones because more reliable chuck chuck was 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1158	3054.78	3055.95	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	to see the i suppose that that that's another 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1159	3059.5	3060.81	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	are probably better yeah yeah that i i i things like carmen this day and

Bmr006.C.dialogueact1162	3065.31	3069.55	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	yeah was better use and very complex ones because more reliable chuck chuck was going to ask something 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1163	3068.5	3070.12	D	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah was chuck chuck was going to ask something 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1164	3069.75	3070.41	C	PhD	qy^d	-1	0	yeah was going to ask something 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1165	3070.37	3072.93	A	PhD	fg|s^bd	-1	0	this is a dumb question but 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1166	3072.93	3077.64	A	PhD	s	-1	0	is a dumb question but i thought it would be i thought would be easier if you use the p. t. a. because 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1167	3074.41	3074.76	D	Professor	s^ar	-1	0	i thought it would 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1168	3077.96	3084.33	A	PhD	qy^rt	+1	1	p. t. a. because can you couldn't use like being forming or something to detect speaker 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1169	3084.94	3085.21	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	well 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1170	3085.92	3088.72	B	Grad	s^aap	+1	0	well if you use the rae rather than signal from just one 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1171	3088.89	3089.19	A	PhD	b	-1	0	from just one but yeah no you're 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1172	3089.52	3091.15	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	but that's yeah no you're you're you're right that in fact if 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1173	3090.06	3090.44	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	that's you're you're right 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1174	3091.15	3098.28	D	Professor	s	-1	0	that in fact if we made use of the fact they're two microphones you do have some location information but we don't have with the one and 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1175	3098.72	3100.48	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	is that not allowed and and so that's

Bmr006.D.dialogueact1287	3280.6	3289.77	D	Professor	s	-1	0	okay okay so if there's too and if they're multiple people talking the lag so yeah whatever angle you are at some like corresponding to the time difference between the two there you get this boost in in in the cross correlations are auction

Bmr006.C.dialogueact1320	3317.9	3318.48	C	PhD	b	-1	0	well we did yeah differentiate so much i was just this is going 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1321	3317.96	3321.27	D	Professor	s^na.%-	-1	0	right well we did yeah we don't have a third dimension there yeah so it's differentiate so much i was just this is going to be there for actually different really very valuable

Bmr006.E.dialogueact1323	3322.81	3329.46	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yeah yeah but it's almost but it's almost i mean that's not to say i mean i i certainly think it's extremely bad we we humans depend on you know these these aren't all cute but 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1324	3327.66	3329.05	C	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah yeah but it's almost but it's almost on you know these these aren't all cute but 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1325	3328.03	3333.26	D	Professor	s	-1	0	yeah but it's almost but it's almost uh i think what you're talking about is there's two things as a sensitivity these aren't all cute but

Bmr006.B.dialogueact1327	3331.42	3337.24	B	Grad	x	-1	0	i think what you're talking about is there's two things as a sensitivity issue and then this a pathological liar this year so that the one where someone 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1328	3333.26	3336.86	D	Professor	s	-1	0	as a sensitivity issue and then this a pathological liar this year 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1329	3337.18	3340.82	D	Professor	s	-1	0	so that the one where someone is just right directly in line sort of pathological or someone yes 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1330	3339.86	3341.5	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	in line sort of pathological or someone just happens to be sitting yes yep 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1332	3341.25	3341.5	C	PhD	b	-1	0	just happens to be sitting yep 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1331	3340.82	3344.02	D	Professor	s	-1	0	or someone just happens to be sitting right there then we won't get good information from it uh yep okay and and if there so 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1333	3343.87	3344.13	E	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	information from it uh okay and and if there so 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1334	3344.13	3347.45	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	uh if they're if they're close it's just a question of the and and if there so it's just the two of you guys on the same side 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1335	3344.87	3348.92	D	Professor	s	-1	0	uh if they're if they're close it's just a question of the sensitivity and and if there so it's just the two of you guys on the same side 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1336	3348.5	3348.75	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	sensitivity 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1339	3349.56	3354.76	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	so if the sensitivity is good enough and we just we just don't have enough uh experience with it to know how yeah okay it 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1337	3349.19	3349.27	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	so if the sensitivity 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1338	3349.45	3349.68	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	so if the sensitivity 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1340	3354.06	3354.94	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	know how yeah okay it 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1341	3354.56	3354.78	B	Grad	fg	-1	0	know how yeah okay it 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1342	3354.61	3354.97	C	PhD	b	-1	0	know how yeah okay it 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1343	3355.16	3363.74	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	and i think dan is still working on it so he actually oh i'm not i'm not trying to argue against using it by any means i just wanted to point out that that weakness that it's top top logically impossible to get a perfect everybody 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1344	3355.78	3356.22	D	Professor	b	-1	0	oh i'm not i'm not trying to argue against using

Bmr006.B.dialogueact1347	3362.39	3366.21	B	Grad	fh|s	-1	0	so he actually he wrote me about it a little bit so to get a perfect everybody great no 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1348	3366.21	3366.44	B	Grad	fh	-1	0	so great no 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1349	3366.52	3366.81	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	so great no 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1350	3366.92	3368.35	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	so i mean the other thing you can do great no i i don't mean just for show 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1351	3367.75	3375.01	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i mean the other thing you can do that if i mean we're assuming that it would be a big deal just to get somebody could somebody to put to two microphones in the p. d. a. but he had put a i i don't mean just for show 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1352	3375.36	3382.1	D	Professor	s^cs.%-	-1	0	what you got to what about just but he had put a third in you could put in the other access and then you know any sort of yeah and they pretty much cover 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1353	3378.48	3379.23	A	PhD	s	-1	0	what you got to and then you know any sort of 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1354	3379.14	3379.53	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	sort of 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1355	3380.83	3381.24	C	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah and they pretty much cover 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1356	3382.38	3384.25	A	PhD	qw	-1	0	what about just doing it from these like yeah 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1357	3382.76	3383.1	E	Postdoc	s^ba	-1	0	what about just doing it from these like 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1358	3384.77	3385.2	A	PhD	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	yeah it would be 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1359	3385.02	3385.22	C	PhD	b	-1	0	it would be 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1360	3385.52	3385.72	B	Grad	b	-1	0	it would be 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1361	3385.71	3390.55	C	PhD	s	-1	0	it would be more interesting to study the p. c. n. because they they stipulation vacation seem 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1362	3388.38	3396.47	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and they're much broader yeah we can n. because they they stipulation vacation seem but but that's i mean what we can watch all of this is their first study 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1363	3392.06	3393.05	B	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	and they're much broader i mean what 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1364	3396.35	3397.98	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	yeah we can do whatever we want study 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1365	3396.46	3396.83	C	PhD	b	-1	0	yeah we can study 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1366	3397.18	3408.17	D	Professor	s	+1	0	that's what i that's not do whatever we want or but but the thing is uh one at least one of the things i was hoping to get it was is is what can we do we what we think would be the normal situations and people get together and one of them has 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1367	3399.27	3400.49	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	or the thing is uh one at least one of

Bmr006.D.dialogueact1494	3618.85	3619.32	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	what i'm asking and i think in on 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1495	3619.3	3627.62	E	Postdoc	s^cs^nd	-1	0	look it's and i think in on the station if you if you want to pursue that now i just think that that's that's a discussion which also really deserves a lot you know more than just a minute i really do 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1496	3625.38	3626.19	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	look it's deserves a lot you know more than 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1498	3627.79	3628.22	B	Grad	b	-1	0	just a minute i really do think that because you raise a 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1497	3627.62	3628.46	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	just a minute i really do think that because you raise a 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1499	3628.46	3630.33	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	think that because you raise a couple of possibilities yourself you and i discussed 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1500	3630.56	3632.04	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you and i discussed it previously and they're 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1501	3632.5	3635.93	E	Postdoc	s^cs.%-	-1	0	and we're we're just and they're different ways of people approach it it and i think we should 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1502	3635.1	3635.33	B	Grad	b	-1	0	and we're we're just i think we should

Bmr006.E.dialogueact1504	3641.8	3642.42	E	Postdoc	fg	-1	0	to do it going in dealing well okay 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1505	3642.41	3643.45	B	Grad	s	-1	0	going in dealing with it okay it's just ever

Bmr006.E.dialogueact1507	3644.02	3646.31	E	Postdoc	s^cc^df	-1	0	came i i'll give you the short version but i do think 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1508	3646.37	3649.52	E	Postdoc	s^nd	-1	0	but i do think that it's an issue that we can't result in five minutes okay 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1509	3649.36	3649.75	B	Grad	b	-1	0	minutes okay 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1510	3649.95	3657.82	E	Postdoc	h|s	-1	0	minutes okay so they it be short thing is um we have uh tape recording i'm sorry digitize degree according those 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1511	3657.98	3659.51	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	according those we won't be able to change if someone says 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1512	3659.51	3661.59	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	right to change if someone says hey roger so and so so that's going

Bmr006.E.dialogueact1516	3663.66	3665.3	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	now in terms of like the transcript the question 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1517	3665.58	3669.12	E	Postdoc	qw	+1	2	the question becomes what symbol are you going to put in there for it everybody's name and whether you're going

Bmr006.E.dialogueact1554	3818.17	3824.85	E	Postdoc	s	+1	2	yeah once now be very possible for me to take those data put them in a in a study and just change everybody's name for the purpose of the publication and someone 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1555	3824.85	3825.68	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	yeah once you get to the publication of the publication and someone who looked 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1556	3827.18	3830.15	D	Professor	s^e	-1	0	you can you know uh the uh for instance uh yeah exactly doesn't matter 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1557	3829.32	3830.14	E	Postdoc	s^aa	-1	0	uh for instance uh yeah exactly doesn't matter 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1558	3830.26	3830.8	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	uh doesn't matter 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1559	3830.82	3835.83	D	Professor	fh|s^bd	-1	0	uh um yeah i mean i doesn't i mean i'm not knowledgeable about this uh certainly doesn't matter the same 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1561	3835.83	3839.7	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	knowledgeable about this uh certainly does bother me to have someone first name in in the in the transcript uh the same thing so 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1560	3835.81	3836.61	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	knowledgeable about this uh certainly does bother me to have the same thing so 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1562	3836.92	3837.13	B	Grad	b	-1	0	does bother me to have someone first name in thing so 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1563	3837.12	3837.79	B	Grad	x	-1	0	someone first name in 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1564	3839.84	3843.79	D	Professor	fh|s^cs	-1	0	transcript uh i think you don't they're filming to be yeah and and 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1565	3843.23	3848.28	E	Postdoc	s^aa|s^df	-1	0	well yeah and and in the form that they signed it does say your first name may arise the course the meetings 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1567	3844.04	3844.54	B	Grad	b	-1	0	in the form that they signed 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1566	3843.79	3844.53	D	Professor	%--	-1	0	yeah and and in the form that they signed

Bmr006.D.dialogueact1569	3848.74	3849.01	D	Professor	b	-1	0	so again it the or your name 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1570	3849.47	3858.88	D	Professor	s^bu	+1	0	so again it the issue is if you're tracking discourse things if someone says uh uh frank said this and then you want to connected to something later you've got to have this part where that's prank call or your name 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1571	3849.54	3850.21	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	so again it the issue is if you're tracking or your name 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1572	3853.96	3854.58	B	Grad	s^fe^t1	-1	0	uh frank said this and then you 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1573	3859.1	3859.35	D	Professor	qy^d^g^rt	-1	0	yeah and and 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1574	3859.4	3873.58	E	Postdoc	s	+1	0	yeah and and you know even more he uh immediate than that just being able to uh well it just seems like to track track from one daughter in et cetera two speaking and who's speaking to home because that can be importance 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1575	3873.48	3873.82	B	Grad	b	-1	0	be importance 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1576	3873.58	3878.59	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	like i'm thinking be importance you know you raised the point so on so it's kind of nice to yeah well who u. s. and i and 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1578	3877.17	3877.79	B	Grad	s^fe^t1	-1	0	yeah well 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1577	3876.72	3876.92	D	Professor	b	-1	0	of nice to 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1579	3878.56	3879.66	B	Grad	s	-1	0	like i'm thinking too much who u. s. and i and actually remember 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1580	3878.59	3884.73	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	like i'm thinking too much who u. s. and i and actually remember for them remember last time we had this discussion of how you know i was sort of avoiding mention people's names 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1581	3884.9	3885.87	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	names and and it was 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1582	3885.29	3888.37	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and and it was and we made the decision that was kind of artificial well i mean for going 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1583	3888.37	3893.75	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	well i mean for going to step in after the fact and change people's names and transferred we've basically done something wants to worse 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1584	3893.51	3893.72	B	Grad	b	-1	0	to worse 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1587	3894.54	3897.1	B	Grad	s^nd	+1	0	well i was sick i i don't want to change the name in the transcript but that's because i'm focus leaving 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1586	3894.52	3894.89	C	PhD	b	-1	0	well i was sick 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1585	3894.33	3894.73	D	Professor	b	-1	0	well i was sick 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1589	3897.1	3902.89	B	Grad	s^df	+1	0	but that's because i'm focus so much on the acoustic six instead of on the discourse and so i think it's a really good point 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1588	3896.68	3897.18	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	change the name in the transcript but that's because i'm focus leaving 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1590	3900.1	3900.66	D	Professor	b	-1	0	instead of on the discourse 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1591	3903.51	3905.16	B	Grad	s^aa|s^na	+1	1	you're right this is going to require more thought 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1592	3905.53	3905.74	D	Professor	b	-1	0	{vocalsound}
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1593	3906.09	3911.23	D	Professor	s^cs^t^tc	-1	0	they just back at this to make a brief comment about thee uh the what we're covering in a meeting i realize they're doing 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1594	3911.23	3916.17	D	Professor	s	-1	0	i realize they're doing is that uh i didn't realize that you had a bunch of things if you want to talk about uh 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1595	3916.66	3922.45	D	Professor	fh|s	-1	0	uh and so uh and so i was proceeding some somewhat a random frankly so 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1596	3922.84	3940.87	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	frankly so i think what would be helpful would be uh it and now i'm to was men dressed too that um before the meeting if anybody could send me any any uh uh agenda items that they were interested in and i'll i'll take the role of organizing uh into the into the agenda okay 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1597	3935.86	3936.18	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	that they were interested in and okay 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1598	3936.96	3937.14	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	in and i'll i'll take 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1599	3941.14	3945.15	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	but i'd be very pleased to have everyone else completely make up the agenda notice i heard 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1600	3945.15	3947.01	D	Professor	s	-1	0	notice i heard to make it up but if if no 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1601	3947.01	3962.15	D	Professor	s^fa	-1	0	how would if if no told me things and i'm just proceeding from my guess is in and uh and uh abs sorry ended up with your sure i am just always asking jose what he's doing you know and so it's that this uh the other things going on always something from my yeah i just i just couldn't do ten minutes 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1602	3953.6	3954.25	B	Grad	b	-1	0	sorry ended up with your sure always something from my 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1603	3953.65	3955.27	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	sorry ended up with your sure always something from my yeah

Bmr006.B.dialogueact1605	3962.49	3968.49	B	Grad	qw^tc	+1	0	how would how would the person who doing the transcript even know who they're talking about 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1606	3970.35	3971.2	B	Grad	qy^f^rt	-1	0	the person who's do you know what i'm saying 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1607	3971.42	3973.49	A	PhD	qy^bu^d^rt	-1	0	the person who's doing the transfer debbie and people 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1608	3973.97	3974.21	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	and people mean 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1609	3974.96	3978.25	B	Grad	qw	+1	0	mean so so how was that information going to get labeled anyway how do you mean what 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1610	3978.36	3980.17	E	Postdoc	qw^bu	-1	0	me so if i'm saying how do you mean what they're they're talking about 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1612	3980.34	3984.62	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	me so if i'm saying in a meeting oh when bob by the way wanted wanted to do so and so 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1611	3980.25	3981.15	E	Postdoc	qw^r	-1	0	me so if i'm saying in a meeting oh when 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1613	3986.81	3988.27	A	PhD	s.%--	-1	0	they're just going to rise bob wanted is if you're doing you you're just going 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1614	3987.11	3987.67	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	going to rise bob wanted if you're doing 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1615	3988.33	3989.82	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	is you you're just going right dog 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1616	3990.19	3995.71	B	Grad	s.%-	-1	0	and so if you were if you're doing discourse analysis how am i they won't be able to to themselves 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1617	3990.93	3992.22	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	and so if you were they won't be able to to themselves 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1618	3995.69	3997.38	D	Professor	qw	-1	0	yeah really how am i going to do any of this well i'm 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1620	3997.72	3998.2	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	yeah really this well i'm i'm betting we're going to have 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1619	3997.68	4002.74	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yeah really this i mean they're going to say speaker the well i'm i'm betting we're going to have huge chunks that are just totally on i'm transcribe by him 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1621	4001.6	4004.79	D	Professor	s^bu.%-	-1	0	well i mean they're going to say speaker the secret to tuesday i mean i i'm transcribe by him 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1625	4005.2	4006.12	A	PhD	s^nd	-1	0	they can't do that the current ones they don't do speaker identity 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1623	4004.89	4006.42	C	PhD	fg|%-	-1	0	they can't do that well the current ones they don't do speaker identity i mean i 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1622	4004.89	4007.27	B	Grad	s	+1	1	they can't do that well the current ones they don't do speaker identity because i mean i 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1624	4004.9	4005.22	C	PhD	x	-1	0	they can't do that well the current ones they don't i mean i 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1626	4007.82	4012.1	B	Grad	s	+1	0	because they naturally speaking or excuse me and via voice it's only one person and so 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1627	4012.87	4016.81	B	Grad	s	+1	1	and so in their current conventions there are no multiple speaker conventions so 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1628	4016.77	4019.91	D	Professor	s	-1	0	conventions so it may just be one long transcript of a bunch of words oh i think 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1630	4018.91	4019.08	B	Grad	s^aa	-1	0	long transcript of a bunch of words oh i think 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1629	4018.78	4021.29	E	Postdoc	fg|s.%--	-1	0	long transcript of a bunch of words oh i think that my understanding from in is inching 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1631	4021.79	4022.37	E	Postdoc	qy^rt	-1	0	from in is inching sequencing 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1632	4022.37	4023.31	E	Postdoc	qy	-1	0	uh sequencing uh you 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1633	4023.5	4025.77	D	Professor	s^bc^nd	-1	0	you should uh just teaching yeah uh you you chain you take was that um 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1634	4023.54	4024.07	E	Postdoc	qy^bu^d	-1	0	you uh just teaching uh you you chain you take 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1635	4024.07	4025.06	E	Postdoc	qy^bu^d	-1	0	you should just teaching yeah you chain you take was that um 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1636	4024.69	4025.89	B	Grad	s^bc^na	-1	0	you should just teaching yeah you chain you take was that um 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1637	4025.41	4033.0	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	should yeah was that um they will that they will adopt the part of the conventions that that we discussed where they put speaker died in a fire down but you know how 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1638	4033.31	4035.51	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but you know how they won't know these people so i think 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1639	4035.51	4038.0	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	people so i think it's what else they'll dobson convention but we haven't specified 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1640	4038.0	4039.65	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	but we haven't specified to them so they'll do 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1641	4039.65	4041.98	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	to them so they'll do something like speaker once because like 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1642	4041.98	4046.07	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	once because like that but i'm betting they'll be huge variations in the accuracy of of their labeling speakers will have to review the transcript 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1643	4046.07	4048.05	E	Postdoc	s^co	-1	0	and it and it may will have to review the transcript in any case 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1644	4047.99	4061.33	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and it and it may very well be i mean since they're not going to sit there and and and worry about about uh being the same speaker they may very well go the uh the first uh the first time it changes to another speaker they'll be secret to the next in any case 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1645	4055.31	4055.61	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	they may 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1646	4061.33	4064.54	D	Professor	s	-1	0	to the next time it'll be speaker three even if it's actually speaker one that would be 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1647	4061.6	4061.84	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	to the next 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1648	4061.84	4062.25	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	to the next time it'll be speaker three 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1649	4064.49	4066.69	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	you one that would be a very practical solution on their part and 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1650	4066.8	4067.37	C	PhD	b	-1	0	you really on their part and and but then we would need 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1653	4067.37	4067.98	C	PhD	s^ba	-1	0	really and but then we would need 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1652	4067.04	4067.45	D	Professor	b	-1	0	really and but then we would need 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1651	4066.91	4068.62	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yeah we you really good on their part and and but then we would need to label it that's 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1655	4068.81	4072.2	B	Grad	s	-1	0	yeah we we could probably regenerate pretty easily from the close talking mikes good you know to label it that's yes i was thinking that attempt 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1656	4068.87	4069.78	C	PhD	fg|%-	-1	0	yeah we we could probably regenerate good you know to label it that's 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1654	4068.62	4069.68	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	yeah we we could probably regenerate good you know to label it that's 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1657	4069.25	4069.46	C	PhD	x	-1	0	we could probably regenerate you know 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1658	4071.83	4074.96	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	the close talking mikes so but i mean that doesn't yes i was thinking that attempt the time values of when it changes 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1659	4072.7	4073.2	C	PhD	b	-1	0	so but i mean i was thinking that attempt the time values 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1660	4072.79	4073.58	D	Professor	b	-1	0	so but i mean i was thinking that attempt the time values 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1661	4073.38	4077.81	B	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	so but i mean that doesn't this doesn't answer the question the time values of when it changes very efficient 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1662	4073.75	4074.32	C	PhD	b	-1	0	so but i mean that doesn't the time values of when it changes 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1663	4075.74	4075.97	D	Professor	s.%-	-1	0	very 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1664	4075.78	4076.74	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	this doesn't answer the very efficient 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1665	4078.61	4081.31	B	Grad	s	-1	0	that that's a good point which what do you do for discourse tracking because you don't know to to know and and 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1666	4079.53	4088.73	C	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	good point which what do you do for discourse tracking for work because you don't know to to know and and you need to know what can cookies they hadn't identification of the you know just because you want to be to want to know well 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1667	4082.34	4082.77	B	Grad	b	-1	0	you need to know 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1668	4088.06	4091.02	B	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	for work who sticks you don't but for discourse you do to know hopefully well you do yeah

Bmr006.C.dialogueact1670	4091.26	4093.46	C	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	hopefully yeah if if if if someone 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1671	4091.98	4092.35	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	hopefully yeah if if 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1672	4092.45	4100.52	D	Professor	s^na	-1	0	yeah if if if if someone says uh what what is jose doing and then jose says something you need to know that that was jose responding 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1673	4094.51	4094.87	C	PhD	b	-1	0	says uh

Bmr006.E.dialogueact1684	4112.69	4131.54	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	well people are very flexible you know me so when we did this last last week i felt that you know no andreas may uh he he he sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they miss sentence or something and and because he missed something then he missed of the initial introduction of who are talking about and was was unable to do the tracking but i felt like 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1685	4129.86	4130.3	A	PhD	b	-1	0	talking about and was was unable to do 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1686	4131.54	4136.51	E	Postdoc	s^df	-1	0	the tracking but i felt like most of us were doing the tracking i knew who are talking about and we just weren't mentioning names so 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1687	4136.51	4138.31	E	Postdoc	s^bs	-1	0	but you know like names so people are really flexible 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1688	4137.15	4137.49	C	PhD	b	-1	0	people are really flexible 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1689	4138.25	4147.14	A	PhD	fg|s	-1	0	but you know like to be of this meeting or you i think said you know or something liz said something about um uh is marg and use the equipment i mean how yeah 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1691	4147.74	4148.94	A	PhD	qw^ng	-1	0	i mean how would you say that yeah 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1690	4147.72	4148.1	E	Postdoc	s^bk	-1	0	i mean how would you say that yeah 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1692	4150.23	4154.56	A	PhD	s^df^ng.%-	-1	0	so you have to really think you know i'm about what you're saying you want to anonymous as you know who 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1693	4150.3	4151.66	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	so you have to really think you want to anonymous 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1694	4152.95	4161.39	C	PhD	%-	-1	0	you know i'm about what you're saying yeah yeah i think it would be really hard if we made a policy sing @reject@ plus yeah time it was going to say is that the other option as you know who up and you know where are you well 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1695	4154.29	4156.22	D	Professor	qy	-1	0	yeah yeah as you know who up and you know where are you

Bmr006.A.dialogueact1699	4157.96	4163.34	A	PhD	s	-1	0	i think it would be really hard if we made a policy sing @reject@ plus we'd have to tell everybody else yeah time it was going to say is that the other option is that we can bleep out the names well 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1700	4159.6	4160.09	B	Grad	s^fe	-1	0	if we made a policy sing @reject@ yeah time it was going to say

Bmr006.E.dialogueact1702	4161.1	4161.59	E	Postdoc	s.%-	-1	0	plus is that the other option well 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1703	4163.07	4163.5	C	PhD	b	-1	0	else the names 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1704	4164.4	4166.91	B	Grad	s	-1	0	but then again that kills your discourse analysis so 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1705	4165.99	4166.43	A	PhD	s^aa	-1	0	that kills your discourse analysis so 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1706	4166.25	4166.67	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	analysis so

Bmr006.A.dialogueact1713	4168.89	4181.92	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	i i think you i think i don't know my own two cents worth is that you don't do anything about what's in the recordings you only in on my eyes so do you think you cam speakers of signed up for it i well that that that that is said that that works that's that's 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1712	4168.52	4169.35	E	Postdoc	s^na	-1	0	i i think you i think that's that's 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1714	4180.28	4186.15	B	Grad	s^aap	-1	0	speakers of signed up for it i well that that that that is said that that works great for the two sticks but it it hurts you a lot for trying to do discourse yeah 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1715	4181.57	4181.84	E	Postdoc	%	-1	0	up for it i is said that that works 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1718	4186.57	4186.77	A	PhD	qw^rt	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1716	4186.08	4186.43	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	yeah 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1720	4187.2	4192.96	B	Grad	s^df	-1	0	i thought we were going to get labeled speaker because you don't have a map of who's talking versus their name that they're being referred to 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1719	4186.76	4187.0	C	PhD	b	-1	0	because you don't have a map yeah

Bmr006.A.dialogueact1725	4196.79	4197.84	A	PhD	qw	-1	0	what you have to know his okay speaker one then okay so 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1726	4197.71	4204.3	D	Professor	fg|s	-1	0	have to know his okay okay so suppose someone says well i don't know if i really heard what uh what jose set

Bmr006.C.dialogueact1728	4205.04	4205.54	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and then jose 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1729	4205.14	4207.39	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and then jose response and part 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1730	4207.53	4207.86	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and part 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1731	4207.63	4210.91	D	Professor	s	-1	0	and part of your learning about the dialogue is jose responding to it but 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1732	4210.91	4213.2	D	Professor	s	-1	0	responding to it but it doesn't say jose it's says speaker five 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1733	4214.02	4214.33	A	PhD	s^bk	-1	0	so 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1734	4214.16	4214.38	C	PhD	b	-1	0	so 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1736	4214.86	4215.08	C	PhD	b	-1	0	so uh 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1735	4214.71	4216.84	D	Professor	fh	-1	0	what do you so uh 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1737	4216.54	4222.39	A	PhD	s^bk|s^bs	-1	0	what do you want to associate the word jose in the dialogue with the fact that then he responded right 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1738	4222.43	4222.8	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	right 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1740	4223.31	4225.15	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	someone who's doing discourse would want to do that and so if we pass out the data to someone 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1739	4223.26	4232.02	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	someone who's doing discourse would want to do that and that violates and so if we pass out the data to someone else and it says speaker five there we also have to pass in this little guy that says speaker five is jose in if we're going to do that we 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1742	4232.12	4233.92	B	Grad	s^ng	-1	0	and that violates our privacy if we're going to do that we might as well give them 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1741	4232.02	4235.05	D	Professor	s^cs	-1	0	and that violates our privacy and that violates if we're going to do that we might as well give them as i say but those are yeah 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1743	4232.65	4233.1	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and that violates our privacy if we're going to do that we might as well give them 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1744	4234.51	4234.92	C	PhD	b	-1	0	as i say but those are 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1746	4235.6	4237.35	B	Grad	s^na^r	-1	0	and that violates their privacy issue yeah now i i think that 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1747	4235.8	4236.17	C	PhD	b	-1	0	and that violates their privacy issue yeah 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1745	4235.57	4235.94	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	and that violates yeah 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1748	4235.94	4236.2	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	and that violates their privacy issue yeah 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1749	4236.91	4237.4	C	PhD	b	-1	0	their privacy issue now i i think that 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1750	4237.15	4244.14	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	now i i think that we have these two phases in the in the data which is the one which is are used university washes use to i b. m. sri and within that 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1751	4239.7	4240.01	D	Professor	b	-1	0	in the in the data which is the one 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1752	4244.5	4254.7	E	Postdoc	s^cs	+1	2	and within that it maybe be it's sufficient to not uh change the two not to incorporate anonymous station yet but always always in the publications we have to 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1753	4251.44	4252.15	B	Grad	b	-1	0	yet but always 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1754	4255.03	4259.07	E	Postdoc	s^co	-1	0	and i think also when we take it that next step and distribute to the world we have to but but i don't 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1755	4259.35	4264.78	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	making some decisions but but i don't but that's that's a long way from now and and it's matter between now and then uh disarming have 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1756	4264.1	4265.14	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	making some decisions uh disarming have it you 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1757	4265.37	4274.25	E	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	for the public one you know what we could it you know maybe's that we will need to do something like actually x. out that part of the uh the audio and just put in brackets speaker one you know 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1758	4268.39	4268.66	B	Grad	b	-1	0	like actually 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1759	4270.62	4271.52	B	Grad	s^2	-1	0	for the public one of the uh the audio 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1760	4271.63	4272.0	C	PhD	x	-1	0	one the audio and just put 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1763	4274.49	4277.22	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	you know what we could do also is have more than one version of release one that's public you know 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1762	4274.48	4274.96	C	PhD	b	-1	0	you know what we could you know 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1761	4274.41	4274.87	E	Postdoc	qy^d^f^g	-1	0	you know what we could you know 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1764	4277.22	4280.44	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	one that's public and one one that requires licensing 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1765	4281.11	4284.75	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	so the license one would we we could they would be a sticky limitation 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1766	4283.73	4284.29	E	Postdoc	b	-1	0	they would be a sticky limitation 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1767	4285.58	4286.08	B	Grad	s.%--	-1	0	you know like well we can i think that's risky 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1769	4286.69	4287.83	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	well we can talk about that later i think that's risky i think that the public should 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1768	4286.33	4288.82	E	Postdoc	s^nd	-1	0	well we can talk about that later i think that's risky i think that the public should be the same i 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1770	4288.91	4291.41	E	Postdoc	s^cs^nd	-1	0	i be the same i think that when we do that world release it should be the same 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1771	4289.55	4290.76	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	think that when we do that world release it should be the 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1772	4291.94	4293.15	D	Professor	s^aa	-1	0	i i agree with saying and i i think that we same for a bunch of reasons legal 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1773	4292.41	4293.82	E	Postdoc	s	-1	0	i agree with saying and i i think that we for a bunch of reasons legal 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1774	4293.15	4298.39	D	Professor	s^cs^na.%-	+1	0	well and i i think that we we have a need to have a consistent licensing policy of some sort legal but i also think it because it's a licensing 
Bmr006.E.dialogueact1775	4297.26	4299.73	E	Postdoc	s^cs	-1	0	well one thing to to take but i also think it because it's a licensing is 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1777	4298.85	4309.47	A	PhD	s^cs	-1	0	well one thing to to take into consideration is are there any um for example the people who are funding this work they want this work to get out useful for discourse if we all of it's a licensing is 
Bmr006.C.dialogueact1776	4298.75	4299.4	C	PhD	b	-1	0	well one thing to to take it's a licensing is 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1778	4309.47	4313.32	A	PhD	s	-1	0	if we all of sudden do this and then released to the public and it's no longer useful for discourse 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1779	4314.3	4314.72	A	PhD	qy^d^g	-1	0	well depending on 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1780	4314.41	4318.47	B	Grad	s^arp	-1	0	well depending on how much editing we do you might be able to still have a useful 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1781	4319.11	4321.02	B	Grad	s^e	-1	0	because for discourse you don't need the audio right 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1782	4321.99	4322.12	B	Grad	qy^d^g	-1	0	right you could bleep out the 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1783	4322.12	4324.03	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	you could bleep out the names and the audio and you see it on 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1784	4324.28	4324.67	A	PhD	b	-1	0	and you see it on 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1785	4324.42	4326.52	B	Grad	s^cs	-1	0	but if and you see it on a much wanted a transcript excuse me we 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1788	4326.88	4327.79	A	PhD	s.%-	-1	0	but if you really close excuse me we we do need audio for discourse 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1787	4326.75	4327.7	D	Professor	b	-1	0	but if you really close excuse me we we do need audio for discourse

Bmr006.B.dialogueact1789	4329.48	4331.93	B	Grad	s^aap^df	-1	0	but an excuse me but you complete out just the names 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1790	4329.49	4329.72	D	Professor	x	-1	0	but an excuse 
Bmr006.D.dialogueact1791	4332.08	4340.43	D	Professor	s^bs^nd	-1	0	right but in the transcript you could no but she's saying from york right before she wants to be able to if someone said jose in their in their thing and then connects up to what he said later then you need it 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1792	4338.82	4339.14	B	Grad	s^bk	-1	0	right but in the transcript up to what he said later then you need 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1793	4339.61	4346.73	B	Grad	s^cs^df	-1	0	but in the transcript you could say everywhere they said jose that you could replace it with speaker seven what he said later then you need it

Bmr006.D.dialogueact1796	4349.74	4350.22	D	Professor	s^bk^r	-1	0	and then it wouldn't meet yeah but i i also want to say that people

Bmr006.B.dialogueact1836	4421.22	4425.33	B	Grad	qy	-1	0	did you read the paper a few years ago where they were reversing the syllables mister blue 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1837	4426.3	4429.1	B	Grad	s	-1	0	they were did they they had uh tighter and says and they would extract 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1838	4429.35	4432.28	B	Grad	s	-1	0	and they would extract out the syllables and they would play them backwards 
Bmr006.A.dialogueact1839	4434.61	4438.74	A	PhD	s^bu.%-	-1	0	but so the syllables we're in the same order with respect each other but they could everything was in the store but they were the individual sable sills 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1840	4436.56	4440.2	B	Grad	s^na	-1	0	order with respect each other but they could everything was in the store but they were the individual sable sills were played backwards and you could listen 
Bmr006.B.dialogueact1841	4440.52	4442.45	B	Grad	s	-1	0	to it when i found out and you could listen to it and it would sound the same
