The group have been comparing their recognition system to a few others , and theirs has not come off favourably.
There could be many reasons for this , including smaller training set , more realistic data , or older technology.
Speaker mn007 has put the best voice activity detector into the system , to great improvements along with designing new filters that run at the correct latency.
Speaker fn002 has started to find parameters for voiced/unvoiced feature detection , and has found some classic ones , although there are other things she wishes to look at.
Me013 offers a few ideas of simple things she may want to try , as he is not confident with everything she is trying.
Speaker me006 is continuing with the idea of extending work on acoustic feature detection.
He is continuing to read , and has discussed the suitability of factorial HMMs with a colleague.
Speaker me026 has been learning more about previous work on reverberation , and is ready to start with a re-implementation of the theory.
From there he wants to extend the work to look at time-varying reverb.
