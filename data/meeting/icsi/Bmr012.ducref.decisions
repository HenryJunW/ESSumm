Following close-talking microphone recognition procedures , it was decided that data from the far-field microphones ( or PZMs ) should be tested on the recognizer as soon as possible.
Speaker mn017 will compare close-talking microphone recognition results with those obtained for downsampled data.
The SRI recognizer will be set up at ICSI to enable researchers to run their own variants.
The group decided to purchase one additional head-mounted crown microphone.
A tentative decision was also made to acquire a hand-held wireless microphone to pass around to additional meeting participants should the installation of more close-talking microphones prove too difficult.
The suggestion of incorporating the use of cross pads during meeting recordings received favorable comments from participants.
It was also tentatively decided to elicit meeting data from members of the transcriber pool discussing the Meeting Recorder corpus.
