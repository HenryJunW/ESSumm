The Berkley Meeting Recorder project is well underway , and this meeting discusses the progress and ongoing issues.
A pressing concern for the group is the DARPA meeting in July , which is only a short time away , and for which they would like to have some progress.
Specifically , the group would like to have transcripts available , which would mean resolving legal issues for data use and on the basis of feedback from IBM get more transcription underway.
Additionally they would also like to have the question answering mock-up and transcriber interface ready for then.
PLP results for the front-end look good , with the group also reporting progress in segmentation: Thilo's segmenter will now be used and ways of improving performance investigated;
The classifier segmentation is progressing well , especially in the use of prosody for identifying interruption.
Work on the front end continues , with improvements of 3-5% being made.
