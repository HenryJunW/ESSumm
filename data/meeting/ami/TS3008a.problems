4	TS3008a.dharshi.s.19	The group were not sure whether the remote control should include functions for controlling video and DVD players , or if it should only be for television.
TS3008a.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	1031.56	1049.12	D	ME	sug	+1	2	Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players , recorders .
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.112	1068.659	1070.63	B	UI	inf	+1	2	{gap} I thought it was only for television .
TS3008a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.113	1070.63	1077.76	B	UI	ass	+1	2	So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_ .
TS3008a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	1090.24	1094.18	A	PM	ass	+1	2	Yeah , but most television remote controls support other functions as well .
