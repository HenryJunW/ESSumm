Well we've made our prototype anyway .
You pass it round to have a look .
Y no , it's a slightly curved around the sides . {vocalsound}
Um , it's almost curved like up to the main display as well .
And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit {disfmarker} the panel that you pull down .
And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line .
We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top .
Cherry would be alright actually .
Yeah , and cherries are fun , summery .
For the first time , well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons .
Uh , we just chose simple shapes for all them .
Um , the important ones are the volume ones .
So we made them a bit bigger .
Hum , you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons ,
so you've got the volume in orange on design there ,
and the the channel is in blue .
And so when I done my thing on cost {vocalsound} a {disfmarker} I had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button .
so uh but there would be a cost implication on that ,
Well the colours wouldn't {disfmarker} like that's {disfmarker} they wouldn't be too important ,
but we didn't have any white Play-Doh .
Yes , we'll have the slide-away .
and {vocalsound} the bit after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance . {vocalsound} And the {vocalsound} and the cost implication .
So um , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture .
Right , so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost {disfmarker} aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in d under um uh twelve fifty or two and a half {disfmarker} uh twelve and a half Euros .
We could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype .
Okay , so , by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source , we've got a single curved case . We've got a rubber uh case materials supplements .
Okay . W the button supplements .
Well , originally , I thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple .
Well , so we've got one special button form , which was the apple .
We've got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that ,
so , I was {disfmarker} {vocalsound} originally , I was thinking {gap} rubber wasn't special ,
So you would only have the one special button that was rubber ,
whereas the rest would be hard plastic .
I thi I think I think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons {gap} made in a different material , rather than per button .
So that's nine point one there
So , that would {vocalsound} that would work out fine if uh uh as assuming your correction are are {vocalsound} {disfmarker} assuming that that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine .
I {gap} switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor .
At the moment we've just got the simple chip , which costs one .
Um , I guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ?
We should be slightly over our budget
Okay , that gives us twelve point seven
So uh maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition
Maybe um we'd be giving up on the kinetic .
i I mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries .
The the problem was the battery's running out and losing the um losing the remote .
So you gotta decide which of those is more important to them .
{vocalsound} But which do you think {disfmarker} or which do we think is the more important of the options ?
I think the voice recognition .
The other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to um make it {gap} originally , we're gonna make it a simple product .
Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first ,
and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ?
So , we've all got a note of {disfmarker} it's thirteen point seven , isn't it , with everything we want on .
But I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery .
and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated .
{vocalsound} And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven ,
So , I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end .
Um so , We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy .
Um {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} whether the product demonstrates technical innovation .
Whether it's easy to use .
Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer .
And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product .
And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently ,
So the first one is um , does the product look and feel fancy .
Okay , well we have a single curve ,
Um , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time .
Yeah , I'd maybe give it a a two .
What {disfmarker} Is one false , or is t one true ?
One's true .
So uh say about a two for fancy ,
And I mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ?
Um , {gap} deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition ,
and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition .
we've got we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we .
In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic .
The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five .
And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic .
so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors {disfmarker} speaker , you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else .
And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your uh sample sensor speaker ,
How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ?
If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough .
If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get {disfmarker} you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor ,
So it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation ,
and if we make it more innovative innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so {disfmarker}
I would go for a one on that at this point in time .
Um , incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer .
it's got the cherry and the sponginess .
Say about a three maybe ?
I woulda said two would seem reasonable .
The product is a recognisable real {disfmarker} r uh {disfmarker} reaction product ?
and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from .
{vocalsound} So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing , as well as having the logo on and all that .
But um , I think the logo would definitely be recognisable .
{vocalsound} Two .
So we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements ,
What does {disfmarker} what do all them numbers mean then ?
Do we add them up and rate {gap} or anything ?
I think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be {disfmarker}
I'm just gonna do this in my head .
One point eight isn't it or something .
So yeah , pretty close to a two .
So it's {disfmarker} I mean it's pretty good at the moment ,
but it's gonna get worse , isn't it .
Was it {disfmarker} thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if {gap} has .
Well , you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements .
So I guess this {disfmarker} Is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ?
I'm not sure .
{gap} we'll probably have to re-rate it .
If you want to keep kinetic , right , you've got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one .
You've got the sample sensor and and sample speaker , which is your big item .
Oh actually we just have a plastic case , then we lose two points ,
which gets us um {disfmarker} In {disfmarker} right within the budget range .
and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements .
Yeah , I was I was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case .
So we're going for plastic , yes ?
{vocalsound} Lose a little bit on the fashion , yeah , but {disfmarker}
Do we just have one special {disfmarker} uh {gap} special forms down here ?
You got special colour .
Well originally I was assuming we had the red apple ,
Yeah , I think we should just imagine white buttons .
{disfmarker} we've got nought point eight left ,
Well , we've got special form .
Now that would be one button ,
and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button .
'Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special {disfmarker}
I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour .
So , special colour , you want three in there .
Well I thin I think you you you just need two for the special colour
One original colour and then sort of two supplements , I think maybe .
And we've got special form {vocalsound} is the one apple .
You were making these buttons down the bottom , I was presuming , bigger than the other ones ,
the volume ones should stand out a bit .
Maybe that'll be a second supplement .
Then there's a spe a second special form .
So I think that should still be okay .
Yeah , that's twelve point three ,
So {gap} decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion
and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it ,
Yeah . So you'd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two .
so that's like if that's the new age kind of um inno innovative c type company , then um having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on {disfmarker}
So it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button , then maybe they could be {vocalsound} a different shape .
Maybe other ones could be something else shaped .
{disfmarker} And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one .
Well you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change ,
because at the moment you're making a red apple .
So next year you could make {disfmarker} next year's model the same , but have it as a a yeah whate whatever , a lemon .
{vocalsound} Yeah , I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something , maybe . {vocalsound}
we've {disfmarker} the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it ?
So maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we've lost some {disfmarker} maybe lost something on the innovation side ?
So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability , we're pretty much the same , maybe .
So , I mean we could maybe put two again on them .
And what about the sort of innovation ?
Um , well we've still got the kinetic energy . Um {disfmarker}
And the speech feature .
Whether whether that's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity , I don't know . {vocalsound}
But I think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics , but {disfmarker}
Um , apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing .
But then what colour would you make the R_s ?
Well , but you've got the company logo on there ,
which would effectively be a stick-on badge .
Did you get told what the company colour is or {disfmarker}
I'm still not quite sure we've established that .
{gap} so long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline .
So basically , even if you had a silver {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the same colour of silver on your display , because you've got effectively a double edging on the uh on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product .
we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to .
Well , in this one , you've actually got three colours of buttons .
Well , we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour .
We're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard .
Bu but but uh was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the um on the other opt you know , on the second page , as it were , that uh you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ?
I think if they were just all small round blue buttons , it'd be fine .
And then for the more functional buttons , we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like a
{disfmarker} plus it's hidden away anyway ,
I mean it's the sort of thing that , I mean , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume .
But if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning , then you're paying a bit more attention .
So it may be sort of different colour buttons isn't so important .
Shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion ,
go to a three ?
Well , but I think we said that w Because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra an extra sort of fruit um shape on one of the buttons .
well , we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something . {vocalsound}
And did we make it a cherry officially ?
Yeah .
{vocalsound} As an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we've just about achieved everything .
So do we have anything else to discuss ?
So we've done the the finance bit and the Excel project and the {disfmarker} We've done the redesign .
So we're now on to project process .
Now satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera .
I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down ,
which I will do .
Did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves {vocalsound} well enough ?
I thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary .
Well , we were finding out various things in {vocalsound} in be in-between the meetings ,
and they didn't {disfmarker} the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one , you know ,
sort of {disfmarker} we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you know , you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons ,
and I don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that .
The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would {disfmarker} normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that , you do that .
Then you go away .
You find out information .
You then come back .
You then discuss it .
{vocalsound} Whereas , this time , you're really getting it from a database source ,
what do you want to put down ?
Creativity , seemed okay .
Um um flow of information on on any given subject {disfmarker} given subject um sometimes disjointed . {vocalsound}
I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project .
I mean a remote control isn't the most um kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing .
But {gap} think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way .
I mean this one seems {gap} . From the website it looks {gap} it's quite innovative ,
It was quite good with this um {disfmarker} the white board , having that and the digital pens .
{gap} we did find a new idea ,
I mean sort of a kinetic remote control .
{gap} voice recognition , especially not {gap} could {disfmarker}
You've got voice recognition computers ,
that's not remote controls .
Yeah , so it's just like the same products , but just put together in a different way .
so how do you reckon teamwork went ?
That went okay , yeah .
I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them .
To uh go uh reasonably well .
{vocalsound} I don't think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything {disfmarker}
Bit {disfmarker} bit arbitrary . {vocalsound}
Well , I mean I don't think it {disfmarker} I just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products .
{vocalsound} So , we're m we're meant to comment on leadership and the means , E_ G_ whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera .
{vocalsound} But we can't really all fairly comment on leadership
{vocalsound} So our experience of leadership wasn't really as much as yours . {vocalsound}
I certainly didn't get this uh computer to work as well as I would have liked .
Alright uh means , so whiteboard um {disfmarker} so really , it's uh equipment . Oh .
Comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
But I mean , I d I don't {disfmarker} I'm not sure I see the value in these .
I mean , they record what you're writing ,
and then what do you do with it ?
Where do you get the recording ?
So it's not just for us ,
it's for the experiment as a whole , so {disfmarker}
New ideas found , so one or two .
Kinetic powered remote control . Um ,
Voice um recognition thing .
uh are the costs within budget ,
Uh , don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary .
I think that we've got two questionnaires
and a report on the last meeting .
