{vocalsound} Okay , let's have a look to the agenda today .
{vocalsound} So , we are going to have a meeting about the functional design .
Um so first before starting I w just going to uh to go quickly to {disfmarker} through the minutes of previous meeting .
So uh {vocalsound} basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control ,
but I have new um new i inputs for {disfmarker} about that topics .
I goin I'm going to share with you .
so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations .
But first I would like quickly to uh to decide of {disfmarker} to give a name to the project .
So , I just put d quickly Remo ,
Any ideas ?
Uh the Powerstick .
Maybe a Spanish name would work well .
Mando .
What does it mean in Spanish ?
Control .
{vocalsound} So , let's go for Mando ?
you could have the fonts you know special ,
Although you don't wanna cut uh cut women out of the uh potential buyers though ,
I I think this is more a question of of look and feel .
Something that should be addressed later
We should we should go to other {disfmarker} for the other topics .
So maybe we could start with the market , yeah .
and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls .
And also I di I did a study with {disfmarker} for the incorporation of new technologies
Well {vocalsound} {vocalsound} more {disfmarker} most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly .
So and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control ,
the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control .
So {vocalsound} {vocalsound} in my opinion the Mando {disfmarker} this Mando shouldn't be very small
So it may be interesting to to think in a {disfmarker} in both prototypes , for right and left handed people .
Well th the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person .
Well maybe it could be a universal design .
And finally , the incorporation of a L_C_D_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting ,
but I don't know if the budget would be large enough .
But most of {disfmarker} yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology .
We had the new requirements from the {disfmarker} so uh from the head offices of the company ,
and so they wanted {disfmarker} so they want to um {disfmarker} they would like to be restricted to T_V_ .
So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now
and uh finally , {vocalsound} it should be clear that the corporate image , that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product .
{vocalsound} I was still uh I was still working on this uh twenty five Euro price point
because I think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there , this is quite a low uh price
I think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult
because if you think {disfmarker} if you're watching T_V_ you're gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the T_V_ which might interfere with the {disfmarker}
it could be command control kind of thing .
It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated .
Okay so um while uh researching this this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote ,
and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on Epinions dot com , which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site .
and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant ,
well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the L_C_D_ screen
But um the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control , and it's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it ,
I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel .
because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu uh Euro ,
but one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen
this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple ,
So this is something else we might wanna consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons ,
but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons .
Um I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . Um
if I had my perfect remote control , I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way .
because w if people see a remo see the {disfmarker} see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to {disfmarker} very different build {disfmarker} very different to the traditional {disfmarker}
Um okay , so , I think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this {disfmarker} a programme driven interface rather than the channel number .
the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily .
and maybe we wanna make it something that's {vocalsound} extensible to do other tasks .
Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , I dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on ,
user i interface could be of two types ,
one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing {disfmarker} doing some he is knowing about that technology .
and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being {disfmarker} sitting on the on the remote .
but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel .
And for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote .
That increases the the cost also .
Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well {disfmarker} of such technologies is enough ?
Well wh uh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones
{vocalsound} Well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets , though ,
my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control .
I'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo {vocalsound} everyone will s will buy it .
{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Actually I'm not so sure
you know if I was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well , I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm {disfmarker} instead of pressing up on on a remote control .
we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy ,
which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big .
We should bring new technologies for young peoples ,
So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_
{vocalsound} and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies .
you say we're focusing on T_V_ , but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of of televisions ?
well , could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control ?
For twenty five Euro ? {vocalsound} I think it's impossible .
because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control ,
So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh
of increasing the unit price .
what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control ?
So what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_ ?
So you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it's up to .
so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control , if you want to browse , in addition to the T_V_ , or uh or it should be a special T_V_ connected to {disfmarker}
Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market , or what ?
we don't go for speech recognition technology .
The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion .
I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the {disfmarker} than the L_C_D_ .
I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or a {disfmarker} you know .
But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars ,
Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ?
I'm no I'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies .
Um {vocalsound} so you have to work on the component uh concept .
Uh you have to work on user interface ,
and you have to go through a trend watching .
So the question is still open about the L_C_D_ thing .
