ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	135.92	137.28	ID	B	ass	-1	0	But there we go .
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	136.58	138.21	PM	A	ass	-1	0	I'm sure it's fine .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	137.28	142.45	ID	B	inf	+1	1	Um , so I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design ,
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	142.45	144.99	ID	B	inf	-1	0	and what we actually need to do ,
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	144.99	147.87	ID	B	inf	-1	0	and what the remote control needs to do .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	147.87	156.54	ID	B	inf	-1	0	And it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	156.54	160.4	ID	B	inf	-1	0	They don't need to actually manually touch the television set .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	160.4	165.01	ID	B	inf	-1	0	So , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	166.34	167.824	ID	B	stl	-1	0	Um , from {disfmarker}
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	169.16	179.03	ID	B	inf	+1	1	Uh , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	179.03	183.18	ID	B	inf	+1	1	Um , one is the visibility in the dark ,
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	183.18	187.17	ID	B	inf	-1	0	which was um Genevieve's idea .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	187.17	191.06	ID	B	sug	-1	0	So we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	191.06	192.8	ID	B	sug	+1	1	And we could use illuminated buttons ,
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	192.8	197.77	ID	B	inf	-1	0	which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone , or um something fam familiar .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	197.77	201.98	ID	B	inf	-1	0	A automatically , um lights up at first touch .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	201.98	203.87	ID	B	sug	+1	1	Or we could use fluorescent materials
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	203.87	209.46	ID	B	inf	-1	0	which would just um take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	210.27	214.35	ID	B	sug	+1	1	Um , also we could use um an alarm .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	214.35	222.87	ID	B	inf	+1	1	So if we lost the um remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press ,
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	222.87	227.57	ID	B	inf	-1	0	and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	227.57	229.5	ID	B	inf	-1	0	Maybe behind a cushion or somewhere .

ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	229.5	231.36	ID	B	ass	-1	0	Um , so that would work .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	231.36	231.86	ID	B	stl	-1	0	Um ,
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	231.86	232.15	ID	B	oth	-1	0	oop .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	232.15	233.0	ID	B	oth	-1	0	Go back there .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	234.09	242.08	ID	B	inf	+1	2	Um , another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	242.08	256.11	ID	B	inf	+1	1	Um , from previous researches I've carried out on other projects , um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory .
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	246.67	247.936	UI	C	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}

ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	256.11	263.82	ID	B	inf	+1	1	So they can be heated and um and cooled , and they change the shape of um the metal .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	263.82	270.21	ID	B	inf	-1	0	So , for example , a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	270.63	280.13	ID	B	inf	+1	1	So um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	280.13	287.44	ID	B	inf	+1	1	So , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled ,
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	287.44	289.92	ID	B	ass	-1	0	and I think that would be very important for products now .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	289.92	296.82	ID	B	inf	-1	0	Especially 'cause there's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	296.82	297.5	ID	B	stl	-1	0	'Cause all ,
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	297.5	299.69	ID	B	inf	-1	0	we all know that our resources are being limited ,
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	299.69	302.18	ID	B	inf	-1	0	and we have to be very environmentally conscious .
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	302.27	302.77	PM	A	inf	-1	0	Right , um ,
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	302.77	303.91	PM	A	inf	-1	0	one question .
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	303.91	310.25	PM	A	el.inf	-1	0	This , um , self-destructible uh metal , it allows for recycling materials ?
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	303.6	303.95	ID	B	ass	-1	0	Yeah .
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	310.25	321.37	PM	A	el.inf	-1	0	So that , um , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ?
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	310.21	311.632	ID	B	stl	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.60	316.53	317.207	ID	B	fra	-1	0	And then {disfmarker}
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	319.74	320.28	ID	B	inf	-1	0	Yeah .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	321.62	321.87	ID	B	inf	-1	0	Yeah
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	321.87	322.8	ID	B	stl	-1	0	they would ,
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.64	322.8	328.15	ID	B	inf	-1	0	um you would make the , the product as you normally would ,
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.65	328.15	333.57	ID	B	inf	-1	0	apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.66	333.57	341.47	ID	B	inf	-1	0	And that's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	341.47	346.19	ID	B	inf	+1	1	I mean , the user would return the p product to the company ,
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	346.19	350.12	ID	B	inf	+1	1	'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	350.12	359.82	ID	B	inf	-1	0	Um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components ,
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	359.75	360.48	PM	A	bck	-1	0	Yeah .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	359.82	361.78	ID	B	inf	-1	0	and then either reuse some bits ,
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	361.78	368.73	ID	B	inf	-1	0	and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.72	368.73	375.58	ID	B	inf	-1	0	Something like the case , if it's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else .
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	373.93	374.4	PM	A	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	375.69	380.8	PM	A	el.inf	+1	1	Would we be the company that would break down these , or uh metals ?
ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	380.8	383.49	PM	A	el.inf	-1	0	Or would we contribute to another group ?
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.73	381.15	381.57	ID	B	stl	-1	0	You could {disfmarker}
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.74	381.57	388.17	ID	B	sug	-1	0	we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.75	388.17	394.02	ID	B	inf	-1	0	But it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made .

ES2015b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	395.44	395.8	PM	A	bck	-1	0	Alright .

ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	421.59	428.55	ID	B	inf	-1	0	the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they don't need to be manually de um deconstructed .
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.83	428.55	433.13	ID	B	inf	-1	0	Like , you don't have to individually um unscrew all the screws .
