Hello . Hello .
You have to put it exactly on the on the {disfmarker}
My laptop is crashing .
Uh actually my laptop doesn't work ,
Okay . I think it works .
you all read what we are going to do or not ?
We're gonna make a remote control .
I just made a a simple uh presentation .
How does this work ?
Press F_ eleven .
that's my name , {gap} .
Uh we're going to make uh a remote control ,
are we going to {disfmarker} uh this agenda of our meeting .
You know , this is about twenty five minutes , this meeting .
it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly
Uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control .
Fir the first thing is th the functional design ,
We have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design ,
The the second thing is the conceptual design ,
that's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface .
And we have to look what uh the market is doing for {disfmarker} what kind of uh remote controls are in the market .
And the third thing is uh the detailed design
it's exactly how it looks and whatever . {vocalsound}
these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one .
And you already saw {disfmarker} you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map .
what we're going to do first is um
You have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard
and um and say why it's your favourite animal .
and we have to uh use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen .
first have to show you ,
maybe you can come here to have a look how it works .
Use pen format .
and a different colour can use here {gap}
line width {vocalsound} ten .
Just draw slowly ,
because otherwise it won't work .
It's a very nice elephant , you can see .
It's a bit slow you can see ,
this is a bit annoying .
and then uh what's the colour ?
How do I do {disfmarker}
It's in format .
Just make a new blank new blank page .
let's make it um a dog .
Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back ,
I make a cat of it .
I just draw too quick I think .
I thought these pens would be just um {disfmarker} uh you write it down and you download it to Word ,
but you actually got to write on the paper .
but I d I I thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in Word ,
but it's just a picture .
it's not that cool as I th thought it would be .
Y you can you can't edit in the {disfmarker} edit it in Word .
Now we just have to save everything ,
what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros .
And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros ,
so we have to uh use a big market in Europe .
The production cost are about half the price of selling price ,
can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million ,
we're gonna have {gap} a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the {gap} and everything ,
my first question was does it have to be a {vocalsound} a universal remote control ?
that's a good question .
Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it uh apart .
Yeah , it probably would be universal .
I don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros ,
I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros
we we just say we just say that's universal remote control .
And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player
so a lot of buttons {vocalsound} on the remote control .
what what what's a remote control ,
it's just a black thing with some buttons on it ,
we can try to make it special .
{vocalsound} Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it uh it has to be clear ,
And how big should it be ?
{gap} It shouldn't be too big ,
but I don't think we can make it too small ,
We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think .
Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem .
maybe more trendy .
Fold open ,
where you can see uh more options . I think {disfmarker}
something uh on top , just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often .
O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control .
Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ?
or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small .
But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it .
And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control ,
because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken .
And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile .
You can put games on your remote control . Whatever . {vocalsound}
{vocalsound} And uh how about the batteries ?
Uh should you put it in a recharger
Ma maybe a home station .
but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think .
uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger ?
if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive ,
but I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing .
Uh if you th look at the market , it's probably {disfmarker} it's still the best way just to put batteries in it ,
because maybe it's too expensive .
but a home station is uh a really good idea ,
because uh lots of people are {disfmarker} uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is ,
Maybe uh use it as a separate option . Sell it uh separately .
and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station ,
or you can change your batteries ,
The option , just the option , that's cool .
Uh I I set something on paper already , {gap} size , looks , uh usable ,
uh the buttons on usable places ,
uh the the on off button must be on top ,
uh it has to lay good in the hand ,
does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control
uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works .
you can um have uh {vocalsound} the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see .
But the rest is uh you don't use that often ,
so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well .
And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open ,
Uh on on top are the the basic options on top ,
basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so ,
maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh
Mm . If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an {disfmarker} uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control .
So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square , just normal remote control {gap} .
Just think about it .
We have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting ,
We have uh another thirty minutes ,
so then we're going to meet again .
Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert , the user requirements uh specification , do I need to think as a user ,
I think this {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_ , a D_V_D_ player , all that things .
what's in the market ,
uh what kind of uh buttons do you have .
I already wrote some down , some ideas .
There's already a document in the folder about it .
see you in thirty minutes .
