There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only , they should ignore the teletext function , as it is dated , and , also , the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product.
The target group will be people below 30.
It transpires that customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes , especially if they include LCD screens and speech recognition.
Functions like zapping are very prevalent , as well as complaints about remotes being difficult to learn and easy to lose.
The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip , and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared.
The team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons.
They plan to include an LCD screen to display relevant information.
Other functions are served by push buttons: OK , menu , screen sizing , AV , settings buttons , mute , digits 1-9 , power , volume control , channel up/down with the last three types being prominent on the device.
The exact design and placement of the components will be decided in the next meeting.
