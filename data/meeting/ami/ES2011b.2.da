ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	172.05	177.39	ME	D	inf	+1	1	In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	179.09	183.17	ME	D	inf	+1	1	a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	183.17	186.73	ME	D	stl	-1	0	through just their habits to n know
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	186.73	190.71	ME	D	inf	-1	0	their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out .
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	190.71	197.3	ME	D	inf	-1	0	Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about .
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	197.3	202.67	ME	D	inf	+1	1	Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look ,
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	202.67	204.52	ME	D	inf	+1	1	they don't like the way they feel ,
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	204.52	208.07	ME	D	inf	+1	1	they don't think they match their operating behaviour ,
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.37	208.07	212.97	ME	D	inf	+1	1	and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons ,
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	212.97	216.22	ME	D	inf	-1	0	so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	216.22	220.02	ME	D	sug	+1	1	and I think we should design according to these buttons .
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	220.02	221.8	ME	D	inf	-1	0	Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ .
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	221.8	223.88	ME	D	inf	+1	1	I don't know what R_S_I_ means .
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	223.88	228.14	ME	D	inf	-1	0	Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue .
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	227.72	227.9	PM	A	bck	-1	0	Hm .
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	228.74	241.23	ME	D	inf	-1	0	Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance .
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	241.23	244.83	ME	D	inf	+1	1	So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection .
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	244.83	249.16	ME	D	inf	-1	0	They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour .
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	249.16	250.43	ME	D	stl	-1	0	And um
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	251.37	254.44	ME	D	inf	+1	1	yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently ,
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	254.44	256.12	ME	D	inf	-1	0	so this is the order .
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	256.12	260.1	ME	D	inf	+1	1	Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power .
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	260.1	267.14	ME	D	inf	+1	1	The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than {disfmarker} you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour ,
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	267.14	272.12	ME	D	inf	+1	1	and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings ,
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	272.12	273.11	ME	D	inf	-1	0	and then , just one ,
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	273.11	278.72	ME	D	inf	-1	0	and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television .
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	278.72	279.33	ME	D	stl	-1	0	Um ,
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	280.07	286.48	ME	D	inf	+1	1	about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that .
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	286.48	293.4	ME	D	inf	+1	1	And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds ,
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	293.4	295.34	ME	D	inf	-1	0	I don't really know how to describe this ,
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	295.34	304.5	ME	D	inf	+1	1	um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product ,
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	304.5	311.53	ME	D	inf	+1	1	while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent ,
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	311.53	317.15	ME	D	inf	-1	0	so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing .
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	317.15	322.06	ME	D	ass	-1	0	Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is ,
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	322.06	331.92	ME	D	inf	+1	1	but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely ,
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	331.92	333.63	ME	D	sug	-1	0	but we should discuss this together .

ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	458.49	462.53	UI	C	sug	-1	0	or um maybe that making 'em the same colour ,

ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	484.13	487.59	UI	C	inf	+1	1	um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_ .

ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	509.81	512.304	UI	C	inf	-1	0	um I dunno if this will work but {disfmarker}
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	514.61	518.95	UI	C	ass	+1	1	And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those .
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	521.376	525.63	UI	C	ass	-1	0	{vocalsound} Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons ,
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	525.63	537.67	UI	C	sug	+1	1	uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um {vocalsound} like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user .
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	540.736	542.66	UI	C	inf	-1	0	{vocalsound} That concludes my presentation .

ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	545.86	547.44	UI	C	inf	-1	0	Okay . You need the little thingy .
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	564.54	564.79	UI	C	oth	-1	0	Ooh .
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	593.58	595.533	ID	B	oth	-1	0	How do I um {disfmarker}
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	599.83	599.96	ME	D	fra	-1	0	S
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	609.73	611.11	ME	D	inf	-1	0	That's on view .
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	611.4	611.67	ID	B	ass	-1	0	Right .
ES2011b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	611.11	611.24	ME	D	oth	-1	0	Oh .
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	614.36	621.09	ID	B	inf	+1	1	Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote ,
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	621.09	627.04	ID	B	inf	-1	0	um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting .
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	628.1	633.93	ID	B	inf	+1	1	Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions ,
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	633.93	638.81	ID	B	inf	+1	1	the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ .
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	638.81	650.24	ID	B	inf	+1	1	And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is .
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	652.0	655.33	ID	B	inf	+1	1	So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote ,
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	655.33	658.3	ID	B	inf	-1	0	um input which would probably be buttons ,
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	658.3	661.39	ID	B	inf	-1	0	although um we just talked about voice recognition ,
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	661.39	664.06	ID	B	inf	+1	1	processor to take the information ,
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	664.06	666.8	ID	B	inf	-1	0	um something to transmit it to the T_V_ ,
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	666.8	675.74	ID	B	inf	+1	1	and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration .
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	675.74	678.01	ID	B	inf	-1	0	And also you need a sender for location signal ,
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	678.01	684.32	ID	B	inf	-1	0	which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall .
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	686.77	690.35	ID	B	inf	-1	0	And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works .
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	690.35	692.86	ID	B	inf	-1	0	Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip ,
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	693.92	697.4	ID	B	inf	-1	0	um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	697.4	700.59	ID	B	inf	-1	0	which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ .
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	700.59	707.14	ID	B	inf	-1	0	And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal ,
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	707.14	711.32	ID	B	inf	-1	0	um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead .
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	711.32	714.67	ID	B	inf	-1	0	That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it ,
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	714.67	718.58	ID	B	inf	-1	0	and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up .
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	721.77	727.43	ID	B	sug	+1	1	Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source ,
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	727.43	729.53	ID	B	inf	-1	0	that way you wouldn't have to plug it in ,
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	729.53	732.67	ID	B	sug	+1	1	um a button pad for input ,
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	732.67	736.82	ID	B	inf	-1	0	um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff ,
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	736.82	738.9	ID	B	sug	+1	1	I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ ,
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	738.9	743.2	ID	B	inf	-1	0	that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver .
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	743.2	747.27	ID	B	sug	-1	0	Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	747.27	752.83	ID	B	sug	+1	1	and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself .
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	752.83	754.22	ID	B	inf	-1	0	So that concludes my presentation .

ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	939.16	944.01	UI	C	el.ass	-1	0	Okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a {disfmarker} like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the T_V_ itself .
ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	944.41	950.47	ID	B	inf	-1	0	Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place {gap} since the T_V_ already has power .

ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.111	1497.48	1502.63	ID	B	ass	-1	0	because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch .

ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.181	1501.85	1504.89	UI	C	inf	-1	0	I think {disfmarker} you would have to have like a function switch button ,

ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.184	1513.15	1518.99	UI	C	inf	-1	0	but I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad .
ES2011b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	1514.09	1514.68	PM	A	fra	-1	0	But i

ES2011b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.116	1524.22	1527.48	ID	B	inf	-1	0	but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch .
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.186	1527.68	1531.52	UI	C	el.ass	+1	1	So {disfmarker} but I'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button ,
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.188	1531.52	1535.04	UI	C	inf	+1	1	so like you're {disfmarker} if you're on T_V_ , like you can switch channels ,
ES2011b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.189	1535.04	1544.48	UI	C	inf	+1	1	but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks
