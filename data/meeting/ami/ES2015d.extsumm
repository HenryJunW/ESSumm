Um the agenda for this meeting {vocalsound} is um {disfmarker} we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers .
And then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave gave it .
And um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget .
It's a pretty simple design .
It's um based on a mango ?
And we have the company logo here
where's the L_E_D_ ?
It's in the middle of one of the little R_s .
And then the other one is the power .
So it's palm-held .
buttons are accessible from your thumb .
And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus .
So one plus one would be eleven ,
You press a plus button ?
I've never heard of that kind before .
but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if I press the six it'll go to channel six , and then I'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ?
we can further define that .
I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five .
like as long as we realise that's what it'll do .
Well the there is a {disfmarker} there's a delay on remotes I think .
um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers
because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb .
And {vocalsound} it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well .
Um and the feel of it , I mean , we've made this out of Play Doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness .
Okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype .
But we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway ,
that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use .
Or the combination .
Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit ,
like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green ,
or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in
Banana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company {disfmarker} the yellow and black .
we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device ,
And so now that we've we have a prototype , uh we need to go over the finances
Do you need to do a presentation first ?
Evaluation criteria is next in line .
Um , we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen .
Um and looking looking back at my notes from our {disfmarker} both our conceptual and our functional meetings , um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were ,
Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false .
So basically the lower p the lower the points the better .
Do we have a fancy look-and-feel ?
We've been quite successful with the rubber coating
The look is a little bit more playful .
Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy ,
I mean {vocalsound} th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen .
I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy . {vocalsound}
I kinda {disfmarker} I like the potato look .
It's a two ?
Okay so question number two was {vocalsound} is it techn technologically innovative ?
So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative .
and the use of the rubber .
and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons ,
there's no L_C_D_ control ,
so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's sort of probably halfway .
we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose .
we'll put three ,
but I think we actually reached our goal .
Uh , will it be easy to use ?
Yeah . One .
you can't really get confused with that .
The plus number thing .
But once that's figured out , it should be fine .
Is this a good-looking remote ?
Again I think the colour comes into this .
I think that the logo could be smaller .
Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent .
I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand .
where's it gonna sit in your living room ?
the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit .
But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand {vocalsound} .
Would we wanna show it off to our friends ? {vocalsound}
Okay , so should we say two for that ?
will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ?
I think we have to market it in the right way , that um {disfmarker} to say that it is simplistic .
And the kinetic energy part .
No , I guess , I don't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for ,
About ten pounds .
But you don't have to buy batteries .
So in the long term this can actually save you money .
I would give it a two still though .
{vocalsound} Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user .
I think it does very well .
easy to use .
Okay so one ?
Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ?
is the alarm system still {disfmarker} was it implemented ?
But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm .
I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up .
You press the button it makes a noise
It would just be a little speaker on the back or something .
We can give it a one ,
because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find .
Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ?
it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do .
The plus thing needs to be worked on .
we'll say yes it's uh one ?
Uh , will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_ ,
I think so .
We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about .
Two okay .
Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ?
Well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey .
So it could be grey on the banana one .
I think this is the
the factor that we've been least successful in confronting .
Four I think .
{vocalsound} Um , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ?
But maybe more like two
{vocalsound} Alright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ?
Yeah it is one point nine .
So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing .
Um we're using a regular chip .
Um , it's cur it's double curved , so its curved all around .
Um , we're using plastic and rubber ,
So it's like special colour {disfmarker} well we'll have two colours
Well one colour for the case , one colour for the buttons .
So um our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros .
I mean we weren't really given a lot of time , or materials , yeah , to go about our design task .
Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess , but m
and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we wouldn't have been able to afford that .
{vocalsound} Good leadership , I think we stayed on task .
and also our personal coach helped us along the way ,
We never were pushed for time , or sat around doing nothing , so {disfmarker}
I think we worked great as a team .
We needed more Play Doh colours .
The computer programmes are good .
Yeah well I guess we really {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} we bounced off of each other ,
Fantastic .
Thank you very much . {vocalsound}
