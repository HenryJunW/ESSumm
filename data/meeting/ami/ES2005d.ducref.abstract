The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented their prototypes to the group.
Two prototypes featured different fruit shapes , with one including speech recognition instead of a large number of buttons.
It also featured scroll wheels for channel control.
The other prototype was designed like a banana with children users in mind.
The Project Manager announced to the group that with all of their desired features , the project would go over the alotted budget; after a reanalysis of the features of the prototype , the project came in under the budget instead.
It was decided that another feature could possibly be added.
The group evaluated their effectiveness as a team and felt that all members worked well together and could be creative , and that the project had very good leadership.
The Marketing Expert led an evaluation of the prototype according to the initial project goals; the evaluation showed that most of the goals had been sufficiently satisfied in order to launch the product.
