It was decided that the speech recognition component seemed feasible , so it was added to the prototype design to provide a device locator function.
It was removed when the project exceeded its initial budget , but it will be suggested to the management that the speech recognition should remain in the product design.
The plastic case will be a neutral color , and the changeable rubber cases will be available in vibrant , fruit colors.
The LCD screen will appear only in black and white.
The company logo will appear on the inside of the device when opened.
The group decided that the device fulfilled enough of the project's initial goals to continue in production.
