This is our last meeting .
Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting .
Uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation .
Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget .
Um then we'll do the evaluation ,
and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make ,
We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel .
Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles .
Um and a spongy feel .
Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity .
Um the iPod , we really liked the look of that .
the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips ,
um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote .
basically we we st went with the colour yellow .
Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it's basically designed around a banana .
These would be like the rubber , the rubber grips .
Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel .
And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod ,
And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus .
we could use the voice .
It's as simple as you , we could make it really .
Plastic covered with rubber .
T the actual thing might be smaller .
It's a quick on-off button .
You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria .
we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale .
And one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that .
With seven being false , we did not achieve that .
So for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ? {vocalsound}
I think it's definitely different than anything else out there .
I'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average .
So uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely .
I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form .
{vocalsound} Four is fair .
Did we make it simple for new users ?
It's very intuitive , I think yeah .
Um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ?
'Cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls {gap} most common , which are channel and volume .
So that's a one .
How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ?
Something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore .
But um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . That , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing .
Y you could add an extra feature actually .
Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television .
That can't cost much .
Let's add one of those features and say yes . {vocalsound}
Two .
Are we technologically innovative ?
It's all just stolen technology when it comes down to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
I don't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth . {vocalsound}
{vocalsound} Um I would say we're probably at four .
Um spongy material ?
We have some spongy , yeah .
It's not a one though .
Probably a four at most .
did we put the fashion in electronics ?
I'd say we did .
{vocalsound} Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the L_C_D_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour ,
Now we just gotta calculate .
Okay we'll say two point four two .
Now we get to do the budget numbers .
We want a fifty percent profit on this .
Um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ?
Two .
That's the advanced chip-on-print , yeah .
'Kay then the case is a {disfmarker} Probably it's double curved .
Case materials are
Plastic .
That's not a special colour .
It's a specially ugly colour , but it's not special .
Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged ,
{vocalsound} we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements .
So our total is fifteen point five .
by three Euros over .
What if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on .
I suppose the L_C_D_ C_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though .
you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even ,
Right . We may not need it .
I think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me .
But I'd like to hear your thoughts .
Uh h what did you think of our project process ?
yeah I think we did quite well . Um {disfmarker}
Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning .
But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing .
and um I think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things .
Super super .
I had some problem with the pen I think ,
Minus your PowerPoint fiasco .
Um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary .
And I still have to do my minutes for the last meeting . {vocalsound}
Um so there will probably be another questionnaire coming up .
And then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can , what goes on after that .
