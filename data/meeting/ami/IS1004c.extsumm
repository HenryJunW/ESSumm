So today is um our third meeting .
It will be about the conceptual design {vocalsound} uh .
um . We decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons
and we are not decided about u the use of L_C_D_ screen on on the remote control because of costs .
Uh at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point .
So each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform
I investigate deeper the preference of the users .
What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device .
After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking ,
what they what they find more more interesting , more {disfmarker} or more important it's uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel .
So now more more cool aspect , ma more {disfmarker} a cooler aspect uh rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with {disfmarker}
instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things , a device which is pleasant to to watch , to see .
all this fashion it's {vocalsound} it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables .
And also {vocalsound} in the in the U_S_A_ the the current {disfmarker} the mor the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy .
What what do you mean by {vocalsound} fruit and vegetables and spongy ?
I didn't miss and I saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes .
So we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana ,
Vegetable textures and all this kind .
So which fruit are you thinking of ?
{gap} I ha I haven't thought of any particular fruit ,
but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may {disfmarker} could remind some kind of vegetable ,
instead of vegetable , some natur mm uh natural object or something .
or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the {disfmarker} {gap}
No , not n not not too much focus , not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different .
I'm not , I'm not really sure if uh that would really appeal to everyone though ,
like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner ,
Is fruit cool ?
Okay , but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know ,
Well , probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of ,
a cucumber .
Maybe too long .
and you you you will not have pla enough {disfmarker} a lot of place to put a L_C_D_ on a banana also .
Uh do you want a an L_C_D_ with twenty five Euros ? {vocalsound}
and also it's {disfmarker} I'm not convinced about this L_C_D_
you're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons {disfmarker} with only a few buttons .
So you are User Interface guy .
Okay . So I received an email um around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit ,
It means that it can recognize , it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that .
I guess you could build that in , you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control .
but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done .
Is this a technology that recognize keywords {disfmarker} speech keywords ?
it's it'll recognize uh I guess keywords , but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase .
So this is not s really to do to to do control .
It's designed it's designed as a fun kind of thing ,
{disfmarker} yeah comp {vocalsound} completely pointless {vocalsound} for the inter for {disfmarker} from the interaction point of v point of view {gap} .
So this is out of discussion .
I think it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's it's it's not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine , so {disfmarker}
I've just done a quick mock-up of uh uh some of the features of our {vocalsound} potential funky-looking uh remote control {disfmarker}
But um , I've just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels ,
{vocalsound} But I think it's important , you know , to have two scroll wheels because , you know , you want one for for the channel , but you also want one for for the volume ,
I've also included this turbo button
because I think , you know , every design should have a turbo button ,
so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if uh , you know , if I'm if I'm going {disfmarker} if I'm scrolling past them
but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need , um .
it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana
well , I guess you need an on and off switch ,
but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe , you know ,
So i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the L_C_D_ thing .
I I think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so .
No we can we can't use that .
Well , I f I think it's probably more than , than our {gap} can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine , you know , to say hello in the morning .
I don't I don't know if that speech recognition is , you know , even if we can do it , I think it's not really appropriate for uh television environment .
It might be useful to have some kind of base station ,
even if it's just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping , you know , this is a way of finding the remote .
So this is going to be about the component design .
So first thing is we need power source for the remote control .
So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies ,
one is the usual batteries which are there ,
they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing
and on top of that we can have solar cells ,
when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty uh innovative kind .
Then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your {disfmarker} if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces ,
I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy .
and then it should be double curve .
The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve .
with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve .
but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one ,
it'll bring the cost down
Yeah but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood .
but are we set on the banana idea ?
the shape of a banana is not it's not really handy .
Yes it is .
Yeah , okay , so capsicum or pepper . Yeah .
{vocalsound} I don't know , it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me , like
But {gap} like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top
Okay , so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated ,
Then uh there are different kind of chips ,
one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip .
Pricing is a factor for us , that's why we'll go for the regular chip .
So are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana ?
Uh , so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better .
or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place ,
so our T_V_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like V_C_R_ D_V_D_ players which are usually attached with the T_V_ ,
It depends , if we like , if we are concentrating on like a fruit design , then maybe maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit , you know , like a different fruit for each device .
So you're having the basis station and there is a button ,
if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is . Uh {disfmarker}
{vocalsound} I think that's a pretty handy feature .
Yeah but I'm a bit worried about the budget . {gap}
basis station is nothing more , just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh you're having one socket on which the thing sits .
L_C_D_ has already been ruled out , A_S_R_ has been ruled out .
I'm just wondering actually , 'cause , you know , I {disfmarker} this whole fruit thing with the banana , it's um it seemed like {disfmarker} it first seems a bit kind of uh niche , like only a few people would really want a banana ,
but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana ?
You know , rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana , you could make it kind of silver .
If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana .
maybe {disfmarker} like still in the shape of a banana .
Um , but you know , just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana
Before before st before ending the meeting I'd like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype .
So we need to take some de decisions about um {vocalsound} about what we're going to do .
so we're going for a stylish banana shape .
{vocalsound} We'll have a base station extra uh on the side .
Uh , we have a R_F_ for um for beeping for beeping .
So we {disfmarker} that means we need a button on th on the on the basis .
and your tur turbo turbo uh button .
Yeah , which {disfmarker} I think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device ,
And and you have two wheels .
Oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well .
Well , I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote
But you know our targets are very high , means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make .
You have to uh work on the look and feel uh design
and you have to work on the user interface ,
in fact you two you have to work together to model the first uh f first prototype .
Uh Marketing Expert uh have to go to product evaluation .
