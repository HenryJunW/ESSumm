Um this is the kick-off meeting for the day .
Um we're the new group uh to create a new remote control for Real Reaction .
As you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting ,
um become acquainted with each other ,
um have a little training on tools ,
uh create a plan ,
discuss things
and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total .
The new remote control is to be original , trendy and user-friendly .
That , Steph , is your part , is the user-friendliness .
The originality um is gonna take all of us .
Um the trendiness we'll probably go look at {disfmarker} for some marketing research information from you , Sarah .
we'll have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design .
Everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard .
Kate , why don't you try it first , if you can either bring your things with you , I guess {disfmarker}
we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well ,
'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around .
you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal . {vocalsound}
Its a sort of bunny rabbit cat . {vocalsound}
I think it's to get us used to using the pen .
Not a mouse , a rat .
a fish .
And I think your pen's running out of whatever .
we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this
and this remote control has to be sold {disfmarker} um we're to sell it for twenty five Euros ,
with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros .
That tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale .
would be like what , a hundred million of them um to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million .
Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item .
if they cost twelve and a half , you're selling it for twenty five , you're making twelve and a half Euros each .
Um and we're to make a profit of fifty million ,
I was just wondering if that's the um {disfmarker} If fifty percent is normal {disfmarker}
Um I would think would be more like sixty percent .
you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that .
In order to make fifty million Euros , and you're only getting twelve and a half each {disfmarker}
four million . You'd have to sell four million .
Experience with a remote control .
Any of you use of remote control for a television or D_V_D_ or something ?
That that that's the sorta product we're talking about , one that will work for a {disfmarker} in a home environment , for a T_V_s and {disfmarker}
I've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time ,
but I also have heard about them not working well or not well co-ordinated
and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another .
that you always sit around {disfmarker} you know , you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something , there's five different remotes , and one for the D_V_D_ and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else .
And they don't always talk to each other .
But I presume this is t I presume this is just for television .
We could make a Hello Kitty
themed remote .
I think one in b bright colours would be good . {vocalsound}
{vocalsound} I think one that works would be good . {vocalsound}
We could totally go for the Japan-a-mation .
I mean there's also the cachet that um uh the Japanese make great {vocalsound} products .
I think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions .
Like I've got one at home
that has well , apart from the obvious , channels , channel up , channel down , volume ,
you know , subtitles , mute , there's a lotta buttons that I've got no idea what they do , like {vocalsound} .
that's a really good point ,
because I think one of the things that {disfmarker} being somewhat computer literate , we tend to um go to menus and then make choices ,
so if it's like an uh volume button , you know , you can go in and say mute or or volume .
We don't need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down .
Mm . We can make it smart like an iPod ,
make everything menus .
closing the meeting .
Um I know this sounds like it was very quick ,
I think that's the industrial design is the first one ,
that's Kate , for the working design .
And user , that's you S Steph , for the technical functions design ,
and for marketing the user requirements specification .
we have to help each other
and work through this as a group ,
Uh as it says , we're gonna get individual instructions ,
and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now
