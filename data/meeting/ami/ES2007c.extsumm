Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting .
Um {vocalsound} which was we got together just to basically decide on {disfmarker} well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing ,
Um yeah , we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations ,
o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first .
{vocalsound} Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery ,
a hand dynamo which is {disfmarker} which was used uh in the fifties for torches ,
You can have a kinetic provision of energy ,
Or you can use solar cells ,
but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but {disfmarker}
Well , there's sometimes combinations , I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with {disfmarker} but also using some solar power .
Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really .
And uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice ,
{vocalsound} For the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one .
You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one ,
{vocalsound} Um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium .
And th for each of them you have uh cases where {disfmarker} for example titanium , you can't use it for {disfmarker} if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium .
But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything .
So that might be an idea of using the rubber ,
And also it doesn't break as easily maybe ,
Rubber , we're all we're all going {disfmarker} we're all liking that idea ?
so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse ,
um or you could have um L_C_D_ , which gives you a display .
Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons .
Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double {disfmarker} rubber double curved case ? {vocalsound}
Let's have rubber push buttons , hey .
Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be {disfmarker}
If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive .
{vocalsound} is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ?
Well , if if it's not chip on print then , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red .
If it's something that's inside the the unit . {vocalsound} I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not .
So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print .
What about the just developed uh sample sensor ?
Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ?
I'm just guessing . But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and {disfmarker}
it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns {disfmarker} comes on ,
a it just gives you a verbal response .
Oh , then {gap} forget about it .
so we want it rub rubber double curved . {vocalsound}
So rubber rubber keys , yeah .
But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific {disfmarker}
Okay , so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic .
Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine .
So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface .
I guess , we we basically vetoed that idea .
they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod .
but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche ,
but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well .
I can give you an example here of uh , {gap} good layout and bad layout
So this would be an example of bad layout ,
where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V_ on both of them , so uh
Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose .
Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense .
I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us .
So we're {disfmarker} we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh .
I think we shall have a limited number of buttons ,
ideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad .
it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that .
Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy ,
Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere ,
I I guess {vocalsound} the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before .
Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets
So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already {disfmarker} that we already have .
{vocalsound} Um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative .
now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap .
I mean it's different , but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy .
That's why I was thinking , Bluetooth ,
'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is {vocalsound} ,
they don't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not .
Of course , they do .
So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other
that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does ,
Well , if you're looking at {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if you {gap} looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art .
Like it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth ,
If we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have
Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then .
It's been done for watches , but I haven't seen that for remotes , yet .
Okay . {vocalsound} Yeah , this {disfmarker} that's that's very good .
Yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating {disfmarker} like the energy generator .
Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture .
Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them .
and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy ,
Yeah , we're we're ahead of the game there .
right , we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing ,
and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though .
Maybe make it like fruity colours or something .
The power button could be like a big apple or something .
Um like I'm just thinking bright colours .
Wanna make it different colours so {vocalsound} anybody can choo like like {gap} {disfmarker}
so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the {disfmarker}
where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing .
from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design .
Um Gabriel , you're gonna be working on , you know {disfmarker} come up with the the user interface design .
Then basically , you two are gonna be working together on this .
Um and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay .
come up ki you know , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas .
Um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation .
We'll look into this lock key
