LED's can be used to light up the remote.
Using them sparsely , as in mobile phones , could bring down the cost.
It would be a good idea to integrate a mechanism for finding the remote control , when the user loses it.
The latter would be preferable to implementing a backlight into the remote.
A single , large , round button can be used for both volume and channel selection by using the four separate quadrants.
Another button to switch between two channels could also be implemented.
The remote will also include volume and program selection , and speech recognition.
A recharging cradle can be added to compensate for the extra energy consumption.
