ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	251.19	255.42	ME	D	inf	-1	0	Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	255.42	256.56	ME	D	inf	-1	0	and we'll come to that later .
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	256.56	258.49	ME	D	inf	-1	0	So that was one of the first things we did .
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	258.49	269.305	ME	D	inf	+1	1	Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan . {vocalsound}
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	270.29	285.99	ME	D	inf	+1	1	Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls .
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	285.99	289.55	ME	D	inf	+1	1	They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative ,
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	290.9	294.2	ME	D	inf	+1	1	and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use .
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	294.2	299.74	ME	D	inf	+1	1	Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important ,
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	299.74	303.5	ME	D	inf	+1	1	is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative ,
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	303.5	306.4	ME	D	inf	+1	1	which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use .
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	307.84	311.29	ME	D	inf	-1	0	So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	311.29	316.96	ME	D	inf	-1	0	is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at .
ES2004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	316.02	316.31	PM	B	bck	-1	0	Yeah .
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	316.96	319.75	ME	D	stl	-1	0	{vocalsound} Okay , um ,
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	319.75	324.13	ME	D	inf	-1	0	now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group ,
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	324.13	335.05	ME	D	inf	+1	1	um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	335.05	339.12	ME	D	sug	-1	0	So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ?
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	340.13	344.91	ME	D	inf	+1	1	There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials ,

ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	925.27	925.6	ID	C	stl	-1	0	Well
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	927.14	928.47	ID	C	stl	-1	0	well this {disfmarker} the thi
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	928.47	934.36	ID	C	inf	+1	1	the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	934.36	937.94	ID	C	inf	-1	0	because you can you can print circuit board like that
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	937.94	943.54	ID	C	inf	-1	0	that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have {disfmarker} fit the n the size of the nine buttons in .
