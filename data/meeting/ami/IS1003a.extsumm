I'm Ada Longmund ,
and as you may know it , I'm the pr project manager .
Our project project is to create um a new remote control
so the remote control has to be original , trendy and um user-friendly .
if we're um the functional design , you have to do uh any individual work
and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other .
Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design . Uh .
The tool training is to try out the white board ,
Maybe someone ha we have to {gap} this whiteboard ,
Maybe you can draw your favourite animal
and make a list of its favourite characteristics .
I don't know if we have to do it now ,
maybe later later .
the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros . {vocalsound}
I think it's quite good price , yeah .
it will uh be a an international remote control ,
and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes .
try to create something new
And {vocalsound} and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes ,
you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role
you will have to work on the design
and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control
and think of the user requirement specifications .
Those things just refer to each of each of us , I think . AMI
I_D_ is for the Industrial Design ,
And U_I_D_ , it's for the User Interface Designer ,
and Marketing Expert , it's me .
I will manage all all the group .
what's the difference between
user interface design d industrial design ? {vocalsound}
I suppose you have to design it
and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it .
I I think the user the user interface design is {disfmarker} he will design how the user will you know {disfmarker} the relation between the user and you know the remote control so {disfmarker}
And the uh industrial design , it is how the object will look like .
Maybe , it is the outside and the inside .
'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be , you know .
I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have
and then thi this would {vocalsound} I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer .
so really the remote control to be international .
And not too expensive .
And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now .
{vocalsound} There was a step about drawing something in the in the board ,
Are we supposed to do right now ? {vocalsound}
You can draw something which is very simple . {vocalsound}
It's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It's a cat .
you have to draw a rat if you want a rat .
It's a rabbit .
Right . A fish .
present project ,
we have break .
we have twenty five minutes for the meeting .
You know your job ?
I have an idea of my job {vocalsound}
