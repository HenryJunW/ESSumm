For the conceptual design , the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks and texture over technological innovation; however , they both seem to be more important than ease of use.
The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote.
Materials also need to be strong: the marketing expert suggested an iron-plate or titanium front.
The industrial designer suggested they use rubber push buttons (and no scroll wheel) , simple battery (instead of solar cells or kinetic dynamo) , and advanced chip.
Speech recognition can be implemented , but it does not link speech commands to remote control actions.
He also advised that the users within the target group prefer primary colours , soft textures and curved shapes.
The team drew a provisional prototype.
They placed the LCD below the buttons.
If it is implemented , a recording button , microphone and speaker need to be included in the design.
Finally , they decided to have a titanium case with plastic front and the company logo and slogan engraved.
Packages with a variety of changeable fronts will be launched.
