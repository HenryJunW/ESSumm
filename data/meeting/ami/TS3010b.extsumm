So welcome back .
first . I want to say I'm the secretary ,
so I make the minutes .
You find them in your {disfmarker} in the map in the From the group .
There's the minutes from the first meeting .
You'll find the next minutes also there .
I wanna hear from you , what you've done .
And after that I have some new product requirements . So {disfmarker}
And after that we have to make decisions , what we will do .
We have forty minutes for this meeting .
After that we'll have lunch .
So first I wanna ask the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Industrial Designer to tell what he did . So {disfmarker}
Where have I put it ?
I've save it on my computer , my presentation .
But now I don't know where it is .
Okay here it is .
It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you .
It's about the working of the remote control .
I just had an half an hour j to study it
and {vocalsound} I don't get it .
First uh I will tell you something about the findings ,
what I discovered about the remote control .
Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map ,
and it's the top of the remote control .
The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside .
Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it ,
um because its uh not so expensive .
And there are uh a lot of uh wires ,
uh which um connect the components in it ,
and there are um switches and things like that .
There's a lot of small uh electronics .
So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it .
Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it .
And here I have the top of the remote control .
Uh here's some kind of chip .
Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers .
Uh you have all on your remote control .
And uh the teletext uh button .
And uh here's the battery .
And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip .
And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components .
My preferences ?
We shouldn't make it too big .
Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it .
A long-lasting battery .
Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic .
Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it .
We can also make uh a button uh with a {gap} {disfmarker} menu uh button .
And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ .
And the bleep signal , y uh you told us .
Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep .
And also the bleep , when {disfmarker} what I told you about uh when you lost it ,
and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it .
The battery .
You say one battery is cheaper .
If we w if we use only just one uh small pen-light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two .
when you use two , you can use it two times longer .
then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting .
Okay and the buttons .
When you use it on the television , you've {disfmarker} you need the television , wh which can use it .
But uh I think this {disfmarker} our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company ?
Or is it also for other company {disfmarker} uh for other televisions ?
I think we have to use it also on other televisions though .
Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions .
They are two different things though .
We have to choose one .
It has to work on o uh all televisions .
Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions .
And I just uh have one more idea .
But {disfmarker} Uh , to have a trendy remote control , we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones . To change covers .
So if you have uh a trendy half with all red , uh yellow and something . And then you can put a red cover on it .
Will this will this add to the cost ?
Uh then it won't be {disfmarker} uh will have just one cover on the uh original one .
And then you can buy the covers .
but you have to m uh be able to change it .
D does it make it more difficult to design ?
I think it will be a little more difficult ,
but not too much .
Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones .
Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones .
If it won't works then we'll get something else .
Then we uh won't g uh go further with it .
Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost ?
Uh a p a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a cover made in uh in China , it it won't be I guess so expensive I think .
Yeah but there are also design cost .
Would you change the cover ?
I wi I won't .
But maybe I think trendy people
or like children where you can paint on it ,
I think that too less people would change it for good profit . So {disfmarker}
I'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh {disfmarker}
But it's uh yeah it's uh original idea . {vocalsound}
but I don't think we have to do it .
Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design .
{vocalsound} Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh {disfmarker} for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set .
And uh well , it all by pushing a button on the remote .
Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web .
Uh message to the television .
And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh {disfmarker} and maybe uh teletext or something like that .
well these are two uh remotes ,
and that's our uh our dilemma I think . Uh {disfmarker}
But uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more .
Or uh uh more functions on the remote .
Uh maybe more devices you can influence .
Uh a radio or a v a video recorder , uh V_C_R_ .
Um any ideas about that ?
Basic or multifunctional ?
We'll got back on that later .
So uh I didn't know what uh what way we would go .
Then it's your turn , the marketing expert .
So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market ,
Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons .
And we looked at uh several um things .
Uh among them design ,
uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls .
Uh our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls .
Um uh they especially found found them very ugly .
And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it .
Uh well they also zap a lot .
And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons .
So a lot of unused buttons .
Well uh the most used button is the channel selection .
The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant .
Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important .
Uh not important they found the audio ,
uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right .
Uh the screen and the brightness . And uh channel settings . Uh th and they also are not used very often .
Then we have a few um graphs about the market .
Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups .
Um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five .
Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big .
And to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh I don't think uh , I {vocalsound} I think the younger will be most interest in it .
Um in the {gap} we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature .
If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control , what would you think of it .
Now you can clearly see young users say {gap} . I will {disfmarker} that would very nice .
And older user think uh they will be scared of change {vocalsound} I think .
And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it .
Young users uh think that's an interesting idea .
And old users not .
Uh well we uh found out that there are two {disfmarker} several markets at which we can aim .
Uh the first are the younger ,
the age between sixteen and forty five .
Uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here .
Uh the second group is the older group .
Aged between forty six and sixty five .
They are less interested in uh new features .
But uh they spend their money more easily .
Well then I come to my uh personal preferences .
Uh yeah the first question is uh {disfmarker} also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at .
Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it .
What I thought , um even young people say it's hard to use , remote control .
So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested .
But when use it , uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition .
Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control .
You can find most functions on a T_V_ set .
So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness . And such things .
One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one .
So the design of our remote control is very important .
If we aim for the younger people , um and there will be uh a lot of features like L_C_D_ or the the the speech uh f recognising , uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher .
Uh I think we don't have that in our budget .
And I don't uh I don't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something .
So it's {disfmarker} Yeah , it's hard to uh get the younger group .
I think uh the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition .
So I think that can be an d good option . L_C_D_ .
Uh we go {gap} {disfmarker} back on the decisions later .
Now we have a few new product requirements .
First , teletext .
We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore .
So not necessary .
Only for the television .
So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something .
We look at the age group of forty plus .
Uh no , younger than forty .
Our corporate colour and slogan must be used .
So you can see it on our site .
Now we have to decide what controls do we need .
Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said .
I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option .
Yeah but we don't use it .
It's a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} new requirement .
No discussion about it .
Well a power button ?
Uh the well um I think separate channels . So {disfmarker}
So so uh zero to nine or something .
Uh volume .
To move up , move down .
Do we make a menu ?
Uh yes
I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows .
Up-down for channel selection ,
and left-right uh for volume .
And if you press the menu button you get into the menu ,
On the L_C_D_ screen , you mean ?
Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control .
Think it's better to have it on the remote control ,
But then we come to the costs .
But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control .
So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell .
Is this enough ?
Mute .
I think that's enough for the next phase .
And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? Or {disfmarker}
that's for the next phase .
Phase two is the conceptual design .
And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons .
Your individual action , you can find them in the email .
