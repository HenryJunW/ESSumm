This last meeting started with the presentation of a remote control prototype.
It has on-off and volume buttons , an LCD screen (it can be active or switched off) in various colours , which largely replaces the use of push buttons , and a jog-wheel for navigation and option selection in the menus presented on the LCD.
It also includes speech recognition as an alternative interface , which also serves as mechanism for locating the device.
It was designed to be powered by a single battery.
The casing will be made of titanium with rubber strawberries following the fruit and veg fashion.
The prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) in terms of fancifulness , technology , robustness , usefulness , size , colour and shape and customizability: the average mark was 2.17; the team were satisfied with their prototype , although after costs were calculated it proved very expensive.
Finally , the team evaluated the whole process: they deemed themselves a good team , they found there was plenty of room for creativity and they liked the project manager's leadership.
