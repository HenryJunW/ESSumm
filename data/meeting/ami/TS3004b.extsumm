I was a little short on time ,
Yeah , same here .
we have uh forty minutes for this uh for this second meeting ,
and we have to make uh sure that we going t that we are sure , that we are ,
that we know what we're going to make uh th what the product is going to like {disfmarker} look like .
Uh first I have the notes of the last meeting ,
so I showed uh show them to you .
the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um {disfmarker} Should be a univ uh universal remote control {disfmarker}
I just got a email from the from the personal coach
and it should be a T_V_ remote control only .
it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly .
All these points uh we have to look at .
The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people .
So we have to look at that as well .
'Specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something ,
I've used a marketing report on uh the site .
Uh I think you've uh read it too .
Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site .
I didn't get it uh anyway .
I I was the only one who get it .
it was uh uh uh um um {vocalsound} a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users .
And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof .
I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings .
Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly .
so we have to make a beautiful remote control .
Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy .
Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good .
Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at .
Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot .
I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons .
The last point is quite an interesting {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons .
And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one ,
we should have the ten percent on the on the top ,
Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .
That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something .
Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system ,
so when you {vocalsound} clap your hands it will beep or something .
Uh you must find it uh quickly .
Uh . Maybe just a button on the home station .
So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station .
we can uh combine that .
Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control .
Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this .
It's only uh th thirty four of the {vocalsound} thirty four percent .
But it's uh a tough one .
Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty I think .
Uh next , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ .
Yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something .
Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point .
Uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition .
We didn't uh think about that already .
And uh an L_C_D_ on the remote control .
Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features .
but they're more critical .
And older people uh want to spend uh more money .
we have uh a new uh age of forty plus .
But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ?
so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control ,
I I think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly ,
because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros .
I have my personal uh preference .
that's {vocalsound} not very good ,
because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ .
But it's already out of the question , this .
Um my point is , well , I {vocalsound} {disfmarker} If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros .
On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything .
so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special .
I told about the home station .
Uh it must be simple ,
And I I found a motto .
And we put the fashion in electronics .
{vocalsound} The company is about our uh th th their own fashion , their own style .
But old people are not looking for that .
I think the main thing is the usability , that's where we can uh make it a special product .
'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff .
But we have to make sure that we're better usability ,
So make it just a different colour or different shape ,
Technical functions design .
But um we have elderly people ,
so we need to keep it simple .
Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard . So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls .
Not too full ,
like uh Jens already said , only ten percent is being used .
what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or {disfmarker}
But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff .
the options that we put on there should be easy to use ,
and 'cause you have more room then ,
and for elderly people big buttons .
Uh an icon on it or text on it ,
so it's very clear what that buttons does .
Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet
Of functions I could think of . Uh volume , channels , the the basic according to {gap} . Just one two three etcetera . Uh text service options . Um basic on-off .
Could I think of favourites ?
I always look up the same um pages on text
and always have to click the number .
But if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button
but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel .
So you might as well remember the number .
Maybe i maybe it's too complicated ,
I would find it handy , I think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six .
But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ?
If I use my telephone , I never use those buttons to to to call
If I don't do it , maybe old people {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Right .
They don't like new features .
play , pause . I dunno if that's usable
miss {disfmarker} Did I miss any other buttons , basic buttons ?
that's the only th the only thing you need .
Uh uh the p uh next and previous .
Li like a web browser ,
Six seven eight or five .
But uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before .
Like a web browser back button .
but I think it's all too difficult for old people . {vocalsound}
just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time .
I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons .
Yeah , the ten plus button .
Just uh one one pressing , or quickly after each other .
w wouldn't it be a problem to uh {disfmarker} Because you h have to be fast enough .
But I think that's in the T_V_ as well . That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it .
So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons .
It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two .
So if you have a universal T_V_ controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes .
Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu .
So you also need a menu button .
And then uh navigation uh {disfmarker}
But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next ,
I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things , and uh the menu button .
Because you n almost never use menu button .
Maybe it's still still a good idea , I'm not sure .
You'll also have to use a mute button
I don't know where where you have to put it .
now my personal preferences .
Uh using the standards , basic {disfmarker}
Um I think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design .
So we have to , I dunno , uh make a different shape than usual .
Does it have to be {disfmarker} Uh it has to be uh with different colours
Maybe we can give it out in different colours .
It's like a iMac or something .
That's fa That's fancy . That's uh fashion .
But it looks cheap as well ,
because it's a small thing .
maybe you can look at uh mobile phones .
They they're uh designed very well .
You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it .
But uh well , I think that's a good example .
the working design .
The method I used is uh search the web . Just the web page provided .
Um basically what happens is you press a button ,
uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch .
And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed .
Then the chip produces a pattern . Like a Morse code
And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ .
Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light .
And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_ .
we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ?
Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ?
Red's l shows up like something's wrong ,
and green is like it's okay ,
on most uh uh remote controls it's red .
The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons .
{vocalsound} I I think uh the batteries will be uh {vocalsound} a little {disfmarker}
we have a recharger in it ,
If we can still make that then {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
It's just to indicate something's on .
That it's working .
And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern .
So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal .
So that it can be used with all the T_V_s .
We have to really understand what patterns are used ,
Otherwise it won't work .
we have to uh make buttons for that as well ,
The chip um uh is producing the pattern .
So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to {disfmarker}
An automatically search function for each television , or something .
I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works .
I I use a universal uh remote control ,
And you have to put in a number ,
I have a modern one .
And the modern one you you uh you type uh search ,
And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off .
And then you know , oh it it's the right one .
We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one .
That's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern .
But uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different .
what you have to do is uh get these patterns right .
What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television .
And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now ,
And then he saves that setting
Um the energy source is uh the battery , basically .
Um that's connecting to all the components .
the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed .
when you press a button , a switch get closed .
So the chip knows what button you pressed .
And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb .
So that's the LED , L_E_D_ .
we can make the normal one also a normal light . Not a LED light , but as a normal one .
Uh if you if you use the buttons , uh both of them works .
Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push .
So you see green if you push that button .
Mm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then .
But does it make any difference for the energy you use ?
i it it will look different ,
Is LEDs uh beneath the the buttons ?
Yeah , w around the buttons , or in the buttons even .
The same as a telephone , or a mobile phone , or what do you mean ?
It it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much .
Maybe that's a good idea for old people as well .
It's only few LEDs . Only four or something . Four LED .
But if we use a battery station ,
Yeah , that's a good idea , okay .
Maybe what Paul said , uh under the {disfmarker} on the on the home station , uh a button to uh to call your uh remote control , that it beeps .
But you have to make a sound device in it then .
maybe it's that that's a little too hard to make . Especially for that kind of money .
twenty five Euros , I think we can make it .
Production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half .
But but we only have to make it for television ,
and um we must have something special .
I think uh you also have uh {vocalsound} remote controls with a lot of options .
But we lose about ninety percent of those options .
Uh . We have to give our customers some extras .
the the personal preference , I didn't fill it out .
Because I was short on time .
Basically what we could do too is uh have a Bluetooth uh integration .
We have some new uh project requirements .
We have to have a look what they are .
Uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet .
So a teletext option , maybe we have to skip that one .
I'm not sure .
I don't think so ,
and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use .
and it's it's on your comp it's on your television .
It's only one button .
We definitely should use it . Um {disfmarker}
The remote control should only be used for a television .
And um the the forty plus people , I already told you .
Oh , this is a problem .
Oh sorry about that .
The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty .
So it should be flashy or just more interesting .
that's {disfmarker} It changes things .
I just I just didn't read it well .
That kinda changes the whole situation .
then we have to make some nice features .
I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way ,
to make it more like a mobile phone . More modern .
L_C_D_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think .
And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control ,
I I don't y you'll use it often ,
because you can see on the television wh what channel you {disfmarker}
{vocalsound} Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable .
I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular .
because the {disfmarker} Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think .
But uh some of you had uh something to read about um {vocalsound} uh speech uh recognition .
That's very {disfmarker} That's fancy . That's cool .
Only the numbers , only numbers . Uh furthermore nothing . But only the numbers , one to twenty or something .
Yeah , maybe we have to integrate that as well . If it's possible .
I don't think it's very expensive actually .
I didn't have information about that .
And and and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or {disfmarker}
that's a problem ,
Uh only in English . Only in English I think .
Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever
it's probably my job to figure that out ,
then th we have to think about that .
Maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that .
We have short time to to put it on the market ,
In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing .
I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition .
A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke , and the T_V_ turns uh to one .
And then you have to say uh T_V_ channel one , or something . Not just one ,
Okay , no speech recognition .
Do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ?
Yeah , I think so .
If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds ,
It lights up when it's dark ?
If you push something , it it all lights up .
it it mustn't work all the time .
It uh uh it have to work only when you use it .
if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off .
It's the same as the telephone . Yeah .
Different colours ,
uh maybe use even different fonts .
so y you just make it th through {disfmarker} You look through it ?
Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one .
but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control .
Because you ne almost never use it .
Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something .
but younger people I think um more often use the internet
and elderly people often use teletext .
I use te teletext every day , I think .
we just keep it one level then ?
And I think , uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons ,
We're going to have a lunch lunch break . Um {disfmarker}
you know what you have to do .
Trendwatching .
we're finished for t for this time .
