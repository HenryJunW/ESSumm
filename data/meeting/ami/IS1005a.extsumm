Uh , we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control .
So I'm going to be the project manager of this uh project .
I'm Fabien Cardinaux
and uh I I guess you can present yourself .
so my name is Petre {gap} .
Uh , in the project I'm supposed to be the technic .
'Kay . So my name's Bob Morris .
I'm the Marketing Expert for this project .
My name is Hamed Getabdar ,
and uh I'm going to be Interface Designer in this project .
We are talking about the project plan ,
Um . So what is the goal of this project ? Is to design a new remote control .
So it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities
and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way .
Um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all {disfmarker} during all this project .
For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it .
So I will ask you all to do the same .
Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal ?
Yeah , yeah , you can draw the picture , of course {vocalsound} .
Uh we are going to to sell {disfmarker} we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro .
And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro .
And uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world .
We expect a production cost of maximum uh twelve point fifty Euro .
Um , so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control , and any idea ?
Well , from experience , um I've had remote controls in the past that have had very {disfmarker} they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small ,
and it's been very hard to to to use , because there's so many buttons ,
you know , on a T_V_ remote you only ever use , mostly , you know , f four or f six buttons . Um .
Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light {vocalsound} ,
so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light .
And the second thing , f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh {disfmarker} there are two buttons for volume control .
But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like .
{gap} Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could {gap} {disfmarker} the the volume can go up very quickly
Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards ,
I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves ,
because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune {gap} .
So we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes .
Uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control ,
you are going to try to to find the user requirements f uh for the remote control .
