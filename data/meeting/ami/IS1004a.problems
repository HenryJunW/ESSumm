1	IS1004a.elana.s.18	A group member asks whether it is going to be a stand-alone unit , or one that requires a T.V . beforehand.
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	645.64	648.31	B	UI	el.inf	+1	1	is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling ?
3	IS1004a.elana.s.19	They did not decide yet what type of remote control to produce- whether it should be for a specific device or universal.
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	657.78	665.49	A	PM	sug	+1	1	So um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go .
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	666.54	670.66	A	PM	el.ass	+1	1	should it be um specific remote control to some specific device ?
IS1004a.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	670.66	673.38	A	PM	el.ass	+1	1	Should it be a universal one ?
2	IS1004a.elana.s.20	The main concern is that they do not know what the product is , yet they have to make it fit that price bracket.
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	687.54	696.43	B	UI	inf	+1	1	so , it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make ,
IS1004a.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	700.84	709.55	B	UI	sug	+1	1	but I guess if that's {disfmarker} if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket
