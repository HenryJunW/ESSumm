The first prototype for the remote control was made of single-curved rubber with a total of 16 rubber buttons (some of them in a slide-out panel) with a cherry design on top.
It uses kinetic energy and has a sample sensor for the speech recognition.
The initial cost was calculated at 13.70 Euros.
Although over budget , the team decided to evaluate this prototype before making any changes.
On a scale from 1 (true) to 7 (false) they rated it on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (2) , technological innovation (2) , ease of use (1) , incorporation of fashion elements (2) , and brand recognition (2).
Changing the rubber case to plastic reduced the cost and allowed for an extra button-form and colour.
The team were reasonably satisfied with the project in terms of teamwork and creativity , although they thought that the flow of information was sometimes disjointed.
However , the idea of designing a remote control seemed unexciting , especially since the requirements restricted it to TV only , and the budget was too small.
Finally , some new ideas were also found in the form of kinetic energy source and use of speech recognition.
