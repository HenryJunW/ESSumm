TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	410.73	416.63	C	ID	inf	+1	1	see i uh use some design example so yeah it's uh from similar products and uh use 
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	416.63	426.27	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and uh use the the possibilities from our manufacturing department about screens components which will have to be implemented in the design that's why it's a 
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	426.27	428.4	C	ID	inf	-1	0	that's why it's a wanted to go first Well 
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	428.84	432.97	C	ID	inf	-1	0	Well they gave me um an idea about what people ones where 
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	432.97	437.93	C	ID	inf	-1	0	what people ones where it's mainly focusing on this group but i want to make the distinction clear but uh 
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	437.93	446.22	C	ID	inf	-1	0	but uh i could not Track the pictures into the the slide so so so i don't have examples of how it looks like but it 
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	446.22	453.42	C	ID	inf	-1	0	but it comes down to what you uh what you think we should do with the spongy in the fruity looking uh type If it the 
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	453.5	461.39	C	ID	inf	-1	0	type If it the young dynamic people want soft primary colours uh which looks like fruits you know you can and shapes 
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	461.39	467.05	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and shapes are curved and not us all it straight lines anymore so there's basically 
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	467.05	473.13	C	ID	inf	-1	0	so there's basically um yeah goes on to what you were mentioning earlier There's a lot

TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.337	2330.54	2331.81	D	ME	fra	-1	0	But we we 
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.229	2333.68	2334.18	B	UI	ass	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.348	2334.05	2335.78	C	ID	fra	-1	0	so this is gonna be from the 
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.338	2336.73	2339.3	D	ME	el.inf	-1	0	Is it is is this is from the side will 
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.351	2337.59	2339.81	C	ID	stl	-1	0	From Yeah 
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.230	2339.79	2340.304	B	UI	fra	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.339	2339.3	2341.35	D	ME	oth	-1	0	will send because they're

TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.350	2340.3	2340.81	C	ID	be.pos	-1	0	yeah sorry 
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.340	2341.35	2345.43	D	ME	inf	-1	0	because they're at the screen goes up like that arrive so then it's 
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.352	2345.28	2345.76	C	ID	ass	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.341	2345.43	2346.77	D	ME	inf	-1	0	so then it's like this or 
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.353	2347.19	2347.76	C	ID	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.342	2346.77	2351.66	D	ME	ass	-1	0	like this or and it's not convenient because then you have to screen like this you look like that it's better 
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.343	2351.66	2355.29	D	ME	ass	-1	0	that it's better to have it so what's But there's or does it 
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.344	2355.29	2358.47	D	ME	el.sug	-1	0	there's or does it fit it all away 
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.231	2356.75	2357.707	B	UI	fra	-1	0	Yeah i know 
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.354	2356.8	2359.55	C	ID	sug	-1	0	The the idea is that it as a flip up to here 
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.232	2359.05	2364.97	B	UI	ass	-1	0	May maybe it's it's easier to to integrate the the the l. c. d. screen just into this this ball ball 
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.233	2366.36	2369.06	B	UI	inf	-1	0	Because it's not doesn't have to flip them 
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.355	2366.1	2366.73	C	ID	ass	-1	0	Okay 
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.234	2370.65	2374.61	B	UI	inf	-1	0	Because you have an of space for for making uh and l. c. d. because 
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.356	2370.82	2372.24	C	ID	ass	-1	0	Yeah yeah 
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.235	2374.61	2375.856	B	UI	fra	-1	0	c. d. because you know it 
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.345	2374.92	2380.43	D	ME	ass	-1	0	It's better to to have this like this i guess and then flip it like this 
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.357	2375.66	2376.15	C	ID	ass	-1	0	So 
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.236	2379.48	2382.489	B	UI	el.ass	-1	0	But why why do we need to the flipping uh 
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.358	2382.317	2385.11	C	ID	inf	-1	0	You can adjust and also which it flips so it can also from 
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.359	2385.11	2388.39	C	ID	inf	-1	0	so it can also from the same know it can flip over to the flip up 
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.237	2387.39	2388.77	B	UI	ass	-1	0	Okay yeah 
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.360	2388.39	2389.94	C	ID	inf	-1	0	flip up to their if you want 
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.346	2389.5	2390.3	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Yeah so we uh yeah 
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.347	2390.3	2391.59	D	ME	ass	-1	0	so we uh yeah but v. 
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.348	2391.59	2393.89	D	ME	sug	-1	0	but v. still keep the flipping minutes 
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.332	2395.06	2395.98	A	PM	el.ass	-1	0	Yeah we could slip 
TS3006c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.238	2394.61	2394.95	B	UI	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.361	2394.6	2395.13	C	ID	ass	-1	0	Think so 
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.333	2397.28	2398.94	A	PM	el.ass	-1	0	Keep that alive 
TS3006c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.362	2397.53	2404.18	C	ID	ass	-1	0	Yeah because i think they will feel weird if you would make this smaller and it's a bigger or something that I
