ES2008b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	250.98	253.02	A	PM	inf	-1	0	it looks like a Y_ kind of {disfmarker} over there above Draw .

ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	256.08	257.56	D	ME	stl	-1	0	Alright . So
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	257.56	263.47	D	ME	off	+1	1	we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	263.47	266.41	D	ME	inf	-1	0	Um I guess Real Reaction did some market research .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	266.41	269.78	D	ME	inf	+1	1	They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	269.78	273.54	D	ME	inf	-1	0	and they watched them watch T_V_
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	273.54	280.22	D	ME	inf	+1	1	and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	285.35	289.44	D	ME	inf	-1	0	What they found was they analysed people's desires and needs .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	289.44	295.68	D	ME	inf	+1	1	Focusing on their desires , um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly {vocalsound} ,
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	295.68	299.36	D	ME	inf	+1	1	seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	299.36	300.01	D	ME	fra	-1	0	and that they {disfmarker}
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	300.01	306.47	D	ME	inf	+1	1	more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	306.47	309.3	D	ME	inf	-1	0	I don't know anything beyond what fancy means ,
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	307.06	307.42	B	ID	bck	-1	0	Hmm .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	309.3	313.4	D	ME	inf	-1	0	but that's particularly of use to us , I think .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	313.4	317.18	D	ME	inf	-1	0	Um also they did some questions on voice recognition
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	317.18	322.59	D	ME	inf	+1	1	and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age ,
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	322.59	328.02	D	ME	inf	+1	1	so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition ,
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	328.02	336.5	D	ME	inf	-1	0	whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions .
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	337.74	338.26	B	ID	bck	-1	0	'Kay .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	337.73	340.96	D	ME	inf	-1	0	Um people also had certain frustrations ,
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	340.96	346.57	D	ME	sug	-1	0	that I think that we could try to take into consideration with our design .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	346.57	351.66	D	ME	inf	+1	1	That being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	351.66	356.65	D	ME	inf	+1	1	I think , over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	356.65	362.22	D	ME	inf	+1	1	People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	362.22	364.89	D	ME	inf	+1	1	and I think that ties back to what you were saying before
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	364.49	365.15	B	ID	bck	-1	0	Hmm .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	364.89	366.59	D	ME	ass	+1	1	just that there's too many buttons ,
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	366.59	368.68	D	ME	sug	-1	0	it just needs to be easy to use .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	368.68	370.82	D	ME	inf	+1	1	It also mentioned something called R_S_I_
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	370.82	374.46	D	ME	el.inf	+1	1	and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what R_S_I_ is ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	374.74	376.24	C	UI	inf	-1	0	Repetitive strain injury .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	374.46	375.47	D	ME	und	-1	0	because I don't know .
ES2008b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	377.451	378.478	A	PM	fra	-1	0	{gap}
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	377.36	378.57	C	UI	inf	+1	1	Repetitive strain injury .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	376.98	377.2	D	ME	und	-1	0	What ?
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	378.55	380.43	D	ME	und	-1	0	Ah . There we go .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	380.92	381.619	C	UI	fra	-1	0	So if you {disfmarker}
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	380.43	380.93	D	ME	be.pos	-1	0	Wow .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	380.93	382.74	D	ME	inf	-1	0	People do not like that .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	382.74	385.85	D	ME	inf	+1	1	So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that ,
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	385.85	389.69	D	ME	inf	-1	0	um the repetitive use , I guess , caused a strain .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	389.69	398.53	D	ME	inf	+1	1	Um looking at the needs people specified , the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	398.53	405.56	D	ME	inf	+1	1	People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	406.02	411.51	D	ME	inf	-1	0	And what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	411.51	419.52	D	ME	inf	+1	1	People also zap like to change the channel , about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	419.52	429.34	D	ME	sug	+1	1	So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings ,
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	429.34	430.98	D	ME	inf	-1	0	because they're used much more infrequently
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	430.98	434.01	D	ME	inf	-1	0	and probably just complicate what's going on .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	435.27	438.2	D	ME	sug	-1	0	So I think that some things that we might wanna think about ,
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	438.2	440.35	D	ME	inf	+1	1	the idea of an L_C_D_ screen was brought up
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	440.35	445.23	D	ME	inf	+1	1	although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were ,
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	445.23	447.93	D	ME	inf	-1	0	so I dunno know if that's coming to me later , or something like that .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	447.93	449.26	D	ME	sug	-1	0	But something for us to consider
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	449.26	454.56	D	ME	sug	+1	1	also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	454.56	457.18	D	ME	el.sug	-1	0	or what we wanna make easiest to use ,
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	457.18	468.54	D	ME	sug	+1	1	make sure that , you know , something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	468.54	473.87	D	ME	sug	+1	1	And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like ,

ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	569.97	570.24	C	UI	stl	-1	0	Right so
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	570.24	576.14	C	UI	inf	+1	1	I'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	578.12	581.37	C	UI	sug	+1	1	We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	581.37	588.66	C	UI	inf	+1	1	It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	588.66	591.86	C	UI	inf	-1	0	so i it's basically a communication device .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	591.86	595.08	C	UI	inf	-1	0	We we tell the remote control what we want to do ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	595.08	596.63	C	UI	inf	+1	1	it sends a message to the television
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	596.63	598.18	C	UI	inf	-1	0	saying change the channel ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	598.18	599.7	C	UI	inf	-1	0	change the volume ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	599.7	601.08	C	UI	stl	-1	0	uh yeah ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	601.08	602.02	C	UI	inf	-1	0	adjust these settings ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	602.02	602.92	C	UI	inf	-1	0	adjust the brightness .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	605.11	608.99	C	UI	inf	-1	0	Um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control ?
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	610.08	613.51	C	UI	sug	+1	1	First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	613.51	616.0	C	UI	el.inf	-1	0	We need to know what our final product is gonna be like ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	616.0	621.37	C	UI	el.inf	+1	1	so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	621.37	623.1	C	UI	el.inf	-1	0	uh how it works ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	623.1	626.15	C	UI	el.inf	+1	1	and what the end-user is gonna want from this product .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	627.46	629.63	C	UI	stl	-1	0	Um . Oh ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	629.63	638.49	C	UI	sug	+1	1	a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	638.49	643.36	C	UI	sug	+1	1	um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	643.776	644.624	D	ME	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	644.49	647.58	C	UI	sug	+1	1	h how well these particular prototypes work ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	647.58	650.6	C	UI	sug	-1	0	uh sorta find out what people think of 'em .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	650.6	656.14	C	UI	inf	-1	0	Um using a remote control is is quite a subjective experience . Um ,
ES2008b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	655.49	656.22	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Hmm .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	657.32	660.02	C	UI	inf	-1	0	and different different people sort of prefer different things .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	661.19	667.22	C	UI	inf	-1	0	Um we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	667.22	672.66	C	UI	inf	+1	1	When a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	672.66	678.67	C	UI	sug	+1	1	So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	678.67	682.39	C	UI	inf	-1	0	uh so that we're not completely shocking people .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	682.39	687.11	C	UI	inf	+1	1	But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	687.11	691.69	C	UI	inf	-1	0	uh and to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different , something that stands out .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	693.44	698.53	C	UI	sug	+1	1	Um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	698.53	701.04	C	UI	inf	+1	1	Uh the first of these is is technological
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	701.04	701.22	C	UI	fra	-1	0	ye
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	701.22	705.06	C	UI	el.sug	-1	0	uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	705.06	706.94	C	UI	inf	-1	0	The second is is economic ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	706.94	709.9	C	UI	sug	+1	1	uh we need to find a balance between features and price .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	709.9	710.24	C	UI	stl	-1	0	So
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	710.24	710.92	C	UI	inf	-1	0	as you mentioned
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	710.92	714.62	C	UI	inf	+1	1	things like voice recognition would would add to the price
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	714.62	717.93	C	UI	inf	+1	1	uh but it would also im improve the design of the product .
ES2008b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	716.18	716.5	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Hmm .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	720.05	720.68	C	UI	stl	-1	0	So
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	720.68	728.23	C	UI	inf	+1	1	I had a look on the {disfmarker} on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	728.23	733.03	C	UI	el.ass	+1	1	In analysing these we can consider what what things {disfmarker} what's good about them ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	733.03	734.31	C	UI	el.ass	-1	0	uh what things do they get right ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	734.31	735.42	C	UI	el.ass	-1	0	what's bad about them ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	735.42	736.69	C	UI	el.ass	-1	0	what's wrong with 'em ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	736.69	741.71	C	UI	el.sug	+1	1	um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	741.71	747.7	C	UI	el.sug	-1	0	and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	749.49	754.15	C	UI	inf	+1	1	Here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum .
ES2008b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	754.087	755.611	A	PM	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	754.15	761.76	C	UI	inf	+1	1	Um on the left here we've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control ,
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	755.523	757.345	B	ID	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	761.76	763.84	C	UI	inf	+1	1	so it's one that's got lots of buttons ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	763.84	765.74	C	UI	inf	-1	0	it's it's fully featured ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	765.74	767.81	C	UI	inf	+1	1	everything you might possibly want to do is there ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	767.81	773.56	C	UI	inf	-1	0	you know , it's got forward , backwards , up , down , channel numbers , volume , uh freeze frame .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	773.56	773.81	C	UI	stl	-1	0	Yeah ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	773.81	775.35	C	UI	inf	-1	0	it's it's fully featured
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	775.35	778.38	C	UI	inf	-1	0	and it might take a while to get to learn to use it ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	778.38	781.83	C	UI	inf	-1	0	but once you've learned it you can {disfmarker} you can do whatever you want with your T_V_ .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	782.58	784.39	C	UI	inf	+1	1	The one on the right is a lot more basic .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	784.39	789.39	C	UI	inf	-1	0	It's just got the essential functions of the T_V_ changing the channel , play , stop , volume .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	789.39	791.47	C	UI	inf	+1	1	It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	791.47	794.97	C	UI	inf	-1	0	but again th it's it's swings and roundabouts .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	794.97	795.88	C	UI	ass	-1	0	There are disadvantages ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	795.88	799.89	C	UI	inf	-1	0	you can't use it say to to freeze the television picture .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	799.89	803.4	C	UI	inf	+1	1	Uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	803.4	807.67	C	UI	sug	-1	0	So we've got to to find our {disfmarker} find a way of striking a balance between the two .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	809.92	813.89	C	UI	inf	-1	0	Um as I said before , remote controls are subjective ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	813.89	816.35	C	UI	inf	-1	0	different people want want different things .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	816.35	821.98	C	UI	inf	+1	1	Um personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that's simple ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	821.98	823.76	C	UI	inf	-1	0	it it's easy to use ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	823.76	829.12	C	UI	inf	+1	1	uh it's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel .
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	829.12	831.87	C	UI	inf	-1	0	It it does everything that I need it to uh ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	831.87	833.51	C	UI	be.neg	-1	0	as I said before , I'm quite lazy ,
ES2008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	833.51	837.19	C	UI	inf	-1	0	I don't wanna walk across the room just to adjust my television .

ES2008b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	919.73	920.74	A	PM	fra	-1	0	There are Y_s {gap} .
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	919.86	921.01	B	ID	stl	-1	0	Okay . So
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	921.01	923.07	B	ID	inf	+1	1	this is our working design presentation .
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	923.07	926.25	B	ID	ass	+1	1	Um I had a bit of {disfmarker} some issues with this ,
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	926.25	930.02	B	ID	inf	+1	1	because I wasn't able to find everything I needed ,
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	930.02	933.62	B	ID	inf	-1	0	but I guess that's {disfmarker} we're still in early stages .
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	933.62	935.48	B	ID	stl	-1	0	Um so , yeah ,
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	935.48	936.41	B	ID	inf	-1	0	this is this .
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	936.41	939.17	B	ID	fra	-1	0	Though th the thing about working design is the {disfmarker}
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	939.17	945.03	B	ID	inf	+1	1	what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function .
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	945.49	950.5	B	ID	inf	+1	1	Um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder .
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	950.5	951.01	B	ID	inf	-1	0	It works
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	951.01	954.63	B	ID	inf	+1	1	because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	954.63	957.2	B	ID	inf	-1	0	and then you put the bean through a filter
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	957.2	958.93	B	ID	inf	-1	0	and that filters out ,
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	958.93	961.19	B	ID	inf	-1	0	and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	961.19	966.76	B	ID	inf	+1	1	because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work .
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	966.76	968.58	B	ID	ass	-1	0	Don't know if I'm explaining that very well ,
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	968.58	970.16	B	ID	el.sug	-1	0	but {disfmarker} how do I get to the next s
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	970.16	970.34	B	ID	inf	-1	0	ah .
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	971.16	971.66	B	ID	stl	-1	0	So
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	971.66	973.9	B	ID	fra	-1	0	h the method as
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	973.9	979.65	B	ID	inf	-1	0	um working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function ,
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	979.65	981.36	B	ID	inf	-1	0	what what needs to be done
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	981.36	984.62	B	ID	inf	-1	0	and how do we convert all the elements to make that done .
ES2008b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	982.64	983.36	D	ME	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	984.62	985.84	B	ID	stl	-1	0	So
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	985.84	986.1	B	ID	fra	-1	0	wha
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	986.1	989.62	B	ID	inf	-1	0	the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	990.79	993.57	B	ID	inf	-1	0	at which you need something to happen .
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	993.57	1000.2	B	ID	inf	+1	1	So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function .
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	1000.2	1005.34	B	ID	sug	-1	0	And then I think the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately .
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	1005.34	1006.963	B	ID	stl	-1	0	So um {disfmarker}
ES2008b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	1008.42	1008.94	A	PM	fra	-1	0	You just press {disfmarker}
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	1008.15	1009.57	B	ID	oth	-1	0	Uh . Uh .
ES2008b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	1008.94	1009.1	A	PM	ass	-1	0	yeah ,
ES2008b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	1009.1	1009.92	A	PM	sug	-1	0	just click .
ES2008b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	1009.92	1010.35	A	PM	ass	-1	0	That'll be fine .
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	1010.66	1010.8	B	ID	stl	-1	0	So
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	1010.8	1020.78	B	ID	inf	+1	1	the findings that I got uh very {disfmarker} just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	1020.78	1023.92	B	ID	ass	+1	1	and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	1023.92	1025.69	B	ID	inf	-1	0	'cause you don't need a sight line .
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	1025.69	1027.8	B	ID	sug	-1	0	So that's one thing we're gonna work on .
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	1027.8	1029.79	B	ID	inf	+1	1	Um the user interface is critical here ,
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	1029.79	1037.47	B	ID	inf	+1	1	because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls {disfmarker} that converts the electrical energy into data ,
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	1037.47	1039.13	B	ID	inf	-1	0	which then goes through the infra-red ,
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	1039.13	1044.6	B	ID	inf	-1	0	so the the chip that uh I think Ian is designing , is gonna be crucial .
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	1045.07	1047.42	B	ID	inf	-1	0	And really it all comes down to the to the user ,
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	1047.42	1051.67	B	ID	inf	-1	0	because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design .
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	1051.67	1051.98	B	ID	stl	-1	0	So
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	1051.98	1065.86	B	ID	inf	+1	1	the components that we find here are the energy source , you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver .
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	1065.86	1067.79	B	ID	inf	-1	0	So you have four main components
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	1067.79	1071.0	B	ID	inf	-1	0	and they are designed sort of like this .
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	1071.0	1073.36	B	ID	inf	-1	0	You have your energy source right there
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	1073.36	1081.96	B	ID	inf	-1	0	which then um brings uh energy or information to the chip ,
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	1081.96	1084.35	B	ID	inf	-1	0	which is also controlled by the users .
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	1084.35	1087.85	B	ID	inf	-1	0	You have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip {disfmarker}
ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	1087.85	1091.39	B	ID	oth	-1	0	ooh 's not what I wanted to do uh uh .

ES2008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	1129.2	1133.1	B	ID	inf	-1	0	and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch
