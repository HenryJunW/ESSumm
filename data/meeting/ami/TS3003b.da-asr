TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	209.65	210.91	D	ME	inf	-1	0	you already knew that 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	212.1	214.26	D	ME	inf	-1	0	Um i've done some research we have we 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	214.26	217.58	D	ME	inf	+1	1	we have we uh the new research in a usability lab we we observed 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	217.58	223.02	D	ME	inf	+1	1	lab we we observed um users' operating remote controls uh without them fill 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	223.02	225.56	D	ME	inf	+1	1	uh without them fill out a questionnaire we had 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	225.56	228.22	D	ME	inf	-1	0	we had one hundred of these uh test subjects 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	229.36	236.64	D	ME	inf	+1	1	Uh in addition we did some market research uh see what the market consists of what ages are involved 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	238.9	239.13	D	ME	stl	-1	0	Well these are three 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	239.13	244.6	D	ME	ass	+1	1	these are three quite as punishing results i thought um remote 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	244.6	247.53	D	ME	inf	-1	0	um remote and being considered only for uh seventy 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	247.53	247.84	D	ME	fra	-1	0	for uh seventy 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	247.84	256.33	D	ME	inf	+1	1	for uh seventy five percent of the um People question of uh indicated that they thought their remote where was ugly um and 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	256.33	262.85	D	ME	inf	+1	1	um and an additional eighty percent indicated that would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control so 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	262.85	263.361	D	ME	stl	-1	0	control so 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	264.67	267.33	D	ME	inf	+1	1	Um in addition remote we're not very functional fifty percent of 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	267.33	273.32	D	ME	inf	+1	1	fifty percent of the people indicated they only use about ten percent of the buttons on the remote control 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	275.08	279.39	D	ME	inf	+1	1	And fifty percent of the people indicated that the remote tend to get lost in the room 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	280.47	280.8	D	ME	stl	-1	0	So 
TS3003b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	281.83	282.08	B	UI	bck	-1	0	Mm 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	282.33	283.07	D	ME	oth	-1	0	Some things 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	285.34	288.94	D	ME	inf	+1	1	Then we did some research to the most relevant functions channel 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	288.94	296.65	D	ME	inf	+1	1	channel selection and volume selection um but gotta turn on a scale of one to ten for relevancy the power 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	296.65	298.67	D	ME	inf	+1	1	the power button got online and teletext 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	298.67	301.17	D	ME	inf	+1	1	and teletext got uh a six and a half so these are the most 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	301.17	307.0	D	ME	inf	-1	0	so these are the most Most um important functions on a remote control then there are some one time 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	307.0	309.28	D	ME	inf	+1	1	there are some one time use function that's what i like to call 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	309.28	310.87	D	ME	inf	-1	0	that's what i like to call them that 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	310.87	315.5	D	ME	inf	+1	1	them that um audio settings video settings and channel settings buttons which are not really 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	315.5	318.62	D	ME	inf	+1	1	which are not really used very frequently but i 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	318.62	320.74	D	ME	inf	+1	1	but i still consider to be of some important 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	322.1	329.43	D	ME	inf	+1	1	Um channel selection was also indicated to be we used very frequently one hundred and sixty eight times per hour 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	332.14	333.38	D	ME	fra	-1	0	And these are the this is the market 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	333.38	335.02	D	ME	inf	-1	0	this is the market um 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	335.02	341.15	D	ME	inf	+1	1	um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty six 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	342.13	348.74	D	ME	inf	-1	0	Um Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control um 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	348.74	352.85	D	ME	inf	-1	0	um they like to use new from new functions but 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	352.85	354.38	D	ME	inf	-1	0	but they also are very critical they won't spend the money 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	354.38	356.37	D	ME	inf	-1	0	they won't spend the money very easily so 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	356.37	358.63	D	ME	stl	-1	0	so Um the users 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	358.63	364.23	D	ME	inf	+1	1	the users of forty six to sixty five years can say they make up forty percent of the market 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	365.24	367.31	D	ME	inf	+1	1	They're not really very interested in features but they do tend 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	367.31	369.97	D	ME	inf	+1	1	but they do tend to spend the money a lot easier 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	375.35	383.36	D	ME	sug	+1	1	Well i think this in the case for um Design i think we should make a remote for the future and this means 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	383.36	389.84	D	ME	sug	+1	1	and this means we would Um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	390.82	394.16	D	ME	inf	-1	0	Uh this also makes up most of the biggest part of the market so i 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	394.16	399.38	D	ME	inf	-1	0	so i will also be were remain profit would be Campbell 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	400.47	403.42	D	ME	sug	+1	1	Um this would be we would have to make a fancy design 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	404.85	416.14	D	ME	inf	+1	1	Um The results also indicated that um about one corner of the people questioned thought that uh remote control "'cause" there's r. s. i. 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	417.57	422.17	D	ME	sug	-1	0	Um this certainly it's something to take into account and thirty four percent 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	422.17	429.21	D	ME	inf	+1	1	and thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn how to operate a new control remote control so these are two factors 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	429.21	433.79	D	ME	sug	-1	0	so these are two factors that i think should be included in the design the size 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	433.79	436.72	D	ME	sug	-1	0	the size of course uh the remote must look very nice 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	438.07	444.07	D	ME	inf	-1	0	Um functionality As a lot of people indicated they only use about ten percent of the buttons i think we should 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	444.07	447.27	D	ME	sug	+1	1	i think we should make very few buttons and this will also 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	447.27	451.75	D	ME	ass	-1	0	and this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	453.27	461.62	D	ME	sug	+1	1	Uh i think be most frequently used buttons should be emphasized especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons "'cause" they're 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	461.62	462.79	D	ME	inf	-1	0	"'cause" they're used most and 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	462.79	465.39	D	ME	sug	-1	0	used most and so we should be robust we shouldn't 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	465.39	466.95	D	ME	sug	-1	0	we shouldn't breakdown easily 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	469.16	477.95	D	ME	inf	-1	0	Um Then as know it as a lot of people indicated that there are um remote got lost in the room it 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	477.95	478.51	D	ME	fra	-1	0	lost in the room it might be 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	479.62	480.53	D	ME	inf	-1	0	And i say it might be because it 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	480.53	486.78	D	ME	ass	-1	0	it might be because it would um certainly bruce the uh production costs a lot but it might 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	486.78	489.85	D	ME	sug	+1	1	a lot but it might be a good idea to make a docking station and 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	489.85	493.15	D	ME	sug	+1	1	and this would could get a button in it which would send the 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	493.15	495.44	D	ME	sug	+1	1	which would send the signal to the remote which wouldn't 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	495.44	496.29	D	ME	sug	+1	1	remote which wouldn't beep So you know 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	496.55	498.9	D	ME	inf	+1	1	beep So you know where it is in the room and 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	498.9	503.92	D	ME	sug	+1	1	and in addition to this it could um rechargeable batteries in the remote if you put it in 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	505.71	517.11	D	ME	inf	+1	1	Then um as pricing we need a great deal of people would indicated that um an l. c. d. screen in the remote control would be preferred this was um 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	517.11	524.36	D	ME	inf	+1	1	this was um Mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five but 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	524.36	528.06	D	ME	inf	-1	0	but up till forty five it remains feasible is it also greatly 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	528.06	530.86	D	ME	ass	+1	1	is it also greatly increase the production cost but 
TS3003b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	530.86	535.74	D	ME	sug	+1	1	production cost but i think these are just some small factories we could consider

TS3003b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	963.58	966.14	C	ID	inf	+1	1	So this is a schematic overview you've got the buttons

TS3003b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	985.58	986.9	C	ID	stl	-1	0	Well um i think 
TS3003b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	986.9	990.94	C	ID	sug	+1	1	um i think we should use d. for the materials simple plastics keep 
TS3003b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	990.94	992.24	C	ID	sug	+1	1	keep the inner workings simple so it's robust 
TS3003b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	992.24	994.41	C	ID	inf	-1	0	so it's robust um 
TS3003b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	994.41	998.41	C	ID	sug	+1	1	um so i think we should focus on aesthetics designer user interface because 
TS3003b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	998.41	1003.01	C	ID	ass	-1	0	because if you're going to use high tech materials the price is going to go sky high 
TS3003b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	1004.88	1008.29	C	ID	inf	-1	0	And uh you only have to design a remote once and if you use high tech 
TS3003b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	1008.29	1011.05	C	ID	inf	+1	1	and if you use high tech materials that come back in every product

TS3003b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	1012.38	1020.46	C	ID	ass	+1	1	So it's in my d. it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in dice in design and not in uh in the product itself
