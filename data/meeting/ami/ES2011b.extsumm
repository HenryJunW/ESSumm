we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control .
Um I've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings {vocalsound} {vocalsound} ,
and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder
Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked
Um , how do I put this {disfmarker}
So what happens it doesn't work ?
Could you just plug it back into hers
The cable might be a little loose or something .
In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um
a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory
Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look ,
they don't like the way they feel ,
they don't think they match their operating behaviour ,
and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons ,
and I think we should design according to these buttons .
I don't know what R_S_I_ means .
So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection .
yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently ,
Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power .
The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than {disfmarker} you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour ,
and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings ,
about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that .
And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds ,
um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product ,
while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent ,
but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely ,
Okay so now I need to press F_ eight , what is it ?
What's function ?
This my presentation about the uh technical functions design
and I basically just tried to focus on um {vocalsound} just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user .
And okay so basically um {vocalsound} I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way .
you know keeping buttons together that {disfmarker} like close together that um {vocalsound} are used in the same way ,
keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum ,
um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_ .
or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ?
{vocalsound} I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring ,
And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those .
uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um {vocalsound} like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user .
Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote ,
Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions ,
the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ .
And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is .
So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote ,
processor to take the information ,
and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration .
Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source ,
um a button pad for input ,
I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ ,
and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself .
and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in .
Um , teletext is apparently outdated , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . Um ,
also our remote should be used only for television , um ,
Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this ,
So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions .
so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ?
It's easy to implement .
So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range ,
but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme ,
if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey .
and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work ,
um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone .
Yeah , so it would be a two part package .
Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall
We probably leave that .
like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's {disfmarker}
Then it can live anywhere .
You don't need a light .
And like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so
'Cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities .
And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type , that's the the technology these days .
I think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take {disfmarker} like just reduce the number of buttons you know ,
like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a
you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_ .
So we definitely want a power button and numbers .
That sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah .
but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ?
you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then {disfmarker}
if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing {vocalsound} like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus .
Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like {disfmarker}
w right if you're on the channel let's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down .
But the only thing is like , iPods are so expensive ,
I don't think it's the wheel dealy .
like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just {disfmarker}
You know actually our our new project requirements , I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things .
So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next {disfmarker}
So {disfmarker} but I'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button ,
so like you're {disfmarker} if you're on T_V_ , like you can switch channels ,
but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks
