IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	479.65	487.37	D	ME	sug	+1	1	Okay so my personal preferences in this um project or are we really have to concentrate on this is all that is the selling 
IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	487.37	491.69	D	ME	inf	-1	0	that is the selling point the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase a 
IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	491.69	494.53	D	ME	inf	-1	0	a because wants there's no be back in mind cells 
IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	494.53	498.02	D	ME	inf	-1	0	in mind cells they always say you know be back still come back if somebody says i'll

IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	498.02	501.07	D	ME	inf	-1	0	if somebody says i'll come back in getting next week you're that they're never gonna come back and but 
IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	501.07	502.5	D	ME	inf	-1	0	they're never gonna come back and but you gotta make 
IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	502.5	505.9	D	ME	inf	-1	0	you gotta make it attractive enough to be by now now now we're now 
IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	505.9	509.83	D	ME	inf	-1	0	now now we're now was a big board and in my book for selling this thing 
IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	510.54	518.32	D	ME	sug	-1	0	And in order to make it really sellable we've got a short knowing curve make sure it's really intuitive in easy to use we have to have as 
IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	518.32	521.45	D	ME	sug	+1	1	we have to have as few buttons as possible because the more 
IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	521.45	523.76	D	ME	inf	+1	1	because the more buttons is more confusion so that's 
IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	523.76	526.03	D	ME	ass	-1	0	confusion so that's what i'm saying simplicity is good finding it's important obviously 
IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	526.03	528.95	D	ME	inf	-1	0	finding it's important obviously can't you can't find it so 
IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	528.95	532.27	D	ME	sug	+1	1	find it so gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it and i've already 
IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	532.27	535.66	D	ME	inf	-1	0	and i've already said this several times but i put it in writing here should be 
IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	535.66	539.11	D	ME	inf	-1	0	writing here should be an attractive impulse purchase a twenty five euros so it has to have an of 
IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	539.11	544.76	D	ME	inf	-1	0	so it has to have an of value that when somebody looks at at this it at twenty five euros an activity that has to 
IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	544.76	549.21	D	ME	inf	-1	0	that has to be so great that they're gonna say a twenty five euros isn't much um and 
IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	549.21	556.96	D	ME	sug	+1	1	um and then maybe a model like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use our marketing campaign okay 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	556.58	556.82	C	ID	bck	-1	0	Yeah

IS1009b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	616.32	616.63	A	PM	off	-1	0	Uh-huh 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	618.32	619.65	C	ID	fra	-1	0	The method is like uh in a remote 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	619.65	625.93	C	ID	inf	+1	1	like uh in a remote control you have a chip integrated set keywords which is like a pre of the remote control what it 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	625.93	628.26	C	ID	inf	+1	1	control what it takes the cover from a battery see battery 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	628.26	639.41	C	ID	inf	-1	0	see battery it can't be an l. a. and the chip supplied like you have to oh i like the the switch it can it can it can connect your uh remote control or to a power supply from the you know electricity or something like that it should be a battery 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	639.41	646.12	C	ID	inf	-1	0	that it should be a battery because uh a remote control should be like you you you should take it to do better but you want and then uh oh 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	646.12	648.03	C	ID	stl	-1	0	and then uh oh uh that that's integrated circuit 
IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	645.78	646.16	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Mm hmm 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	648.03	651.48	C	ID	inf	-1	0	that's integrated circuit it it takes energy from the power source and 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	651.48	656.2	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and ah what they would like if you press a button it's like a input for the remote control it and it takes the input 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	656.2	666.01	C	ID	inf	+1	1	it and it takes the input and it it to transforms into uh in front runner bits and it sends it it to the device like t. v. or that you can be spent something like that so Oh i remote 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	666.43	670.27	C	ID	inf	-1	0	Oh i remote control or is it specifically designed to a single device if you want to design 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	670.27	676.81	C	ID	inf	-1	0	if you want to design it for multiple devices that you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency make 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	676.81	683.73	C	ID	inf	-1	0	make uh the the remote control or it sends some bits some of the uh would be it's like but a particular frequency the device 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	683.73	686.29	C	ID	inf	-1	0	the device should know what the frequencies it should really 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	686.29	692.97	C	ID	inf	-1	0	it should really recognise that o. b. it's which are coming from that remote control it and it should be action like 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	692.97	701.47	C	ID	inf	-1	0	should be action like if you press the button channel or something like that then uh the remote uh remote control would send the centre so you send the signal and the t. 
IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	699.776	700.61	D	ME	inf	-1	0	Signal 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	701.47	709.46	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and the t. v. it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that change the volume control and 
IS1009b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	703.62	704.2	B	UI	inf	-1	0	See 
IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	707.08	707.38	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
IS1009b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	708.64	708.93	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	709.46	716.0	C	ID	inf	+1	1	and uh so uh i think it's hard to design a remote control for my people are devices

IS1009b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	716.5	722.92	D	ME	ass	+1	1	Yeah well that's already been eliminated by management sell more often but 
IS1009b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	718.19	718.98	A	PM	ass	-1	0	yeah that's 
IS1009b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	718.98	722.5	A	PM	fra	-1	0	yeah that's so

IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	726.28	729.97	C	ID	inf	+1	1	So all user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	729.97	732.76	C	ID	inf	-1	0	the messages like they should be a user user interface like 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	732.76	736.53	C	ID	inf	-1	0	like oh you know switch that or something like that but that should be there so uh you 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	736.53	738.67	C	ID	inf	-1	0	so uh you can control what the way you want you want to 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	738.67	753.63	C	ID	inf	-1	0	way you want you want to change the channel you want to control the what do you want to go new a new to the t. v. or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations that's that should that should be some device to tell what to do to that well in uh integrated so cute so that 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	753.63	760.4	C	ID	inf	-1	0	so cute so that the integrated circuit can't stand the signals and t. v. can pull for the Actions

IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	763.82	768.71	C	ID	off	-1	0	I i just would like to uh are are some extra features to the remote control uh well 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	768.71	777.21	C	ID	ass	-1	0	uh well i think these are the very simple features and uh they don't take much to our armour just though oh well investment also it's like uh oh

IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	777.21	787.96	C	ID	sug	+1	1	it's like uh oh the text or buttons which well which are there on the old remote control and it goes we can meet well or like fruit or cent uh 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	787.96	794.12	C	ID	inf	-1	0	uh they'll be like like a meeting if it is dark so that you can find your remote control if it is dark

IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.72	795.06	798.51	C	ID	sug	-1	0	And uh they should be i'll be as many buttons i pressed if suppose 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.73	798.51	815.15	C	ID	inf	+1	1	pressed if suppose that i used to lean but the the remote control and uh and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then they should be i'll be saying that it did this is not that all you know well well action did they can be no action take into that so and they should be outside 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.74	815.15	816.9	C	ID	sug	-1	0	and they should be outside to lock like 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.75	816.9	831.82	C	ID	inf	+1	1	to lock like well well you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh what they were buttons are presently a child second be like you if you if you have key kids and all then they'll be sleeping with remote controls so can you know the remote control it 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.76	831.82	837.15	C	ID	ass	-1	0	remote control it to make it usable for more than one device it's a it's hard but i think it's possible i yeah

IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	911.06	913.92	C	ID	inf	-1	0	if there are more buttons then it will be more complicated if 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	913.92	917.48	C	ID	inf	-1	0	if you have less features then your remote control it won't be attractive so i think 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	917.48	925.61	C	ID	sug	+1	1	so i think that we need to make some buttons which are which are like l. b. o. uh in a in didn't it for two was the operations like if you 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	925.61	932.99	C	ID	inf	-1	0	like if you press one button in one more than it would change the channel if you press the other button and and uh that would be to change the colour so 
IS1009b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	932.99	939.01	C	ID	ass	-1	0	the colour so if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but i think it will complicate them at home what i think so
