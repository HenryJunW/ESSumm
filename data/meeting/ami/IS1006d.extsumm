Okay . So first , {vocalsound} let's uh see the prototype .
And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this {vocalsound} jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . {vocalsound}
So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume .
And we have speech recognition .
Here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise .
And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser .
{vocalsound} Oh , these are strawberries . {vocalsound}
{vocalsound} Material , we want to stick to titanium .
So , we want to have {vocalsound} simple and perfect shapes , like I shown in these phones .
And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours .
For the L_C_D_ .
wh what are the strawberries for ? {vocalsound}
That's location sensors .
let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium . {vocalsound}
so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven .
One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is .
what do you think , is it fancy ? {vocalsound}
So here , two . Up .
Then we have uh technology .
d I think it's a one for that , at least .
Robustness , uh-huh .
It's um robust , yeah .
Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ?
The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial .
And if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this .
It's much longer than that that being two two five , no ?
we only address two main functions here
and the other functions will be on L_C_D_ . So
It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen .
Okay , two . {vocalsound}
{vocalsound} So size and weight .
Up to three for that ,
Colour and shape .
The case is silver titanium , no ?
{vocalsound} And what about the strawberries on the top ?
{vocalsound} I'm not convince .
{vocalsound} Well y you know , it's this uh fruit and vegetable year .
We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too .
So , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours .
Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and {disfmarker}
I suggested three .
And uh the last one is adaptive .
Okay . {vocalsound} Let's go for one . {vocalsound}
Now we have to do the average . {vocalsound}
Two point one seven .
So now , it has to fulfil the {vocalsound} financial criterium ?
We need only one battery .
We have sample chip .
And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition . {vocalsound}
Yeah , I think we will go for a single curve ,
Titanium .
How many push-button ?
Two .
The scroll-wheel , okay .
One L_C_D_ displayed .
So we are at seventeen dot eight .
Are we supposed to cut things out now ?
{vocalsound} So think of what we can cut uh here . {vocalsound}
if I look at what is the most expensive things , uh it's the L_C_D_
and the speaker .
Apparently , we have to choose one or the other . {vocalsound}
I mean , producing electricity from mechanical energy .
to make electricity .
So , but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay ,
We we win one .
So , put minus one there , please . {vocalsound}
{vocalsound} I'm not sure if this is legal .
Okay , we're uh on target .
Project evaluation , good . {vocalsound}
Mm . See mm how {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Are we a good team ? Mm .
Is there enough room for creativity ?
Yeah , yeah .
Team-work , very strong , I would say .
I think white-board is useful .
Digital pens , useful .
{vocalsound} Ah , we got new idea , speech recognition , location finding . New materials , new s uh this fancy strawberry design .
