ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	255.42	256.56	D	ME	inf	-1	0	device will come to that later so that was one of 
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	256.56	258.49	D	ME	inf	-1	0	later so that was one of the first things we did also with our

ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	270.29	285.99	D	ME	inf	+1	1	At so the general findings from that was that in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls where People want a fancy look and feel rather than the the current functional look-and-feel of remote controls they 
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	285.99	289.55	D	ME	inf	+1	1	they also also what a remote control to be technologically innovative 
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	290.9	294.2	D	ME	inf	+1	1	And of course as you can take that it should be easy to use uh we should point 
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.26	294.2	299.74	D	ME	inf	+1	1	uh we should point out that the first of those findings fancy look-and-feel is d. most important is twice 
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	299.74	303.5	D	ME	inf	+1	1	most important is twice as important as the second technologically innovative which is in turn 
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	303.5	306.4	D	ME	inf	+1	1	which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use 
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	307.84	311.29	D	ME	inf	-1	0	So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually fired it's still important

ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	324.13	335.05	D	ME	inf	+1	1	um we find from our um consultants in paris and milan who did attended all the design in fashion fears and the fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes shoes and furniture so should we be thinking of using

ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	879.6	888.99	C	ID	inf	+1	1	be made nice to current remotes use this so the can Uh p. c. b. board which pretty printed circuit board which 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	888.99	896.86	C	ID	inf	-1	0	which basically has these context of really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button and it'll connect the circuit and 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	896.86	905.36	C	ID	inf	-1	0	the circuit and each each which is connected to to uh at different likes on the chip and say sends a different message and 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.119	905.36	911.47	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and that then Uh gets translates by the chip into account and then it's find 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.120	911.47	917.68	C	ID	inf	-1	0	account and then it's find out of this l. e. d. a. in the sequence of log on and off busts

ES2004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.107	922.38	928.079	B	PM	el.inf	-1	0	to stick "'em" in varying sizes or is it just one size or we would have to fit the design of 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.121	925.27	925.6	C	ID	stl	-1	0	Well 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.122	927.14	928.47	C	ID	stl	-1	0	About this with the the thing about 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.123	928.47	934.36	C	ID	inf	+1	1	with the the thing about it is um That they can be as big or small as you want today because you 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.125	934.36	937.94	C	ID	inf	-1	0	today because you can you can print circuit board like that the 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.126	937.94	943.54	C	ID	inf	-1	0	like that the it's it's simply space like that so you can have the than the size of the non buttons and if you v. 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.128	943.54	952.11	C	ID	inf	-1	0	if you v. c. has then the track so you could you could see you could put them virtually of right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one if you if you want

ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.141	992.18	994.39	C	ID	sug	+1	1	but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.142	994.39	999.99	C	ID	sug	-1	0	buttons and um also like five or ten seconds and not being used i have that and off if 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.143	999.99	1003.04	C	ID	inf	-1	0	that and off if we decide to skate for buttons it could light up

ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.144	1004.91	1014.17	C	ID	inf	+1	1	Um the case material i've uh been sent what we factory can actually give us The there's

ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.153	1028.77	1030.03	C	ID	inf	+1	1	with being why you could go forward but i think a bit impractical 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.154	1030.03	1032.5	C	ID	ass	+1	1	but i think a bit impractical type thing 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.151	1032.5	1037.98	C	ID	inf	+1	1	type thing and Um very expensive just a process

ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.152	1037.98	1040.95	C	ID	inf	-1	0	just a process which to make it is expensive and 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.155	1040.95	1043.24	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and rubber where you saying

ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.163	1076.32	1078.67	C	ID	inf	-1	0	but that's what they said um 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.164	1078.67	1084.82	C	ID	inf	-1	0	they said um the u. problem with a casing is that Uh there is

ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.166	1094.17	1098.18	C	ID	inf	+1	1	if you gave type thing in making a do a standard box shape where is if you come 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.167	1098.18	1104.96	C	ID	inf	+1	1	where is if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do use of curved shapes uh 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.168	1104.96	1106.82	C	ID	fra	-1	0	shapes uh whether whether or not because 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.169	1106.82	1109.2	C	ID	inf	-1	0	whether or not because we'd have into separate units 
ES2004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	1111.24	1112.77	A	UI	stl	-1	0	Second thing is yeah and 
ES2004c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.115	1111.47	1112.76	B	PM	ass	-1	0	Changed yeah 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.170	1111.37	1112.42	C	ID	inf	-1	0	The for the flip fine 
ES2004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	1112.77	1116.1	A	UI	inf	+1	1	yeah and second question is like a mobile you can change the colour of your colour the skin or the 
ES2004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	1116.1	1117.63	A	UI	inf	-1	0	your colour the skin or the wheel so in

ES2004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	1117.63	1123.63	A	UI	inf	+1	1	wheel so in this case if you're looking at like that "'cause" we can change the colour like from green battered into c. d. to do something like that so is that 
ES2004c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	1121.34	1121.56	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
ES2004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	1123.63	1126.45	A	UI	el.inf	-1	0	that so is that feature available in like go titanium or it's like 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.172	1123.21	1123.83	C	ID	fra	-1	0	Yeah i think 
ES2004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	1126.45	1129.236	A	UI	el.inf	-1	0	or it's like only specific the plastic

ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.174	1128.23	1132.4	C	ID	inf	-1	0	Yeah in the entire thing why don't i don't think it would be available it's overly but it 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.175	1132.4	1134.11	C	ID	stl	-1	0	but it just it will well

ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.176	1134.11	1137.65	C	ID	inf	-1	0	it will well you could make it available in that type thing and it's just 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.177	1137.65	1145.28	C	ID	inf	-1	0	type thing and it's just a would be so expensive to buy new case for it because of the expense of how much that aim is is is to like in 
ES2004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	1141.18	1141.45	A	UI	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.179	1145.28	1146.65	C	ID	inf	-1	0	is to like in strong but 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.180	1146.65	1151.0	C	ID	ass	-1	0	strong but i think it should be left factor of design rather than for

ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.198	1215.6	1219.57	C	ID	inf	-1	0	colours and uh it's a used just by charging that you think or it makes connection 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.199	1220.71	1222.75	C	ID	inf	-1	0	Oh is that if you have to close enough that 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.200	1222.75	1224.65	C	ID	inf	-1	0	close enough that would be one option um 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.201	1224.65	1228.36	C	ID	inf	-1	0	um the second option and they'll for rubber buttons but i thought 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.202	1228.36	1232.47	C	ID	sug	+1	1	but i thought that an l. c. d. type of screen because one 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.203	1232.47	1238.31	C	ID	inf	-1	0	because one they're incredibly then Um and they they come out space to 
ES2004c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.204	1238.31	1249.58	C	ID	inf	-1	0	to vary you can have them in us all of our brain you could a range the buttons on the screen in that solves that thing and you could have to like attach 
ES2004c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	1250.61	1253.104	A	UI	und	-1	0	So that is that the last or you could have
