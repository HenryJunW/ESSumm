ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.43	419.74	424.87	B	ID	inf	+1	1	as i think the the wasn't too much difference in the cost but the race the actual buttons but 
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.44	424.87	427.08	B	ID	inf	+1	1	the actual buttons but does affect the printed circuit board um there's next 
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.45	427.08	429.18	B	ID	inf	-1	0	um there's next haitian basically for the the 
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.46	429.18	438.42	B	ID	inf	-1	0	basically for the the circuit board which is the middle this see them that the chipset uh by the way things of the uh still um of the remote The

ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.50	457.03	461.3	B	ID	inf	+1	1	Um one final think we can move for some information the speech recognition is the small 
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.51	461.3	467.56	B	ID	inf	+1	1	is the small unit available through the the company um we chose you would be nice to cost between the

ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.53	470.18	474.37	B	ID	inf	-1	0	and i guess that would require yeah more fun stick a poster is next 
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.54	474.37	476.58	B	ID	inf	-1	0	a poster is next a price in a sense that is as 
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.55	476.58	479.0	B	ID	inf	-1	0	that is as an extra cost nonsense and there is what this preferences 
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.56	479.0	485.84	B	ID	inf	+1	1	and there is what this preferences um As a policy for how we could use kinetic and 
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.57	485.84	490.01	B	ID	inf	-1	0	and which the idea of the watches and you move you move the remote around 
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.58	490.01	492.66	B	ID	inf	-1	0	move the remote around to power that and it's

ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.60	497.82	505.97	B	ID	inf	+1	1	um for the past since i saw we put we go it's having the standard um pushbuttons of them the scroll wheel 
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.61	507.22	513.9	B	ID	inf	+1	2	Um and for the circuit board again depends on which features we want a national minimum wage to 
ES2014c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.62	513.9	521.56	B	ID	inf	+1	2	wage to be one of the scroll-wheel the one the voice recognition um that we'd have to get uh a more costly circuit board That's it
