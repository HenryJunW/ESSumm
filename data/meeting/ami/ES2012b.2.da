ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	125.97	131.94	PM	A	inf	+1	1	Um and that people might want it as as {disfmarker} in addition to their existing remote controls .
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	131.94	140.6	PM	A	inf	-1	0	Um {vocalsound} and that it sh it should just always work , whenever you uh um mm uh use it .

ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	158.86	162.34	PM	A	off	+1	1	I'll shortly ask for for three three presentations .
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	162.34	168.52	PM	A	off	+1	1	Uh before I do that , however , I will go through some new project requirements
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	168.52	171.77	PM	A	inf	+1	1	that um {disfmarker} the the management have placed on us

ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	179.0	185.86	PM	A	inf	+1	1	Um the uh the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	185.86	191.49	PM	A	inf	+1	1	and uh the they don't necessarily agree with with what we uh we thought .
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	191.49	193.56	PM	A	fra	-1	0	Um and and then we'll {disfmarker}
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	193.56	200.64	PM	A	sug	-1	0	as a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device um actually b carrying out ,
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	200.64	204.44	PM	A	inf	-1	0	and we have uh forty minutes to do this in
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	204.44	205.056	PM	A	fra	-1	0	and I uh {disfmarker}
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	212.02	219.29	PM	A	stl	-1	0	Anyway . Okay . Now ,
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	219.29	233.89	PM	A	inf	+1	2	the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet .
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	233.89	237.8	PM	A	inf	+1	2	Um and and they want it only to cover televisions .
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	238.89	240.08	PM	A	stl	-1	0	Um now ,
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	240.08	243.11	PM	A	ass	+1	1	what is not q quite clear from their directive is
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	243.11	247.08	PM	A	el.inf	+1	1	whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	247.08	256.03	PM	A	inf	+1	1	or whether they don't want it to cover , you know , videos , D_V_D_s , um satellite boxes ,
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	256.03	262.2	PM	A	inf	+1	1	which uh {disfmarker} I mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise .
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	262.2	266.95	PM	A	inf	+1	1	The um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only .
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	267.69	275.85	PM	A	sug	-1	0	Um and on that basis um I I think we we need to bear that in mind ,
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	275.85	288.48	PM	A	inf	-1	0	um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer {disfmarker} they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things .
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	288.48	295.49	PM	A	inf	+1	2	Um {vocalsound} the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours .
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	295.49	303.46	PM	A	inf	+1	1	Um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there , the the the two R_s in grey against uh a yellow background .
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	304.25	305.13	PM	A	stl	-1	0	Um now
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	305.13	312.74	PM	A	sug	+1	1	this doesn't {vocalsound} necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market .
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	312.74	317.92	PM	A	inf	-1	0	But uh do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that .
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	317.92	320.5	PM	A	sug	-1	0	Um it also has to be simple ,
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	320.5	323.46	PM	A	inf	-1	0	which to some extent goes along w with the first one ,
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	323.46	325.64	PM	A	inf	-1	0	and that {disfmarker} we've already said that it must be simple
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	325.64	327.99	PM	A	inf	-1	0	'cause that's what people want anyway .
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	327.99	333.71	PM	A	inf	+1	2	Um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly ,
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	333.71	339.27	PM	A	inf	-1	0	which um mm {vocalsound} uh is is is their choice ,
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	339.27	346.11	PM	A	sug	+1	1	but uh um we we need to talk that through .

ES2012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	485.73	492.23	ME	D	inf	+1	1	See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly .
ES2012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	493.88	500.98	ME	D	sug	-1	0	So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly {vocalsound} .

ES2012b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	512.76	519.75	ME	D	inf	-1	0	if we can make it look better , it'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up .

ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	1263.04	1266.34	UI	C	inf	+1	1	this is just about the technical functions .
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.196	1265.02	1265.45	PM	A	bck	-1	0	Alright .
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	1266.34	1267.06	UI	C	stl	-1	0	So
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	1267.06	1270.89	UI	C	inf	+1	1	the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	1270.89	1275.28	UI	C	inf	+1	1	and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	1275.28	1283.13	UI	C	inf	-1	0	and um identify what the necessary things are , what people are {disfmarker} what you really wanna have a remote control do .
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	1283.13	1286.09	UI	C	inf	+1	1	Um and then there are two different kinds that I found .
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	1286.09	1289.17	UI	C	inf	+1	1	There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	1289.17	1290.47	UI	C	inf	-1	0	which I will have pictures of
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	1290.47	1293.84	UI	C	sug	-1	0	and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be .
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.197	1290.98	1291.3	PM	A	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	1295.469	1296.6	UI	C	stl	-1	0	{vocalsound} So
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	1296.6	1300.0	UI	C	inf	+1	1	these are the two different ones .
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	1300.0	1302.66	UI	C	inf	+1	1	This one um {disfmarker} this is the user centred ,
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	1302.66	1307.49	UI	C	inf	+1	1	it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons

ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	1307.49	1310.87	UI	C	inf	+1	1	and then this is the engineering centred ,
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	1310.87	1312.46	UI	C	inf	+1	1	which has a lot more buttons ,
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.198	1312.17	1312.64	PM	A	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	1312.46	1317.01	UI	C	inf	-1	0	and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	1317.01	1319.28	UI	C	inf	-1	0	that you don't use .
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	1319.28	1321.41	UI	C	stl	-1	0	So basically ,
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	1321.41	1326.09	UI	C	inf	+1	1	what a remote control is is you {disfmarker} it's to send messages to the television set ,
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	1326.09	1326.59	UI	C	stl	-1	0	you know ,
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	1326.59	1331.25	UI	C	inf	+1	1	turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that .
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	1331.25	1334.2	UI	C	inf	+1	1	And so for this product it's gonna be television only ,
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	1334.2	1337.82	UI	C	inf	+1	1	and then it has to have the uh logos
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	1338.92	1341.47	UI	C	inf	-1	0	for the company and the colours .
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	1341.47	1342.19	UI	C	stl	-1	0	And so ,
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	1342.19	1345.82	UI	C	ass	+1	1	for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	1345.82	1348.32	UI	C	ass	+1	2	and has quite a {disfmarker} you know , fewer buttons .
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	1348.32	1353.27	UI	C	inf	+1	1	Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	1353.27	1356.91	UI	C	inf	-1	0	and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have .
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	1356.91	1358.66	UI	C	inf	-1	0	It looks kind of narrow at the top ,
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	1358.66	1362.2	UI	C	sug	+1	1	and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top ,
ES2012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.199	1361.2	1362.13	PM	A	bck	-1	0	Mm , yeah .
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	1362.2	1363.46	UI	C	ass	+1	1	then that would be easier .
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	1364.25	1366.16	UI	C	stl	-1	0	Um {vocalsound} and so
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	1366.16	1368.58	UI	C	sug	-1	0	we have to decide what's gonna make our product different .
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	1368.58	1369.61	UI	C	fra	-1	0	E
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	1369.61	1371.76	UI	C	sug	+1	1	the unique style , maybe have it light up
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	1371.76	1373.52	UI	C	inf	-1	0	so it's visible in the dark ,
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	1373.52	1375.68	UI	C	sug	+1	2	um the changeable face-plates ,
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	1375.68	1378.02	UI	C	fra	-1	0	and the lighting up and visible I was {disfmarker}
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	1378.02	1379.97	UI	C	inf	+1	1	when we were talking about havi losing it ,
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	1379.97	1386.28	UI	C	sug	+1	1	maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it {disfmarker} maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that ,
ES2012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	1386.28	1391.45	UI	C	ass	-1	0	so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that .
