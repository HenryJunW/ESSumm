let's uh talk about the interface uh concept .
Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose ,
uh show you some samples , uh
uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already .
And uh my personal preferences .
{vocalsound} Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off .
the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off .
The channels buttons , one to nine ,
zero to nine ,
and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine .
Uh the volume and channel quadrants ,
uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel .
And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display .
Um , I found some uh interesting uh uh samples . Examples .
Um , well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's {disfmarker} that they're all pretty uh uh high uh {disfmarker}
Large .
Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long .
A lot {disfmarker} a lot of buttons buttons .
Um , power buttons are mostly at the top
uh left or right .
Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue .
And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons .
Some buttons have icons like the play and stop ,
but we don't use that .
But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters .
Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they're both uh a V_ .
So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that .
For the uh menu , what do we use for that ?
We don't have buttons for the menu .
Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel {gap} .
I thought that was our uh idea .
And that the menu button is okay .
Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows .
The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean .
Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting .
But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case .
Uh , round edges .
The logo at the bottom .
And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour .
Uh , recognisable .
{vocalsound} Not too much colours .
Uh , no . Not too much .
But this has to be has to be trendy
Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion .
Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want ,
our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to .
And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also .
First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours .
Like , totally yellow , totally red .
Uh , the shapes are curved and round ,
Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long .
But to give him the shape of your hand , so you {disfmarker} it's easier to use or something like that .
The battery , there are few options .
Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery .
Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it's also nice {gap} have it curved .
And maybe like it's hand-shaped .
Uh material , you use plastic . Hard plastic
And also rubber
Uh the push-buttons .
We have one new thing uh discovered .
It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse .
Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels .
When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up
and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , uh if you wanna see that channel .
You can do it with your thumb .
And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons
The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips .
There are also uh simple chips .
They are uh cheaper .
Um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control ,
And you have also advanced um chips .
But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen .
And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ ,
And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the {disfmarker} for remote control ,
that we then use the primary colours .
This is with an L_C_D_ ? No ,
Not with an L_C_D_ .
But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons .
But then it's not easy to use scroll uh wheel .
but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty .
but like we said before , it has to be used on every television .
Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our uh remote control .
but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls .
And I think , what I said , everybody has them uh has them already .
And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news .
Uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without ?
{vocalsound} I got it on my screen and it was uh higher .
But I don't know uh how much higher . {vocalsound}
I think if we have an L_C_D_ , it will also sell a lot better .
And that might uh bring back the costs uh {disfmarker}
I think we must discuss who {disfmarker} uh what will be better . If we have a better shape of the um remote control , or better options on it .
With a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a L_C_D_ . And then a flat um remote control .
Or , a more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without L_C_D_ .
Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ .
Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip .
A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range .
The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip .
So , my uh presentation is about trend-watching .
Uh , well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers .
They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan .
Uh , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich .
Well th and the young and trendy , they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes , shoes , and also uh products .
And um , material ? That should feel {disfmarker} have uh a spongy feeling .
Then the old and rich .
They like uh dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes .
Well , uh then already come to my personal preferences .
We uh aim at the younger market .
However , with trends it's always if there's {disfmarker} it's now .
It it it might last one year , and next year it be {disfmarker} uh can be totally different .
Well , we have to decide on the concept .
Maybe one of you can paint it on the board .
Can make several uh concepts .
We have this , and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand .
This is the remote control .
And then you have something like th this under it .
So , it has to be soft ?
And it has to be soft , yeah .
Buttons on top of it .
The scrolling . You can do it with your thumb .
But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here .
If we have a menu , uh how do we uh choose other options ?
with the menu uh button .
And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it .
But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu .
Uh , then we have it on the T_V_ , the menu .
Yeah , but {vocalsound} again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ?
And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher .
we make two concepts .
One with L_C_D_ . One without L_C_D_ .
And and this one has to be soft .
And this has to be harder ,
Or some kind of rubber around it .
And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger .
It's not good to use .
One with two scroll buttons and one with without .
Uh , one with a with a menu , and one without a menu .
And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_ .
Yes , but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose .
Then it depends on the cost .
M uh yeah , maybe it's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um
more separate , yeah .
Like , you have the menu button in between uh {disfmarker}
When you uh {gap} the menu , you have to go there there there there .
I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for .
We have two buttons missing .
The mute button .
Mute . And the other .
Personally , I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle .
But how do you wanna solve it ?
With the switch button .
Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy .
Uh , then you can also have like uh th um {disfmarker}
Yeah , and joystick , I think .
Does that break , a joystick ?
Or a small one just like in a laptop .
But how expensive it is ? {vocalsound}
For the young peoples I think scroll button's good .
That's not expensive than uh {disfmarker} Joystick is better .
I mean the the shape of the remote control .
Just like a Playstation thing .
Maybe , if it's possible , {vocalsound} it's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better .
And on the L_C_D_ , how much it costs ?
they're not uh in details .
It's more expensive or less expensive , huh ? {vocalsound}
So , after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it .
Then for the components , we use a normal battery .
Then it's {disfmarker} Ch cheapest way , I think .
Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive .
Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ .
If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip .
If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip .
And uh , we {disfmarker} If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to
Uh the most expensive .
So , uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_
Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ?
If you have pistol , it {disfmarker} L_C_D_'s not easy .
if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller .
Now we put uh rubber around it .
Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber .
Then this is the design .
And the buttons are on the next page .
So , depends on the cost .
Next meeting . Thirty minutes .
You two stay here . {vocalsound}
Check your mail .
It has to be ready in the next meeting .
Next meeting is called the detailed design .
