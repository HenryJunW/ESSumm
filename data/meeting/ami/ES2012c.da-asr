ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	16.57	21.48	A	PM	be.pos	+1	1	think if if we since the meeting of the uh uh design group um 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	21.48	27.05	A	PM	ass	-1	0	um i think we uh made some different progress the last one Um then 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	27.05	34.25	A	PM	ass	-1	0	Um then comes interesting uh Uh it's suggestions for a tiny remote control um our 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	34.25	40.4	A	PM	off	+1	1	um our again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting um 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	40.4	48.71	A	PM	inf	+1	1	um Yeah the the problem with existing remote controls we felt as well so they're ugly Um 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	48.71	52.21	A	PM	inf	-1	0	Um then the people at at at a premium just me best uh um they've got lots 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	52.21	53.8	A	PM	inf	+1	1	um they've got lots of buttons on the on the 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	53.8	55.81	A	PM	inf	+1	1	of buttons on the on the other people don't use and find 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	55.81	57.71	A	PM	inf	-1	0	don't use and find difficult to learn um 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	57.71	59.83	A	PM	inf	+1	1	um that people use um and 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	59.83	69.84	A	PM	inf	-1	0	and We we thought that's it for a a new uh Uh remote control that we want to rush and by um 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	69.84	76.22	A	PM	inf	+1	1	um that we that we should look at speech recognition of the rubber of the buttons and uh if you have any buttons 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	76.22	84.39	A	PM	inf	+1	1	and uh if you have any buttons there should be very few of them in any for they use functions that are cheating tried to the people use um 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	84.39	84.54	A	PM	fra	-1	0	um 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	84.54	89.05	A	PM	inf	+1	1	um we want to get a four at that a a longlasting battery that we get we guarantee 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	89.05	93.1	A	PM	inf	-1	0	we get we guarantee for the life of the uh of the product and the shapes that 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	93.1	103.84	A	PM	inf	+1	1	and the shapes that will be easily recognisable i. e. and as a a trendy remote control and and be as a a real reaction product so 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	103.84	117.648	A	PM	inf	-1	0	so that uh when people are uh happy with that they will be able to buy and everything else from as Uh 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	119.56	124.58	A	PM	stl	-1	0	I mean So again 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	124.58	130.4	A	PM	inf	+1	1	So again um how will have a three three presentations from uh the the the three of you and then uh 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	130.4	138.18	A	PM	inf	+1	1	you and then uh Well we'll make a final the final uh decision um and 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	138.18	145.17	A	PM	sug	+1	1	um and the the decisions that we need to to make today funny are um what energy source we want to use whether it is practical 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	145.17	151.35	A	PM	el.ass	-1	0	whether it is practical to use uh and Uh a longlasting one and uh 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	151.35	161.4	A	PM	inf	+1	1	and uh i don't i think a discussion was around the fact that if we go in a jail for a a long lasting power supply then basically it's uh sealed for life and that if 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	161.4	166.18	A	PM	inf	-1	0	and that if you just one is to run one then we'll we'll give them another one and uh it it will 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	166.18	172.43	A	PM	inf	-1	0	and uh it it will be a in a prominently displayed is possibly the uh the transmit richer that's it so 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	172.43	177.25	A	PM	inf	-1	0	richer that's it so um um there for life guaranteed for life 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	178.08	181.15	A	PM	sug	-1	0	Um that'd be the internal shape um then then 
ES2012c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	181.15	186.81	A	PM	sug	+1	1	um then then this is where i need to Uh kate's expertise advice and

ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	323.429	324.22	B	ID	stl	-1	0	Okay they say i just i 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	324.22	327.18	B	ID	inf	+1	1	they say i just i looked at what exactly the remote still uh basically they 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	327.18	330.61	B	ID	inf	+1	1	uh basically they way if you press a key or give a voice command and then 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	330.61	334.68	B	ID	inf	+1	1	and then this is translated uh into a light signals which are 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	334.68	336.82	B	ID	inf	+1	1	signals which are then seen by the t. v. uh 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	336.82	342.83	B	ID	inf	+1	2	uh the materials we're gonna need to look at uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery um and 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	342.83	350.87	B	ID	inf	+1	2	um and been integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with uh a diode transistor resonator uh two more resistors and it a pastor and 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	350.87	358.114	B	ID	inf	+1	2	a pastor and the battery works in conjunction with a sister and i can pass or Mm 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	360.3	363.4	B	ID	inf	+1	2	Uh basically what happens is you press a number or give a voice command and this creates 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	363.4	366.77	B	ID	inf	+1	2	and this creates a a connection with and uh the remote that has 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	366.77	367.68	B	ID	fra	-1	0	that has the chip the chip than 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	367.68	369.33	B	ID	inf	+1	2	the chip the chip than sense as as connection and produces 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	369.33	373.25	B	ID	inf	+1	2	and produces a signal in a morse code format the signal sent a 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	373.25	374.8	B	ID	inf	+1	2	the signal sent a transistor which 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	374.8	375.86	B	ID	inf	-1	0	transistor which amplifies it and 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	375.86	378.93	B	ID	inf	+1	2	amplifies it and then sends it on t. v. light emitting diode and 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	378.93	379.66	B	ID	fra	-1	0	and uh uh which is 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	379.66	383.12	B	ID	inf	+1	2	uh uh which is then the train changed into uh infrared light which is sent a t. 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	383.12	384.25	B	ID	inf	-1	0	which is sent a t. v. answer seen 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	384.25	386.0	B	ID	inf	-1	0	v. answer seen by the t. v. and watch uh 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	386.0	388.51	B	ID	inf	-1	0	and watch uh change the channels 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	389.261	394.66	B	ID	stl	-1	0	Uh-huh Mm Cool 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	394.66	395.64	B	ID	oth	-1	0	Cool 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	403.895	405.34	B	ID	stl	-1	0	Uh so as for how 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	405.34	410.67	B	ID	inf	+1	1	as for how we should end up uh use it as a remote of a warming questions are the buttons are you 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	410.67	416.45	B	ID	inf	+1	1	are you are fewer buttons you have a guest a few internal connections and channel codes are gonna need um 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	417.51	424.44	B	ID	ass	+1	1	However uh to not have buttons are to use a voice commands is the buttons might make these connections more difficult and i raise 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	424.44	425.91	B	ID	ass	-1	0	and i raise production cost 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	425.91	427.58	B	ID	sug	-1	0	production cost something we should think about also we have 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	427.58	429.82	B	ID	sug	+1	1	also we have to work within the company constraints and 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	429.82	434.47	B	ID	inf	+1	1	constraints and the company's an for me in the email that that they're extra to push buttons or that seems 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	434.47	438.15	B	ID	ass	+1	1	buttons or that seems to be the most uh cost effective way of producing it Um 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	438.88	443.57	B	ID	inf	+1	1	it Um also with battery connections the company has some other than the batteries so we can use so i was 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	443.57	449.08	B	ID	sug	+1	1	can use so i was thinking perhaps combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery and somehow to the combination 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	449.08	456.13	B	ID	inf	+1	2	and somehow to the combination had to would maybe look up with something that uh will last a lifetime of the five ten years and we could 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	456.13	458.94	B	ID	inf	-1	0	and we could still keep that original idea 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	459.655	464.97	B	ID	sug	+1	1	Um we have to do the chips of the cost and aligned purses off the shelf and 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	464.97	467.67	B	ID	ass	+1	3	the shelf and the custom design will give us much more flexibility enable 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	467.67	472.4	B	ID	inf	+1	1	flexibility enable us to incorporate voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon um how that's 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	472.4	473.85	B	ID	ass	+1	1	um how that's gonna cost more but 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	473.85	476.65	B	ID	ass	+1	1	gonna cost more but the the off the shelf is gonna be uh it cheaper it's gonna 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	476.65	479.26	B	ID	inf	-1	0	it cheaper it's gonna be a mass produce a quite daring get out there faster but it's going to be less 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	479.26	484.05	B	ID	ass	+1	1	but it's going to be less flexible with the features that she things like a voice activation was haven't really been used 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	484.05	486.27	B	ID	inf	-1	0	was haven't really been used much on remote so there's many chips 
ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	486.27	489.69	B	ID	inf	-1	0	so there's many chips out there that would be easy to uh to give ourself we're

ES2012c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	489.69	496.94	B	ID	sug	+1	2	to give ourself we're uh it definitely gonna go with the the voice option would probably have to design um our own chip And
