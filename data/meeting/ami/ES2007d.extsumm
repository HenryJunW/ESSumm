We've got a cool prototype .
everything uh that we wanted
we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber ,
Double curved .
um but also something that was gonna jump out at people ,
So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what a nice thing we have going here .
So , basically , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , yeah , {vocalsound} the thumb button is the power button .
Your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down ,
Um and then then you can also {disfmarker} there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want .
but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different .
That certainly does .
I have one thing about it , but it's a small thing ,
but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one .
But , that's I don't see why that's not possible .
like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ?
Yeah , I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer {vocalsound} for the whole {disfmarker} the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse .
I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so {disfmarker}
But we can have both uh {disfmarker}
Have them in stock .
I think it's , well , if the R_R_ motto is , we bring fashion to to electronics , I'd say that could be quite fashionable .
And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue .
One thing I do need to do {disfmarker} we need to look at , is the costs .
I could do {disfmarker} you know , I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you ,
but it's just easy enough to go through it with you ,
so we're going for the kinetic power .
So {disfmarker} the case , we've gone for the double curved .
and it's made out of rubber .
well they're in diff special colours ,
Special form ,
We're under budget .
That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make .
And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty .
so we evaluate each criteria .
And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven ,
one being true , so it's it's more like it's {disfmarker} fits the criteria ,
and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria .
So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ?
I would give it a seven .
As in it's not .
Oh sorry , one , d yeah .
Second criteria , new technology .
Well , the kinetic thing , yeah .
w every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new .
Maybe three , yeah .
So criteria three is is it easy to use ?
not if you're left-handed it's not .
If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two .
{vocalsound} 'Kay , criteria four is costs . {gap}
It's come in under budget .
So that's a definite one .
Amount of buttons .
Contains only the necessary buttons .
R_S_I_ is it good against ?
Yes . Very good .
does it get lost ?
I don't think it's gonna get lost easily .
But it is smallish .
I mean , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but {disfmarker}
So that's the evaluation ,
{vocalsound} We've , we've done well .
Number one product .
Okay , I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know , little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it ,
um and then come together and worked in , you know , integrally , you know , at the right times ,
and be you know , has been good communication going on . {vocalsound}
during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion ,
but we we kept {disfmarker} we tried to keep it cool and and
Now you guys have been a a great team .
and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new , something that hasn't been done before ,
I think when this meeting's finished like officially , there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in .
I mean , since we saved on the on the production cost , do we know how much we're making on profit ?
I think actually {disfmarker} and one advantage of of this is that after the uh , you know , after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote , you know .
Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this ?
The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that ?
I love it . {vocalsound} I love it . {vocalsound} I think it's cool .
Um , but a p a pen with a camera on it , I don't think it's such a new thing .
It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff , but as it's not {disfmarker}
it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text .
I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it's just the first step .
