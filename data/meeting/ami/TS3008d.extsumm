Okay , welcome to the detailed design meeting .
Oh , we're gonna have a prototype presentation first .
'Kay , we've made a prototype .
especially we looked at the form , material and the colour .
The logo is uh is uh {vocalsound} is pretty uh {vocalsound} obvious to see on the on the remote control ,
I think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious .
Uh , power button .
Uh then the the the nine uh channels .
Uh the volume uh uh at the side , and the other side is the programmes .
And then we had uh just uh two buttons , we place them in the middle , uh the menu , and for the teletext
did we want to have a m mute button ?
Alright , and uh you gotta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button .
Yeah , but you you gotta make it clear on the {disfmarker} on {disfmarker}
Next to that I kinda miss a zero actually .
Uh , there are different ways for remote controls to uh {vocalsound} do uh like
uh d I call it teens and twenties .
All n no , that's um {vocalsound} kinda dependent on the television .
but do we have {disfmarker} do we need extra buttons ,
I think you should add {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
A cross , or whatever . Yeah , line .
Yeah , but you don't you don't actually need them ,
becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have a couple of seconds {disfmarker}
No , that's dependent on the television .
I know some remote controls that don't have these buttons , but you still can , know , obviously you can still select the twenty {disfmarker} uh a number in the twenty or in the ten .
Yes , but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they come with the television .
when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash , it's the same thing as when you just push the one ,
some televisions don't accept uh that that {disfmarker}
When you push the button , the remote control gives a signal .
and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one .
it it it works uh if you haven't got uh a special button for it , uh if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a a line , which is an empty space .
Yeah , but it's exact the same {gap} that w would appear when you put a separate button {disfmarker} push a separate button .
Yes , but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button , uh then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons .
Yeah , but you don't underst uh you don't understand my point .
that special but button {gap} you're talking about , eh ?
That's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv T_V_ that they have to put a one in {disfmarker} on your screen and a dash , which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it .
When you don't have that separate button , and you push y one , it's exactly the same thing .
No , s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c
That's the same thing as the button with the one and it {disfmarker}
It's simply not true . It's simply not true .
I I know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that doesn't sport these buttons , it still works .
We'll discuss them in the usability lab .
we'll apply them then for now .
I don't know uh I don't know if if it's it's necessary .
Yeah , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two .
but I still think i it it {disfmarker} all T_V_s in some ways support it ,
I think it's more c is m maybe we don't {disfmarker} uh we both don't really understand how it i how it really works ,
but I think there's more to in than wha than what you just said .
No , you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals .
I think it's pretty basic ,
there's one there's one button ,
But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell ,
because Real {vocalsound} Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls .
So maybe we can uh use the docking station , for example , uh M_P_ three players or or uh
I think that's very difficult , because of different shapes of uh uh devices .
Yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put uh {disfmarker}
when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it , when it's o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same uh {disfmarker}
The technology and the voltage can be the same . That's uh that's true .
When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it .
Shouldn't it fall then ? It {disfmarker} isn't going to fall down ?
No , when you make it large enough no it it will not .
But it's just an idea .
It's leaning . It's leaning backwards , I think , in the in the docking station .
Uh , you could make like a hole in it , you know , of uh {disfmarker} in in the {disfmarker}
Well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later ,
because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway , because we have some uh cost issues {vocalsound} still to come .
the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control ,
because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area .
Then your uh left thumb of uh {disfmarker} your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button ,
which is the most common used uh function ,
Yes , uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber ,
and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material , a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it .
Yes , we can make also n neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make uh light on it .
because we're gonna use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber ,
Then we're gonna do the buttons in the i are we're gonna have rubber buttons .
Uh , in the same colour as the side .
But uh , and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours ,
Right , we're gonna evaluate that design according to a few points .
{vocalsound} Um , we g the four of us are going to do that um together .
we we gotta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design ,
{vocalsound} The remote control is not ugly . How do you feel ?
Yeah , maybe it really depends on taste .
I think I think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side , because you can uh make it in your own {disfmarker}
Yeah , but we d we didn't {disfmarker} we're we're not planning to use fronts , I believe .
No , not not fronts , but different designs .
Okay , three .
The remote control's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy .
Yeah well , let that {disfmarker} let's make that a one . {vocalsound}
The remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible .
It's something we really put work into .
I would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant .
The remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons .
I think we totally succeeded there .
Well maybe a two , because of the menu button or something .
Also , the the the buttons of the one , the two , the the digits ,
The remote control has got a really trendy look .
Yeah , uh a t I think a two .
we've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever .
But I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful .
You agree on the two ?
Remote control has got innovative technology implanted .
No , not L_C_D_ , so .
you mean the rubber stuff ?
But that that's not innovative .
Or seven maybe , {vocalsound} yeah .
With the lights it {disfmarker} it's it's kind of future {disfmarker}
Yes . {vocalsound} The docking station is a is a little bit innovative .
Well , let's leave it open for uh for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway .
No uh , well , the agenda says evaluate now , so I think we {disfmarker}
{gap} how would you innovate a remote control more ?
Yeah , more through uh like function T_V_ functionalities and {disfmarker}
But I d I definitely don't think it's a five ,
think about it la later on
Remote control is easy to use .
Yeah , a two .
It will be bought by people under the age of forty .
Yeah . Definitely .
Yeah , a two .
The remote control has recognisable corporate image , colour , logo or slogan .
Yeah , you can put that on the side if {vocalsound} if we would like to .
Yeah , and I will I th still think it's gonna be a two or a three .
Remote control's got a basic design intended uh for novice users .
Yeah , make it a two .
It's a two point six .
which is uh quite a great score .
Is there something after this uh meeting ? Or {disfmarker}
Well , I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire .
I received uh a spreadsheet .
I'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together ,
First of all , the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list .
We include one battery .
we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them .
we should know how many simple chips , regular chips {disfmarker}
The simple chip is e enough I I think ,
I haven't got an idea on on which we need to use , really .
The the email I got said uh simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device , it will uh cost a a bit more , like I think the advanced chip {disfmarker} maybe .
Maybe you can uh look it up right now .
well , point out the advanced chip for now , I guess .
Yeah , but it will it will it will be {disfmarker} cause a lot of problems .
Okay , we went for the double-curved case
made out of plastic and rubber . And with a special colour .
Otherwise , you get uh a standard uh plastic colour .
Yeah , I think we uh we have special colours .
Okay , then the push-button , I was just counting them .
Uh , I think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use ,
Well that's bit of a problem ,
because I re but I really don't understand that , because I can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons , and it wouldn't be possible according to this uh sheet .
it's only uh when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much .
Maybe it's the kind of push-buttons .
You can have f four kind of push-buttons .
And plus these two , f uh plus the mute button , and it's will be uh eighteen .
Why is that so uh expensive .
Yeah , I don't understand .
Well , okay , well well let's make it just one .
I I I couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button . Really .
I've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah , only with uh page up , page down and volume ,
Yeah , but I d I wouldn't want to own that . Really .
Uh , it's it's still for little children .
But then still , {vocalsound} when we {disfmarker} there's no room for a docking station or something .
We'll give the buttons special colour .
We'll give them a special form .
{vocalsound} A special colour , why a special colour ?
Because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings .
I don't think the special form is really true .
I think all the special colour things have to be marked over here , because that's what we were planning to do ,
'Kay , but the problem now is that {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} There's no such thing as a docking station in this list ,
but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents .
{vocalsound} But we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station {disfmarker}
then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore ,
No , but you {disfmarker} otherwise you can't retrieve it .
I mean if it's a simple chip , then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents .
But for two Euros and thirty cents , we uh we don't get a docking station .
if it would cost two Euros , that had a total a total thing , it would be nice too ,
or we can ki do the kinetic cells .
But uh what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ?
Maybe you can uh find it in your email right now ,
yeah , but when we skip when we um {disfmarker} when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station , then we still {disfmarker} yeah , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special ,
We can make a plain docking station for two Euros .
Wi wi without recharge {disfmarker}
I've got a schematic view of the remote control , but nothing about uh advanced chips or {disfmarker}
You can look at it for s presentation .
I don't think here {disfmarker} it's in here already .
Was it working design or components design ?
You know that a push-button requires a simple chip , but a scroll-wheel , it it me requires {disfmarker} {gap} {disfmarker}
Okay , so we only need a simple chip .
it s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip , and that a display requires an advanced chip .
And what's the sample sensor slash sample speaker ?
Maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up , page down .
So we're gonna use the simple chip .
Nah , there is some money left to be spent .
I think we can make a docking station . Yeah .
we aren't gonna apply any uh innovated {disfmarker} innovative te technology anyway , I think .
maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something .
Instead of the rechargeable {disfmarker}
Kinetics aren't uh nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking .
the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking {gap} .
Hey that {disfmarker} maybe that's cool {disfmarker} that's a cool thing about it , you know . You don't use batteries .
We can make a docking station for two thirty .
Yeah , but be serious , then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control .
but we uh we don't inc we haven't looked at the {disfmarker} these costs of the speaker and other stuff .
{vocalsound} Well then it's a useless project .
Yeah , then we don't have any innovation things .
Uh maybe it {disfmarker} with the kinetic thing , I think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing .
Can't we say fifteen Euros ?
No , then we have to sell it for thirty Euros .
You can sell for twenty seven and a half .
{vocalsound} No .
Maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote . Battery and kinetic .
You you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour , really .
Uh , a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time .
Because I think the d whole dynamic part , do you know , appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy , you know ,
with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing , and y when you move it around a lot , then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and {disfmarker}
Yeah , it's funny for a week .
Okay , then we d Okay , well y we don't have to do it , but what {disfmarker} that would just have a lack of key features , you know .
We can really can do the docking thing ,
Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station .
No no , it's not possible .
{vocalsound} It w it won't tell , but {disfmarker}
No , this not gonna sell . No .
Yeah , we just have to go all what we did today again . You have to do it over .
No no uh there's still there's still someth concept and something special left .
Yeah , and I would li I would have liked a kinetic part as well , to give it some just to give it some extra special feature ,
Warning , finish meeting now .
well , we were gonna what look {disfmarker} take a look at the last sheet .
No , we can't .
Yeah , we have to {disfmarker} Yeah , it's {gap} {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Yes , yes . Celebration .
I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire , to be honest .
