We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design .
Alright , Trendwatch .
It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling .
{vocalsound} Um , technological technological innovations , that's uh regarded very highly too .
Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen , uh speech uh acknowledgement , as we uh talked about earlier .
{vocalsound} Uh the last point is easy to use .
Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use .
Well we have to choose one of them . {vocalsound}
Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use .
So it must be very bright , very colourful .
Fruit and vegetables are cool .
Uh furthermore uh material , that's your part , should be very strong .
I was thinking of something like uh {vocalsound} well uh iron plate over it ,
Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year .
Yeah , that's great .
Right , I am going to tell you something about the components design .
Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough ,
but it doesn't have a really really tough look . So {disfmarker}
Uh the buttons of course rubber ,
I think everyone agrees .
Um under forty five years old .
Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours .
Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said ,
And also they like curved round shapes .
Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something .
So it it looks pretty but it feels strong .
uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery .
But solar energy is not very practical inside a house ,
And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for uh for a simple remote ,
And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case .
Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium .
Um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons .
No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that ,
But we do use an L_C_D_ screen ,
so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip ,
Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems ,
Um it's not really speech recognition ,
and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left .
No it doesn't does not do anything .
Well , as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote .
Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and {gap} uh and that kind of stuff {vocalsound}
um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons .
Can you draw it now ?
So you have a menu button ,
and then you can go up and down .
But then we should also have an uh an Okay button .
I suggest a banana shape .
m Next year that's out .
Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ?
And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ?
Um the video button should be uh an apart button ,
Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s uh window an option Get Out .
But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part .
if we decide to uh to implement that , maybe we should .
Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same uh little hole thingy .
This is my suggested design .
Um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make .
And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom .
Yeah , fine . {vocalsound}
I think we should , if it's um possible , uh one with colours , but {disfmarker}
Nah th It's too expensive .
Alright .
You can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the L_C_D_ is .
So it f falls over the hand .
I will design it , we design it later .
Well a case ? Uh that's me .
{vocalsound} Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium ,
And then the front is made of plastic .
And you can put that on and off ,
But the feel of plastic isn't strong . {vocalsound}
Titanium back , plastic front .
Okay .
When you want an other colour on the front , it doesn't match .
but you know b Titanium is very basic colour ,
and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front .
all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard work .
Uh the buttons are normal , etcetera .
Um well we have our beautiful drawing .
Well you can put that in uh into the shared folder ,
and then I'll put it in our end report .
I think we can launch a couple of packages .
We can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot .
Yeah
Launch different lines at once .
Well you can you can give them uh s s three or so ,
and that they want more .
Yeah but you you can have some basic colours ,
yeah well I think we'll have to in the next uh half an hour , we'll have to uh s s specify the different uh types we want to launch , when we uh {vocalsound} well introduce our remote .
Maybe a a cheap voice recording .
We all agree on that . Yeah .
Industry designer , {gap} . User Interface , Mike . You're going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .
Uh I don't know what product evaluation exactly means ,
but uh you'll get uh the specifications .
Will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers ?
Yeah . Round .
Well yeah . Um I think um {vocalsound} a logo , our company logo , and the slogan should be or could be {disfmarker}
Uh I I'd say only the logo .
Well , our slogan is not very long .
But you can put it on the back ,
Ah the logo should be on the top I think .
Right corner , yes .
But the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable , when you get off the front .
The logo can be on on every uh front .
Yes , slogan from company on the back with logo
and logo also on the front
So uh a little corner of titanium .
Yes , {gap} that also sounds uh pretty uh neat .
