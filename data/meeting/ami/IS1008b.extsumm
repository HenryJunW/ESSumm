actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting .
and uh we'll issue some information from uh all of you .
And it's in the , I think uh , in the sharing folder .
And uh I will invite uh the Christine and the Ed and uh Agnes to discuss about on the various subjects .
the agenda of the meeting is opening .
Then uh I'm going to talk about uh the project management ,
and uh , of course , I'm doing the project management and secretary both ,
to take the minutes of the meeting .
And there are three presentations .
One is uh new project requirements .
And the second one about uh decision on remote control functions .
And uh finally we are closing .
Uh and the meeting time will be uh forty minutes ,
management come with the new proposal ,
and I have to discuss a few points on this .
Uh both says new insights in the aim of your project .
Uh the one is uh the teletext becomes uh outmoded , okay because if uh because of the computer systems and the new technology .
we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design .
And the second one is about uh the remote control .
Should be used only for the T_V_ .
And the third point , it's very very important to establish our uh marketing or uh corporate image , okay , with this new project or new product .
I'll invite uh Christine to discuss about uh the functional design .
I I figured uh we should um identify some user requirements ,
and from my experience , I wanna uh , and from {vocalsound} research I did , uh the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button ,
Because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them .
since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product ,
thought we better look at things that are popular
and um ex go beyond those ,
and , as I said in the first meeting ,
um {vocalsound} and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction , especially in the the uh the outside of the product
I did a little history on uh the the uh remote controls
all these devices are examples of where uh mm {disfmarker} they {vocalsound} represent examples that are available today {vocalsound}
{vocalsound} which I think the one in the middle is r um really uh something to keep in mind .
you could throw it at things
if if the T_V_ didn't turn on and off , you could use it for something else .
But um {vocalsound} I just {vocalsound} took some {vocalsound} different uh schematics
and I guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board .
personal preferences , {vocalsound} um
uh I I'm really thinking outside the box here ,
and I think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference .
So something that's very very flexible and inflatable
I think um it could either be {disfmarker} you could go either one extreme ,
be very colourful ,
or you could make it clear ,
and um kind of blend in with things ,
Um I think uh it needs to be waterproof ,
because uh sometimes they fall into cups
one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it's done its job or not ,
because half the time , I keep pushing on the remote control ,
and I don't know if it's actually understood my message ,
so I think it should give you some sort of an oral cue .
And uh , course I never wanna replace the battery .
if you can add other facility , other feature , like uh unbreakable .
because uh especially today , you know , you have the family and the kids ,
and the kids throw it
if you can add the feature , okay , for your uh fabric whatever in your outline design okay , with unbreakable ,
I think that will give a lot of advantage for our product ,
Do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials ?
'Cause , for example , in the unbreakable thing , doing something plastic would be harder ,
whereas having something like , I dunno , steel or titanium isn't really economically viable . {vocalsound}
Titanium would be {vocalsound} be heavy , too ,
um {disfmarker} I wanted feedback ,
but we'll see what your uh personal preferences are and your thoughts .
{vocalsound} I like titanium .
Expensive .
nobody told me how mu what our financial objective is , so um {disfmarker}
It'd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though {vocalsound} .
because uh the last meeting we supposed to discuss about the financial thing .
I know the project plan and the budget .
I will {disfmarker} I will send you a mail ,
At the end of the day , the company uh wants to make at least uh the fifty million Euro .
and uh of course the price will be very reasonable on the the sales side .
that maybe Eddie will talk to you about uh how much uh the price
how much its cost for the manufacturing
and how much it's going to be {disfmarker} we sell in the market .
And I I have one {disfmarker} maybe the suggestion or opinion .
This remote control , okay , it can be for like universal , to use for any T_V_ .
and it will be slim ,
Might be hard to find , though .
But let's try it , okay , with the different uh {disfmarker} the designs , okay , the functional designs .
from the marketing {disfmarker} yeah , from the marketing side , just to to give an idea what the management is looking for , I was looking for a a remote control to have a s
I have a sales price of twenty-five Euro ,
with a production price of uh twelve and a half Euro .
For what uh I think from what we're trying to find , we're tr we're looking for , I don't think that price is exactly in the market .
in the recent surveys , uh from the ages {disfmarker} fr from fifteen to thirty-five , eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy .
Twenty-five Euros , uh that's that's a preson reasonable price .
Now if we're gonna take a risk , and push this up a bit , make it more expensive ,
then it w it could possibly sell .
But , I think uh there's one other thing interesting {disfmarker} two things that are interesting {gap}
is that uh from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group , which always spends more money on trendy new things , speech recognition is requested .
And we're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote .
Obviously , we can't make a remote into a computer ,
but maybe simple commands .
louder , softer , on , off .
Thirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use .
So we have to figure out a way of making it um more user friendly .
{vocalsound} Uh fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time . {vocalsound}
So maybe one word speech recognition commands ,
say remote , and there's a beep beep beep ,
But , in the cost that uh the management is looking for , that's not gonna be possible .
But if it's trendy ,
if it's fancy ,
it's got some colour to it ,
if it's very easy {disfmarker} easy to use ,
if it's got simple remote {disfmarker} speech remote uh control , like I said , louder , softer , change channel , on , off , remote , it goes beep beep ,
I can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset
So we're gonna have to look at it in a {vocalsound} in this global idea , with the ideas of the industrial uh design .
But , price obviously we have to talk about .
What do you think about uh the design , uh what he was talking about {disfmarker} of the speech recognition ?
training is always an issue with uh commands .
uh {disfmarker} we can perhaps um {vocalsound} do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process ,
{vocalsound} But um anyway , um {vocalsound} I I think also that uh this might impact the battery life .
maybe what we'll have to do is um add something where you can um recharge it wirelessly
or maybe uh set it out in the sun
and it uh , you know , gets uh , from the light , um a a solar cell inside there
It seems also like with the speech recognition , yeah , it's a great feature ,
but if you're watching T_V_ , there's a lot of ambient sound ,
so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the T_V_ speech , and the the user's speech .
Because tha w {vocalsound} with speech recognition uh th I'm not that good at that idea
Because I think s with speech recognition , if uh the the remote or like the telephone {vocalsound} {disfmarker} it has a exact word that it has to hear .
I don't think it would come through a sentence in a television .
what I can uh suggest to you , Christine ,
uh if you need some uh {disfmarker} the technical feedback , or some training , okay , about uh this facility , especially for the speech recognition , I can recommend you some companies like uh Intel or I_B_M_ ,
because they're already in this uh speech recognition part ,
and uh if you want , I can coordinate , okay , to get some information ,
and uh you can uh let me know , okay , so what kind of uh the details you require okay , to add this feature in this project .
we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop , apart from uh what {gap} today .
From from your side uh , you're gonna have to go back the management
and s be more s precise .
What do they want ?
Uh {vocalsound} , a risk , take a risk on the market ?
Something that's gonna cost more , but could very easily s make a boom in the market ?
Because it has to be something totally different ,
but end of the day , you're the sales guy ,
It's uh of course it's uh good to uh tell the management how much it's cost us
I don't mind to convince , okay , the management to spend some more money on the project , okay , if you can make out of
The management says , okay , so they they don't want certain facilities ,
they want something uh new ,
I think uh like uh speech recognit definitely they will agree ,
And uh I hope I can convince the management on that ,
the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products .
So , in our case , existing remote controls .
We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad ,
but when you look , technically , at how it works , sometimes that's not the case .
Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep ,
Um and then what the remote control should look like ,
in terms of the functionalities that we need , you obviously need to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off .
You need to change channels , both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing .
You need to be able to control the volume
and then control any menus on the T_V_ to regulate contrast or whatever .
the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls , in general .
The buttons {disfmarker} it's not clear what they're supposed to do .
Um often , you need to know specific button sequences {vocalsound} to get certain functionalities done ,
um which you don't necessarily always remember , especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often .
here we've got two examples
where here on the left-hand side , you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons .
The buttons , in a lot of cases , are tiny .
they're labelled ,
but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much .
Whereas , on the other side , you have a much simpler remote control
that I think basically has the minimum functionalities {vocalsound} that are needed .
And it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it .
So , I would be inclined to go sort of towards this , in terms of design , rather than this .
And if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons .
So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit , or to a minimum ,
make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed , so like the on button being really obvious one , the channel changing and the volume ,
and to keep the design basically sleek and simple .
Clearly your research and uh {disfmarker} and ours uh heading in the same direction ,
the only thing that I saw missing from uh your your research that we found was this uh ability to find the doggone thing when you need it .
I also think that um uh th f the the feel of it is uh , when you hold it , is something that um uh was expressed more in in in in my uh design
'cause those are the parameters that an Industrial Designer's more thinking about , th th the look and the feel ,
that's definitely a very important factor , especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing and then using it almost on an {disfmarker} daily basis in a lot of cases , I think .
for anybody need uh any help , for time being , on this uh subjects , okay , so please come back to me ,
and uh Christine , maybe I can uh try to help you to get some uh the technical uh the companies
to help you for uh make a design uh slim ,
and to add some features , like we are talking about , the speech recognition and all .
Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include ,
'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table ,
do we actually want to incorporate all of them ,
or have we missed anything ?
Do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide ,
maybe that would provide some guidance ?
it says individual actions ,
so I'm supposed to do the components concept ,
supposed to work on the user interface concept ,
and you're supposed to keep watching the trends .
Um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach .
I think we should {vocalsound} do as many features as uh {disfmarker} start with all of them right now
and eliminate them later in the process ,
I was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away ?
I mean , it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features , um
and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use , maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want ,
I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting ,
'cause w our meeting time has run out .
what we'll do is now we'll take for lunch break ,
