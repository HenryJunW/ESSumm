I think to sum up the last meeting , would be to say um the requirements that we've um set out .
Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick , {vocalsound} L_C_D_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with power being I suppose one of the main single purpose buttons .
Um we were also going to use {gap} novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck ,
and also because of the minimal design um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck .
This uh meeting is the conceptual design phase
And is to cover things like um what the parts might be made of , um ,
The case uh le that's what I wrote first of all , could be plastic our plastic .
Uh but later on {gap} we found out that um it can be rubber as well , or titanium or even wood .
we decide what it's gonna be .
Probably plastic . Uh
we need the infra-red transmitter .
Uh joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it , um could be plastic w or rubber even as well . Um
three different types of batteries . Um can either use a hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , you know that they use in watches , or else uh a solar powered one .
Um the bat uh the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of power , would be my one query .
Is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power ?
And solar cells , I dunno about that .
Uh . We should probably just use conventional batteries . Um , just like in usual remote controls .
Um . {vocalsound} And these are three different types of {disfmarker} or two different types {disfmarker} three different types of shapes you can have .
Uh one is a flat one ,
and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved .
but uh you can't have a titanium one for a double curved ,
the single curved and double curved , would you be able to give an example ?
Double curved . It probably means {disfmarker} this is probably double curved .
Uh whereas a single curved would be like that .
it looks better than the single curve ,
but uh you can't have it in titanium ,
and for the buttons , um it can have the scroll wheel
Uh but um it requires a more expensive chip to use ,
and if you wanna use L_C_D_ it's even more expensive .
you have to decide ,
there's trade-offs there . Um
if you have a double curve uh control and it's rubber , then you have these rubber buttons as well .
I reckon you're gonna have to have uh key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days .
like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an L_C_D_ ,
does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount ? Or ?
We have to look into the costs of those .
Uh the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the uh remote control .
translate the key press into an infra-red signal
and this is received by the T_V_ .
And uh then the next slide just shows how the uh copper wires uh interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons , uh to uh get sent to the chip .
in the information that you've been supplied , how feasible would you say that the idea of using an L_C_D_ looks ?
Um {disfmarker} I think we can do it if {vocalsound} uh we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic .
Um and then maybe use single curved uh case .
Um I'm actually gonna be bold and go oo go straight for rubber um for reasons I'll go into uh in more detail .
I also have a preference for rubber .
Uh um I was given a an H_T_M_L_ file giving um various ideas from uh from other previous remote control designs ,
and pretty much decided to just dump them all .
I wasn't very impressed by them
uh nothing I saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today .
rather than looking at other remotes , uh ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand .
um so that if r a if {vocalsound} so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already .
Um and what we've basically decided on was the the um the joy uh the joystick , two function buttons and the L_C_D_ ,
I don't actually think we need the um the numeric keypad
because one of the menus that we could have available um {vocalsound} v via via the L_C_D_ is one where you scroll through channels ,
You must have two two modes ,
basic mode , where um the joystick's uh left right {vocalsound} left right for channels , up down for volume ,
um and the uh uh and the menu mode for uh further functions .
Um now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design , um it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people .
That would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate , then .
And {vocalsound} also this is {gap} a rather nicer de uh design gimmick that the {vocalsound} the um you know the whole thing you know {vocalsound} it should have sort of organic feel to it
that it should be , you know , soft to touch
the um the joystick unit should rest over the uh the joint of the f of the uh four finger
Um and it would need t there would need to be a {disfmarker} it would need to be articulated just below that
so that it could be switched around for uh left or right handed users .
And you then have , at the uh at the bottom , the L_C_D_ ,
and this would need to be articulated as well .
the t uh the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch
and menu mode would be the enter button .
And then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes .
Programming them can be a right pain .
So I thought th the simplest way around that would be to have um a cable to connect it to the computer
some {vocalsound} some fair iv {gap} fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you {disfmarker} on your {gap} computer
And you could download programs for it from uh for uh T_V_s from all sort of main manufacturers .
We compared uh whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool .
And then we we research uh fashion trends in Europe ,
Uh we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool .
As in they want it to do a lot of good s
and if it does do a lot that's a bonus ,
but they don't care so much ,
Technology technical {disfmarker} technologically innovative . People want it to be that ,
but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does .
like the interface is really important .
{vocalsound} And easy to use ,
it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point is twice as important {disfmarker} I mean the second point is twice as important as the third point .
{vocalsound} The fashion , now this is seems a bit odd to me ,
but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes .
How that relates to a remote control I don't know .
Spongy .
If it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze , you know , it's spongy , then {disfmarker} can I skip the rest ?
The uh rubber material is the type of stress ball material , not just normal rubber .
kinda spongy material .
{vocalsound} Um we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative , obviously .
But what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future
Um now the fruit and veg options , either we we go in that direction
or we stay totally away from it .
but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that , or a kiwi fruit .
{vocalsound} Few questions about a spongy remote control .
I've never seen one before .
if we want something strong and sturdy , I say stay with plastic or titanium ,
but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want ,
I just don't know how the L_E_D_ and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material
If we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is ,
And also , this was this year .
things change all the time , every year
Seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf ,
um having the use of the L_C_D_ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers
{gap} if you've got a lot of channels , the number keypad can be quite annoying as well ,
what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components , um ,
say something like um lithium ion battery ,
Looks like we {gap} going for a double curved design .
Um I don't know what cost implications there are in that .
Um , looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber .
Though I'd have to say {vocalsound} depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some kind of inner frame .
there would be basically two points of articulation . W um one below and one above the m the uh the main sort of grip .
Do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation ?
but it could be a weak point in um the structure , do you think ?
If you then have a sort of outer skin of mm flexible , spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know
organic ,
if we take some of the ideas {gap} why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ?
Sure , yeah .
Make it harder to lose , as well .
{vocalsound} The noise for when you lose the banana , um f yeah , for when you lose the remote control , {vocalsound} it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that , rather than a standard beep beep .
y {vocalsound} you lose the banana ,
you press a button ,
and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana .
I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control .
Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s ,
you s you click a button
and it finds the frequency
that works with your particular television .
e each manufacturer will have a partic {vocalsound} will have a particular command set that uh the T_V_ responds to .
But if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing .
An interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer , we can still make the process easier
because instead of having to look up codes , maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the L_C_D_
you've got yourself and the Industrial Designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage
looking from {vocalsound} {disfmarker} prototyping of some des description using clay .
um mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are {vocalsound} are made , I would say .
Um but then again , the um the menu structure to to a considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television , and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate .
product evaluation , doesn't that come after actually seen a product prototype .
At this stage we still have no no target audience
I think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say maybe sixty or something ludicrous .
Um your idea of the U_S_B_ would I think would largely depend on the cost .
U_S_B_'s definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there ,
The the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the P_C_ for a larger programming
programming it to use your T_V_ , you might hook it up to the P_C_ .
I'm not sure , but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the U_S_B_ might be prohibitive .
Um you're gonna look at product evaluation .
Um looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay . {vocalsound}
I think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting ,
{gap} they're going with the fashion thing , like the design , spongy rubber .
though maybe we could have options for colours as well . {vocalsound}
So we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on .
Possibly I'm think I'm not sure but I'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used . Um .
like I said before I I think we should have the R_R_ on the uh on the top function button .
