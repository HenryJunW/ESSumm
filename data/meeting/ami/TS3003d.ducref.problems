The final cost of the prototype was probably slightly over the specified 12.50 Euros.
Raising the budget was not an option , although it was promoted as an idea throughout the meeting.
It is not clear whether the budget will allow for a docking station to be produced along with the remote , as it isn't included in the costing sheet.
The non-standard interface (few buttons , scrollwheel) makes the remote unsuitable for older people - the original target group.
It was suspected that many would not know how to use a scrollwheel , even though it does resemble a radio tuning button.
