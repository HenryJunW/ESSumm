He the demonstrated the equipment the group would be using , and the group practiced using the SMARTboard by drawing their favourite animals.
The project manager then went over the project budget.
The industrial designer gave a brief presentation about his role and his initial ideas for the project , suggesting that the remote should be used for multiple devices and that the group should consider using bluetooth rather than infrared.
The project manager then asked the others about their initial ideas.
The user interface designer agreed that the remote should control multiple devices.
They also discussed having glow in the dark buttons , using bluetooth instead of infrared and using a display and/or a joystick instead of conventional buttons.
However , they were unsure about what the budget would allow.
The project manager suggested that the remote should be rechargeable or not use much power , but this might be difficult if using bluetooth.
The project manager closed the meeting.
