ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	34.35	38.77	PM	A	off	+1	1	Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	38.77	46.13	PM	A	sug	+1	1	Uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.7	46.13	50.99	PM	A	sug	-1	0	{vocalsound} Um then we will um do an evaluation .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.8	50.99	57.48	PM	A	sug	-1	0	Uh or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.9	57.48	61.73	PM	A	sug	+1	1	Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.10	62.05	64.92	PM	A	sug	+1	1	Um then we'll do the evaluation ,
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	64.92	70.74	PM	A	sug	+1	1	and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make ,
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	70.74	74.06	PM	A	inf	-1	0	or hopefully everything will fall right in line .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	74.54	76.98	PM	A	oth	-1	0	Um let's see ,
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	76.98	79.09	PM	A	inf	-1	0	minutes from the last meeting .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	79.09	84.3	PM	A	inf	-1	0	Um we looked at uh the the trends .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	84.3	88.75	PM	A	inf	+1	1	We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	88.75	91.56	PM	A	inf	-1	0	It was twice as important as anything else .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	91.56	95.36	PM	A	inf	+1	1	Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	96.78	99.65	PM	A	inf	+1	1	Um and a spongy feel .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	99.65	104.47	PM	A	inf	-1	0	So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	104.47	109.46	PM	A	inf	+1	1	Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.22	109.46	117.81	PM	A	inf	-1	0	Um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	117.81	121.52	PM	A	inf	-1	0	Um looking at other other devices .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.24	121.52	124.94	PM	A	inf	+1	1	Um the iPod , we really liked the look of that .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	125.56	130.73	PM	A	inf	-1	0	Um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	130.73	135.14	PM	A	inf	-1	0	Um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	135.14	148.23	PM	A	inf	-1	0	Uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	148.23	151.61	PM	A	inf	-1	0	But I think we've still decided not to go with that .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	151.61	154.28	PM	A	inf	-1	0	{vocalsound} Then we looked at the components um
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	155.6	159.85	PM	A	inf	+1	1	the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips ,
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	159.85	165.25	PM	A	inf	+1	1	um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	165.25	169.74	PM	A	fra	-1	0	Um and basically how ,
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	169.74	171.82	PM	A	inf	-1	0	what were making for the prototype .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	171.82	174.09	PM	A	off	-1	0	So I'm going to leave it at that
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	174.09	177.4	PM	A	sug	-1	0	and let you guys take over .
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.1	178.69	180.39	UI	C	el.inf	-1	0	The prototype discussion .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	180.5	181.62	PM	A	inf	-1	0	The prototype yeah .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	181.62	182.85	PM	A	el.inf	-1	0	Do you need a {disfmarker} this ?
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	183.54	184.636	UI	C	inf	-1	0	No . {vocalsound}
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	184.45	184.79	PM	A	ass	-1	0	Okay .
ES2016d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.1	184.849	187.18	ID	B	inf	-1	0	{vocalsound} Can try to plug that in there
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	185.89	189.15	UI	C	inf	-1	0	There is our remo {gap} the banana .
ES2016d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.1	186.354	188.172	ME	D	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2016d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.2	187.18	187.824	ID	B	fra	-1	0	but {disfmarker}
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	189.15	191.96	UI	C	stl	-1	0	Um {vocalsound} yeah
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	191.96	194.81	UI	C	inf	+1	1	basically we we st went with the colour yellow .
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	194.81	202.0	UI	C	inf	+1	1	Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it's basically designed around a banana .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	202.338	203.315	PM	A	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	202.0	205.68	UI	C	inf	-1	0	Um but it would be held in such a fashion ,
ES2016d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.2	202.568	203.679	ME	D	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	205.68	206.45	UI	C	fra	-1	0	where it is ,
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	206.45	209.45	UI	C	inf	-1	0	obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic .
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	209.67	212.69	UI	C	inf	+1	1	These would be like the rubber , the rubber grips .
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	212.69	213.41	UI	C	stl	-1	0	So that's
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	213.41	217.67	UI	C	inf	-1	0	so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it .
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	217.67	220.78	UI	C	inf	+1	1	Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel .
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	220.78	222.61	UI	C	inf	-1	0	You have to use your imagination a little bit .
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	222.61	226.38	UI	C	inf	-1	0	And this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through .
ES2016d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	225.01	225.62	PM	A	ass	-1	0	Very nice .
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	226.5	232.77	UI	C	inf	+1	1	And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod ,
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	232.77	236.83	UI	C	inf	-1	0	where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels .
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	236.83	238.34	UI	C	inf	-1	0	Volume up and down .
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	238.34	243.74	UI	C	inf	+1	1	And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus .
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	243.74	244.72	UI	C	ass	-1	0	It's that that simple .
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	244.72	248.5	UI	C	inf	-1	0	That just represents the infrared uh beam .
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	248.98	250.85	UI	C	inf	-1	0	That's a simple on and off switch .
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	250.85	251.72	UI	C	inf	-1	0	Um I don't know ,
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	251.72	254.01	UI	C	sug	+1	1	we could use the voice .
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	254.01	255.73	UI	C	inf	-1	0	T that blue bits should be yellow ,
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	255.86	258.28	UI	C	inf	-1	0	that that'd be where the batteries would be I suppose .
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	258.28	261.31	UI	C	stl	-1	0	And um {vocalsound}
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	261.31	262.5	UI	C	inf	-1	0	that's about it .
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	262.5	264.36	UI	C	inf	+1	1	It's as simple as you , we could make it really .
ES2016d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.3	264.7	265.33	ID	B	stl	-1	0	Right .
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	264.36	265.21	UI	C	el.sug	-1	0	Is there anything you want to add ?

ES2016d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	270.38	274.81	ID	B	sug	-1	0	We might uh add some more underneath here .
ES2016d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	274.81	277.63	ID	B	sug	-1	0	Maybe give it , give it a form .
ES2016d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	277.63	279.4	ID	B	inf	-1	0	I mean you're supposed to hold it like that ,
ES2016d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	279.4	282.76	ID	B	inf	-1	0	but um just if you grab it , take it from somewhere ,

ES2016d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	288.53	290.489	ID	B	sug	-1	0	Might as well think about {disfmarker}
ES2016d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	289.35	293.04	UI	C	inf	+1	1	T the actual thing might be smaller .
ES2016d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	291.32	293.32	ID	B	sug	-1	0	Th think about the button as well .
ES2016d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	293.32	297.55	ID	B	sug	-1	0	Like either put either one {gap} one on either side or

ES2016d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.16	394.24	397.01	ME	D	sug	-1	0	And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did .
ES2016d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	397.8	408.25	ME	D	inf	-1	0	Um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier .
