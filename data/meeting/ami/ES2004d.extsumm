um we decided to use a kinetic charger ,
standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes ,
We wanted a stand-by function .
The case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable .
Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design .
Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel .
Um {vocalsound} and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that .
Um {vocalsound} and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_ .
Prototype presentation .
Me and William worked on a prototype ,
and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that .
I can hold it like {disfmarker}
and I'll I'll show you the presentation .
And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there . Um
It's gonna have a a plastic body {vocalsound} um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something .
This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing
um which there'd be sort of a wide choice {disfmarker}
Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns ,
Um {vocalsound} it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design {vocalsound}
and uh {vocalsound} the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um {vocalsound} how do you say , it's {disfmarker} yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top
The black and white touch screen
and the buttons at the bottom would d
so so it'll fully close flat .
we've um already said {disfmarker} d decided on the kinetic batteries ,
which {disfmarker} actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well ,
So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections ,
Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in {vocalsound}
and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of ,
so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap .
So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something .
Um the standard , there's {disfmarker} be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about .
obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers ,
it would need two separate P_C_B_s ,
so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling .
{vocalsound} And uh because , obviously , all T_V_s use this , the same infrared medium ,
we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data .
And the infrared um sender would be on the {disfmarker} on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the {disfmarker}
So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ .
And then finally um on to the interface .
{vocalsound} The top screen , as we said , is {disfmarker} would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen
which {disfmarker} yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it ,
uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect .
And now we've {disfmarker} we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top .
But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product
And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics ,
as that is {disfmarker} that's the company logo {gap} .
Um I've now got evaluation criteria .
This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research .
the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company .
So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting ,
are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ?
The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends ,
and those {disfmarker} the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours .
{vocalsound} The design should minimise R_S_I_
and be easy to locate
and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there ,
though that did seem to be the favoured strategy ,
We're going to use a seven point scale ,
where one is true
and seven is false .
and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here .
Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market {disfmarker}
w we'll discuss each one
and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven .
I won't write all of that out again .
It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six ,
Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating ,
and we could take an average at the end .
So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques ,
and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who .
Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel .
My own rating for that would be a two .
Two and three quarters ?
criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative .
I would give that a three .
I'd give it a one .
It's just two point five for that one .
ease of use .
Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true .
I would say a two . I would say a two .
One point seven f five .
it incorporates current fashion trends ,
I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here .
Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ?
the the base colour was um {vocalsound} white or or like or l sort of a light blue ,
but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any {disfmarker} basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised .
So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do .
'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it ,
In that case it's got to be a one for me .
Yeah , I'll give it a one as well .
to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury .
I don't think we've really touched on that a lot .
we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that .
but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ?
the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_
but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much .
I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that
and give it a four .
I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five , actually ,
And finally , last but not least , easy to locate .
Now we talked about voice recognition ,
we talked about a beeper ,
have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ?
Yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition ,
And are we happy with the costs on that ? That is going to be feasible , cost-wise .
Yeah , yeah , that {disfmarker} yeah , that's feasible .
it would be quite loud .
And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room .
That's a one for me .
{vocalsound} I do realise that we might be being fairly biased ,
'cause it is our product ,
We've got our our {disfmarker} we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there . That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate .
The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low ,
i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury .
{vocalsound} Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it ,
or do we have to make further modifications ?
I don't think so .
We happy to go ahead ?
I think we {disfmarker} yeah . I think we're set .
I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that ,
and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that .
I'll just leave it there .
I've got finance here now .
We just type numbers into this
and we come out with the final value .
So are we still on for kinetic ?
Yeah .
See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning .
Um it might have influenced our choice .
It was a regular chip on print
you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells ,
there should just be one .
one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker .
One double curve .
'cause it's two .
what's a single curve then ?
It would just be a flat bottom with one curve . {gap} like a domed thing .
{vocalsound} Um we've got plastic and rubber ,
I think rubber , since it's being used just as a casing ,
See , it says case material .
we're not actually using plastic in the case ,
There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing .
So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ?
Or sh we should just put it in as one ,
because the plastic is zero anyway .
special colour , do we need that ?
Might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours .
the push-button's one
and L_C_ display one .
{vocalsound} I think we could change the battery also .
Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery .
and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing ,
is that going to make a difference ?
so the highest we've got is the electronics here . Um {vocalsound} and the interface .
If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ?
it {vocalsound} um it would make one difference .
What I feel is , customers never said anything about the battery {gap} .
but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it .
If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five .
If we change it to the battery it's {disfmarker} that's minus three .
We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version .
I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now ,
because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product .
We can put in our recommendations .
If we if we're working to head office specifications as {disfmarker} this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we {disfmarker} the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings .
Um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers
So if we take voice recognition out {disfmarker}
That'll do it . Twelve point three five .
we are close to the budget .
Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ?
So we are under the budget .
Product evaluation .
We've done room for creativity ,
Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't {disfmarker} didn't feel able to make . Um
I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork .
I think we had a nice time .
Although we had our separate tasks ,
there was so much interaction ,
so much that we needed to um bounce off each other .
in that in relevant areas we've been able to , you know , give and take
and adjust our remit where necessary .
Yeah , I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody .
We came to a very predic creative design , yeah .
And Sarah , you coordinated the work very well .
although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there ,
but that's that's good .
I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually {disfmarker} if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , I think maybe it would've come out a d little different ,
I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down ,
you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model .
Um {vocalsound} means , whiteboard , digital pens , etcetera , what does that mean ? Any ideas ?
How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ?
Could it've been better ,
I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more , had we actually had had more time and if we'd been separated more .
I think it's new ideas in general ,
It's really borrowing from other areas , it's , you know , bringing things from other areas in ,
Surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like a real want to see a new launch or something like that .
but nobody giving uh much idea to this .
I think it's really good that this has been very market research based ,
because {vocalsound} just going back to mobile phones , I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible .
We see it in mobile phones a lot ,
and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from .
There are innovations in that that people don't really want .
and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based .
Um {vocalsound} our costs are below budget
with recommendations that they {disfmarker} the budget be increased ,
Do you think that's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing ? And the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ?
I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone .
I think we've done very well to get within budget
Um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire .
There's a final questionnaire .
we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with {vocalsound} {vocalsound} everything that I fell behind with ,
{vocalsound} I think I've got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy .
