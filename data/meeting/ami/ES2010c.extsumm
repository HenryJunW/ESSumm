{vocalsound} Okay we're back for the conceptual design meeting .
Um we're gonna open it and I'm gonna keep the minutes as Project Manager .
We're gonna have three presentations ,
one from each of you again .
And then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts
Okay , so trend watching .
fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like , fancy versus functional ,
and then it has to also be technologically innovative , and yet easy to use .
So the customer basically is confused .
So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing , shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns .
um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year .
Um . But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , I don't know if we really want to go with that ,
um we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled
And I was thinking about different types of designs and I came up with something .
So what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone
where we put the buttons around , like we'd put a big on-off button or something else in the middle ,
So it's classically retro .
looking at the interface concept , it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this .
Um uh can't really see , but there's two possible ways ,
on the r left , if you see on th on the sides of of the remote , you have the sort of scroll down ,
And then on the right , we have what's really big trend right now , it's the iPod .
and it's sort of like you have the both {gap} kind of trendy and hip , but also very sleek and um and very simple , but technologically advanced .
Um there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight .
for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow .
Um this is particularly geared towards children .
Um and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking .
and then down at the bottom you have the logos
and that's where you could put the R_R_ , Real Reaction .
{vocalsound} {vocalsound} But it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying , well out of this one we like , you know the round section of um , b or we'd like the the button size on this .
So basic remote operation runs as follows ,
we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery y contacts , integrated circuit which consists of a diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and a capacitator ,
um contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and a power-source ,
whatever power-source we've actually determined we want .
They suggested power options , solar cells , hand dynamo , and kinetic power ,
Um I'm not sure how the hand dynamo works ,
We can offer options for casing such as straight , curved , double-curved , you know ,
very specific to the customer .
{vocalsound} Um certain restrictions do apply here though .
And uh so you {gap} functions what {disfmarker} for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves .
Um the manufacturing division also has said that um {vocalsound} they have several types of chips
and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise .
Um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip .
Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before ,
and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition .
um there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for {disfmarker}
So , you would say like , good morning , coffeemaker , and it would respond , good morning , Jill ,
I'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work , 'cause do you programme {disfmarker} do we program the responses and the questions .
I feel like voice recognition would be , I don't know , w it would be too hard to really {disfmarker}
If it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would , you know , technology {disfmarker}
But , I guess , we have to look at w what {vocalsound} our production cost is for the chip itself anyway .
let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost . Um .
It's not gonna be a huge universal remote .
'cause it still fits in your hand , so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial , but not necessarily full of buttons .
If we do a voice-activated locator , though , we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip .
Honestly , I think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base
I think if we had a a locating device with the small one , I think that seems way more advanced .
Okay , so what kind of material do we want to be made out of ?
I don't think wood is a viable option .
'Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium ,
I I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.I'm
not sure that we'll have the time and money to {vocalsound} produce a whole array of
uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power , I'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex ,
because we could produce , you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour .
um we could do f a cherry cover for this year
So we could do like a b a hard base plastic , and then we could {vocalsound} give two latex covers to start .
Are we gonna go with the voice activated {disfmarker}
I think we should just do um the recognition for when it's lost , you know .
because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time .
Uh and what size batteries , double A_ , triple A_ ?
or we could do one small lithium ,
I ki I kind of {vocalsound} like your idea about the retro phone dial ,
'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle , then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are ,
because w And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ?
which I think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side ,
Well , the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side .
Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the R_R_ like that .
I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though ,
or if we're going for the retro look , I think , like a really shiny black would be cool .
or like a gun-metal grey ,
I'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button .
It'll wear off . {vocalsound}
so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be .
Like a little cut-out kind of {disfmarker}
Um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow .
The I_D_ is going to do the look and feel design ,
the U_I_D_ the user interface design .
I think you're going to get a lot of , I mean , the final say on what buttons get put {disfmarker}
'Kay . And you're gonna do some product evaluation .
Okay , and right now , the I_D_ and U_I_D_ , you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay .
