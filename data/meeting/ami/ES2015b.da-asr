ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	263.82	270.21	B	ID	inf	-1	0	them at all so it for example the screen that's holding something together could expand then it would force all the components that part So um 
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	270.63	280.13	B	ID	inf	+1	1	So um the benefits of this a product to be that when it came c. n. do this product like if if it was heated so um everything with spring apart so all 
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	280.13	287.44	B	ID	inf	+1	1	so all the um individual components could be easily separated and and some could be we used some could be recycled and i think that be 
ES2015b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	287.44	289.92	B	ID	ass	-1	0	and i think that be very important to products now especially

ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	635.53	635.93	C	UI	ass	-1	0	Yeah 
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	637.7	645.29	C	UI	inf	+1	1	Um multi function controls can be difficult to use as a lot shape of buttons can be confusing 
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	646.68	655.03	C	UI	inf	+1	1	A single function remote control is some place to use but it means you have to have all their remote controls for older and chi minh devices 
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	668.71	668.87	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Okay 
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	669.3	675.29	C	UI	ass	+1	1	Um I think that a single function remote control would be preferable because it's 
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	675.29	677.96	C	UI	inf	-1	0	because it's easier to use it 
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	677.96	684.11	C	UI	inf	+1	1	it be more compatible with the range of television sets making a more internationally sellable 
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	685.31	693.72	C	UI	fra	-1	0	Um i will make an array shows time or obtainable as we have less function on the side of things to include in the design another 
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	693.72	697.72	C	UI	inf	+1	1	another pay more profitable as a team or some plastic and 
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	697.72	699.93	C	UI	inf	+1	1	and glass functions we have to be included 
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	701.28	703.73	C	UI	inf	+1	1	So be cheaper to make I'm probably 
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	703.73	710.31	C	UI	inf	-1	0	I'm probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with our a wider range of devices

ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	717.712	725.26	D	ME	el.inf	+1	1	So as far as we know um a single function television remote control is is is usable internationally 
ES2015b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	726.24	737.4	C	UI	inf	-1	0	Well it's just that one we're creating that we and we have to make at um compatible with different brands of devices and it

ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	1207.13	1208.27	D	ME	inf	-1	0	here's some ideas for you a large percentage of

ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	1212.3	1213.98	D	ME	off	-1	0	so i'll show you some numbers here 
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	1218.73	1221.31	D	ME	inf	-1	0	Um so the youngest age group fifteen to twenty five ninety one point 
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	1221.31	1226.75	D	ME	inf	-1	0	ninety one point two percent so that they would pay extra might have voice rec voice recognition include on the remote control um 
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	1226.75	1230.24	D	ME	fra	-1	0	um you could see the number decreases uh that's with all its uh interestingly enough twenty 
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	1230.24	1236.62	D	ME	inf	-1	0	uh interestingly enough twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount Um that would are willing to pay extra so i guess we're 
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	1236.62	1239.37	D	ME	sug	+1	1	so i guess we're not to figure out what age group we're we're targeting in it and have 
ES2015b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	1239.37	1242.26	D	ME	sug	+1	1	in it and have voice recognition or something wanna look into and if we have the budget
