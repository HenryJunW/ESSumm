Uh oh I've forgotten to mail you the minutes ,
but I will do .
Um {vocalsound} Will you guys first with your prototype um before we get to the good news ?
Okay , have you got a presentation to make ?
No , not mine yet .
We made three for you .
Um one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato
so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one ,
or as mm few buttons as possible ,
mainly speak recognition .
If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there ,
{vocalsound} Well I like the feel of it , I like the feel of it .
but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand .
Um the black on the back is the slogan .
but also we're gonna have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle .
These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down .
it does actually feel quite ergonomic ,
{vocalsound} Um , obviously I don't think that's real sized {gap} .
It would have to be a bit bigger .
Um that's a speaker at the top ,
Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom .
And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one .
and and um we have the banana-based one too .
This one is uh , I suppose for the younger audiences .
Well , nice to have uh options at least .
{vocalsound} So are there any um improvements or issues or {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance .
Uh , let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria .
the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros .
{vocalsound} So basically , um in order to save our two Euros um I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened .
Doesn't save us quite as much .
W why is the uh double curved two of them ?
Oh , good point .
I think it means double curved as in um
like uh {gap} a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward .
and why why I've got it two , I don't know ,
But you think it should be one .
{vocalsound} Um okay , so that would take away three , which would give us {disfmarker}
Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty .
So we could even add something .
Ah yeah , we could add things .
Yeah , if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to .
Project process , how do we think that went ?
Yeah I think we have a a winning product .
Uh room for creativity , were we happy with that ?
W I think we were very creative .
Leadership ,
Great leadership . {vocalsound}
Uh teamwork . I thought went well .
Yeah , everyone got enough input , I think .
{vocalsound} These pens are are neat though .
{vocalsound} Yeah , these are new ideas , like glow-in-the-dark or something like that .
So just general thumbs up for all of us then .
Uh Brian , have you have you finished ?
At last mine is also the presentation .
Oh , you got a presentation ,
we forgot to mention
it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex , new material that we've got .
So now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh uh of our product .
whether it meets our standards or not .
w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything .
We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product .
Then trends , whether it is as {gap} fashion trends or not ?
Then marketing strategy of the company .
Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale .
what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ?
It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted .
{vocalsound} Seven is good , yeah , isn't it ?
True or false ?
Uh one is {disfmarker} means highest ranking ,
So it's one for from your point of view .
I'm gonna give it a two .
Oh , I'll go for a one . {vocalsound}
Uh for me personally it is everything fine ,
but there is one thing which limits the customers ,
like we are having only two , three designs ,
But if a person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him .
So we are showing our preference for particular fruits ,
Is that no is that not trends ?
because whatever companies {disfmarker} they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes ,
But in electronics , I think , it's not q always quite so um {disfmarker} you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates .
we are doing a very wrong thing .
We're gonna average them ?
I have taken it very wrongly .
About one point f one point eight .
Well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it um ,
well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know ,
so I would actually give it a three .
'Kay . As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology ,
um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism .
it might be trendy to some , but I'm just not swallowing the fruit ,
Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good ,
It is cus spongy also .
So what about company strategy ?
Well , I think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy .
Pretty much kept to the company strategy , so I would go for a {disfmarker} a one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by {disfmarker}
Uh overall we are getting two {gap} something ,
So we can launch it . Yeah .
'Cause we've evaluated and we are within budget .
