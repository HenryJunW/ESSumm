So {gap} is the agenda ?
Opening , acquaintance , tool training and project plan , discussion and then closing .
Project aim is a new remote control .
It's original , uh trendy and it's user-friendly .
Try out the whiteboard ,
every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal .
so , I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working .
Okay , project finance ,
selling price twenty five Euros ,
profit aim fifty million Euros .
Market range internationally sold .
it's gotta be {disfmarker} can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make .
Next meeting starts in thirty minutes .
I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where .
Yeah , I think we're {disfmarker} I mean before we close the meeting , we're supposed to come up with some ideas for {disfmarker}
Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or {disfmarker}
Right , who's got experiences with remote controls then ?
Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make ?
Yeah . Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control .
Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and {disfmarker}
I mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_
and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player , or something like that ,
but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something .
'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices ,
but that would p that would probably be quite expensive .
and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these {disfmarker} any of these ideas are feasible or not .
So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things .
Couldn't we have like one that comes out ?
you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically .
Um {gap} have uh one very complicated one on one side with {vocalsound} all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff ,
and then on the other side o {vocalsound} one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and {vocalsound} minus , and the just the mute button , for example .
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though ,
'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it .
No , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold
or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe . {vocalsound}
I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception {disfmarker}
Okay . Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface ,
but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ ,
but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate
D_V_D_ players , things like that .
I think we should also have a back-up plan of {disfmarker} I {disfmarker}
'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that {disfmarker}
We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just {disfmarker} that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one .
have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use ,
But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ?
Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people
or {disfmarker} big buttons for {disfmarker} touchy buttons for {disfmarker}
{vocalsound} I think a flip up thing ,
like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones ,
User Interface Designer , that's that's
so you gotta {gap} you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . Um .
Industrial Designer , you are the one {gap} , you know , you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in , I guess so , um
Mm . Har how it works an
And in marketing {disfmarker}
User requirements specifications .
Do you think our two kind of overlap , because {disfmarker}
Yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap .
You two {vocalsound} you two are gonna be just , I think , you just double up , you know , you {disfmarker} working together .
You're the one that's gotta go and find out {disfmarker} do th do the research ,
