F You're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me .
So these are the um last notes we I made .
If anything doesn't look right , just say it to me then .
Are we doing the the speech recognition ?
Okay , but it's still possible uh uh financially .
Okay yeah . Well then then we're gonna put it in .
Or are we making a slide open , like underneath ?
Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls .
{vocalsound} It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well .
Yeah , we're gonna use the advanced chip then .
No , you have a different chip for speech recognition . So {disfmarker}
So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget .
Yeah , we just made a Word file with the basic elements .
Simply a square with uh round corners .
{vocalsound} Uh the material should be hard plastic .
Uh colour changeable , and also transparent .
The functions are just basic .
Mute function , on-off function , text functions .
And the logo is over here , and the mic .
So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ?
Yeah , speech recognition .
Only one button to say it's on or off .
Um I didn't have a specification of that . But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something .
Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore .
Well we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad .
I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . So {disfmarker}
Um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find .
Um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out .
It's {vocalsound} basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know .
It's uh twelve buttons .
F the form well , we've taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device .
Um we'll use hard plastic . Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons .
We have decided uh {vocalsound} in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it .
And also in the num-pads , there's also colour {gap} light behind it .
Okay , there is one uh function I use uh daily , and it's not on the basic functions .
It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart .
Okay , maybe we use this button for the {disfmarker}
Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something . {vocalsound}
And h how does the second level come out ?
Uh it slides uh along ?
Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera . That's used pretty often .
So here are multiple speech buttons ,
I don't know how many .
Uh menu buttons with arrows .
Maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs ?
Colour buttons .
Yeah , maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel , that it is volume .
There's one text button I prefer .
That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page , uh like seven hundred , uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text .
If you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ?
That's a functionality for the television . {vocalsound}
uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . Th th th if you switch it on .
Uh the buttons ? Uh from which material are they now ?
Because um if you use it a couple of years , some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away ,
And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ?
I think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons .
Yeah , I made some criteria uh , so we can uh ev evaluate our model .
and we have to test the criteria from one to zero .
We sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our
And um {vocalsound} we have to discuss about {vocalsound} , if we give it a one or a seven .
If it's really uh , if you can if you can get the iPod look , then it's beautiful , I think .
The basic colours are black or green or yellow ?
Maybe um company colours ?
A bit a bit of yellow .
Yeah , grey . Just dark grey I think .
Changeable fronts , so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful .
Okay , just give it a two . {vocalsound}
The fancy look-and-feel .
And we can change the colours , so that's uh really fancy I think .
It's pretty cool . If you slide it open , {vocalsound} it lights up .
And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons , but behind the buttons .
I think it's one .
{vocalsound} Learnable ? Easy to use ?
Uh {vocalsound} it's it's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use .
And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer .
Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel .
Then a two .
New features . Techno technological innovative ?
{vocalsound} The speech function is new .
And the scrollwheel , backlights , slide .
and the slide . Uh I think the slide is pretty new .
But then we also have the the home station .
We are forgetting about that now , but {disfmarker}
Yeah , we didn't draw that too , but {disfmarker}
Okay . And new features , so we give it a two or also again a one ?
No , just so it's still a two .
Yeah , but did we reach , um {vocalsound} with our uh style , the targeted audience ?
You get the fancy things for younger people . And you get the the aesthetic things for older people .
But we didn't follow the latest trends .
Yeah , you could make a a front
Like a a f banana kind of front .
So we give ourself a three or something .
Yeah , it is one point eight three .
A perfect score . {vocalsound}
Okay , let's have a look at this one here , the production cost of it .
Yeah , there are some that they didn't mention , because recharge is not on the list .
So I think we are pretty much in the right direction , because it's twelve point three Euros . {vocalsound}
But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or {disfmarker}
Can we make that for uh h twenty cents ? {vocalsound}
The b the button supplements , I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was {disfmarker}
{vocalsound} But this is expensive , the sample speaker .
Is that uh included ? In the twelve Euro or
It's kind of weird that we {vocalsound} we get this information now , afterwards .
So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together .
Was there room for creativity ?
Mm uh i Yeah , I think so .
Yeah m If we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity
I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it . So {disfmarker}
Okay , so the leadership {disfmarker}
{vocalsound} Just normal discussion , I think . Not
one leader or something .
Uh team work
the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard .
We were not all {disfmarker} We were not um agree with every not agree with {gap} .
Uh I think we {vocalsound} we got wrong information at the wrong time .
I think that was the m biggest problem .
Like uh the prices .
If we knew that before , we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker .
But the teamwork was okay .
Yeah , uh everybody could speak their uh opinion .
I think uh everyone listen to each other .
The smart board is okay .
Digital pen is horrible .
But if you want to download it to your computer , it's doesn't work .
Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with , if it worked really well .
Yeah , i if if it would be faster , it would be great .
Yeah , the drawings are are hard to make , I think .
Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style .
But you might as well do it in normal computer style .
So we made it in time .
{vocalsound} And we made a remote control .
In the budget , yeah .
New ideas found .
I don't know what it mean .
To gather , or to uh work together , uh or new ideas for {disfmarker}
Yeah , but still , you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this . Because we don't have any sizes and {disfmarker}
Yeah , but it {disfmarker} You can't possibly do that in such a short time , I think .
Yeah , this this is just the idea phase ,
I think just {disfmarker} I just write a final report .
Guys , I think we have to finish the meeting .
Fill in the questionnaire .
