Um , once again I'm uh gonna take minutes .
Uh , first we have a prototype presentation by G_ and G_ .
Uh evaluation crit criteria .
Uh , in combination with the finance I um {vocalsound} uh I received uh a an uh an Excel uh file
which we have to fill in later on .
Uh , and then we must see uh if we uh stay under the twelve and a half Euro .
And after that , uh uh an evaluation of uh the process how we uh how we have done it here with the SMARTboard , with the with our laptops , with the {disfmarker} all uh all this .
Once again , forty minutes ,
I would g give the word to um G_ and G_ for the prototype presentation .
Shall I give a short introduction and then uh {disfmarker}
Yeah , well sure .
Um , this was our first concept .
We decided to use a single touch-screen .
And um , well , we began with uh with a form of shape , that is uh is easy to hold w in one hand , left or right handed .
Um well , during the meeting I showed you the concept of uh placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb ,
and uh the menu structure , uh if necessary , with your other hand ,
Yeah , uh well , and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel L_C_D_ uh screen .
Well , these would be the main buttons ,
h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to .
We have the {gap} more advanced menu uh setting right here .
We have the sub-menus and stu stuff .
As you can see , this uh {disfmarker} there , there are uh two uh weird bumps in it .
{vocalsound} This is for uh the added uh effect of uh well uh y youth and dynamic .
And so when you put it on the table , it will just {gap} lay down .
The s panel we g you would hide with some more uh rubber layers ,
But the overlaying layer is uh a little bit uh curved and stuff .
you can make a more thinner uh design ,
So , you have room here for your battery
S and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some {disfmarker} have some wires underneath it to make it as uh thin as possible in the middle for good grip .
Uh , you can see there's a v a very uh youthful uh dynamic uh exterior .
it's like an uh Easter egg .
Yeah , it's like an e but this is for children .
We we want a more adult version .
So this actually basic the idea .
We we just want to build a more uh adult vers adult version of of this .
{vocalsound} And and for colours , we we figured starting with basic colours like uh white or metallic grey .
Those are the technological colours actually ,
It would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable ,
so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple ,
but when the o older people uh go in the shop and they see uh an orange um remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one .
And young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible ,
they think , ah I'll buy for a couple of Euros some noi nice hip uh {disfmarker}
Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover , so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop .
um I think a cover is necessary ,
So , there must be some cheap standard cover ,
Yeah , but uh you d you mustn't forget that uh our target aim is younger people .
So I think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard ,
and for the people who uh really want uh a more sophisticated , more traditional look , they're willing to pay uh that .
Yeah . Yeah , maybe {disfmarker} yeah , perhaps you're right .
Uh , maybe we could uh develop a cover uh with wood style .
a wood style , a white c and uh a couple of h hip uh fruity colours .
And lea uh l delivered standard with a fruity colour , but not too not too much .
But , the mai I think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours .
Not too , but w a little ,
Um , now is the time to uh evaluate our prototype concept to uh to the past requirements .
Um , we're going to do that with a seven point scale .
We have to uh be consensive about about things .
We're going to vote .
The remote control is designed for people with age below forty .
Yeah , it's not just uh designed for people under the age of forty . It's also designed for people above forty .
Yeah , two or three ,
The remote control is beautiful .
acco according to us , it's one ? Or {disfmarker}
Of c of course you have to be uh very positive and uh enthusiastic about your own product .
Uh , the remote control looks fancy .
One ?
The remote control has big , clear channel switching buttons .
Yeah yeah ,
Uh , teletext buttons and volume buttons ?
Teletext is in the menu .
Volume is true .
Yeah , the they are big and clear . {gap} .
I would give it a more a five or a six .
The remote control is easy to be found .
Uh well , when we put in fancy colours , yeah
Yeah , it has these {disfmarker} all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape .
If you put uh your normal uh remote control under your bed , or you throw this remote control under your bed , is it better findable ?
{vocalsound} It'll make a difference .
Well , we p we can do it glow in the dark .
{vocalsound} Because uh four is between three and uh uh also between between true and false .
uh , w uh according to uh the the other uh remote controls , there may uh uh be there in your uh T_V_ room , this one will stand out , I think .
If your uh fifteen remotes in a drawer , uh you find it , yeah ?
if this lying on your couch , you're you're {disfmarker} you think what's that for kinda orange uh thing .
But but the survey under users was that they uh really lost it .
Yeah , that's stupid . {vocalsound}
Most of times when you lose it you're sitting on it . Uh {disfmarker}
the remote control has fresh , fruity colours .
Um I would call uh {disfmarker} choose two ,
'cause we decided not to make two f uh fresh colours , as it would not {gap} .
Yeah , yeah , not too flashy .
The remote control is made of soft material .
Yeah , rubber , is kind of soft .
Yeah , but not too soft we have decided .
Three , yeah .
Easy to use . One .
It's it's not the most easy to use {disfmarker}
Jus just with ten buttons , that's the easiest .
Yeah , but the most uh easy to use is just with one button
It is r it is rather easy to use , because you have the primary buttons always visible .
Okay , two . Yeah , two .
The remote control is innovative .
The remote control has m remova {vocalsound} removable {gap} from Multilux .
The remote control , i it has speech recognition .
False .
The remote control has built-in games ?
But uh , maybe make it two , because the games are in a sub-menu and not uh {disfmarker} it's not an entire game .
Yeah , but they are built in , so it's one .
And the last , paren {vocalsound} parental advisory function . {vocalsound}
Okay , we have now to c uh to calculate the production cost .
Yeah , if the costs are under twelve and a half Euro , uh then we uh can uh ra uh move on to the project evaluation , as we have uh experienced it .
Otherwise , we have uh do uh have to do a little uh redesign uh thingy . So {disfmarker}
Battery , yes . One .
Kinetic , one .
Advanced chip .
{vocalsound} So it's only uh once double-curved .
We're now in a problem , 'cause uh we have uh reached eleven Euro yet .
Then we'll see uh {disfmarker} we'll we'll see uh wha how much we are over budget .
Special uh {disfmarker} is the special colour ?
No , this is a standard colour .
{vocalsound} Yeah , but we want to make uh the wood colours , uh that uh {disfmarker}
{vocalsound} Yes , this is a special colour . {vocalsound}
{vocalsound} Yeah , if if you're honest , we'll uh type one , special colour .
Yeah , but but D but Daniel , tha that's that's another brand .
That's another article
Well , we're only four Euro over budget .
Well , other case , we can make it single-curved or uncurved .
Mm , single-curves .
The kinetic thing , can we just skip it ,
because uh you have to shake it , but that's not really innovative .
What do you think about uh putting a battery in it , but also selling like uh the covers , a docking station
But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual .
well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved .
so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then {disfmarker}
No , it's it's just one curve and not a back uh curved I think . Or {disfmarker}
but uh {disfmarker} it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look .
No advanced chip , uh that's a little bit of problem .
So , if we do this , uh we're on uh twelve and a half Euro .
If you make it double-curved , it costs one Euro more .
Uh , there's an a a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality .
But {disfmarker} I don't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price .
Yeah , well let's assume it is .
But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion .
No , well , y I mean uh , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k uh remote control is kinetic .
Yeah , but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile . So {disfmarker}
because if you want to go to kinetic , you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat ,
and I think now it's it's more of uh a compromise
Well , we were above , so we did a little redesign {disfmarker}
now uh it's about time to uh talk about uh this project .
was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ?
I I didn't think so . That {disfmarker} there was a lot of room for it .
But , that's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us .
and I couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff . Bu
Well , I th I think you two , {vocalsound} uh especially you and uh and uh Daniel , you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project .
I think Jeroen and I , we had a more design {disfmarker} we could have more {disfmarker} we had more room for creativity than than you two .
Uh how about the leadership ? {vocalsound}
I thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting .
but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more .
So like , I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting , and {disfmarker}
I was a I was also very uh unhappy , uh very unsatisfied uh about the
and uh I think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk {disfmarker}
No , it {disfmarker} you did better .
Yeah , more more consensus .
Uh , teamwork ?
Well , we work together on a project , but everybody has his own task .
and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed .
But , really teamwork were you two uh {disfmarker}
Nah . Yeah , we we had some trouble with the pen , but {disfmarker}
D uh just write your name right now .
Uh he he knows how it works , yeah .
The idea is great , but it doesn't work properly . Uh {disfmarker}
It's it's not real real use for me .
I it's the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow .
Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things ,
And the eraser was another problem .
M Abo What kind of new ideas ?
Well , the the idea of the touch-screen is uh {disfmarker}
New ideas about uh the working of this software , about about the project , about the remote controls or {disfmarker}
I don't know what what I mean .
the mm the mean uh number is uh one point eight one point eight six .
So that's fairly uh fairly good , I think .
all the requirements uh are true or very true , right . Yep .
People will still feel the need to to write it quickly on uh a page and not download it and save it , and {disfmarker}
You had expected it to to be uh more more uh {disfmarker}
More user-friendly .
And now you have to um keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen .
And writing text {disfmarker} uh , yeah , you've gotta really do your best to write some {disfmarker}
Just t t type text , and that that would be uh excellent .
Here . Picture from scanner , clip-art .
But not the the the the predefined uh squares I think uh {disfmarker}
So there the the the functionality is there ,
but it's not it's not ideal ,
it costs a lot of time to uh
To use , yeah .
Uh , the costs are within the budget .
Uh , the project is evaluated .
because uh there must be some kind of end report .
Uh about all the meetings , what we have decided ,
{vocalsound} here is uh standing uh whoa , we can celebrate now , but the end report is {disfmarker}
You have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report .
Maybe we can do it uh together .
So I I s I will uh put it on a story-board .
Um , this is about the functional design ,
It's a read-only version .
but you can save it u the {disfmarker} under another name .
about the three functions where {disfmarker} uh which are most used and uh which must uh immediately be visible on our uh remote control .
Um , it must be uh simple to use , very clear what to do , and at the younger people .
No , you have to put {disfmarker} uh , switch channels uh at the top , because that's the most used function and teletext at the second {disfmarker}
a volume changing , second .
S switch , yes .
{vocalsound} then the conceptual design .
Well , okay , maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost .
Uh , he here it is still double-curve , the rubber , the flashy , the fruity , the removable .
It's not double .
Nay but that {disfmarker} this is what um {disfmarker}
Was initial , the plan . The initial plan .
And the the added functions like Tetris snake ,
the added functions . Uh , was it included in the cost ?
I don't think so , eh ?
Okay , so uh anybody uh misses something here about uh {disfmarker}
Yeah , the end conclusion .
that's that's what I'm gonna write b between now .
Yeah , but but the the decisions are put in the uh conclusion , I think .
well I gonna redesign uh something now .
Oh , before you change anything maybe you um save it first .
Finish meeting now .
I'm going to finish my end report .
