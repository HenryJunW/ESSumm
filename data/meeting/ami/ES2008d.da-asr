ES2008d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	78.68	79.83	A	PM	inf	-1	0	um but we talked about energy we're gonna 
ES2008d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	79.83	82.36	A	PM	inf	+1	1	about energy we're gonna use the kinetic battery um we want to use 
ES2008d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	82.36	83.94	A	PM	inf	+1	1	we want to use a simple chip because 
ES2008d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	83.94	86.6	A	PM	inf	-1	0	a simple chip because right gonna need a dash of all um we can use a 
ES2008d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	86.6	88.39	A	PM	inf	-1	0	we can use a scroll um which is in a latex 
ES2008d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	88.39	93.53	A	PM	inf	+1	1	which is in a latex cases win fruity colours that's curved and

ES2008d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	107.74	108.59	A	PM	el.und	-1	0	Okay let's do the 
ES2008d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	108.59	111.37	A	PM	sug	-1	0	let's do the look-and-feel design presentation first 
ES2008d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	112.6	112.79	C	UI	stl	-1	0	Right 
ES2008d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	112.79	113.9	C	UI	sug	-1	0	Right you ones that 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	114.42	114.9	B	ID	stl	-1	0	Right well we 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	114.9	116.68	B	ID	inf	+1	1	Right well we made three different prototypes and 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	116.68	118.66	B	ID	off	-1	0	and i guess we'll start with with this one Um 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	118.95	120.56	B	ID	fra	-1	0	this one Um we have our 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	120.56	123.3	B	ID	inf	+1	1	we have our colours not are not text but this is the general 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	123.3	125.2	B	ID	inf	-1	0	but this is the general shape um it's 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	125.2	126.42	B	ID	fra	-1	0	um it's you hold it 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	126.42	130.32	B	ID	inf	-1	0	you hold it sort of you they're like like this in your left it or you switch it over 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	130.32	131.13	B	ID	inf	-1	0	it or you switch it over and uh 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	131.13	134.14	B	ID	inf	-1	0	and uh see easily adaptable to either hand you can push the buttons with 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	134.14	136.49	B	ID	inf	-1	0	you can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone or you can push 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	136.49	139.89	B	ID	inf	-1	0	phone or you can push somebody or Index finger for other hand or 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	139.89	140.81	B	ID	fra	-1	0	other hand or even i mean 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	140.81	141.85	B	ID	inf	-1	0	even i mean there's a whole variety and 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	141.85	142.66	B	ID	inf	-1	0	there's a whole variety and we like this and uh so 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	142.66	144.21	B	ID	inf	-1	0	we like this and uh so what you're saying index finger Uh 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	144.89	149.06	B	ID	inf	+1	1	Uh we have the on off button at the chip very visible very big We have are 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	149.56	152.27	B	ID	inf	+1	1	We have are up and down buttons which are also gonna 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	152.27	154.29	B	ID	inf	+1	1	which are also gonna be a channel selector "'s" and we have our little menu 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	154.29	156.47	B	ID	inf	+1	1	"'s" and we have our little menu button here if you push 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	156.47	162.61	B	ID	inf	+1	1	if you push it if you're just pushing is normally they're the many buttons if you uh the volume buttons rather if you press 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	162.61	165.9	B	ID	inf	+1	1	buttons rather if you press all at once they become channel changing buttons you 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	165.9	175.12	B	ID	inf	-1	0	buttons you for breast slept three times in the menu with the other features and power possibly also with your t. v. channel choices shows up and you have your five 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	175.12	177.17	B	ID	inf	-1	0	and you have your five be sets down here 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	178.26	180.34	B	ID	sug	-1	0	And people wanna grab hold of that see how it feels 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	180.34	181.62	B	ID	sug	-1	0	that see how it feels in your 
ES2008d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	182.82	185.61	B	ID	inf	+1	1	That's our number one prototype um

ES2008d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	337.8	339.26	C	UI	stl	-1	0	um basically in terms of making 
ES2008d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	339.26	346.64	C	UI	sug	+1	1	in terms of making decisions what we need to do is first of all decide on the form um which are the three different shapes to wants then 
ES2008d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	346.64	350.78	C	UI	sug	+1	1	wants then decide what kind of button they'll we want to how many buttons 
ES2008d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	351.08	354.07	C	UI	sug	+1	1	And then to choose what colours want to make the buttons and if you

ES2008d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	719.97	723.76	D	ME	inf	+1	1	show And seven being not true at all or false if the 
ES2008d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	723.76	727.99	D	ME	el.ass	-1	0	if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria so 
ES2008d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	727.99	728.3	D	ME	stl	-1	0	criteria so we can do this one 
ES2008d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	728.3	730.1	D	ME	sug	-1	0	we can do this one first first i wanna know if 
ES2008d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	730.1	736.13	D	ME	el.ass	+1	2	first i wanna know if it needs that the and the look and feel Um object
