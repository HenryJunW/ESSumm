4	IS1002b.JacquelinePalmer.s.9	The group decided that they want to incorporate teletext despite the management's directive.
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.73	699.59	704.35	A	PM	sug	+1	3	So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include , it really should be in there .
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.67	1015.54	1020.83	C	ID	inf	+1	2	just I I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands .
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.53	873.47	875.71	D	ME	inf	+1	3	I I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext ,
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.156	1615.69	1619.46	A	PM	inf	+1	3	I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext .
2	IS1002b.JacquelinePalmer.s.10	The group does not want to include the battery charging stand.
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.158	1502.31	1504.67	D	ME	inf	+1	2	but we're talking about {disfmarker} in cost is gonna probably double .
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.211	1986.08	1988.71	A	PM	ass	+1	2	But it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent .
