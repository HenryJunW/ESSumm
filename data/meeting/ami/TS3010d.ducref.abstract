The industrial designer and user interface designer presented their prototype design , made of yellow rubber and hard plastic , with large , mostly blue buttons , a joystick and LCD screen.
Led by the marketing expert , the group evaluated the prototype on a scale of one to seven , based on a set of evaluation criteria.
The overall rating was two.
The project manager calculated the production costs , which were too high at fifteen Euros.
The group discussed how to make the design cheaper , and decided to keep the LCD screen , but to remove the special colour and replace the joystick with regular push-buttons.
Finally the project manager led an evaluation of the project process before closing the meeting.
Overall , the group were satisfied with the creativity , teamwork and available equipment , although the marketing expert thought the SMARTboard and laptops were sometimes distracting and not that helpful.
