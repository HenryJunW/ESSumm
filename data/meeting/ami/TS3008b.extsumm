Welcome at the functional design meeting , again presented by Maarten .
Uh , we've got three presentations .
And I'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me .
'Kay , we're going to um uh talk about working design .
It's an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television .
Uh , diodes , uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights , they're needed and they're uh everywhere available .
Uh , the circuit board , it's the most um important uh um part of the remote control .
Well , the technical functions .
and I think they're {disfmarker} we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user .
{vocalsound} th I think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements ,
w if you want try a a a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market , uh like elderly people and {disfmarker} we have to choose for novice user .
Uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions ,
uh like just th the channels uh one till nine ,
uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that .
Um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel .
and I don't know if there uh are any um {disfmarker} uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that .
Uh , I th I thought the the {disfmarker} with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh {disfmarker}
Alright , I've done some research for functional requirements .
there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab
and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions .
three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly .
So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach .
Um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as I uh quoted here from the uh results .
Furthermore , fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control .
Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room .
Um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever ,
And a trendy look , well uh , although seventy percent of the market is uh {disfmarker} consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever , I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent .
Well , then we {disfmarker} I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements
Well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet .
Well , I think that may be so , but well , we can't just leave the teletext button off .
So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off ,
The remote control should only be used for television . Otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market .
New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty .
It's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty .
Yeah , but it is {disfmarker} it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about , we already cover that .
So maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either .
Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design .
That means we can uh well d yeah , discuss on the remote control functions .
Yeah , we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions .
I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to ,
No , yeah , th th the user requirements of the the {disfmarker} The new project requirements told us not to {disfmarker}
But just the basic functions . Maybe like rewind and wind ,
No , new requirements say no .
Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m uh {disfmarker}
Yeah , we we'll make w this one trendy .
I think stop function is very useful .
Yeah , yeah , but maybe you s yeah yeah , maybe y you do , but I've never heard of it in the first place . And
I think we should just put one teletext button on it .
I think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present ,
No , okay , but we don't have to {disfmarker} uh , when we don't want to uh control other devices , I think it makes it even more simple .
uh uh the batteries maybe . If you use large batteries or small batter batteries .
I think double A_ .
But i in a way we have to be uh uh special .
Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ? How we can {disfmarker} what the extra touch can be .
Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing .
Or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it ,
so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something .
So big buttons , flashy design , and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing .
a swapable front or whatever .
Yeah , or just different colours would be uh {disfmarker} I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control .
Yeah , you have to put it on its {disfmarker} So it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table .
If you do that , but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros .
{vocalsound} I in in the base we could like make uh a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise .
And then also you don't even need batteries , because you can make it uh chargeable . {vocalsound}
but when you {disfmarker} you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control , then the then the money {disfmarker} there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know , {gap} rechargeable units .
Well , maybe yeah , you could {disfmarker} when that's {disfmarker} when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger ,
On the other hand , if you don't do it , we can also make a nice bay .
I mean , it looks trendy and still {vocalsound} still put a bleep function in it ,
well , we will see what's possible concerning the the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that .
And and what people just think about , well , I'll never have to buy any r batteries again , so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty .
We have lunch break , and then we have thirty minutes of individual work .
I had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes ,
the the s the next minutes won't be a problem ,
but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too ,
Has anyone got um {vocalsound} a little bit detailed ideas about the shape ?
Maybe like this pen .
It has to feel nice in your hand .
you should like make Alessi or something design it .
Yeah , but {vocalsound} twelve and a half Euros ? Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
I think it uh has to be a r {gap} it has to have round forms or something .
Something like that is very ergonomic .
And on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it . It's also round .
Maybe uh , I don't know , some some lights , a big but well .
Maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons . {gap} {disfmarker}
but I also meant the the blinking li w you know , the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote .
{gap} maybe put something on top of it {vocalsound} or , you know , like that's {disfmarker} looks funny .
I think I think that'll be too big tha too big then .
I think we're we're done .
