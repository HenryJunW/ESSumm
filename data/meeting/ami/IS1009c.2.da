IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	1018.28	1021.81	ID	C	inf	-1	0	Every button , every individual button , has its own morse code .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	1021.81	1031.51	ID	C	inf	-1	0	Suppose uh the uh user has pressed butto button one , then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b {vocalsound} that that button ,
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	1031.51	1038.96	ID	C	inf	-1	0	and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	1038.96	1042.47	ID	C	inf	-1	0	Like {vocalsound} you have got a signal by pressing a button .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	1042.47	1046.34	ID	C	inf	-1	0	That's a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	1046.9	1050.88	ID	C	inf	-1	0	Now , that signal , that morse code , has to be amplified by the transistor .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	1050.88	1054.49	ID	C	inf	-1	0	That is the use of transist transistor we {disfmarker} which we use in the remote controller .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	1054.49	1062.05	ID	C	inf	-1	0	It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the L_E_D_ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	1062.05	1069.14	ID	C	inf	-1	0	The sensor on the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately ,
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	1069.14	1078.71	ID	C	inf	-1	0	that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal , then it will uh it will uh know which uh what what action it has to uh do .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	1078.71	1081.0	ID	C	inf	-1	0	Then it will do the appropriate action .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	1081.0	1084.06	ID	C	inf	-1	0	So uh this is how the remote controller works .
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.77	1083.82	1084.16	UI	B	bck	-1	0	It works .

IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.88	1149.4	1152.4	ID	C	inf	-1	0	and uh just beside that you can see a transistor ,
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	1152.4	1156.95	ID	C	inf	-1	0	and a uh uh cylinder shape , uh that one is a capacitor .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.90	1156.95	1159.81	ID	C	inf	-1	0	Uh and also there are uh {vocalsound} um resistors
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.91	1159.81	1162.37	ID	C	inf	-1	0	{disfmarker} uh sorry , ther there is a diode .
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	1161.97	1163.03	PM	A	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.92	1162.37	1163.87	ID	C	sug	-1	0	Can you go {disfmarker} go on to the next slide .
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	1163.03	1163.35	PM	A	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	1164.98	1166.63	ID	C	inf	-1	0	So uh this is the circuit board .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	1166.63	1168.62	ID	C	inf	-1	0	The green one is a circuit board .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.95	1168.62	1175.06	ID	C	inf	+1	1	Actually , uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	1175.06	1178.5	ID	C	inf	-1	0	Uh it's it costs less than what you print on a paper ,
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	1178.5	1187.46	ID	C	inf	-1	0	because uh {vocalsound} uh when you {disfmarker} when you are building uh some circuits {disfmarker} some um uh circuits and also wires , it's it's better to go for printing ,
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	1187.46	1196.07	ID	C	inf	-1	0	because uh you can build these kind of k circuit boards on a on a bulk and it's just printing , nothing like uh , you know , you don't need to use wires and all .
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	1193.38	1193.76	UI	B	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.99	1196.07	1198.42	ID	C	inf	-1	0	It's not exactly wires we are using .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.100	1198.42	1201.32	ID	C	inf	-1	0	It's just printing something on a board .
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	1198.657	1198.994	ME	D	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.101	1201.32	1205.31	ID	C	inf	-1	0	Tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci uh circuits .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	1206.71	1209.79	ID	C	inf	-1	0	So th that green uh thing is a circuit board ,
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	1209.79	1215.08	ID	C	inf	-1	0	and also you can see uh there are b s like uh um access for buttons ,
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	1215.08	1220.47	ID	C	inf	-1	0	like when you press a button , the circuit under the button will be activated
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	1220.47	1221.03	ID	C	stl	-1	0	uh th it will
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	1221.03	1229.29	ID	C	inf	-1	0	it will he get some signals from it and it will uh it will ch its ch se send a signal {disfmarker} signals to the , yeah , um integrated circuit .
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	1224.56	1225.0	UI	B	bck	-1	0	Transmit .

IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	1231.24	1232.11	ID	C	stl	-1	0	Uh so this is {disfmarker}
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.109	1232.11	1235.28	ID	C	inf	-1	0	these are the circuits un underneath the buttons .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	1235.28	1237.81	ID	C	el.inf	-1	0	Uh can you see the black uh , round marks ?
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	1237.53	1237.85	PM	A	inf	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.111	1237.81	1239.04	ID	C	inf	-1	0	They they are the circuits .
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	1237.83	1238.13	ME	D	inf	-1	0	Yes .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.112	1239.98	1241.13	ID	C	sug	-1	0	Next , please .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.113	1241.13	1250.76	ID	C	inf	-1	0	And um like uh we have uh designed uh before we have seen some uh few things like {vocalsound} instead off buttons we have some scrolls .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.114	1250.76	1260.04	ID	C	inf	+1	2	Uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.115	1260.04	1266.66	ID	C	inf	+1	1	Like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh {vocalsound} uh uh full {disfmarker} a complete chip .
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	1259.97	1260.27	ME	D	bck	-1	0	Okay .
IS1009c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.82	1263.62	1263.84	UI	B	bck	-1	0	Okay .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.116	1266.66	1276.68	ID	C	inf	+1	1	Uh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious uh hard dynamo , um a kinetic provision of energy ,
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.117	1276.68	1282.3	ID	C	inf	-1	0	more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy . So that also we can have in a battery ,
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.118	1282.3	1285.35	ID	C	inf	+1	1	uh or we can use solar sells .
