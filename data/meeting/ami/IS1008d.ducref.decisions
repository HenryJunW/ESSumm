The group decided that the LCD display will be included in the design and that the microphone for the remote will be placed on the side of the device.
The Project Manager decided to negotiate the cost of production to allow the integration of the display into the design.
The group will work with other companies to promote the product and have it released along with other products or with an event , such as a sporting event.
The Project Manager decided that no additional changes will be made to the remote.
The product evaluation will occur at a later time , after the production of some real units have been produced , rather than evaluating the prototype.
