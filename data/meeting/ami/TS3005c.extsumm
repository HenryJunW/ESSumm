welcome everyone to our next meeting .
but um I've prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda
I think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side .
Um we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened .
Um once again I will try to uh write some minutes
Um today we once again have uh three presentations , if I'm right ,
and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts .
I'd say let's start with the first presentation .
Um in the same order as last time ?
Components design ,
first of all I've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um {vocalsound} you know from what uh the remote control's formed .
Uh first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control .
the case was is made from rubber , I suppose .
because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control
the uh titanium was also an option .
But uh it's a very expensive material .
Uh rubber is , I think , uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh
Um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber .
Uh titanium uh you have to paint it
and with that uh it's possible to scratch it
Um {vocalsound} I h I had an idea single covered uh curved , sorry , single curved .
it's t two dimensional .
I think it's uh it's best to draw
I thought of an idea like this .
So it also looks nice when it's on your table .
uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table ,
but it's c it's stands .
Um the graphical user interface and the buttons , uh we also thought about that already .
Uh I thought about uh the L_C_D_ touch screen ,
And um it should be made of strong plastic
and it should be bright .
uh this should uh be uh our uh button component .
Uh the batteries , uh we also thought about that already ,
uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station
And they should be long lasting , not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use .
Uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip
but I think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it
with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition
there should be some more uh investigation on that side .
Uh my personal preferences uh
I also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours .
I think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber .
but I don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour . {vocalsound}
We could make a little R_ and R_ {gap} on the top of the machine .
I suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls
Uh s as I said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely
but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic , hard plastic or uh titanium .
I thought a little bit about the interface . Uh how it should look .
And uh {vocalsound} uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons , but only an L_C_D_ screen ,
Uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition .
And this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device
and it answers you .
And they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker .
This uh and there's an easy way to uh program that
Um perhaps it's useful ,
perhaps for because people um lose the remote ,
they can yell uh remote where are you and {gap} calls or something .
And perhaps we could uh implement that .
And then I have to go out of the presentation
because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like
I tried to uh the L_C_D_ screen I tried to sort of to draw {gap} .
I thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume .
and then the buttons above and uh below
the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon .
I think it's not really on scale and and so forth .
Um an options button .
It's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the T_V_ and that kind of uh thing .
Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should ,
so that it's better in your hand or something uh .
But uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that .
Uh and then uh if you press the op options button , now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do
And uh it's also uh I thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings .
And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote ,
so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things .
I'm going to tell you something about a trend watching . The trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours , material and stuff .
The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy .
The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative ,
like the L_C_D_ screen that's {vocalsound} quite innovative
And the third thing is it should be easy to use .
I think with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use .
The personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow , uh strawberry red and stuff .
The round shapes , and soft material m materials like the rubber .
It should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things .
Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff .
They liked square shapes with round edges .
And hard materials like wood , um titanium .
And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like
It's it's a bit like a banana .
And for the elderly people just plain old .
Because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs ,
or was it two colours ?
We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes .
I think like my colleague , you said , is that's e better , or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something , with round squares .
You could you could uh change the colours , that was also the idea .
I guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh
Changing just the shape of the uh remote control ?
Perhaps you could find something in the middle .
round corners , but s but square , yeah .
But maybe then both groups won't buy it .
So it's a bit square , but it's also a bit uh round .
Uh {disfmarker} Look something like that {gap} . Autumn colours like red , brown .
So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour .
between the young people ? Fresh , exciting .
And the old people , old and boring .
like I said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones
So we have to decide if we're going to use
real hard rubber , or soft rubber . Or something something between that .
Soft rubber .
like like like a a eraser or something . That's the bit you can press it in ,
Yeah it's quite hard
but you can press it in .
So we should first decide about shape , I think .
and the L_C_D_ screen was uh rather small . Um .
w I think that L_C_D_ screen should be like {disfmarker}
but I think it should be larger .
Yeah , three quarters .
Larger I think .
Looks a bit like a Game Boy now . {vocalsound}
but if yo if you make the the L_C_D_ screen as large as the remote control itself , uh you'll {vocalsound} you'll always get some {disfmarker}
You always touch it ,
because you have how much ? Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen .
Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time .
And we won't include a a pen , or something to point ,
we we want to do it with our fingers ,
Because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use {disfmarker}
Yeah o yeah {gap} , if they think it's handy to use a pen .
And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , huh . {vocalsound}
but that that can be {gap} with plain soft tissue .
maybe I should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision .
So we can discuss these points .
{gap} those points um energy question mark .
are we going to do it with separate docking station
Uh chip on print and case .
I think energy were batteries
The docking station .
Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries
We already decided that on the previous meeting .
which you can recharge through the docking station .
if the badg the batteries are dead
then you can re you can uh change them .
{vocalsound} but it should be th I think normal batteries ,
normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . Yeah .
Um what was with the chip on print ?
Chip on print with a with a {vocalsound} simple uh a sim not a simple but a {disfmarker}
but how did this how does that with a L_C_D_ screen ?
You still have a print plate .
I dunno what w what we have to decide about that .
chip on print , I think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got , uh it's always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button .
But when you got a L_C_D_ screen , with no uh with not {vocalsound} {disfmarker} the buttons are not always on the same place ,
but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate ,
you need some kind of C_P_U_ , I guess .
Mm , I don't I dunno I don't think that's {disfmarker}
Yeah , it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen .
I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_ .
but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume .
So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or C_P_U_
Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen .
And the case , yeah we already discussed the case ,
we wanted to make it from rubber
but but a hard rubber like this ?
Or softer rubber
Uh hard rubber I think .
We have different colours .
the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ?
I think it's more round than square . {vocalsound}
But I think it should be a bit longer , perhaps .
I think it meets more the young people than the older people .
But that's what we want , {gap} .
and how about my idea uh of making it um with one single curve ?
I thought that was a quite good
Uh got a single curved uh rubber
you c you can draw it on your paper
And load it on the the user the server .
there are also some some questions uh about the concepts I think
what we should also have on , I just remembered , um a menu to go back through the first uh
{gap} if if you touch options , you can't go back to this uh right away now .
Isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ?
If you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter .
I think it's it's easier to have it something like {disfmarker} Oh a button uh minus here , plus over here . A minus here , plus over here .
The other buttons and on here {vocalsound} the top .
I think I would put a plus and a min uh here .
And then the P_ in the mid in the middle
We'll leave that to the usability engineering then . {vocalsound}
But I'm going to look if I've got some examples
So not how much {disfmarker} n not how often it's used , but {disfmarker}
W what's what's usual or normal .
because I have two televisions at home .
One is horizontal ,
one is vertical ,
it does it doesn't really matter ,
I think we have we don't have to decide about that now
And the speech uh shall we implement that ?
But then you should also find a place {disfmarker}
You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something .
you can make a very sensitive microphone ,
maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh
But that's not import I think that's not im very important
You could p you could put it in a logo of the company . {vocalsound}
between the round of the R_ .
but it doesn't makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh {disfmarker}
just 'cause other remotes don't have that .
because a microphone is very small thing ,
but you can make it look like it's big
so as its its really an important function of the remote .
{vocalsound} Interface type .
we already s discussed that , huh , the the L_C_D_
I think it's better to just {gap} up what you'd like to do on the screen .
If you want to go back you have to back button go back ,
if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s sub-menu .
the the young people do like uh scroll uh
and I think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh {disfmarker}
I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options ,
you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television , you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen .
So then it's uh very handy to to scroll down ,
And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side
there's our five minutes uh warning .
what's the standard colour ?
we have different colour .
You should you should have a black one
because uh I think black is standard .
Dark grey , something like this this colour or something .
I think it's better to have silver nowadays .
Yeah the the silver black are our main colours . Yeah .
w what about a yellow thing ,
it'll be a banana yellow , we have .
But if you use uh silver , uh rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy .
Green , wood , brown .
I would think about colours like uh red , yellow , green , blue ,
The fruity colours and the autumn colours , like red and brown , {gap} dark red and brown .
And and do we have to have a normal black one , or uh {disfmarker}
uh that wraps it up ?
Everybody knows uh what to do ?
I wrote it down here . I wrote it down here what to do um .
The next meeting is once again in thirty minutes .
and especially notice that uh the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board ,
and of course to all four of us uh specific instructions will be emailed by our personal coach .
but do we have to stay here ,
I I'd say just wait uh for email and uh find out .
