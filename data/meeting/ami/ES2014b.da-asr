ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.45	611.792	617.392	A	PM	ass	-1	0	So like here 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.16	613.861	615.28	C	UI	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.18	620.09	621.24	C	UI	el.inf	-1	0	To press function okay 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.19	621.24	622.96	C	UI	inf	-1	0	okay 
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.46	630.32	631.39	A	PM	el.inf	-1	0	On the control function i know 
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.47	631.39	634.65	A	PM	ass	-1	0	i know I know 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.20	631.25	631.4	C	UI	oth	-1	0	Oh 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.21	632.7	638.28	C	UI	inf	+1	1	Um Or piece on gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design um louise 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.22	638.28	642.19	C	UI	inf	-1	0	um louise that the user interface design as you know And um so 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.24	642.19	651.83	C	UI	inf	+1	1	um so the basic method is this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set so that the desired function is performed um 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.25	651.83	656.57	C	UI	inf	-1	0	um an example of a function could be to change the volume up or down uh so 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.26	656.57	658.87	C	UI	inf	-1	0	uh so obviously need to different buttons for that 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.27	659.41	666.1	C	UI	inf	-1	0	Um to change the channel either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down to um to switch 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.28	666.1	669.78	C	UI	inf	-1	0	um to switch the television on off maybe stand-by button um 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.29	669.78	673.28	C	UI	inf	+1	1	um here to example remotes um by the 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.30	673.28	678.88	C	UI	inf	+1	1	um by the look of at the polls have um kind of play and fast forward rewind functions so 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.31	678.88	685.14	C	UI	inf	+1	1	so i think they're incorporated kinda video function which we would have to worry about Um but as you can see 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.32	685.14	691.39	C	UI	inf	+1	1	Um but as you can see the left a rule is quite um quite busy look and quite complicated um 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.33	691.39	695.34	C	UI	inf	+1	1	um where's the right remote is much simpler it looks much more 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.34	695.34	697.22	C	UI	inf	+1	1	it looks much more user-friendly 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.35	698.85	702.72	C	UI	inf	+1	1	Um so my personal preference would be the right remote so that 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.36	702.72	704.28	C	UI	inf	+1	1	so that it's got nice big buttons it's got a very limited 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.37	704.28	706.63	C	UI	inf	+1	1	it's got a very limited number of buttons um 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.38	706.63	707.96	C	UI	inf	-1	0	um the nice kinda 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.39	707.96	709.92	C	UI	inf	-1	0	the nice kinda clearly labelled um 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.40	709.92	720.97	C	UI	inf	+1	1	um i like the use of the kind of them symbols like the triangles in the squares and arrows as well as the words on them terribly functions will have to to 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.41	720.97	723.08	C	UI	inf	+1	1	have to to to a very user friendly and colour special colour 
ES2014b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.42	723.08	724.82	C	UI	inf	-1	0	and colour special colour could
