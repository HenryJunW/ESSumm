Um , I'm Abigail Claflin .
So this is our kick off meeting . Um
and I guess we should all get acquainted {vocalsound} .
Hi I'm Chiara , I'm the um Marketing Expert .
{vocalsound} I'm Stephanie and I am the User Interface Designer .
I'm Krista and I'm the Industrial Designer .
Um so f here's our agenda for today .
Um we're gonna do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close .
So our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly .
Right . Functional design , conceptual design and detailed design .
So throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things .
Um {vocalsound} so we're gonna try out our white board .
So you want us to draw it and then talk about it ? Or just draw it ?
I think both . {vocalsound}
We ought to decide who starts and {vocalsound} all that .
Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro
and profit aim is fifty million Euro .
Um , and we will hope to sell this internationally .
How many should we sell then ?
well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million .
Experience with remote control .
Um , I think one thing is that it should be easy to find
I mean you always know where your T_V_ is , so just have a call button ,
so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control .
Um or even a {disfmarker} maybe a vib a vibrating thing .
What if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it
I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base .
But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing , a pretty object attached to the wall .
Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ?
Hand-sized .
I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons ,
but like , I don't know you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them . So .
but what if it had like a little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions .
so you can programme like your favourite channels ,
But , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen .
so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen ,
I mean , we have to remember our budget is twelve point {disfmarker} twelve fifty for {disfmarker} to actually make the device .
and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um {disfmarker}
Water resistant .
maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot .
Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your {disfmarker}
like that's another {disfmarker}
Um . We should probably start wrapping up ,
The Industrial Designer ,
{vocalsound} um is going to be looking more into the working design .
User Interface Designer .
I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w
So technical function .
What is technical functions exactl
{vocalsound} What effect should the thing ha should it have ,
And the M_E_ , what does that stand for {vocalsound} ? M
Marketing , right . Um {vocalsound} .
So we'll be working on the user requirements , um {disfmarker}
