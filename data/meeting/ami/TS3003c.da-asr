TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	204.14	209.95	D	ME	off	+1	1	um uh and inform you buy the trendwatching and then over the past few days Um 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	209.95	212.24	D	ME	inf	+1	1	Um we've done some market research we 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	212.24	216.1	D	ME	inf	+1	1	we distribute it some more on cats questionnaires And 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	216.7	227.28	D	ME	inf	+1	1	And um Besides that um i deployed some trendwatchers to milan and paris to well get all the news trends and i've consulted 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	227.28	240.88	D	ME	inf	-1	0	and i've consulted some additional trendwatch trendwatchers after the original trendwatchers should turn about what the The best design would be Um 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	240.88	242.21	D	ME	stl	-1	0	Um okay these are 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	242.21	245.09	D	ME	inf	-1	0	these are some overall findings um 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	245.09	249.6	D	ME	inf	+1	1	um Most important thing is the fancy design um 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	249.6	254.62	D	ME	inf	+1	1	um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	255.1	262.39	D	ME	inf	+1	1	Um Innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design line of doing 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	262.39	267.76	D	ME	inf	+1	1	line of doing this this means um functions which are not featured another remote controls 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	268.97	278.4	D	ME	inf	+1	1	Um about half of half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use Um for 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	278.4	291.93	D	ME	inf	+1	1	Um for are um group we're focusing on the people of sixty eighty years old this is um These factors are slightly more equal 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	295.07	295.25	D	ME	stl	-1	0	Okay these are some more group 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	295.25	298.3	D	ME	inf	-1	0	Okay these are some more group specific findings uh the older people 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	298.3	301.02	D	ME	inf	+1	1	uh the older people prefer dark colours uh they like recognisable 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	301.02	305.33	D	ME	inf	+1	1	uh they like recognisable shapes And familiar material um 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	305.33	316.34	D	ME	inf	+1	1	um Our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much Be material for all the people um this 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	316.34	327.64	D	ME	inf	-1	0	um this is this image will give you uh Little bit of an impression about um the look and feel That um the remote should have 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	331.07	335.2	D	ME	off	+1	1	Um this leads us to some personal preferences uh the remote control 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	335.2	342.26	D	ME	sug	+1	1	uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the In the room Um 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	342.26	347.97	D	ME	sug	+1	1	Um so this would be no Uh eye-catching designs just 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	347.97	349.27	D	ME	sug	+1	1	designs just keep it simple and 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	349.27	351.32	D	ME	fra	-1	0	and Well 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	351.32	352.0	D	ME	stl	-1	0	Well the docking station and small 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	352.0	355.57	D	ME	sug	+1	1	the docking station and small screen would be are main points of interest because 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	355.57	362.7	D	ME	inf	+1	1	of interest because this would be d. b. "'s" would that be the innovativeness in the remote control 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	363.93	368.96	D	ME	ass	-1	0	So this would be very important that we at least include these features Um 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	368.96	379.01	D	ME	inf	+1	1	Um Well it trendwatchers i consulted advise that it should be the remote control on the docking station should be telephone shape so you could imagine that 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	379.01	384.7	D	ME	inf	+1	1	you could imagine that uh the remote control be standing up straight in the the ah king station 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	385.5	387.22	D	ME	fra	-1	0	This is not really this is pretty much 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	387.22	390.85	D	ME	inf	+1	1	this is pretty much in you shake to uh uh older people so 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	390.85	399.58	D	ME	inf	+1	1	older people so they would prefer Uh design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station So it would 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	399.58	401.7	D	ME	sug	-1	0	So it would be kinda more telephone shape 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	402.66	413.14	D	ME	sug	+1	1	Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions one with a woodlike colour and maybe feel and one with a grey black colour you would like for them or 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	413.14	419.98	D	ME	sug	+1	1	you would like for them or Uh exclusive people people are more money and 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	419.98	427.3	D	ME	sug	-1	0	and grey black colour for the well People the less means 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	430.97	432.03	D	ME	inf	-1	0	That would be all 
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	432.55	433.09	A	PM	und	-1	0	Okay thank you

TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	1073.99	1074.49	A	PM	stl	-1	0	Yeah well i think 
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	1074.49	1080.77	A	PM	inf	+1	2	well i think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place and 
TS3003c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	1074.9	1077.292	D	ME	ass	-1	0	That's true 
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	1080.77	1087.73	A	PM	inf	+1	2	and i don't think they they like uh remote just laying everywhere in their rooms so

TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	1087.73	1091.57	A	PM	inf	+1	2	so maybe a docking station well them guess the remote a place 
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	1090.92	1092.03	B	UI	ass	-1	0	Yeah that's true yeah

TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	1101.87	1109.64	A	PM	ass	+1	1	but i think it's a um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station so you have 
TS3003c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	1101.7	1102.13	B	UI	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	1109.64	1114.41	A	PM	sug	+1	1	so you have a button button on your docking station which you can push and then it starts beeping

TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	1261.25	1263.31	A	PM	fra	-1	0	i think the um maybe we have to 
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	1263.31	1268.89	A	PM	sug	+1	2	maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition Because 
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	1268.89	1274.31	A	PM	inf	-1	0	Because it will increase costs assignation and significantly and i don't think

TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	1281.22	1281.57	A	PM	stl	-1	0	So that brings 
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	1281.57	1283.72	A	PM	sug	-1	0	So that brings us back to the energy if we 
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	1283.72	1292.272	A	PM	inf	+1	1	if we don't have voice recognition And that will avoid use a lot of energy to use Um

TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	1293.49	1294.04	A	PM	stl	-1	0	So in that case we could 
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	1294.04	1297.93	A	PM	sug	+1	2	in that case we could use kinetic uh energy but 
TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	1297.93	1303.56	A	PM	sug	+1	4	energy but i think just a simple battery which you can read a little docking station is just as good a much cheaper

TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	1861.94	1865.34	C	ID	sug	-1	0	I think we should start by by choosing a case because that's the 
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	1865.34	1867.85	C	ID	inf	-1	0	because that's the basis your building oh

TS3003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	1873.59	1874.041	A	PM	fra	-1	0	Yeah it's 
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	1880.24	1881.51	C	ID	sug	+1	1	Is that the flat case 
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	1882.71	1883.3	C	ID	oth	-1	0	No 
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	1889.73	1890.62	C	ID	inf	-1	0	Just from the side so 
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	1890.62	1893.58	C	ID	inf	-1	0	the side so it's run a normal the the single

TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	1907.36	1907.55	C	ID	stl	-1	0	So this type 
TS3003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	1907.55	1910.46	C	ID	ass	+1	1	So this type should be better for you or better
