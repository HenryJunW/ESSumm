ES2009b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	39.98	45.54	A	PM	inf	+1	1	And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics .
ES2009b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	47.41	49.53	A	PM	inf	+1	1	Um and no teletext .
ES2009b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	49.53	50.96	A	PM	inf	+1	1	I'm not sure what teletext is
ES2009b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	50.96	52.68	A	PM	inf	-1	0	but I'm assuming you guys do ,
ES2009b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	52.68	56.22	A	PM	inf	+1	1	so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design .
ES2009b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	56.55	60.53	A	PM	inf	+1	1	{vocalsound} For reasons that I don't really know .

ES2009b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	63.5	65.28	A	PM	stl	-1	0	So basically um
ES2009b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	65.28	68.61	A	PM	inf	+1	1	given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design
ES2009b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	68.61	69.48	A	PM	sug	+1	1	we'll discuss it later
ES2009b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	69.48	69.99	A	PM	stl	-1	0	I mean
ES2009b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	69.99	71.07	A	PM	inf	-1	0	'cause it's television only
ES2009b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	71.07	73.32	A	PM	fra	-1	0	we'll be able to change our
ES2009b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	73.32	76.15	A	PM	stl	-1	0	uh {vocalsound} um well
ES2009b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	76.15	80.47	A	PM	sug	-1	0	we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote . {vocalsound}
ES2009b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	80.47	81.55	A	PM	stl	-1	0	Anyway . So
ES2009b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	81.55	85.3	A	PM	sug	+1	1	I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation

ES2009b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	118.92	124.06	B	ID	sug	+1	1	We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project .
ES2009b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	124.06	126.82	B	ID	inf	+1	1	Um remote control works as follows .
ES2009b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	126.82	129.07	B	ID	inf	-1	0	This is all pretty basic stuff you guys .
ES2009b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	129.07	132.7	B	ID	inf	+1	1	Um sends message to another system ,
ES2009b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	132.7	133.54	B	ID	stl	-1	0	so
ES2009b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	133.54	139.05	B	ID	inf	+1	1	there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines ,
ES2009b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	139.05	140.34	B	ID	inf	+1	1	there's an integrated circuit ,
ES2009b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	140.34	142.08	B	ID	inf	+1	1	which is the microchip ,
ES2009b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	142.08	144.95	B	ID	inf	-1	0	um and that actually compose the messages
ES2009b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	144.95	151.82	B	ID	inf	+1	1	and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system .
ES2009b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	151.82	154.16	B	ID	inf	+1	1	A user interface controls the chip ,
ES2009b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	154.16	160.76	B	ID	inf	+1	1	basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well .
ES2009b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	161.7	161.96	B	ID	stl	-1	0	So
ES2009b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	161.96	162.82	B	ID	off	-1	0	my findings ,
ES2009b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	162.82	165.59	B	ID	inf	-1	0	um I just did a preliminary study here
ES2009b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	165.59	173.35	B	ID	inf	+1	1	and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands .
ES2009b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	173.35	178.76	B	ID	inf	+1	1	And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals .
ES2009b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	178.76	180.23	B	ID	inf	+1	1	Um too much metal is used sometimes
ES2009b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	180.23	182.76	B	ID	inf	-1	0	and people pick up radio signals and the like ,
ES2009b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	182.76	185.69	B	ID	inf	+1	1	and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire
ES2009b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	185.69	188.11	B	ID	inf	-1	0	and injuring the customer ,
ES2009b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	188.11	191.12	B	ID	ass	+1	1	just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad .

ES2009b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	540.3	541.41	D	ME	inf	+1	1	for some people they're important ,
ES2009b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	541.41	544.73	D	ME	inf	+1	1	but the primary uses are really really basic .
ES2009b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	544.73	552.79	D	ME	inf	+1	1	Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use ,
ES2009b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	552.79	554.35	D	ME	inf	-1	0	they're not using a lot of it ,
ES2009b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	554.35	556.22	D	ME	inf	-1	0	they don't need it ,
ES2009b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	556.22	559.63	D	ME	inf	+1	1	they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with .
ES2009b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	560.205	567.63	D	ME	inf	+1	1	{vocalsound} And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their {disfmarker} the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . And then they can't find it in the room .
ES2009b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	567.63	574.93	D	ME	inf	+1	1	So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people .
