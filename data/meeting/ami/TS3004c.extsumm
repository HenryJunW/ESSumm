we're going to talk about the conceptual model .
I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes , minute . {gap}
we just talked about it looks .
Has to look nice .
Usability is very important .
People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones . Um {disfmarker}
It has to be very basic ,
not too many buttons .
Light switches on if you use a button .
Uh text T_V_ still has to be a possibility .
And it has to be easy to learn .
And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text T_V_ button . That are the functions .
I just want to give you uh Mike again , the first uh presentation
I received an email {disfmarker}
uh and uh I searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market .
It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe ,
Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel .
So it's very important for us to create something new .
Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface .
Uh this uh aspect is the most important one .
It uh is twice important as the following . {vocalsound}
The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative .
Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features .
And then uh that uh {disfmarker} This is a point of discussion ,
because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition .
But we already have the flashing flashing light
Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use .
We already discussed that .
Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy .
So I took uh that part of the webpage .
And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari {vocalsound} uh France and uh Italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends .
This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe .
But it's about uh clothes and shoes .
But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy .
Spongy , like sponge .
So rubber , kind of .
Uh soft materials .
But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea ,
because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground .
But I didn't knew uh knew what it means .
it's also a stress-ball .
Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control ,
I think about changeable fronts .
Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front .
And uh some basic uh colour fronts .
Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge . {vocalsound}
just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has .
We have to discuss about that .
Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative .
how do we do that ?
Maybe speech ?
We ma must have some kind of gadget .
{vocalsound} It's very uh difficult to to to do it .
Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control .
that's the problem . That's the main problem .
Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations .
actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost .
But maybe it's cheap
and it's easy to implement .
if we implement uh speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well .
Since you have to uh configure speech thing .
But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros .
We have to decide on that .
I got an email uh {disfmarker}
And it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced .
They say uh a display requires an advanced chip .
And this is more expensive than all the other chips .
And speech recognition ?
Yeah , probably too .
I I haven't got anything about speech recognition ,
I had uh to make a sort of a design .
So I did some searching on the internet .
I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls .
This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment .
I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players . Mobile phones .
just modern modern but still uh basic .
Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller .
'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out {disfmarker} both sides .
And here you just have one , few buttons .
uh I definitely think we should go like this .
And then changeable fonts ,
It's the most important part , I think .
And the home base is something like that , something simple .
and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit .
Uh basic buttons . On-off , mute . And th maybe two others , I dunno . Text buttons .
And then the colour buttons , if we want it on .
I don't find it very usable ,
and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod .
They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . And uh f above ten . {vocalsound}
That's on on the display .
That th there is no display there .
But it's on the place of the display .
And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part .
So the focus is on these two parts .
So you don't see all the buttons you else need .
{vocalsound} But it sounds very difficult to use .
Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it .
So you can't use your thumb for it .
here we have also side scrolls .
I dunno if we can use that . Do we want to use {disfmarker}
for volume . For volume , or a channel .
then we can even simplify it more .
By just putting the volume on the side .
And and just channel buttons here .
The channel buttons are often used .
And you can't use them now with your thumb ,
m maybe we cho should put that on top ,
and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom .
Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . Put that on the button bottom .
You mean uh these to the low ?
Except from the on-off button .
But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three .
So maybe we can put that on the bottom .
I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top .
{vocalsound} I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up .
I think th the the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top .
But uh we we can switch those two ,
my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player .
if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we {disfmarker} I don't think we should put it on top then .
I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open .
if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons .
the component design .
I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge .
this was on the web site .
If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . So flashy kinda colours .
Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . Not {disfmarker} Nothing square-like .
iPod is trendy .
And it is well curved {gap} square .
we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing .
And um sports and gaming device style characteristics .
we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the {vocalsound} remote control .
the colours also .
So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow .
Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black .
because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public .
Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front .
Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So {disfmarker}
Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue
Still still transparent .
Yeah . But with all with logo on it .
Maybe we have to make it from soft material .
But anyways uh it should be transparent .
Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it .
Just give five with them , just in a box . {vocalsound} Five different {disfmarker}
but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent .
Um the buttons . Normal rubber I think . Like normal ordinary buttons . Soft .
It it could be like a Nokia , like {gap} plastic .
With the hard hard buttons .
I think uh rubber really has an odd look .
The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls , uh the buttons are part of the {vocalsound} uh the style , I think is part of the remote control itself .
it's it's all on one level .
it don't come out of the {vocalsound} on the background .
So that should be hard plastic .
But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material .
basic remote control from normal plastic ,
and
the rounds of it from softer s
The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient .
And back light L_E_D_s .
But I think we have to make the case transparent ,
Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh {disfmarker}
And in green colour , the back lights
but I think there are multiple colour LEDs .
Just make it some different colours . Blue , red and green , or something .
Um this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of uh things .
So we d we just need this and {vocalsound} this transistors and resonators . There's all these kind of things .
Um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls .
Uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in .
We still want to have a recharger , don't we ?
Re recharger . Base station .
uh just just batteries , rechargeable batteries .
And uh a chip , that's this one .
Um for the energy source we can use batteries
or a kinetic uh {disfmarker} Like with the pulse watch .
Or we can also use solar cells .
But you mostly use it indoors ,
It's dark in the room .
It's just batteries ,
and and we can use the home station kind of thing .
Um cases ,
flat , so uncurved .
Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back .
And three D_ curved is also in depth .
Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons .
So we can't use the flat buttons .
Um these kinda materials can be used .
we just make it plastic .
The scroll wheels , that's cool .
That's for the volume .
And uh the L_C_D_ .
we need uh the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an L_C_D_ .
I don't think that's an opportunity .
then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip . So th so the regular chip .
Uh are are we using a a rubber case ,
Uh I don't think a rubber case looks {disfmarker}
The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh .
fruit and veg can be just the covers .
I can't imagine a soft remote control .
just hard plastic ?
Titanium , uh I think it's too expensive .
Not the sh the square form .
more rounded .
you can make it curved or mm round .
But just in two D_ , not in depth .
We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these . What exactly .
So the energy uh is the recharger .
Just a normal battery .
the case is just a plastic one .
Yeah th yeah , the chip is the the regular one .
And we need a plastic case , with a scroll wheel . {gap}
Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board .
That's for the next one .
But you definitely get a specific instruction . {vocalsound}
But th think about something that's more rounded .
Like a very big scroll-wheel . {vocalsound}
but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it .
I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted .
maybe you just have to make it uh {disfmarker} That's not scrollable too easy .
Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle .
It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other .
I think uh zapping is the highest priority .
Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other ,
But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing .
So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time .
we have to care that it r uh looks really new .
Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control .
'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside .
but i i it should be round in in shape .
You have to look at that image of the iPod .
If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo .
Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ?
Yeah , five . Let's give five .
Maybe you can buy separate ones
uh buy the product . You buy , you get one . And uh basic .
y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ?
you could put it like that ,
so top down .
Do we have to design that w as well ?
The docking station ?
But th Yeah , that can be very simple . Least .
But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well .
But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit .
As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes .
but we could do a lot of , lot more curving .
I dunno . I dunno if it's handy .
{gap} I think it will only look more like the old remote controls .
we have to make a decision ,
what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have .
I think if w My opinion . If we just uh take the iPod , and the same look .
So uh light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours .
And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new .
No rubber buttons or something .
Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look . More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player .
And you have the scroll button inside .
But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ?
Doesn't have to be .
though that's a trend . If we want to make it .
I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square .
I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff .
Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the {vocalsound} wha what's it called uh scroll wheel . Make it in in yellow or something . Just like the colours of Real Reaction .
We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition .
do we s keep that ?
But you'd definitely need a
advanced chip .
And we we have to build in a microphone
I d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition ,
Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well ,
Probably we need a uh advanced chip then .
But we don't have any f information about the cost .
Yeah , uh I have I have some some information about the cost . But just a about the chip .
our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit .
This is a very small electronic unit ,
will give a standard answer after it recognise a question .
Just {disfmarker} You say record , followed by your question sample , and after a few seconds the answer uh sample .
it works like uh good morning remote control ,
and then the remote control says good morning .
that's integrated in the chip ,
but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well .
it it would be would be a good feature feature .
We have to stop it now .
