This is the functional design meeting .
Okay , here's the agenda for the meeting .
After the opening um I am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes .
And we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you .
First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting .
First we need to determine the user requirements
And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus ,
And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions ,
the function {vocalsound} of a remote control , as what uh we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set ,
for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera .
whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus .
And we can decide if that's what we want , {gap} , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example .
These are two examples .
Um and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons ,
And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler ,
And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider
like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ?
Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements .
okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab ,
and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire ,
Seventy five percent think they're ugly .
Eighty percent want {disfmarker} they've {disfmarker} are willing to spend more , which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier ,
And we need we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high-tech looking . So {disfmarker}
What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons .
I I think it's like the engineering versus user ,
and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really .
{vocalsound} And so people say that they typically lose it ,
and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is .
Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ?
Uh yeah , that's what my web site said ,
I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly .
And also we found {disfmarker} our team found that speech recognition is {disfmarker} it's like an up-and-coming thing
{vocalsound} Didn't they {disfmarker} um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would {disfmarker} the remote would beep so if you have lost it {disfmarker}
We could definitely include that if we wanted to .
'Kay . Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating .
We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional .
Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip .
Um power source , I figured , batteries ,
'cause they're easily available .
Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s , sometimes three .
so a large on-off button would probably be good .
Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness ,
but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance .
Like that we know the battery's working .
We should make it glow in the dark . {vocalsound}
Well , should it be larger buttons in general ,
I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles .
New product requirements .
First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote .
So no D_V_D_ , no TiVo , no stereo .
so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote .
But it's becoming out-dated now , because of the Internet .
Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news ,
Would it just be universal for everyone , you think ?
Because I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically {disfmarker}
non-technically challenged people are gonna use it .
so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range {disfmarker}
we we need a like homing device .
And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger ,
and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you .
Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery .
Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually .
If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic .
It's really the people twenty five to thirty five .
{gap} and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too .
Well , do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ?
Well , we definitely need those .
And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo .
We could just have the logo in yellow ,
or maybe a yellow light for the keys .
If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom {gap} the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ .
So we've simplified , we don't need all those um play , fast-forward , rewind ,
or no menu buttons .
So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , um the numbers {disfmarker}
Yeah , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those
or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ?
I think that that's fine just for the T_V_ .
you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons .
So we just have it like {disfmarker} add a menu button then for the various things needed ,
The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept ,
um U_I_D_ the user interface concept ,
and you're going to do some trend watching .
