The UI and ID presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design.
It can be used as a normal remote , but the speech recognition also provides a more advanced alternative interface.
The speech recognition works as a finding mechanism as well.
The rubber case is yellow with grey or black , with buttons either made of plastic or rubber.
An extra button could activate/deactivate the voice recognition.
The prototype proved extremely over budget.
The main contributing factors were the solar cell and speech recognition.
One way to compensate for the loss of features , but still attract their target group , would be to add more colour to the design.
After the costing , the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad).
The criteria used were fancifulness (2) , technological innovation (2) , ease of use (2.5) , whether it is easy to find (1) , sponginess (1.5) , number of features (1).
Finally , the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (choices too narrow) , leadership and teamwork (happy with it , but they missed communicating in between meetings) , and means (SMARTboard was not satisfactory , but the digital pens were alright , but not too useful).
The delay in providing costs of components was criticised.
