ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	834.1	836.7	D	ME	inf	-1	0	"'cause" certainly there's lots of different information to go through so 
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	836.7	841.36	D	ME	inf	+1	1	go through so um i'm thinking here but um primarily about customer needs that we start with the

ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	872.59	877.37	D	ME	inf	+1	1	um Users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls so to find

ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	900.87	905.0	D	ME	inf	-1	0	so i guess we're looking at here's people want this technology they tend to use the most

ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	1425.79	1428.71	A	ID	inf	-1	0	Well this is just what how i would go about it um 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	1428.71	1432.4	A	ID	inf	+1	1	about it um i guess i try to define like what we're doing now try to find what 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	1432.4	1434.16	A	ID	inf	-1	0	try to find what we're trying to get done um i think in a practical 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	1434.16	1437.18	A	ID	inf	-1	0	um i think in a practical way we can dunno what it is we use it were from 
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.252	1434.23	1434.62	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Uh 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	1437.18	1437.81	A	ID	inf	-1	0	we use it were from 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	1437.81	1438.66	A	ID	inf	-1	0	we use it were from a with it but 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	1438.66	1444.98	A	ID	inf	+1	1	a with it but we we caught we have an arrow down um exactly what the things we try to fulfil like 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	1444.98	1445.87	A	ID	inf	-1	0	like design the basics i think 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	1445.87	1449.16	A	ID	inf	+1	1	design the basics i think that in the back of our minds we know what the basics are just change channels just 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	1449.16	1450.75	A	ID	inf	+1	1	just change channels just change volume but 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	1450.75	1455.56	A	ID	inf	+1	1	change volume but in my specifics which one of the basic so you try to target um are there 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	1455.56	1459.9	A	ID	inf	-1	0	um are there certain parts of basics and one point or less important than the basics on 
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.253	1455.32	1455.61	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	1459.9	1460.81	A	ID	stl	-1	0	basics on right just the 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	1460.81	1464.33	A	ID	fra	-1	0	right just the idea is just to get everybody to um i you 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	1464.33	1468.9	A	ID	inf	-1	0	i you have or have have a design as a as a basic so 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	1468.9	1472.54	A	ID	inf	-1	0	basic so you know things that to start everything going but i guess everybody 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	1472.54	1474.23	A	ID	inf	-1	0	but i guess everybody does it have some ideas i don't think of 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	1474.23	1476.09	A	ID	ass	-1	0	i don't think of that 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	1477.09	1481.56	A	ID	inf	-1	0	Are um Okay this finding things is a bit confusing so i'll go 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	1481.56	1483.34	A	ID	off	+1	1	bit confusing so i'll go into that then press it just explains 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	1483.34	1485.74	A	ID	inf	+1	1	it just explains how to process goes through from the 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.99	1485.74	1486.45	A	ID	stl	-1	0	through from the from the basic 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.218	1485.57	1486.07	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Mm 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	1486.45	1488.0	A	ID	inf	+1	1	from the basic technology point of view the basic steps that you need 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	1488.0	1489.52	A	ID	inf	+1	1	the basic steps that you need on the diagram 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	1489.52	1492.49	A	ID	ass	-1	0	on the diagram in this like probably works but um 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	1492.49	1493.76	A	ID	stl	-1	0	but um okay you need 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	1493.76	1495.88	A	ID	inf	+1	1	okay you need some power source a battery 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	1495.88	1498.27	A	ID	inf	+1	1	a battery or something to keep it going um and 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.219	1496.79	1497.26	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	1498.27	1500.27	A	ID	inf	+1	1	um and that power source is important because it ties 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	1500.27	1505.13	A	ID	inf	+1	1	because it ties you down to um how long the device will last i'm it ties you down 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	1505.13	1509.0	A	ID	inf	-1	0	i'm it ties you down perhaps a bit later on to the technology is um how for 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.220	1504.72	1505.07	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	1509.0	1511.52	A	ID	inf	-1	0	how for you can transmit a signal or 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	1511.52	1514.55	A	ID	inf	-1	0	signal or the complexity of the functions that you want like for example

ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	1514.55	1516.58	A	ID	inf	+1	1	like for example voice recognition right that might be constrained 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	1516.58	1519.56	A	ID	inf	+1	1	right that might be constrained because that you might need a microphone a menu are 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	1519.56	1521.15	A	ID	inf	-1	0	microphone a menu are the things so that's one 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	1521.15	1523.71	A	ID	inf	+1	1	so that's one that's that's true yeah um 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	1523.71	1524.26	A	ID	stl	-1	0	um 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	1525.03	1528.68	A	ID	inf	+1	1	Well did a basic thing is there's a user interface with people

ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	1535.1	1538.85	A	ID	inf	+1	1	you know and that um picks up and input from the user um 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	1538.85	1541.31	A	ID	stl	-1	0	from the user um uh uh logic is user what it 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	1541.31	1544.87	A	ID	inf	+1	1	is user what it has to decide what the user's telling the device and 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	1544.87	1550.01	A	ID	inf	-1	0	the device and the device has to you know based on you push button a so i'll do something and it's maybe button is a power 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	1550.01	1552.64	A	ID	inf	-1	0	maybe button is a power button on

ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	1552.64	1556.22	A	ID	inf	+1	1	on it needs to be able to send a signal to the device itself just to see here 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	1556.22	1557.86	A	ID	inf	-1	0	just to see here um 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	1557.86	1562.87	A	ID	inf	-1	0	um i think that's all i don't like design um It's

ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	1665.48	1674.25	A	ID	inf	+1	1	um that might be one other consideration which would be the the the transmission between the remote control and the t. v. for example okay um 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.241	1665.34	1665.77	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.163	1674.25	1680.47	A	ID	el.sug	+1	1	okay um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infrared thing because that's something 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.242	1673.86	1674.31	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay 
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.277	1674.12	1674.98	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Okay 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.243	1679.87	1680.3	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	1680.47	1684.67	A	ID	inf	+1	1	thing because that's something you need to actually physically pointing to right 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.244	1683.49	1684.95	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay well 
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.278	1683.56	1683.78	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Right 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.245	1684.95	1693.62	B	PM	inf	+1	1	well all the way that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would it it would affect um how long how long it took us to get this to market so 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.246	1693.62	1700.59	B	PM	sug	+1	1	to market so i suspect it might be a good idea is to restrict are kind of our creative in france unless on the user interface in a way 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.247	1700.59	1703.96	B	PM	sug	-1	0	interface in a way so much abide a high we transmit it um 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	1703.69	1703.95	A	ID	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.248	1703.96	1706.57	B	PM	inf	+1	2	it um because i mean it's tried and tested infrared so 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.249	1706.57	1708.05	B	PM	sug	+1	2	infrared so we could still 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	1707.23	1709.62	A	ID	inf	-1	0	That might be one other one was the transmission um 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	1709.62	1713.13	A	ID	inf	-1	0	um in particular right now since we're talking about voice recognition um it's always kind of 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	1713.13	1718.07	A	ID	inf	+1	1	um it's always kind of top to the device you ideally want them to hold it to them it you may not require 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.250	1715.9	1716.18	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	1718.07	1718.48	A	ID	stl	-1	0	it you may not require 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.251	1717.685	1718.63	B	PM	ass	-1	0	Mm 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	1718.48	1719.78	A	ID	inf	-1	0	it you may not require that but 
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.279	1718.21	1718.46	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Right 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	1719.78	1721.58	A	ID	stl	-1	0	that but you know um it's it's it's something very 
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.280	1719.83	1720.13	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Right 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	1721.58	1725.91	A	ID	inf	-1	0	it's it's it's something very natural i guess you have to hold it to signal to the user and 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.252	1723.07	1725.437	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Yeah uh-huh 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	1725.91	1728.38	A	ID	inf	-1	0	to the user and push a button maybe to start talking about it then you need to send 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.253	1727.69	1728.17	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	1728.38	1729.72	A	ID	inf	-1	0	it then you need to send a signal lot so because 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	1729.72	1738.57	A	ID	inf	+1	1	a signal lot so because if you're using infra-red the line is that um say the t. v.s at the chip and i'm standing in fancy and a transmitter sure that blocks it so in that 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.254	1729.8	1730.21	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Mm 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.255	1732.39	1732.8	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Mm 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.256	1736.91	1737.27	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	1738.57	1741.19	A	ID	inf	-1	0	so in that sense it's not really restriction but it's something which 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.257	1738.36	1738.77	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.177	1741.19	1744.49	A	ID	inf	-1	0	but it's something which you mean that's the thing about later on in the process not so much 
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.281	1741.87	1742.1	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Right 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.178	1744.49	1745.94	A	ID	inf	-1	0	not so much for that 
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.282	1744.33	1744.6	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Okay 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.258	1744.94	1745.41	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay 
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.285	1745.56	1748.25	D	ME	oth	-1	0	And then just a clarification before we finish this at this 
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.283	1748.25	1758.16	D	ME	el.inf	+1	1	at this is our controller is it have the option of being um a nice standard uh frequency is all of the other equipment so that the one controller 
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.284	1758.16	1762.02	D	ME	el.inf	-1	0	so that the one controller can control several pieces of it but 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.179	1759.46	1763.05	A	ID	inf	+1	1	There's there's not much specifics specific information but i think that 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.259	1762.39	1762.51	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Oh 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	1763.05	1768.95	A	ID	inf	-1	0	but i think that um one indication of infrared means that you just are going to additional devices because 
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	1768.95	1770.64	A	ID	inf	-1	0	because infrared is something which are has

ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.265	1778.73	1784.86	B	PM	sug	+1	1	the power and is it worth considering i kinda like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries i mean 
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.266	1784.86	1787.59	B	PM	el.ass	-1	0	i mean is that something really want to go into the think or so we just

ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.184	1789.18	1793.21	A	ID	inf	+1	1	okay from from uh from uh what what are you just added complexity and you had cost of
