The Project Manager reviewed the decisions from the previous meeting.
The Marketing Expert made a presentation on trend watching , including trends in user requirements and trends in fashion.
The Industrial Designer presented all the components of the device and announced that several of the features already discussed would not be available.
He suggested substituting a kinetic battery for the rechargeable batteries and using a combination of rubber and plastic for the materials.
The User Interface Designer presented his main interface design , which included buttons for the most frequently used features and a graphic user interface on the LCD screen for other functions , to keep frequently used features easy to use.
He announced that speech recognition was still an option to consider , depending on price.
The Project Manager then began a discussion to decide what was going into the final design.
It was decided that a kinetic battery would be used in place of a rechargeable battery , that the remote will feature an LCD screen and rubber casing and rubber buttons , and that interchangeable rubber covers in fruit colors will be available.
Speech recognition may be included if it is not too costly.
