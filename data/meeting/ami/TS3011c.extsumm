Um {vocalsound} first of all , um if you make minutes yourself as well , uh like Sebastian does , um could you put them on the shared folder ?
Ease of use is important ,
but uh innovation is more important ,
and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important .
And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture ,
and that they want spongy material .
I assume they just want something colourful . Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something .
the corporate colours are grey and yellow .
Maybe soft material or something . But not a real sponge .
maybe it rubber
or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers .
You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover .
a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these .
but they're very advanced and very high-tech and {vocalsound} just um , well , a weird um shape .
But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . Uh yellow .
And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip
um {disfmarker} I mean this is how you hold a remote control .
There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in ,
in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on ,
and still have the ease of use ,
We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh
{vocalsound} We have uh a curved one .
Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape ,
which is curved in three dimension .
We can use plastic ,
uh which is the same for rubber ,
We can use wood and titanium .
we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases .
And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source {disfmarker} source .
we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh {vocalsound} remote controls .
Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply .
I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny .
But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and {disfmarker}
But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy .
but maybe {vocalsound} maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries ,
because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power .
And we of course have the traditional uh solar power ,
um of course we have the push-buttons
and uh we also have scroll-wheels .
And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons .
Um {vocalsound} uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays ,
we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round .
{vocalsound} Yes . That is possible too . Yes .
I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it .
Um with uh maybe a channel selector .
What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ?
Yeah , uh that's a possibility ,
There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel .
this is my volume button . And I can either on this side or this side um {disfmarker}
And click it to muten the device .
So it might attract uh the young customers .
it's it's been done years ago
and I don't see it anywhere now .
So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect .
Yeah , yeah . Okay .
Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip .
And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker ,
Uh in the voice recognition you say a word {disfmarker} you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute , let's say mute .
and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying .
It performs the action .
d did we already decide on the display ?
Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh {disfmarker}
No . I don't think you need it .
I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing ,
but they seem to like natural uh stuff .
Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy .
The kinetic thing it {gap} it's it's a possibility .
but I'm {disfmarker} I think you should combine it with batteries .
it's maybe a bit too too flashy ,
So it it needs to be rubber .
the younger people liked soft material .
But they really need the regular chip ,
But but do we want the curved uh uh design ,
if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it's too dull .
And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot {disfmarker} um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels .
So I think this is the best of two worlds .
what about um {vocalsound} the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue .
It's it's {disfmarker} uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device .
{vocalsound} But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all .
it depends on your walls actually .
Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample . Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker . Um with a with a regular chip .
And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels .
Yes , yes .
And uh skip {disfmarker} and skip the L_C_D_ part .
Yeah .
according to Ruud , the the the market likes um new flashy technology ,
Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance , I would say do integrate it ,
But we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours .
Uh I think our customers will go insane .
Yeah . Okay , I I agree .
Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product .
I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian .
Uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow .
The next phase , um Sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel . The user interface design .
And for you , the product evaluation .
Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .
can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made ?
The casing is curved , single-curved .
Traditional batteries uh and solar .
What about uh the finishing of the case ?
Yeah , with colourful rubber .
Uh if it's possible with uh different um covers ,
and I think we should use the company colours . Something like black and red . {gap} uh black and yellow .
Yeah , although I don't think that's very colourful . Except for the yellow of course ,
It's quite modern actually .
I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before .
um {disfmarker} you must have a red uh on and off button .
Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours ,
it should be a full colour cover with such an image
but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device .
The scroll-heel . Yes ,
the voice recognition we already decided .
But there will be some additional buttons , I guess .
because they're they're rubber too .
What I said in the in the first uh discussion , uh the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber .
Uh didn't {disfmarker} did we inc uh include the digi digits
or uh leave them to the speech recognition ?
'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button .
So still then , if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting .
What about um making this rubber and making this plastic ?
we should have it the other way around , I guess . A plastic cover with rubber finishing .
I'm I'm not so sure ,
I have to ask with manufacturing ,
So if you want the spongy feel , you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber .
Um I guess you two have to figure that out .
We use the regular chip ?
Regular .
