IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.2	156.36	178.58	D	ME	inf	+1	2	What it what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be uh having no teletext people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext in using teletext and so we're not we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now So 
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.19	161.57	161.87	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Mm 
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.20	167.06	167.2	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Mm 
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.21	172.04	172.39	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Yep 
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.3	178.97	183.92	D	ME	inf	-1	0	right now So that's from a marketing perspective i i see i see a lack And

IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.23	189.08	191.41	A	PM	inf	+1	1	Well that that possibly could also be enough opportunity because and saying 
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.24	191.41	198.85	A	PM	inf	+1	1	because and saying that teletext becoming addicted some sort remote control that can work with the internet there is an opportunity that presented i guess

IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.43	290.45	290.74	A	PM	stl	-1	0	Okay i think 
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.44	290.74	295.18	A	PM	ass	+1	1	Okay i think that the last point is probably quite so uh straight-forward well basically 
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.45	295.18	298.69	A	PM	inf	+1	1	well basically the way it has to be branded

IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.9	299.38	301.312	C	ID	el.inf	+1	1	So the the double r. will be on or 
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.46	303.57	305.24	A	PM	inf	-1	0	On the product yeah you can you handle that black 
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.48	305.24	306.61	A	PM	el.inf	+1	1	you can you handle that black and yellow 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.3	304.9	305.721	B	UI	fra	-1	0	I think what a

IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.4	310.48	319.46	B	UI	inf	+1	1	I think yeah what the things that we should also keep in mind um when we doing this i mean our company slogan is we put the fashion in electronics right so i 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.5	319.46	327.5	B	UI	inf	+1	1	so i think are kind of our target here it is to have some kind of very like sleek and nice looking remote and we want 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.6	327.5	329.17	B	UI	inf	-1	0	remote and we want it to be functional as well but i think one of the 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.7	329.17	334.73	B	UI	inf	+1	1	but i think one of the main selling points is it We don't want it to be clunky like like this thing here you know 
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.49	334.88	335.12	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Mm

IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.53	353.19	357.48	A	PM	sug	+1	0	So we can have a look at the working design for a participant two parts

IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.14	374.47	378.5	B	UI	inf	+1	1	And we've some basic components that um a remote is gonna need just basically 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.15	378.5	380.4	B	UI	inf	+1	1	gonna need just basically every remote mean we need some kind of

IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.16	380.4	382.97	B	UI	inf	+1	1	mean we need some kind of power power source um 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.17	382.97	387.79	B	UI	inf	+1	1	um we have to decide and our our user interface which is his department that 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.18	387.79	390.71	B	UI	inf	+1	1	department that in user interface is also a major component um 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.19	390.71	408.59	B	UI	inf	+1	1	um we need a uh programmable digital signal processors to um to take the input from user and translate that into a Into electronics signal which we passed to the infrared l. e. d. which you aim at the television which indeed receives that signal 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.20	409.71	411.1	B	UI	inf	+1	1	Yeah and off switch um and 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.21	411.1	413.29	B	UI	ass	-1	0	and get in there and that we 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.22	413.29	422.23	B	UI	inf	+1	1	and that we also need to um have that if we wanna universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes it a t. v.s so we need 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.23	422.23	426.15	B	UI	inf	+1	1	so we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so require 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.24	426.15	428.96	B	UI	inf	+1	1	and so require some memory as well 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.25	431.48	437.48	B	UI	inf	+1	1	Um so here's just the basic layout of how how the remote would work You have the 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.26	437.48	441.27	B	UI	inf	+1	1	You have the the power sources in the upper right hand corner there and you can see 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.27	441.27	448.6	B	UI	inf	+1	1	and you can see that uh we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all are signal processing and then passes 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.28	448.6	452.24	B	UI	inf	+1	1	and then passes that signal on to the infrared l. e. d. and 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.29	452.24	458.17	B	UI	inf	+1	1	and that signal is animated and received by the television at the for the transistor So 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.30	458.71	462.23	B	UI	inf	-1	0	So those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.31	462.23	467.5	B	UI	inf	-1	0	and everything else is pretty much a open to move around 
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.29	468.04	472.72	D	ME	el.inf	-1	0	Yeah it is would just be considered just a standard the um 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.32	474.1	474.86	B	UI	fra	-1	0	I think any there's a 
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.30	474.6	477.29	D	ME	inf	-1	0	This is that this is not cutting edge technology we're talking here we're talking about existing 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.33	477.53	477.77	B	UI	ass	-1	0	No 
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.31	477.29	479.54	D	ME	inf	+1	1	here we're talking about existing technology that things can 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.34	479.14	479.4	B	UI	ass	-1	0	Right i think 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.35	479.4	480.017	B	UI	fra	-1	0	Right i think 
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.32	479.54	482.78	D	ME	inf	-1	0	that things can modify their upgraded or the discoveries 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.36	481.57	481.82	B	UI	ass	-1	0	Yeah this 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.37	481.82	490.01	B	UI	inf	+1	1	Yeah this is just this is just the basic layout about that all the components that we are gonna be absolutely necessary to have are working remote we can add things in like 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.38	490.01	493.64	B	UI	sug	+1	1	we can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition i mean that 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.39	493.64	502.46	B	UI	inf	+1	1	i mean that i mean they you can kind of say would would fall under the user interface and the visual signal processing chip but 
IS1002b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.33	501.26	502.33	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Oh okay 
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.57	502.4	504.49	A	PM	el.inf	+1	1	Do we have an i. d. of course of different components 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.40	504.8	508.91	B	UI	inf	+1	2	Um well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip and 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.41	508.91	511.48	B	UI	fra	-1	0	be the chip and the uh it could also basically 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.42	511.48	515.13	B	UI	inf	+1	1	also basically the user interface and the casing a gonna be expensive as well um 
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.58	515.44	515.58	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.43	515.13	521.33	B	UI	inf	+1	1	um the l. e. d. and that the transistors and everything else or you know they're they're pretty cheap So 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.44	521.72	528.0	B	UI	inf	+1	1	So depending on what we wanna functionality to be um the chip could be expensive or could be cheap um dependent 
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.59	528.05	528.34	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.45	528.0	534.23	B	UI	inf	+1	1	um dependent on my memory we need in there and stuff like that and and uh what do you know how much power 
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.60	533.54	535.68	A	PM	el.inf	-1	0	You have any ball park figures for that yeah oh 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.46	535.68	538.19	B	UI	inf	-1	0	Oh i don't have any figures right now we we have to wait 
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.61	537.83	538.05	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.47	538.19	542.58	B	UI	inf	+1	1	we we have to wait for you get to a more specific design phase for that um

IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.48	542.58	556.66	B	UI	inf	+1	1	um but and i think it's significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and and you know the The the buttons and things like that i think

IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.24	618.48	622.57	C	ID	inf	+1	1	is basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad

IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.31	646.87	651.47	C	ID	inf	+1	1	and then was the end up using simple functions a little things in 
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.32	651.47	661.37	C	ID	inf	+1	1	things in most people want one get to amount of actually having to go to the to this to the television into for instance team in their stations there's no need to have 
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.33	661.37	663.49	C	ID	inf	+1	1	there's no need to have them the remote so um

IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.35	665.91	678.85	C	ID	sug	+1	1	Um as for what i would recommend for a then the interface design and uh i will change the colours on the on the wall but Um we should go for the user oriented device so 
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.36	678.85	682.67	C	ID	inf	+1	1	device so simple controls and good ergonomics um 
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.37	682.67	689.82	C	ID	off	+1	3	um and now all the last last time still here recommending the teletext so i'll remove that i guess but 
IS1002b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.38	689.82	691.296	C	ID	fra	-1	0	but um we should go for that 
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.72	690.99	699.59	A	PM	inf	+1	2	But i think what they demand and recommendation was less that there's a way that teletext would become outdated rather than we shouldn't have that so i i 
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.73	699.59	704.35	A	PM	sug	+1	3	so i i still think of it cheap enough functionality waste include it really should be in there Because 
IS1002b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.53	704.32	704.6	B	UI	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.74	704.83	706.94	A	PM	fra	-1	0	Because otherwise we're just going to 
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.75	706.94	715.69	A	PM	inf	+1	1	going to make it even if it's necessary or not if you if you're given the choice between the two uh remote west don't think so without uh open it really if it 
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.76	715.69	724.93	A	PM	inf	+1	1	if it if it isn't more expensive for us to make because it's that is understand it it can be operated at the same set of buttons yeah so 
IS1002b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.77	724.93	726.0	A	PM	sug	-1	0	yeah so it should be in there
