TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	1174.21	1178.48	C	ID	inf	+1	1	um basically what happens is you press a button uh then 
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	1178.48	1184.16	C	ID	inf	+1	1	uh then the circuit gets close by pressing the button uh the like a switch And 
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	1184.66	1190.55	C	ID	inf	+1	1	And by closing that certain circuit chip knows uh what button button is pressed or

TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	1190.98	1194.19	C	ID	inf	-1	0	pressed or like you press the one that circuit it's clothes and um 
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	1194.19	1195.57	C	ID	fra	-1	0	and um then the chip 
TS3004b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	1195.57	1201.44	C	ID	inf	+1	1	then the chip produces a uh pattern Like a morse code to uh
