The industrial designer gave a presentation on the interface concept , discussing which buttons will be needed and then looking at some examples of existing remote controls.
He suggested using a yellow case with rounded edges and the logo at the bottom , and large , clearly marked buttons.
The interface expert informed the group that young people like curved shapes , soft materials and primary colours , and suggested making a hand-shaped remote in plastic and rubber.
He talked about the possibility of using a scroll button , and the different chips which could be used.
The group discussed using an LCD screen , but did not have enough information about costs to make a decision.
The marketing expert talked about new trends , including the trends for spongy materials and fruit and vegetable themed products.
The group had a discussion and decided to create two designs , one with an LCD screen and one without , and the interface designer drew them on the board.
They put off making a final decision about using an LCD screen , scroll buttons and a menu button until they could find out about costs.
