The meeting opens with the group doing introductions by giving their name and role.
Betty is the project manager , Francina is the user interface specialist , Eileen is the marketing expert , and Jeanne is the industrial designer.
The project manager tells them they will be designing a new remote control that should be original , trendy , and user-friendly.
They will be concerned with functional , conceptional , and detailed design.
To try out the whiteboard , each group member draws her favorite animal on the board.
They discuss the project budget and then talk about their experiences with remote controls.
They seemed to agree that the remote should be compact and have a multi-purpose functions.
They also agree that it should do something different that current controls cannot do and that it should be made of different colors , materials , and shapes.
They also discuss a way of helping people find the remote when it is lost- a signal , whether it is a beep or light.
Then they close the meeting with the project manager going over the tasks they are to complete and telling them they will meet again in about thirty minutes.
