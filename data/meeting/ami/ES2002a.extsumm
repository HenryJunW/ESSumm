{vocalsound} Um well this is the kick-off meeting for our our project .
so we're designing a new remote control and um {disfmarker}
Um , as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly .
Um and so there are three different stages to the design .
So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it .
And repeat that process three times .
{vocalsound} So uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it .
My favourite animal is like {disfmarker}
{vocalsound}
{vocalsound}
A beagle .
Uh , right , well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family .
And , yeah that they have lots of personality
Well , my favourite animal would be a monkey .
Then they're small cute and furry ,
and I kind of like whales .
They come in and go {vocalsound} eat everything in sight . {vocalsound}
M my favourite animal is my own dog at home .
Um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you ,
Um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro ,
And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros , so fifty percent of the selling price .
but selling price is {disfmarker} is that wholesale or retail ?
I imagine it probably is our sale actually
because it's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want . Um .
I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ?
Well right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh , like with D_V_D_ players , if there are zones .
um as well as uh characters ,
um different uh keypad styles and s symbols .
'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons .
I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so {disfmarker}
thinking , 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic ,
thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or {disfmarker}
Like how much does , you know , a remote control cost .
Well twenty five Euro , I mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something ,
so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you . Um .
But yeah , I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky .
I just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits .
I I mean one one way of looking at it would be , well the people producing television sets , maybe they have to buy remote controls .
Or another way is maybe people who have T_V_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something .
My parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house .
So um for them it was just how many devices control .
so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses {disfmarker}
Right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know ,
do your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything ?
maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots .
So , like , I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market ,
So extra functionalities .
You keep losing them .
W You get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep .
Maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . S
Maybe like a touch screen or something ?
Or whatever would be technologically reasonable .
Um so inbetween now and then , um as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it
Um for user interface , technical functions ,
Um and uh marketing executive ,
you'll be just thinking about what it actually {disfmarker} what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil
Yeah , so it's th the functional design stage is next , I guess .
are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ?
Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features ?
I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it ,
I think one factor would be production cost .
