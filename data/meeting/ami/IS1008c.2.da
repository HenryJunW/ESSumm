IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.15	143.92	150.19	ID	C	inf	+1	1	we were looking he specifically at the components uh {disfmarker} the following components ,
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.16	150.19	158.1	ID	C	inf	+1	1	uh the case , the power supply , uh the means of communications with the television set .
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.17	158.1	161.9	ID	C	inf	+1	1	In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition ,
IS1008c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.25	160.808	161.145	PM	A	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.18	161.9	163.6	ID	C	inf	+1	1	you have to have microphone {disfmarker}
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.19	163.6	167.31	ID	C	inf	+1	1	well no you don't actually I haven't {disfmarker} have to have microphone in the device ,
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.22	167.31	169.07	ID	C	stl	-1	0	but um
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.20	169.07	171.41	ID	C	fra	-1	0	maybe you do have it a a way {disfmarker}

IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.21	171.41	174.63	ID	C	inf	+1	1	it has to it has to hear the speaker
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.1	174.58	174.69	UI	B	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.23	174.63	175.74	ID	C	stl	-1	0	and um ,
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.24	175.74	178.11	ID	C	inf	+1	1	so it could be in the television set , could be in the device ,
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.25	178.11	180.95	ID	C	inf	-1	0	but somewhere you have to put the microphone ,
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.26	180.95	181.65	ID	C	stl	-1	0	um
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.27	181.65	187.13	ID	C	inf	+1	1	and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost .
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.28	187.13	190.53	ID	C	fra	-1	0	Um so the other w thing that we {disfmarker} So .
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.29	190.53	198.37	ID	C	inf	+1	1	Our method for going about this is we've looked at uh the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.30	198.37	202.76	ID	C	inf	+1	1	and then we also um {disfmarker} we wanted to evaluate some new materials
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.6	198.945	200.389	ME	D	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.31	202.76	205.47	ID	C	inf	+1	1	and we contacted manufacturing for their input
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.32	205.47	213.85	ID	C	el.inf	+1	1	because , course , we m might {vocalsound} come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us ,
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.33	213.85	214.78	ID	C	stl	-1	0	so uh
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.34	214.78	218.48	ID	C	inf	-1	0	this is the approach that we took during our um {disfmarker} our research .
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.7	216.698	217.493	ME	D	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.35	219.89	229.35	ID	C	inf	+1	1	So um for the case , um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design .
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.8	220.808	221.06	ME	D	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}

IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.36	229.35	233.16	ID	C	inf	+1	1	Course , you know , I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable ,
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.37	233.16	242.44	ID	C	inf	+1	1	but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh {disfmarker} we can really seriously explore ,

IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.39	242.44	245.26	ID	C	inf	+1	2	{vocalsound} so then we were thinking about um rubber ,
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.40	245.26	251.0	ID	C	inf	+1	2	but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor

IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.41	251.0	258.71	ID	C	inf	+1	1	and th um there might be some {vocalsound} problems with the m uh how it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh goes with the board .
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.42	259.558	266.87	ID	C	inf	+1	2	{vocalsound} Uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle {disfmarker} it gets brittle after a while ,
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.5	262.049	262.52	UI	B	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.43	266.87	271.24	ID	C	inf	+1	1	so um we still had titanium and and wood available ,
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.44	271.24	276.61	ID	C	inf	+1	2	but um unfortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh ,

IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.45	276.61	281.54	ID	C	inf	+1	1	the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium ,
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.46	281.54	286.62	ID	C	inf	-1	0	although how {vocalsound} Apple did it with th PowerBook I'm not su quite sure
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.47	286.62	287.66	ID	C	stl	-1	0	but uh
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.48	287.66	291.21	ID	C	inf	+1	2	nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood .
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.7	291.712	297.72	UI	B	ass	-1	0	{vocalsound} At least it's environmentally friendly . {vocalsound}
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.49	291.897	295.09	ID	C	inf	-1	0	{vocalsound} So , {vocalsound} this is our finding .

IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.50	295.09	299.0	ID	C	inf	-1	0	And a as she said , it's an environmentally friendly uh material ,
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.51	299.0	303.32	ID	C	fra	-1	0	so we're {disfmarker} we're {vocalsound} currently uh proposing ,
IS1008c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.12	299.981	300.456	ME	D	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.52	303.32	305.98	ID	C	inf	-1	0	uh we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second .

IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.53	305.98	311.51	ID	C	inf	+1	1	So then there's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board ,
IS1008c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.8	306.643	308.66	UI	B	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}

IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.54	312.03	318.31	ID	C	inf	+1	1	{disfmarker} uh these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much um intelligence with this simple one .
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.55	318.31	322.71	ID	C	inf	+1	1	And um then there was the regular which {vocalsound}
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.56	322.71	328.48	ID	C	inf	+1	1	I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one .
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.57	328.48	332.91	ID	C	inf	+1	1	Uh the other option was this advanced chip on print ,
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.58	332.91	334.89	ID	C	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound} and uh we liked th we
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.59	334.89	338.45	ID	C	inf	+1	1	we found that it it includes this infrared sender ,

IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.60	338.45	342.52	ID	C	inf	+1	1	which w 'member the beam was {disfmarker} that was an important component of finding the right chip .

IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.61	343.08	354.58	ID	C	inf	+1	1	And uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print ,
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.62	354.58	357.31	ID	C	fra	-1	0	so uh we we uh
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.63	357.31	360.59	ID	C	inf	+1	1	now jumping right to our personal preferences
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.64	360.59	367.01	ID	C	inf	+1	1	um I I'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um ,

IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.65	367.01	374.49	ID	C	sug	+1	2	you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods .
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.67	374.49	379.49	ID	C	inf	+1	2	I think that people will might really want to design their own cases ,
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.68	379.49	384.26	ID	C	inf	-1	0	you see , they could do sort of a {disfmarker} this um three-dimensional design on the internet ,
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.69	384.26	388.46	ID	C	inf	+1	2	and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know ,
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.70	388.46	394.33	ID	C	inf	-1	0	and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that ,
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.71	394.33	402.6	ID	C	inf	+1	1	and then I uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip .
IS1008c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.72	402.6	405.51	ID	C	inf	-1	0	So this is the findings of our research
