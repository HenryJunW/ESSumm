Do you know how how I can wake it up ?
I've lost my screen . Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
Never close your laptop .
Well , welcome to the kick-off meeting .
Well , this is the agenda for today .
examples of the tool training , project plan discussion and the closing .
Okay , the project aim is to design a new remote control .
Uh , some of the {vocalsound} oje objectives are that is has to be original , trendy , and user-friendly .
Um , I {disfmarker} oh forget {disfmarker} I forget the whole acquaintance part , but we we all know each other .
Uh we begin with the functional design , then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design .
Every uh level of design consists of some individual work , and we uh close it with a meeting .
Okay , first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools .
This is the presentation boards , wh which one I'm using right now .
there's a document folder called um the sh {vocalsound} shared document folder .
so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen .
There is a tool-bar over here .
It's like a very simple uh paint application .
and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button .
and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward ,
Right , we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards .
Uh , every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics ,
Well , I'm gonna draw um a p piranha . Uh , a fish .
And uh {disfmarker} so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths .
but the easiest animal I can think is is a bird .
and then we are uh through the tool training , I guess .
Okay , this is uh something about the project finance .
The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros .
And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros .
The market range is international , so it's gonna be sold world-wide ,
and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control .
well , we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be .
I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls ,
but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever .
Uh , so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with
uh grouped buttons , you know .
And uh , is it gonna be a remote control that's um {disfmarker} what it can be used for different kind of equipment , like your T_V_ and your home stereo ?
Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players , recorders .
{gap} I thought it was only for television .
So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_ .
Yeah , but most television remote controls support other functions as well .
Or someth something special , like uh M_P_ three player inside of it , or uh {disfmarker}
Okay . Maybe with different type of fronts or uh {disfmarker}
The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design , of course ,
The User Interface Designer {vocalsound}
the technical functions design .
And the Management Expert of uh {disfmarker} the Marketing Expert . User requirements specifi
I'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes . {vocalsound}
I'm gonna wri uh write some stuff down
We'll see each other in uh thirty minutes .
