4	ES2009d.JacquelinePalmer.s.8	The group decided to remove the solar panel in order to keep the price point of the device close to the original goal.
ES2009d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	749.08	754.83	A	PM	sug	+1	2	what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	844.63	849.03	D	ME	sug	+1	2	but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget
ES2009d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	896.6	900.16	C	UI	sug	+1	2	and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell .
ES2009d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	902.64	904.44	D	ME	ass	+1	2	I think unfortunately that's our best option .
1	ES2009d.JacquelinePalmer.s.9	The designers of the prototype decided to use several different colors in the visible light stream in the device.
ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	254.98	261.4	B	ID	inf	+1	2	As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out ,

ES2009d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	449.19	452.29	B	ID	inf	+1	2	but we just went for a classic rubber button
