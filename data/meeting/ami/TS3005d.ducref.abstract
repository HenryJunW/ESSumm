The project manager opened the meeting and then the user interface designer and industrial designer presented their prototype for the remote which featured an LCD screen , a scroll button , and a battery indicator.
The marketing expert conducted a project evaluation of the prototype.
The team found the remote to be fancy , innovative , fairly easy to use , available in different colors , fairly spongy , difficult to misplace , and targeted to younger people.
The project manager then led the team in calculating the production costs of their remote.
The team had difficulty in meeting the the target cost and had to eliminate some of the more expensive components they had hoped to include in their design.
The project manager then led the team in an evaluation of the project process.
The team found the project stressful , the equipment useful , the information available to them lacking , and their laptops to be slow and heavy.
