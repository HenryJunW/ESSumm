IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	1301.18	1303.55	D	ID	stl	-1	0	and uh you know the components 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	1303.55	1311.1	D	ID	inf	+1	1	you know the components and the circuit board boring buttons infrared led if it well for the components um 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	1311.1	1314.35	D	ID	stl	-1	0	um So you use that 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	1314.35	1315.74	D	ID	fra	-1	0	So you use that and finding just to 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	1315.74	1319.68	D	ID	inf	+1	1	and finding just to say that that you can detect uh when a keys pressed and then 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	1319.68	1329.84	D	ID	inf	+1	1	pressed and then used to answer to the key to a sequence something that morse code as you know Uh with the different sequence for each key and

IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	1329.84	1331.62	D	ID	stl	-1	0	each key and uh and that's 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	1331.62	1332.1	D	ID	fra	-1	0	and that's where the components to 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	1332.1	1338.3	D	ID	inf	-1	0	where the components to use would have different uh messages the consequences and 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	1338.3	1342.06	D	ID	inf	-1	0	and the chip since that singer signal to that was just a lot of "'em" to fight 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	1342.06	1345.21	D	ID	inf	-1	0	of "'em" to fight to make it stronger um 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.107	1345.21	1347.81	D	ID	stl	-1	0	um So i take 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	1347.81	1351.35	D	ID	inf	+1	1	So i take the new parts are some but on to uh printed balls um because 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	1351.35	1356.65	D	ID	inf	+1	1	um because it's easier to must produce and i some button and 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.110	1356.65	1358.74	D	ID	stl	-1	0	and uh so i think 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	1358.74	1370.64	D	ID	sug	+1	1	so i think we all fall our design want some uh that problem a bird uh you know the e. v. l. s. i. r. f. p. g. a. uh a high-tech energy and 
IS1000c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.148	1367.03	1368.61	C	UI	und	-1	0	Yeah i'm uh-huh 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	1370.64	1371.92	D	ID	ass	-1	0	and this is important and 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	1371.92	1382.15	D	ID	sug	+1	1	this is important and uh so we use a yeah like in any a high take care of devices a chip off like fibreglass to some of them and connect them

IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.126	1428.7	1429.2	D	ID	stl	-1	0	So there so that 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.127	1429.2	1446.99	D	ID	inf	+1	1	there so that you made me that uh they have uh uh I read about uh bunch of different buttons as for we use in to be did push buttons as such as um more that computer a mouse and um very cheap a c. d.s so they could use a display so 
IS1000c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	1442.67	1443.01	C	UI	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	1446.99	1454.41	D	ID	sug	+1	1	could use a display so i'm wondering i think we might be able to integrate it is c. d. into uh luck all seen And 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	1454.99	1463.54	D	ID	sug	+1	1	And the fire point but it is um we have yeah that's um a compromise just to do so 
IS1000c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	1463.28	1463.44	A	ME	bck	-1	0	Hmm 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.130	1463.54	1464.05	D	ID	stl	-1	0	so we have to know that 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	1464.05	1467.82	D	ID	inf	+1	1	we have to know that the pushbutton requires a simple chip but 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	1467.82	1479.38	D	ID	inf	+1	1	but the score we're uh at and that kind of a high a high tech stuff means more money um Which is a higher price range right 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.133	1479.38	1480.62	D	ID	el.und	-1	0	right and 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.134	1480.62	1483.1	D	ID	inf	+1	1	and the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is is more 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	1483.1	1486.32	D	ID	inf	+1	1	which in turn is is more expensive than the regular chip but 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.136	1486.32	1502.47	D	ID	inf	+1	1	but i think uh uh with twelve euros a um a nice it's uh a major form for minimum uh items then i think we we could be able to um there are so tool

IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.150	1562.74	1563.06	D	ID	stl	-1	0	Yeah it's kind of law um 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.151	1563.06	1570.2	D	ID	sug	+1	1	it's kind of law um simpler f. p. g. a. four for four member device and we have to insert i think we could 
IS1000c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	1564.55	1565.04	C	UI	fra	-1	0	What what 
IS1000c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	1568.39	1568.75	C	UI	und	-1	0	Okay 
IS1000c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	1570.24	1570.58	C	UI	und	-1	0	Okay 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.152	1570.2	1574.16	D	ID	sug	+1	1	i think we could insert the one that could on their uh sort of functions of 
IS1000c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	1574.53	1574.96	C	UI	stl	-1	0	Okay so in

IS1000c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.164	1574.96	1580.08	C	UI	sug	-1	0	Okay so in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is tied to use with the p. d. a. that 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	1580.92	1583.42	D	ID	ass	-1	0	Exactly yeah for customising and yeah 
IS1000c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.165	1581.56	1581.72	C	UI	stl	-1	0	You have added 
IS1000c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.166	1581.72	1585.27	C	UI	fra	-1	0	You have added a lot to do with it that might truly how cost 
IS1000c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	1585.27	1591.95	C	UI	sug	+1	1	how cost effective it could be too would that a chip could do we need to do the programme of the things

IS1000c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	1600.15	1601.42	B	PM	stl	-1	0	um so i understand 
IS1000c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	1601.42	1605.8	B	PM	inf	+1	1	i understand uh when we want to display we need a expensive chip but 
IS1000c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	1605.8	1611.33	B	PM	inf	+1	1	but when we you want the scrolling wheel we also need to expensive chip so i 
IS1000c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	1611.33	1613.98	B	PM	sug	+1	1	chip so i can be used change chip so 
IS1000c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	1613.98	1622.95	B	PM	inf	+1	1	change chip so we'd one expensive chip We can uh internet several complicate it or or advanced features 
IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.159	1622.66	1624.53	D	ID	ass	+1	1	Exactly yeah that's a very good idea we could have

IS1000c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	1624.53	1638.23	D	ID	sug	-1	0	idea we could have uh one main chip uh that could hand there are uh it's good as p. g. a. chip that could and uh both uh like sporting would use as well as a as c. d. and yeah

IS1000c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	1639.31	1647.79	B	PM	sug	+1	2	So when d. more expensive chip you meant there is is possible in the in the given that it's uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip so 
IS1000c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.112	1647.79	1653.76	B	PM	inf	-1	0	more expensive chip so all of features uh which you mentioned can be implemented by some same chip
