I have a little problems with my laptop .
And uh s s s so I had a little less time to complete .
Um , it didn't work anymore . {vocalsound}
The entire Windows uh {disfmarker}
Welcome to the conceptual design meeting
Uh uh , also this time there will be uh three presentations .
And we um must uh reach a decision on uh the remote control concepts .
Um uh , and at the end , uh I uh , when I finish it off I have some uh input from uh a master class I uh {vocalsound} visited . {vocalsound} {gap} information . {vocalsound}
I will take notes
uh and at the end of the minutes uh will uh be at the shared folder .
I'll be talking about the components .
Uh , what I did was I reviewed previously used items uh by uh two two uh different uh age groups .
Uh below forty five and above .
{vocalsound} senior citizens uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
They , well , they like more the {disfmarker} they like the traditional materials , like wood and and such more .
And uh uh they like uh straightforward shapes .
where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more uh soft materials .
Uh uh , soft and fluffy and colourful and {disfmarker}
But uh the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic .
Or you can go for both ?
But uh the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l uh light .
Uh , and you you could you could use normal light , but uh you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something .
I I prefer kinetic because it's uh {disfmarker} well , the costs aren't that much higher , and um , ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery .
But , what l what Jarek said , you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves .
Or but but you could go in a in an double curves . And that's {gap} like several different dimensions .
Yeah , that gives you a younger and uh more high-tech look , I f I figured .
Yeah you could {disfmarker} y It leaves more space for creativity .
I I ch prefer rubber because it feels uh {disfmarker} Yeah .
Well , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_ .
Uh , {gap} you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic .
I I uh I would prefer uh both uh too .
but if you have a square uh L_C_D_ screen , and you put a case around it that has uh like bulbs or that that covers part of the L_C_D_ screen .
That's {disfmarker} it's custom customisable and {disfmarker}
uh so what are the opinions ? Uh rubber or plastic ?
I I I prefer rubber .
I went to uh Paris and Milan for some trend-watching .
In Paris and Milan , we uh asked different people , uh differing in age and in income , uh the amount of money to spend , um {vocalsound} what they like in design uh and material nowadays .
Our main audience , uh so that's people below forty , uh prefer the following .
At first , the colours of fruit .
Um , fresh colours , uh green , red , uh strawberry red , uh yellow , banana yellow .
Yeah . They like spongy material ,
Okay , our secondary audience , uh people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours .
{vocalsound} Yeah , uh materials like wood that {disfmarker}
They have to look fancy .
Um , they should be technological in innovative .
Uh , and easy to use .
We have to aim at a mu at the {gap} main audience . And uh , therefore use fresh colours .
Here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . To customise your own remote control .
Uh , in my second sheet of personal preferences , uh we have to reconsider the speech function {vocalsound} uh recognition .
You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak {disfmarker} uh speech recognition and stuff .
Uh , building games like Snake or Tetris {vocalsound} to amuse the younger users .
And third , I stick with it , {vocalsound} the log-in functionality uh with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension . {vocalsound}
But , the main concept is um take one big touch screen .
Um , always display the primary buttons clear and visible .
And uh make the menu structure changeable .
{vocalsound} One thing you've gotta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time .
And um , things like teletext , put them in the menu .
But um , well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure .
I think we can discuss a little about the the three uh kind of revolutionary things uh Tim uh came with .
I think that parental control is a good function to uh to put in the remote .
How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents , children .
You don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings .
You c may use {disfmarker} like when there's uh X_P_ , uh a simple log-on , d you just push uh one or two or three .
I don't know if it's worth uh the time and effort we are going to spend on it .
Well I think that's a b there's a big market for it ,
Just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles ,
I i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control , uh let's say we do , and and well whatever , cho uh child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up {vocalsound} for instance .
What m what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program with the remote control .
Okay . And what do you uh guys think of the games in the voice recognition ?
But I don't think when you're watching T_V_ uh , hearing loud noises from the T_V_ , someone screaming {vocalsound} one , and you f the channel switches , uh {vocalsound} Yeah .
Yeah , like f voice recognition is too much , I think . But {disfmarker}
Okay . So the games uh are in it .
The voice recognition are not .
And the parental control are
Well , I think also it's a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate .
Like the first idea uh from uh {disfmarker} You can buy it without and uh with parental contr control ? Or are we going to put it in and uh just uh {disfmarker}
I I figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it .
Well , maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you cannot watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock .
But you still have the problem about uh the television itself .
You could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem .
{vocalsound} Okay . So uh I think we have decided on the things that {disfmarker} Uh from Janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic .
The case will be double-curved and uh rubber , in a fr flashy fruity colour uh that {disfmarker} with cover is removable .
The buttons will be uh touch-screen . Uh but there may not be too many buttons .
The parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex .
Maybe it's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view .
What I was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you don't use it is simple .
We take it to the other meeting ,
I went to uh a master class and uh uh two things uh are uh are uh {disfmarker} can come in handy uh for us .
First thing uh is uh we talked about knowledge uh management .
Knowledge engineering and uh uh the fact that uh that uh that the idea of knowledge , uh sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is {gap} uh like that .
{vocalsound} It's it's uh very hot at the moment ,
so it's it's mostly for the management expert to to look what other uh
What other companies uh had to uh also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote , just some uh {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound} Import export .
{vocalsound} I had a I had another idea to put uh uh the whole the whole idea of uh Real Reaction and uh uh uh a single brand and uh uh that kind of thing .
When you uh put on remote , you see a kind of a {disfmarker} just like when you telephone , you see a little uh animation .
And uh with the with the with the motto , we put fashion in electronics .
Well , if you if you have the l L_C_D_ screen , you can {gap} you can uh have a small logo i uh at the bottom .
That spins around like all the time .
It it's just like a uh globe in Internet Explorer .
N {vocalsound} Uh , next meeting starts in thirty minutes .
the the industrial uh development uh centre {vocalsound} and uh user interface uh will work together on a prototype .
And uh will drawing it on the SMARTboard .
And um , the marketing expert will uh will uh ke he will be keeping busy with the product uh evaluation .
But the most uh specific instructions will be sent to you by email .
But I think it was a very uh very good uh session , uh gentlemen .
But keep an eye on your uh laptops for a real uh
