7	IS1000c.elana.s.17	They are not certain if the project budget will allow them to use the more expensive chip , so they decided to make two prototypes so that they can compare them and possibly find a compromise.
IS1000c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.111	1639.31	1647.79	B	PM	sug	+1	2	when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget , uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip ,
IS1000c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	1660.37	1664.59	C	UI	ass	+1	2	I don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five Euro you know .
IS1000c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	1681.79	1683.47	A	ME	sug	+1	3	do maybe two designs
IS1000c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.172	1683.47	1684.36	A	ME	sug	+1	3	and then cost them out
IS1000c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.173	1684.36	1687.22	A	ME	sug	+1	3	and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better .
IS1000c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.117	1688.82	1696.98	B	PM	sug	+1	3	wh when you make a {vocalsound} a design ca you can {vocalsound} {disfmarker} next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price .
IS1000c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	1806.6	1816.72	B	PM	sug	+1	2	Let let's say next meeting w {vocalsound} you produce two designs , one one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price .
