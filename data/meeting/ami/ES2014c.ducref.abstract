The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the last meeting.
The Industrial Designer discussed options for each of the internal components.
He showed that the size of the chip was dependent on the type and number of additional features used.
The group discussed incorporating speech recognition and other functions to be able to decide on chip size.
They decided that using speech recognition for the locator function only would allow them to use a simple chip.
The User Interface Designer presented several existing products.
She presented a specialized children's remote; the group decided to focus on a basic remote that would appeal to a wide market.
She expressed that buttons are often ambiguously shaped and that their remote must have an easy-to-use interface.
The Marketing Expert presented trends in the remote control market and the fruit and vegetable and spongy material trends in fashion.
The group discussed ways to incorporate these trends.
They decided to make the standby button shaped like an apple , to use a rubber case and buttons , and to use a single-curved shape.
The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype.
