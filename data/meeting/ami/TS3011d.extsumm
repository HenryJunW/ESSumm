Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control .
And after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions ,
and then they will not use this dial as often .
Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ?
A a and the voice recognition as well ,
it's it's it's another approach ,
And and the case is is rubber ?
And the buttons ?
{vocalsound} Plastic or rubber .
Uh yellow with uh
grey or black or something like that . Whatever cost uh cost uh the least . {vocalsound}
M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition .
okay . Okay , yeah , that's right . Or something li like that .
al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it {disfmarker} you'd disable it with a little beep and and {disfmarker}
Yes .
The production costs .
Twenty two .
And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell .
um then I did the following changes .
Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells ,
um by not using the voice recognition feature ,
th this design is not um within our price model .
But I'm afraid it's not complete .
So the button we can use plastic .
And uh maybe not use the special form .
And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber .
{vocalsound} It becomes a very dull remote control , I know .
But it's the board decision .
Maybe we should look at an {disfmarker} uh focus on another uh {disfmarker}
uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic
but that's not what uh has been asked .
Although I think we {disfmarker} yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people
uh by giving it another colour already .
Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no .
because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good .
Is it ? Is it fancy ?
just {vocalsound} give it a two .
was it innovative ?
we are evaluating this this uh design now . This prototype .
I think uh it's a two .
Is it easy to use ?
so it will be a two point five .
{vocalsound} Is it easy to find ? {vocalsound}
we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out ,
but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find .
but I personally give it a one .
The feel of the remote control is spongy .
and make this a one point five .
The remote control offers enough features .
I'll give it uh a one . For for the {disfmarker} for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one .
I I've {disfmarker} I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price .
But {vocalsound} whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is {disfmarker} well , is not sure .
Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced .
it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality .
Um you had an overall rating . Um {disfmarker}
it's it's about one point five . Something like that .
we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . About the project itself , not about the product .
{vocalsound} The process was good .
But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs .
And and that was the the big deal .
We had we had too little information actually .
looking at room for creativity , there was w way too {disfmarker} the the choice of components was way too narrow .
in the first meeting we we already were very creative .
Uh leadership .
Fantastic . {vocalsound}
I think we're a good team .
I missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh , hey Roo uh {gap} . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}
the means , the SMARTboard , the digital pen . Did you like 'em ?
{vocalsound} Uh . The digital pen was okay ,
but SMARTboard was really bad .
although I would like to see um O_C_R_ .
But I think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem , uh writing down some notes , some some inf uh information , and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information .
I only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big .
I missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops .
The drawing cap capabilities are very limited .
And and uh w you were {disfmarker} when you're using uh Windows , you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons , uh which you can use for drawing .
we need to redesign uh the product .
I think we we we all know what the redesign should be .
A simple , dull , uh one-coloured box .
