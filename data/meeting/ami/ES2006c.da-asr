ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.16	113.66	117.29	A	ID	fra	-1	0	so what what you see i i the this is the outside 
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.17	117.29	119.68	A	ID	inf	-1	0	this is the outside of the remote right if you 
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.18	119.68	124.85	A	ID	inf	+1	1	if you all all point eight you have a circuit board here right and 
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.22	119.36	119.71	C	PM	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.19	124.85	127.83	A	ID	inf	+1	1	right and this is the chip that that was talking about last time this 
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.20	127.83	136.27	A	ID	inf	+1	1	this basically send information to look uh transistor there which then that uh uh a sense information to an l. e. d. device yeah if you flip 
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.21	136.27	141.52	A	ID	inf	+1	1	if you flip the printed circuit board and this is the most important point here uh 
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.23	135.95	136.57	C	PM	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.22	141.52	143.786	A	ID	inf	-1	0	here uh everything else is kind of 
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.23	144.87	148.89	A	ID	inf	-1	0	Okay so if you flip the circuit board is that what it looks like so 
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.24	148.89	154.96	A	ID	inf	+1	1	like so you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place under p. c. b. and 
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.25	154.96	157.27	A	ID	stl	-1	0	and the On pressing this button 
ES2006c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.24	154.47	154.68	C	PM	bck	-1	0	Yep 
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.26	157.27	160.9	A	ID	inf	+1	1	On pressing this button i i said that completes the information 
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.27	160.9	163.48	A	ID	inf	+1	1	the information goes to the chip which is somewhere here and the chip that 
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.28	163.48	171.57	A	ID	inf	+1	1	and the chip that that and then translates the court into i mean for a infrared radiation which course goes out so there So 
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.29	171.57	183.02	A	ID	inf	+1	1	So uh the important point is that i don't know what the website was uh that the configurations all of these printed circuit circuit boards a are quite i can i get them printed 
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.30	183.02	185.37	A	ID	inf	-1	0	get them printed as you want to so uh

ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.31	185.37	191.9	A	ID	inf	-1	0	so uh we we can have a configuration well um irrespective of the cost the way we want to have that right 
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.32	191.9	193.67	A	ID	inf	-1	0	that right that's it for twenty or so

ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.94	449.37	453.75	A	ID	inf	+1	1	so the this concerns first first of all the the chips i i should do that uh so 
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.95	453.75	456.51	A	ID	inf	-1	0	uh so there's there's a chip and this one right the

ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.111	529.91	532.34	A	ID	inf	-1	0	mm so they have a sample sensor and sample speaker 
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.112	535.19	547.27	A	ID	inf	+1	1	So i'm guessing that the the sample speaker is probably something like uh uh and uh you know as soon as you press a button it it now that gives gives you feed that one five or whatever yeah on 
ES2006c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.113	547.27	548.53	A	ID	inf	-1	0	yeah on um
