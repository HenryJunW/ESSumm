3	IS1009c.elana.s.18	The group would like to include voice recognition as a feature , but they are not sure about how much it would cost.
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.143	1566.82	1572.87	C	ID	ass	+1	2	Yeah , but but I what I'm uh very very much doubtful how {vocalsound} how uh far it will work ,
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.144	1572.87	1578.09	C	ID	inf	+1	2	because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems , issues .
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.148	1588.75	1593.24	C	ID	inf	+1	2	So to get a good recogni recognising system , it's a costly thing , I think .
1	IS1009c.elana.s.19	This will require further research by the industrial engineer.
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	1700.12	1707.26	D	ME	sug	+1	2	Okay , so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is .
