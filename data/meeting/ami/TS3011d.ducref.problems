The prototype proved extremely over budget.
It would cost 22 euros.
The team thought all the changes to accommodate the budget requirements made a very dull device.
It was suggested that they go for a completely simple design so as to maximise the profit , although this was not what was asked in the project requirements.
The device cannot be a hi-tech , innovative one any more.
