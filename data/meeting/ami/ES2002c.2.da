ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	75.18	76.88	PM	B	ass	-1	0	That might be a better idea this time .

ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	165.184	166.66	PM	B	ass	-1	0	{vocalsound} Oh no .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.27	165.29	166.73	ME	D	ass	-1	0	It's not good .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.28	166.73	170.08	ME	D	off	-1	0	Okay lemme just see where I can find it .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.29	179.59	180.79	ME	D	inf	-1	0	This looks more like it .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.30	182.46	183.96	ME	D	inf	-1	0	I think I just opened up the template .
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	184.01	184.52	PM	B	ass	-1	0	Oh right .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.31	183.96	184.76	ME	D	be.pos	-1	0	Sorry about that .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.32	184.76	186.86	ME	D	oth	-1	0	Okay alright so let's have a look here .
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.38	187.05	187.89	PM	B	oth	-1	0	Here we go .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	186.86	189.44	ME	D	inf	-1	0	Okay so this was the method that um I've taken .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	189.44	198.37	ME	D	off	+1	1	Uh basically what I wanna do here , before we get into it uh too far , is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful .
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	198.74	199.13	PM	B	ass	-1	0	Okay .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	199.16	203.26	ME	D	off	-1	0	And uh and then sorta g go through some of the way that I've dealt with that information ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	203.26	208.54	ME	D	off	-1	0	and then sort of bring us all together into it to see {disfmarker} sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	209.14	215.05	ME	D	inf	-1	0	Um so I've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	215.05	223.23	ME	D	inf	-1	0	and then ide identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh p project plan that we have so far ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	223.23	227.09	ME	D	inf	-1	0	and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	227.09	234.28	ME	D	inf	-1	0	so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	234.72	236.95	ME	D	el.inf	-1	0	Does that make sense , tha that sort of strategy ?
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	235.64	235.89	ID	A	ass	-1	0	Yep .
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	235.53	235.92	PM	B	ass	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	236.95	238.95	ME	D	inf	-1	0	I thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	238.95	241.37	ME	D	inf	-1	0	so that's why I suggested we get in this .
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	239.91	241.14	PM	B	ass	-1	0	Aye a fair point definitely .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	241.37	254.62	ME	D	inf	+1	1	Okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general , um consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	254.62	260.72	ME	D	inf	+1	1	and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel , uh b f f fancy .
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	258.92	259.36	PM	B	bck	-1	0	Okay .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	261.11	265.48	ME	D	sug	-1	0	Um however , this is where we kinda have to be very , I think , creative about it .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	265.48	268.02	ME	D	inf	+1	1	Number two was that it be innovative .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	268.02	276.58	ME	D	inf	-1	0	Okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	276.58	279.49	ME	D	inf	+1	1	Uh and third priority uh for ease of use ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	279.49	288.19	ME	D	inf	-1	0	so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be , um {vocalsound} quite user friendly while still having technology .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	288.35	293.65	ME	D	off	-1	0	So it {disfmarker} I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	293.65	307.46	ME	D	sug	+1	1	is that I think um {vocalsound} what we should think about is how the um {vocalsound} about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it .
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	301.631	303.408	PM	B	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	307.62	308.39	PM	B	bck	-1	0	Aye right .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	307.46	311.83	ME	D	sug	-1	0	For example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something , you know what I mean ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	311.83	315.91	ME	D	sug	-1	0	like , or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	313.97	314.37	PM	B	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	315.91	317.25	ME	D	fra	-1	0	because obviously the thing that {disfmarker}
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	317.25	319.36	ME	D	inf	-1	0	the message here is ease of use .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	319.36	323.5	ME	D	el.inf	-1	0	So how do you make innovation make something more {vocalsound} more easy to use ?
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	323.5	325.82	ME	D	sug	-1	0	Well that's I guess where we're gonna go with this .
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	325.01	325.47	PM	B	ass	-1	0	Okay .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	325.82	330.25	ME	D	inf	-1	0	Okay then there's the other aspect of the back the the market um
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	331.35	333.76	ME	D	inf	-1	0	research I have here is on fashion style , okay ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	333.76	335.89	ME	D	inf	-1	0	which as we've agreed is a priority .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	335.89	345.13	ME	D	inf	+1	1	Uh top European fashion trend um {vocalsound} that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay ,
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	344.22	345.142	ID	A	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	344.192	346.176	PM	B	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	345.13	346.53	ME	D	inf	+1	1	especially in clothes and furniture .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	346.53	352.92	ME	D	inf	-1	0	And when I first saw that I thought hmm , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	352.92	353.98	ME	D	inf	-1	0	or we get right into it ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	353.98	355.57	ME	D	inf	-1	0	or we completely steer away from it ,
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	355.89	356.8	PM	B	bck	-1	0	Okay okay .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	355.57	356.15	ME	D	el.und	-1	0	do you know what I mean ?
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	356.72	360.07	ME	D	sug	+1	1	So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	360.07	368.34	ME	D	sug	-1	0	but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	368.34	370.29	ME	D	stl	-1	0	Um 'cause I think what we're in
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	370.29	374.96	ME	D	inf	-1	0	what we're in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	374.96	381.27	ME	D	inf	-1	0	um {vocalsound} so I think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something ,
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	381.408	382.243	PM	B	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	381.27	382.42	ME	D	ass	-1	0	I think that would be pushing it .
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	382.56	384.686	ID	A	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	383.17	386.95	ME	D	inf	+1	1	And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	386.95	390.66	ME	D	inf	+1	1	and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	390.66	395.39	ME	D	inf	-1	0	which is {disfmarker} which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	395.39	401.86	ME	D	inf	-1	0	So um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	401.86	406.19	ME	D	sug	-1	0	so if we try and really capitalise on that , I think that'll be in our favour .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	406.19	406.96	ME	D	stl	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	409.6	411.46	ME	D	inf	-1	0	So these this is the summary of everything .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	411.46	416.77	ME	D	inf	-1	0	Um style is number one uh thing in the in the market of who we're selling to .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	416.77	423.19	ME	D	inf	-1	0	Uh innovative design technology's also a must in that it's seen {disfmarker} it'd be seen to be uh cutting edge ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	423.19	425.48	ME	D	inf	-1	0	uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	425.48	427.25	ME	D	inf	-1	0	That was like the number three thing .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	427.25	430.91	ME	D	inf	+1	1	And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	432.05	433.8	ME	D	inf	-1	0	that's the way I interpreted it anyway ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	433.8	436.56	ME	D	inf	+1	1	softness in materials , shape , and function ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	436.56	441.97	ME	D	inf	-1	0	and so I've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , Mac iPods ,
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	441.76	442.33	PM	B	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	441.97	446.98	ME	D	inf	-1	0	something which is , I'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	446.98	449.43	ME	D	inf	-1	0	but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons .
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	449.57	451.32	PM	B	ass	-1	0	Mm that's true , yeah .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	449.43	450.57	ME	D	el.und	-1	0	You know what a Mac iPod is ?
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	451.04	453.54	ME	D	inf	-1	0	I'm thinking however Mac iPod is sort of last year's
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	453.54	456.47	ME	D	inf	-1	0	because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	456.47	460.96	ME	D	sug	+1	1	so I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	460.96	465.69	ME	D	sug	+1	1	and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	465.69	466.672	ME	D	stl	-1	0	{disfmarker} or more of like a {disfmarker}
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	467.537	470.48	ME	D	inf	-1	0	{vocalsound} maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	471.6	472.83	ME	D	fra	-1	0	Um and then so this is
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	472.83	479.43	ME	D	sug	-1	0	w with all that information what I'm what I'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	479.43	485.54	ME	D	sug	-1	0	and as we get into more the more um {vocalsound} techni like sort of production side of things ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	485.54	491.14	ME	D	sug	-1	0	that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	491.14	492.176	ME	D	fra	-1	0	Sort of like a {disfmarker}
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	494.04	495.74	ME	D	fra	-1	0	I dunno like um
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	495.74	498.11	ME	D	sug	+1	1	we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	498.11	499.05	ME	D	sug	-1	0	that we agree on ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	499.05	501.49	ME	D	sug	+1	1	uh sorta like a marketing identity .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	501.49	502.288	ME	D	stl	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	503.75	504.74	ME	D	el.und	-1	0	Does that make sense ?
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	504.74	505.7	ME	D	oth	-1	0	Yeah .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	505.7	514.28	ME	D	inf	-1	0	So {vocalsound} so like I threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , I dunno , green colours , pe whatever ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	514.28	515.28	ME	D	inf	-1	0	it's just an idea ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	515.28	524.97	ME	D	inf	-1	0	'cause I'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their {disfmarker} what people associate this {disfmarker} them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that .
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	525.35	525.81	PM	B	bck	-1	0	Mm 'kay .
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	526.87	527.24	PM	B	ass	-1	0	Great .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	526.87	535.03	ME	D	inf	+1	1	Like um the ones the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	535.03	540.17	ME	D	inf	-1	0	you know something which is , like you see a lot in in other areas .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	540.17	545.351	ME	D	inf	-1	0	Like I see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and {disfmarker}
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	545.6	546.05	PM	B	bck	-1	0	Okay .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	545.95	547.92	ME	D	inf	-1	0	So anyway it's just just an idea .
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	548.66	549.01	PM	B	bck	-1	0	Yeah .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	549.07	558.4	ME	D	sug	-1	0	I'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} into something which is {disfmarker} which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	558.4	562.49	ME	D	inf	-1	0	because like um like something to do with like lighting within it .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	562.49	570.42	ME	D	inf	-1	0	Like you know just within the simple sense , when you pick up a phone and touch a button it uh lights up , q usually the buttons light up .
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	563.45	564.31	PM	B	und	-1	0	Ah .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	570.42	571.56	ME	D	sug	-1	0	How can we build on that ?
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	571.56	574.07	ME	D	sug	+1	1	Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	574.07	578.31	ME	D	sug	+1	1	or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	579.96	581.38	ME	D	sug	+1	1	covers or something so .
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	581.11	581.52	PM	B	ass	-1	0	Okay .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	581.38	581.94	ME	D	fra	-1	0	Anyway those are {disfmarker}
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	581.94	582.91	ME	D	inf	-1	0	that's all I have ,
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	583.06	583.64	PM	B	ass	-1	0	That's great .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.129	582.91	587.184	ME	D	inf	-1	0	but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into {disfmarker}
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	586.01	586.35	PM	B	ass	-1	0	Uh-huh .
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.59	588.13	589.88	PM	B	ass	-1	0	Okay great .

ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	664.93	666.49	UI	C	inf	-1	0	And so think of this concept .
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.3	668.45	672.43	UI	C	inf	-1	0	Um to research it I've um had a look on the the homepage again .
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	672.43	677.19	UI	C	inf	-1	0	It's provided me with more examples of um previously existing c remote controls .
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	677.19	681.27	UI	C	inf	+1	1	Um there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there ,
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.6	681.27	687.376	UI	C	inf	+1	1	um so I've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um {disfmarker}
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	688.79	689.32	UI	C	fra	-1	0	So then this {disfmarker}
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	689.32	694.26	UI	C	inf	+1	1	we're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons ,
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	694.26	696.25	UI	C	inf	+1	1	um the shape of the control ,
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	696.25	698.93	UI	C	inf	+1	1	and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control .
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.67	699.15	699.53	PM	B	bck	-1	0	Mm .
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	702.82	708.48	UI	C	inf	+1	1	Um what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them .
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	709.61	712.2	UI	C	inf	+1	1	Um they're not very attractive to look at ,
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	712.2	713.43	UI	C	inf	+1	1	{vocalsound} and they're not very comfortable to hold ,
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	713.43	713.78	UI	C	fra	-1	0	they're {disfmarker}
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	713.78	715.35	UI	C	inf	-1	0	I just hold 'em like big bricks ,
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	715.35	716.88	UI	C	inf	+1	1	and they're very easily lost .
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	716.88	718.59	UI	C	inf	-1	0	Um they tend to be very dark colours ,
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	718.59	721.898	UI	C	inf	-1	0	so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them . {vocalsound}
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.68	721.56	721.93	PM	B	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	722.82	728.98	UI	C	inf	+1	0	Um {vocalsound} the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme .
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	728.98	732.37	UI	C	inf	+1	1	Um for instance , the stand-by button isn't always red ,
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	732.37	733.05	UI	C	inf	-1	0	uh it really should be .
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	733.05	735.68	UI	C	inf	-1	0	It's uh something the user then uh identify with .
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	735.68	739.16	UI	C	inf	-1	0	This is a red switch off , that's how it should be .
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	739.16	741.14	UI	C	inf	-1	0	Um I'm not sure if there's any other examples of that ,
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	741.14	742.94	UI	C	inf	-1	0	but something to look out for .
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	744.69	751.45	UI	C	inf	-1	0	Um there's a problem that I've I've got couple of preferences for the the end control {vocalsound}
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	751.45	753.63	UI	C	inf	-1	0	um I get 'em with the the red colour button for stand-by
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	753.63	756.304	UI	C	inf	-1	0	and s the other examples of that {vocalsound} um {disfmarker}
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	757.123	758.51	UI	C	inf	+1	1	{vocalsound} The buttons should be large .
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	758.51	760.91	UI	C	inf	-1	0	They shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones .
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	760.91	762.94	UI	C	inf	+1	1	They should be easy to press , very comfortable .
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	763.448	772.01	UI	C	inf	-1	0	{vocalsound} Um one of the examples given on the homepage was um {vocalsound} there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a V_ on them ,
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.69	772.01	772.38	PM	B	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	772.01	776.28	UI	C	inf	+1	1	so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that's kinda confusing .
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	776.28	778.76	UI	C	sug	+1	1	Um should avoid s things like that .
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	778.76	785.69	UI	C	sug	+1	1	Um {vocalsound} if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere .
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.70	786.91	787.35	PM	B	bck	-1	0	Okay .
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	786.99	793.08	UI	C	inf	-1	0	Um obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could um tie-in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	792.11	793.07	ME	D	ass	-1	0	Yeah . Okay ,
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	793.07	794.34	ME	D	el.inf	-1	0	do we have a corporate colour scheme ?
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.71	794.122	795.95	PM	B	inf	+1	0	{vocalsound} I think it's yellow

ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	957.91	963.21	ID	A	inf	-1	0	Okay um I guess the same thing again , I started with something very basic .

ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	963.21	966.66	ID	A	inf	-1	0	So just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process ,
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	966.66	968.03	ID	A	sug	-1	0	um and then you can just work through it

ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	968.03	973.12	ID	A	sug	-1	0	and we 'll either modify it or start from scratch um depending on what your needs are .
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	973.68	976.21	ID	A	inf	-1	0	Um the components are exactly the same .
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	975.69	976.17	PM	B	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	976.21	981.76	ID	A	inf	-1	0	Um I think , like what you guys said , um the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface .
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	981.76	987.14	ID	A	inf	-1	0	The rest of the components um they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity .
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	987.14	989.53	ID	A	inf	+1	1	Um like you said time to market was a problem ,
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	989.53	991.96	ID	A	inf	+1	1	um and how many components are physically in there in cost .
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	992.23	994.38	ID	A	inf	+1	1	And the power is basically a factor of that .
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	994.38	1002.61	ID	A	inf	+1	1	Um and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , um they affect you in terms of the size of your device ,
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	1002.61	1011.88	ID	A	inf	-1	0	um and that would have some inte impact on how y I think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the the remote control
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	1011.88	1017.52	ID	A	inf	-1	0	because um like we've said {disfmarker} we've defined , like we only want the basic things that {disfmarker} to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide .
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	1017.93	1021.44	ID	A	inf	-1	0	So um you know it's just a matter of working out space .
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	1017.87	1018.23	ME	D	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	1021.44	1026.91	ID	A	inf	+1	1	So I guess three things , um cost , um complexity , and the size .
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	1026.91	1029.76	ID	A	inf	-1	0	These are the three things that um will have an impact on you .
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	1029.76	1031.89	ID	A	inf	-1	0	So just go through it in the components .
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	1031.89	1034.86	ID	A	inf	-1	0	Um these are the options that are available to you ,
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	1034.86	1041.29	ID	A	inf	+1	1	um I'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are .
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	1041.23	1041.45	UI	C	bck	-1	0	Right .
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	1041.73	1045.63	ID	A	inf	+1	1	Um it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen .

ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	1052.46	1058.45	ID	A	inf	-1	0	um 'cause they got back to me with like different requirements {vocalsound} , or different offerings of what components availa
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	1058.51	1061.11	ID	A	inf	+1	1	Okay so your basic components are buttons ,
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	1058.92	1059.11	UI	C	bck	-1	0	Right .
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	1061.11	1064.16	ID	A	inf	+1	1	okay and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel ,

ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	1070.44	1071.6	ID	A	fra	-1	0	um they're {disfmarker}
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	1071.6	1073.88	ID	A	inf	-1	0	well in the sense that these are all the options available for you .
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	1073.88	1077.45	ID	A	off	-1	0	I'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later .

ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	1077.45	1081.15	ID	A	inf	+1	1	Okay um then there's um how the case actually looks .

ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	1100.0	1102.04	ID	A	inf	+1	1	but plastic , rubber , and wood ,

ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	1104.72	1107.61	ID	A	inf	-1	0	They had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium .

ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	1107.61	1111.24	ID	A	inf	+1	1	Um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use ,

ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	1111.24	1116.03	ID	A	inf	+1	1	but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing ,

ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	1136.17	1141.36	ID	A	inf	+1	1	The com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	1141.63	1143.58	ID	A	inf	-1	0	um and that impacts cost .
