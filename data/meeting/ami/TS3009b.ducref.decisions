The solution to complaints about remote controls being difficult to learn is to focus on an intuitive design instead of a thorough manual.
The idea of interchangeable fronts was mentioned again; if it were adopted , the company should be recognisable in all the available fronts as well as the remote itself.
The team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons.
An LCD screen is going to be used to display information , but would not be interactive.
The buttons are going to include: OK , menu , screen sizing , AV , settings buttons , mute , digits 1-9 , power , volume control , channel up/down.
There is no need for a special button to recognise two-digit numbers.
The power button will be placed at the top separately.
The less frequently used buttons will not be hidden under a flip , as it had been previously suggested , as there are not that many of them; they will just be clearly separated from the more important ones.
