let's get started .
Uh opening acquaintance , tool training , uh how to use the things here . Uh project plan discussion , and yeah then the rest of the meeting .
Um we're supposed to develop a new remote control ,
that's both original , trendy and user-friendly .
Um we're work we're working uh from top to bottom . Uh functional design ,
then we do some in individual work ,
then we have a meeting to discuss the results , etcetera etcetera .
And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up .
Uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard . Um
uh we should take some practice .
I have some instructions now to do that .
you know how to {disfmarker} the documents work .
Uh this for toolbar . You see it next . Um
And we can use this pen to perform . {vocalsound}
It doesn't always work .
and in the format menu you can select colour and line width , etcetera etcetera .
Each of you can uh take some practice
and you should draw an animal . Uh you should explain {disfmarker} Uh with different colours and with different pen widths .
And you should explain why you draw that particular animal .
Different pen widths , how do you do that ?
Uh with the format menu .
And use different colours etcetera .
{vocalsound} It's a giraffe . Yeah .
Can you use one blank sheet per drawing ? Or
so y you must save it at the end
you can press the next button ,
I in the file option menu .
Is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other ?
introduction and get acquainted
I'm guessing a turtle .
How to select the next or {disfmarker}
{gap} Colours were under format
A fox yeah .
{vocalsound} It's a cat .
we have a financial aspect to this project . {vocalsound}
Um we can sell them at twenty five Euros . Uh
the aim is to reach {disfmarker} uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros .
Uh that's quite a big amount of money .
And the production cost should be the half of the selling price .
now it's time for some discussion .
Uh I'm taking notes . Um
we each have a specific task ,
as I saw in my mail .
I didn't know if you received the same mail .
this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design .
Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions .
{vocalsound} And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements .
Uh did any of you already do some work on this part
I started making an overview for myself , um what I had to do ,
'cause we have three design steps
and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever .
And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far ?
I started I started with the first phase ,
I had to focus on the working design , which you said .
I basically had two points .
Uh {vocalsound} according to the coffee uh machine example , I have batteries to supply energy ,
and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ .
I got another point .
It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo .
Uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function .
And for the changing up to the {disfmarker} to all the channels and changing the volume .
That are the the basic options for a remote control .
I mean , you wanna ch ch flip the channel
but you might wanna use teletext also .
Uh and what did the Marketing Expert do ?
from a marketing uh {vocalsound} perspective , um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements .
Um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ?
there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research {vocalsound} uh to see what existing products are there out in the market .
I mean , what functions do they have .
Um especially what are their shortcomings ?
Are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product ?
Um therefore we have to to do some internet search . For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions ?
Um {vocalsound} and we can interview current users and future users . What w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control ? Um especially for future users ,
uh I'm thinking of early adopters ,
because they they use new technology first ,
Um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are ?
No n not specifically .
{vocalsound} I got some uh requirements
it has uh {gap} it has to be user-friendly .
{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh really easy to use buttons ,
not not uh very small buttons ,
but not the the also the big big buttons ,
It has to be a small unit .
you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house .
Uh and a and a good uh zapping range . {vocalsound}
Uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be , uh yeah um yeah , quite a big distance .
I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment .
I think we can go ahead with what we have .
I will summarise the things we discussed
and put it in the project folder .
Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera .
And it seems you get more information by email .
I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh session ?
Do we only have to to do uh phase one , the functional design uh ?
After that we are going to the conceptual uh {disfmarker}
Y you do some individual work ,
we have meeting ,
individual work , meeting .
And at the end of the day we have a final meeting .
I mean , is it gonna be a multimedia control centre ?
Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ? {vocalsound}
I think that is the user requirements part .
As to what they want . Uh do they want all those functions on that small {disfmarker}
But but we need good communication about this stuff ,
So if I don't know what components to put in , it's kind of hard .
I I think we have first to start with the basic functions
and we can uh expand them .
like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which I know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices .
So you can switch to your video
and then the same buttons control your video .
And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre ,
but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player .
You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function .
And you you don't need that for a T_V_ .
And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well ,
so I kind of need to know what we uh need .
and then we can discuss it with the next uh meeting .
We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video .
And um reserve the possibility to add other features .
So we have a basic starting point
and you can always extend that
so make sure it's extendible . Yeah .
it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly .
{vocalsound} Th the least amount of functions possible
and uh I'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to .
Let's see what we got to do .
