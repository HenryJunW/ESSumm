In this meeting we will discuss our final design .
And we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project .
And then we're going to close the project today as well .
And this uh design , detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design ,
and we will do the product evaluation .
We'll have the prototype presentation first .
Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria .
{vocalsound} Then we will look at the finance .
Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget .
Then we will do the project uh evaluation ,
But first um we will do the {disfmarker} this is prototype presentation .
this is what me and Richard came up with .
The default spot for the on-off button .
The mute button just below that .
Then there's the volume and channel selectors .
Simple plus-minus button .
Uh we thought of a help button .
If you hold it and you press another button , uh the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen .
Then there's the zero to {disfmarker} one to zero buttons . A button for teletext . A button for the subtitles . And the company logo .
So it's rather simple prototype .
Um , {vocalsound} is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ?
Um , when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page .
Uh , that's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh {disfmarker}
you um came in uh page uh one hundred . Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons .
But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel . S so uh the shifting uh button . Uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext , and shifting uh down . So {disfmarker}
I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple . Uh just a few buttons and large buttons .
But uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons .
So I'm wondering if we if we neely {disfmarker} really need all of those buttons .
I think if you look at most controls , they've got more buttons than this .
the on-off button , it's it's a necessity .
The volume and channel buttons , you need you obviously need those those .
The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice .
I think the help button really is necessary
because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does .
Uh , or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh {disfmarker}
you can't leave out the number buttons I guess .
Uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary .
So it's rather basic already .
Just n normal plain buttons .
But they're supposed to be equal sized , round , with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and stuff .
and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons . With a a different colour than the case .
I will move on to the finance part ,
And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros .
I don't know if I've filled in correctly ,
so just correct me if you see uh something wrong .
I counted two batteries .
But maybe we can also use one .
Since it rechargeable .
That's two Euros off . {vocalsound}
We need the advanced chip .
{vocalsound} Here we have the single curves .
Uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro . Um ,
but I think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control .
Then we have the case material supplements .
It's plastic .
It's the cheapest one we need .
But then the biggest costs are the buttons .
So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low .
Let's fir first count the buttons we have now .
Uh seventeen . Uh with the help button .
I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number long .
Uh , d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each ,
So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing
I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button .
On the chip you've got still uh four uh four buttons .
Also the L_C_ display , I think it's , I think it's too expensive for the display we use .
If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip .
but what's the big advantage of our remote then ? {vocalsound}
Only the docking station , I guess .
Which isn't the {disfmarker} the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic .
it's not even taken into the price .
Don't you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th uh these buttons in three ,
But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ?
maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little .
but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros .
But it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty .
It is . If you leave out the L_C_ display . And if you use less buttons . Say {disfmarker} Or you can take the single chip .
Or we can leave out the ten buttons
and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers .
If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display .
Until you've got the right number , then you push it .
That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also . Integrated scroll-wheel push-button .
but then you you can push uh some other button as well .
Yeah . That's right . So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second , then it g turns to that channel .
{vocalsound} And the regular chip is not possible ?
If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip , yes .
And we can save a Euro by a flat design .
or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button .
but I think that's {disfmarker} That is a big advantage ,
can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ?
I think so . Yeah .
But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people ,
who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is .
Holding a remote with {vocalsound} which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero .
With only five buttons on it . And a scroll-wheel .
I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel .
And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen ,
which can provide extra information . How to use the scroll wheel . How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles .
And just um {disfmarker} If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel .
So we make one for the volume , one for the channel . Plus scroll .
we can leave the teletext in if we want .
So we can decrease this one to four buttons .
what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ?
I still think we should go for the single curve design .
But then again , {gap} all these changes are not really okay with me .
But since we just have to .
I'd rather just go to the board
and get us to spend {vocalsound} eighteen dollars a a remote .
But th um I think we can then keep the single curved one . Just to express our L_C_D_ screen a bit more .
I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . {vocalsound} Before we went on to the to the whole design .
Yes . Definitely . {vocalsound}
This will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell .
'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff .
This is not familiar for them .
But they know the scroll-buttons from uh old radios .
Uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels .
What it costs under twelve and a half Euros ?
Uh , yes they are .
But we can go on with the project evaluation .
I did some literature study study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier .
Translated it into criteria ,
Um , is the remote fancy ? The shape , look and feel .
Innovative ? What new functions are there ?
Uh , easy to use ?
Uh , learnability is a very important factor here .
Uh , is it functional ?
And the cost .
The target group . Is the remote really for the group we're making it for ?
I have to say this was a little hard ,
because the minutes of our last meeting were not here .
that's because my pen failed to upload his data .
Is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ?
We all go for six ?
Um , is the design innovative ?
I think so ,
Seven ?
Is the design easy to use ?
Mm . Not really .
I would say four . Four or five between . Between four or five .
Is it functional ?
Yes .
Do we have too many functions ?
No .
Think it's uh seven .
and do we um take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? Like it getting lost and {disfmarker} R_S_I_ influences ?
Mm , we haven't thought of that one .
Think we do .
Are the production costs within the preset limits ?
they are now .
Does the design fit the group of focus ?
I think that's a three .
I think with our new radio button , I think it's uh I think it's better .
{vocalsound} I still {disfmarker} I think it's too m too fancy . Too too flashy .
I would give it a four .
I think I'd go for two .
Is the company company recognisable ?
Yes it is .
we have the logo there .
And they wanna put fashion in their products . Uh in the slogan of the company .
And we have the removable front cases .
I was also supposed to calculate the score ,
These are seven factors times seven is forty something . Two ?
Forty one out of forty nine .
That's {disfmarker} Around eighty percent .
I think that's a pretty nice score .
that brings us to the project evaluation .
Did we move through the right phases , you think ? {vocalsound} Along the process ?
Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier . In the design phase .
So lack of information about prices .
Was there room for creativity ?
Not too much . {vocalsound} No . {vocalsound}
It's because of the finance sheet . Yeah .
Yeah , there w there was enough room , but the finance uh {disfmarker}
And I would've liked to go for the younger users also .
And just to be able to access internet and get something of your own .
Was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions ? Yeah ?
Teamwork ? Did it work out ? Working together ? Also , you {disfmarker} two of you with the uh last phase ?
The tasks are very structured ,
Were the means sufficient for the tasks uh we had to do ?
the smart-board , the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass ,
but {disfmarker} The digital the digital pen is very nice .
Failed download . Smart-board was irritating . {vocalsound}
the sharing of the information was uh was okay ?
Pen is here .
Uh , network .
Have we found new ideas for having this kind of meetings ?
Um , yeah
any more ideas ?
Or questions about the project ? Or about the product ?
Because I think then that we get to our last sheet .
{vocalsound} Considering we are not going to make a docking station .
Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ?
I think we will . {vocalsound} If we gonna export this product .
if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people .
So maybe we should just re-focus .
Just put it on the market for everybody .
You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers .
So you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the market . Just as a test . See how it works .
I think then it would be way more uh popular with younger people than it is , than would be with older people . Even if it were their covers .
I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire . I think .
Five more minutes ?
Then we still have some questions .
If somebody has some questions they can ask them now .
{vocalsound} I think I'm going to make our final presentation now .
{vocalsound} And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation . Summary of the project .
Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ?
Uh maybe we have to fill uh another questionnaire .
