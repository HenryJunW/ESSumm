In the detailed design meeting the team created a prototype.
Along with buttons for numbers , channel selector , volume , mute , on-off , teletext , and subtitles , the prototype included an LCD screen and a help button for functional information.
One rechargable battery , single-curve form and plastic case , brought the total cost to 17 Euros.
To reduce this cost , it was decided to replace most buttons with a scrollwheel.
The remaining buttons were one for channel selection , one for volume (both assisted by the scrollwheel) , teletext , on-off and the help button.
A suggestion to target the product to a younger or perhaps more general group was met with approval.
All these components were re-arranged in a revised prototype.
It was evaluated on a scale from 1 to 7 on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (6) , technological innovation (4) , functionality (7) , consideration of the target group (3).
The remote was also recognisable as a fashionable Real Reaction product.
The project process was deemed well-structured , although everyone thought it would have been better had they known the component prices at an earlier stage.
Teamword and leadership were good , but room for creativity impeded by budget constraints.
