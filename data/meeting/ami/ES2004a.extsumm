Um I'm Sarah ,
the Project Manager
Okay , this is our agenda , um {vocalsound}
get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other .
Um then we'll go do tool training ,
talk about the project plan ,
discuss our own ideas and everything um
Now , we're developing a remote control which you probably already know .
Um , we want it to be original ,
um , trendy ,
appealing to a wide market ,
and user-friendly ,
grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it .
Okay , um , first is the functional design ,
um this is where we all go off and do our individual work ,
um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product ,
um what effects the product has to have
Um , conceptual design ,
and then the detailed design ,
how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work .
We're gonna practice with the pens
and draw our favourite animal on the white board ,
and um sum up the characteristics of that animal .
I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger .
Uh , maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make ?
A kind of dog ?
Okay , now I'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be
{vocalsound} Yeah , it can be a crocodile , it can be a crocodile .
it's meant to be an eagle {vocalsound}
Um finance-wise , we've got a selling price at twenty five Euros ,
which I don't actually know what that is in Pounds , at all .
Seventeen .
Okay , that's expensive .
Should we be making notes of this ?
I'll be able to um pull it up ,
or I could put it in the shared folder or something .
Havi having said that though , if you wanna get one of those {disfmarker} the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway .
um production cost's at twelve fifty , so
Um , and profit aim is fifty million Euros ,
You've got market range international
and you did say earlier it's got to be a {disfmarker} um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups
What are your experiences with remote controls ?
I mean I've got {disfmarker} we got um {disfmarker} we had three videos , a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up
so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into ,
but that kept losing the signals
but that was quite good , the fact that you could {disfmarker} You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you .
My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy ,
not doing any tampering with it and programming ,
I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do
And symbols that you don't necessarily understand ,
So simplification of symbols you could think of .
and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it .
but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display ,
I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful ,
so you've got a little L_C_D_ display .
instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that ,
What about the older generation ?
that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps ,
I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system .
I find it really confusing ,
Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get ,
you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume .
The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control
I think that's a cost thing ,
And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone ,
it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ?
Something that's easily moulded and produced .
we've got half an hour before the next meeting ,
so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things . Um
and then we'll come back and liaise again
and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation .
about what you're saying about the uh {disfmarker} does does it need to be fashionable ?
I I had a quick look at the company website
and it's like the the uh {disfmarker} we put the fashion into electronics ,
I mean you don't {disfmarker} you you can still have plastic
we don't have to use metal ,
I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything .
They're kind of moulded
and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic ,
so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about .
Okay , so let's break it up there .
So , see you in half an hour .
