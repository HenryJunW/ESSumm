{gap} . {vocalsound} I did get a bit more done than the last time ,
'cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copy and paste everything into the {disfmarker}
{vocalsound} Sometimes I have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there ,
and also with {disfmarker} I don't know how to use PowerPoint , so it takes me forever to get something done with it .
Uh we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to uh {disfmarker} f the remote control has to support .
So welcome to the marketing presentation once again .
Um fashion watch watchers uh have detected the trends for young public , because that's our public .
fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing , uh shoes and furniture .
And the feel of the material is expected to be spongey .
oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours .
most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel . Instead of the current uh functional look-and-feel .
And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative .
I think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition ,
And the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use .
Well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect .
Uh nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing , and and some fruit and colours
{vocalsound} Just made a quick design .
I'm dealing with the components design .
I uh used some design examples we had uh from similar products .
Uh for example the energy source . we have four types .
The basic battery .
Uh we have a hand dynamo ,
Uh the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing , if you shake it .
And uh of course solar cells .
for the uh a case , there's uh the traditional uncurved flat hard case .
Single curved , which means that it has uh curves in one dimension .
Or the double curved .
but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now .
Well we have all kinds of hard uh materials like the the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium .
I would definitely go for rubber
We have yeah several uh interface designs .
Uh we can use a scroll buttons for the menus ,
but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons , for the the arrow buttons .
the advanced chip I think is easiest to implement uh for the production , 'cause they they can print it better .
I first uh chose for the battery , 'cause yeah I'm traditional and that's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to .
But I really think that we should maybe uh think about the kinetic energy ,
I can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make .
But it is more longlasting , that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again .
and {disfmarker} especially when the material's rubber . It can be done , I mean , you can't harm it ,
So double curved is like this , this , this , or {disfmarker}
No it means curved in two dimensions .
So uh w single curved ? Uh let's say would be a b square box , but then with curves on one dimension .
One one uh very important thing I was uh yeah thinking about is the speech uh option .
I think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present .
But do uh j do we uh do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ?
For for everything ,
in the in the last uh meeting we uh we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated .
Pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control .
And only the the L_C_D_ panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options .
but this is the the the simple uh layout .
Uh display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button .
And uh if there are older people they wanted more uh yeah more uh luxurous {disfmarker} so that's an a also an option .
So we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy .
Uh the case would be doubly curved . So {disfmarker}
Rubber material .
Advanced chip . Okay .
I'm just thinking , this is not my department , but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost ,
I didn't get any information about that so {disfmarker}
Uh do you have a picture of doubly curved case ?
This is the the menu I was uh looking uh at .
S see this is the the the standard traditional type , where the form uh yeah serves the function , you know .
But this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that .
And th that means curved in both dire dire uh dimensions .
where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold . And {disfmarker}
Th this looks a little bit like like for only for children . So {disfmarker}
Yeah but that's that's the the problem uh yeah the dilemma actually ,
'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours , and with a lot of shape .
Yeah , and the and the rubber , it it will look cheap always ,
Okay but the the colours , you you can make it uh make the colours with {gap} LEDs uh beneath the the buttons .
If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it .
And this is , this is with the curved that I mean .
Well we could make a compromise between that .
Uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved . So to appeal a little more to the all the public .
Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then ?
I mean our aim is to make something different right ?
I would go for the double curved .
And I I'm I'm thinking uh you know uh a drawing palette , where you have the shape for your thumb .
but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons .
You can make a trigger button or something like that .
and we need something that well that {gap} that you can able to use in one hand I think .
But from the side you you can have it also in a kind of shape .
A little upwards . So that the screen is more
So then you have double double curved in some way .
How about we do a uh a pop-up screen , like the laptop .
If you can uh flip .
But I dunno if that's too expensive .
Okay so the buttons are on top here , and you flip it over that way .
and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto uh uh automatically .
So {disfmarker} okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open .
Well yeah the the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever .
We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break .
And ergonomical shape . Yeah .
I would give it a female shape
Yeah so okay we should better choose one sh one shape .
So the keywords are primary co colours , spongey ?
I think that uh it's a nice design .
{gap} or do we wanna make its shape look like a banana or something ?
I don't know what what colours should the basic print be like ?
Like some soft {vocalsound} green or something ?
Orange or something .
and then and then very bright , uh a yellow banana , {vocalsound} an orange , uh a green apple , stuff like that ,
Yeah w we need very primary colours , like bright red , bright yellow .
Yeah but the primary colours w we can uh create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control .
If you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour , then it's just a neutral colour ,
{vocalsound} That doesn't really work . To draw , I guess .
So that's that's a dark blue basic colour I guess .
Yeah with some some yellow banana {disfmarker}
'cause I remember from one of our first meetings that uh people lose their uh remote controls often .
So it {disfmarker} not not only in in the colours {vocalsound} of the LEDs , that we want something to keep it visible at all times ,
I mean , the the colour of the background of the display ?
So just just a {vocalsound} a blue blue backlight or something like that .
maybe a maybe a white a white backlight ?
But don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours ? So th the total of the thing is very bright ?
But then then again , which colour should the buttons be ?
But maybe the buttons , all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people .
{vocalsound} Red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate . Even for colourblind .
So red buttons are okay ?
You better bet better better keep the LED and the button itself in the same colour I guess .
what we should do I think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button , with uh one coloured LED behind it .
but {disfmarker} uh basically you two are going to work on the smartboard .
Next thirty minutes to design something so {disfmarker}
You will do the evaluation .
{vocalsound} You probably get a mail .
Yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation {disfmarker} you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow .
So we're gonna work here ? On this sketchboard ?
But we have to do it at this moment , after th this meeting ?
Yeah you have uh
thirty minutes .
