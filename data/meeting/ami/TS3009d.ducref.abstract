The ID and UI presented the drawing of a prototype.
It is rounded , with the front made of hard plastic in different colours.
The back , as well as the lower part of the front are made of titanium.
The back has the logo and slogan of the company engraved in its middle.
The buttons include oval digit buttons , arrow-shaped channel and volume controls in the middle; below those , is the menu (for the LCD) and the video button.
The LCD can be found at the lower section of the device.
After the presentation , the product was evaluated.
This was done on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) on fancifulness , ease of use , finding the device when it is lost , hi-tech features , incorporation of fashion trends , and ergonomic design.
Because it was over budget , titanium was replaced by plastic and the speech recognition was discarded.
They thought it would have been more sensible to have the component costs before the prototype design.
Finally , the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (generally satisfied) , leadership (the process was democratic , not happy with management) , teamwork (happy with it) , and means (SMARTboard was 'a disaster' and the digital pens only good for drawings).
