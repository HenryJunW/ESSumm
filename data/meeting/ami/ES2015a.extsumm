Welcome to the meeting everyone .
This is the first meeting uh for developing our , our new product .
{gap} I'm Heather , I'm your Project Manager .
If everyone could go around and explain their role and um , and their name .
My name's Poppy .
I'm the Industrial Designer for this project .
{vocalsound} My name's Tara and I'm the User Interface Designer .
I will also be responsible for the functional design phase , the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design . {vocalsound}
I'm Genevieve .
I'm the Marketing Expert .
And uh tool training is one thing that we're going to be doing today ,
um um as well as planning the project ,
as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control .
Um , we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy ,
um , a completely new style , so that , um , can really appeal to a , to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of , uh , channel-changer .
And , um , it needs to be user-friendly for , um , maybe , for an example , for people that , um , can't see the numbers as well ,
Yes , it's a television remote control .
I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now .
and then , um , after we've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in a meeting and , and discuss what , what um , what kind of functional design we want to use .
Same with conceptual design and detailed design .
And , um , as a sort of team-building moment , um , I , I'd like us to , um , try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal .
My favourite animal , which changes all the time , okay ,
right now it is an elk .
and it , it is my favourite animal right now , 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature ,
I'm gonna take minutes
while , um , you guys express your favourite animals .
like all sorts of animals , but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently . {vocalsound}
But I like cats because they're so independent ,
I think my favourite animal would be a dog ,
{vocalsound} . Um , I like dogs because , um , they're so good to humans ,
I'm going to draw a butterfly ,
because I saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving .
So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard ,
um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget ,
um , wanna make this um {gap} selling price of twenty five Euros .
we can {disfmarker} like the price to create it will be significantly less .
Um , we'd like to , um to , uh , make fifty million Euro .
Um , and make it for an international market .
Um , we want it to cost , uh , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents .
so we'll have a hundred percent profit then ?
So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any um suggestions that you may have so far ,
I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing .
I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing .
So maybe if you could have some kind of
tracking {vocalsound} device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was .
Do yous not find that , um , {vocalsound} like , there's a lot of , um , buttons on your remote control , and you don't know what half of them do .
There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something .
Are we going into kind of novelty factors here .
I suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing .
And the key issue here is , is being trendy and original .
Um , like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times .
Um , our next meeting will be in half an hour .
Industrial Designer .
You'll be beginning your , your working design .
Um , U_I_D_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes .
and , um , we need the user requirements from the manag
Marketing Expert .
Um , you will get specific instructions , um , of what to do in the next half an hour .
