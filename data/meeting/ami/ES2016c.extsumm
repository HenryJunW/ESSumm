This is our conceptual design meeting .
{vocalsound} I'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes .
Um then each of you will have your presentation ,
um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control .
{vocalsound} Um we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo .
our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users .
Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before .
Um which were all things we were thinking we would {disfmarker} wanna make it simple . Um {disfmarker}
And that it should look different than what's out there .
Um uh I think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it ,
Um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote , because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity .
I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . Um {disfmarker}
{vocalsound} Um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand . {vocalsound}
And with a scrolling um function also .
I was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at .
Um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design ,
Um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative .
And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up .
And thirdly the remote would be easy to use .
As far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture .
Um and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel .
Um I think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design .
But I think that , even if it's very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers ,
so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and {disfmarker}
We brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further .
We need to keep it simple , have limited buttons ,
Um {vocalsound} we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables .
I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable .
Or with exterior designs .
So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable ,
Possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones ?
Personalise your remote .
Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices .
They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly .
There's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote .
Um there's a graphical use , where you you look at pictures and well on a screen .
A command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response .
Um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes .
So , then I had a look at new products that are on the market .
Um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices .
And then on the right is obviously an iPod ,
and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through .
And nothing's simpler really .
Um then there's things like this , which is a a a kid's remote ,
where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before .
So I don't know {gap} if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components ,
Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing ,
And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote .
it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus .
The details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control .
top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input ,
{vocalsound} Its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television .
{vocalsound} Um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time .
We are talking something more complicated of course , it's going to be more expensive as well .
Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell .
So we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium .
Can also mix these .
Um what we could use is , or what I was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery .
So um obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really .
Um solar cell is interesting .
{vocalsound} May fail though , every here and there .
Um the kinetic energy thing um might work , um but the same problem .
You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work .
So I'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery .
our interface options are push-buttons .
however {vocalsound} when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an L_C_D_ into the remote control as well .
If we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that I've just presented , um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well .
solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control .
With the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design .
With plastic , as I understand it , you can use any form .
{vocalsound} With rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it ,
but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an L_C_D_ screen .
And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit .
Is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ?
How about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control ?
Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously ,
but uh give it like the surface of
an orange , banana , whatever .
You could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose .
I would say , if I were to make a decision , I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance .
I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous ,
So is the two piece idea out ?
Well we sort of {disfmarker} {gap} rid of that because {gap} gonna use a battery .
Well we can still design a two-piece uh remote um without having a base , having one of them be a base station ,
{vocalsound} Energy source I think we've , I think we've decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet .
Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print , as I said , the the more advanced features you want , um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive .
So I guess the case would be plastic ,
with {disfmarker} Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it .
It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe .
So then for the scroll , are we going for the iPod type ?
Yeah I think so .
{vocalsound} Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right ?
Um Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design . Um {disfmarker}
Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design .
Corrine we'll want a product evaluation .
And the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh
maybe and and get us a prototype .
basically {gap} just be working on the prototype , {vocalsound} uh we'll accomplish your other two actions .
