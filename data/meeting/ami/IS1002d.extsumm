Okay so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product ,
And here's the agenda for this meeting .
Uh I'm just gonna open , say a few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards .
You guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product
And then we're gonna evaluate it .
Then we're gonna talk about finance ,
Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department , which is us , is uh fifteen point eight Euros ,
we implemented the basic functions ,
which is just T_V_ functions plus the locator ,
cradle ,
scroll wheel for uh the {vocalsound} the channels ,
and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll .
Scrolling through your favourites list .
I like the the the the logo on there as well .
so this is the cradle unit ,
Um so the scroll bar is {disfmarker} or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here ,
This is the teletext .
So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming {vocalsound} your uh the um the type of television you wanna use .
So um the plastic is the white area of this {disfmarker} of the model here ,
and the red area is like a rubber covering .
and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um {disfmarker}
could that be easy to {disfmarker} for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ?
Yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem , but if you drop it {disfmarker}
I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well .
but I think we might scale down the final model a bit .
So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote .
Beep beep beep .
And um there's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it ,
we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger {disfmarker}
but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there .
And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so {disfmarker}
But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling ,
So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit ,
But it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that ,
So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people .
My my s my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions .
So you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there
I gotta do mine up at the board .
No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it .
And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh .
And uh to me with this product we got uh {disfmarker} we got {vocalsound} basically three things to market .
We've got the features ,
we have the uh characteristics ,
The the corporation stands behind the product , okay .
we've got you know the features that make this a unique product . Um
we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive .
One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee ,
it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , I believe , to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros .
We're gonna be competitive , and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche .
would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ?
for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , I th I think that that we can go after this
and at that cost I think it uh {disfmarker} there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together .
The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only .
There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my {disfmarker} but I like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back .
{vocalsound} Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ?
W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but {disfmarker}
Yeah , the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less {disfmarker}
b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons ,
Okay so we can talk about finance now .
So I have a little spreadsheet for us
I've made a f few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros ,
which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already .
Uh {vocalsound} and I'm assuming that the locator beacon ,
uh can be made for a similar price to uh an L_C_ display ,
um I do think we that we we {vocalsound} uh don't need the events chip on print , we only need the uh the regular chip on print ,
Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved ?
It's single-curved ,
So we come {disfmarker} bring it down to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Fifteen point four .
See it's a little bit more than f single-curved .
So yeah it's fifteen point eight ,
we haven't talked about any special colour though
if we're going for greys and silvers then I don't think we're {disfmarker}
is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll ?
That's a scroll .
then we have fifteen point eight Euros .
We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation ,
How how have we done today ?
I think we did pretty well .
No , I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept .
Okay so th th what about um room for creativity ?
Sh I think there was plenty of room .
I think we we ended up being quite creative there .
we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us
yeah but {disfmarker} we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess ,
It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was
These cables suck {vocalsound} .
So yeah the the pen came in alright
and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works .
What new ideas have we found ?
Well we had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle , and the r uh remote call feature .
Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice .
And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon .
Are the costs within the budget ? {vocalsound}
Not the original budget , but they are now .
Is the project evaluated ?
So we need to close this meeting ,
