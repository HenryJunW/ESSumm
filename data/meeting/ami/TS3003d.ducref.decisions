The prototype will use a rechargable battery.
The case will be plastic and will be made in single-curve form.
Five buttons are going to be used: one for channel selection , one for volume (both assisted by the scrollwheel) , teletext , on-off and help button.
These would be made of rubber in a colour different from that of the case.
Their functionality will be enriched by the use of a scrollwheel (going up or down the channel list , changing the volume , etc.).
Standard buttons like the ones for teletext shortcuts were considered superfluous.
An LCD screen will be providing functional information , and context tips when using the scrollwheel.
The revised prototype will probably be targeted to a younger one , or even across the population.
