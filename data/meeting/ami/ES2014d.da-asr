ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.79	818.98	823.8	D	ME	inf	-1	0	This is about the evaluation criteria be used for that the prototype we've got here and

ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.80	823.8	827.34	D	ME	inf	-1	0	and so the method is the design team mates prototype um evaluate 
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.81	827.34	831.98	D	ME	inf	+1	1	um evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we formulated and

ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.83	835.45	838.28	D	ME	inf	-1	0	and also fine um so i guess 
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.84	839.339	843.98	D	ME	inf	+1	1	And it on a scale from so it should be one false paying seven so

ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.86	855.5	863.95	D	ME	inf	+1	1	So i've got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to identify mental one as well at the end um 
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.87	863.95	869.6	D	ME	inf	+1	1	um so We have to say with this true or false the the product looks and feels fancy 
ES2014d.D.dialog-act.s9553330.88	870.68	875.8	D	ME	inf	+1	1	Um But the the product demonstrates technical innovation that is
