The group realized that it would be too costly to add both a voice recognition component and a touch screen , so they decided between the two and will now only add the voice recognition component.
The group decided to have optional alternative cases for the device to suit different consumer tastes.
It was also decided that the remote will not have the traditional look of a hand-held remote since it can be stationary with voice recognition software.
The remote control will be made of a soft rubber material.
The device will be powered by solar power , with a small backup battery.
