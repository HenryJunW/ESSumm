The project manager opens the meeting by going over the agenda.
She explains the project , which is to create a new remote control for television that should be original , trendy , and user-friendly.
The three components of completing the project will be functional , conceptual , and detailed design.
They introduce themselves by going up to the white board and stating their name , role , drawing their favorite animal , and sharing their favorite characteristic about the animal.
After they talk about their overall budget , they discuss what special features they want to include in this remote control that existing ones do not have.
They discuss making a menu-based remote which would be less crowded with buttons and therefore stylish and sleek but functional.
They end the meeting with the project manager going over the task each member is to complete before the next meeting.
