ES2006a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.3	29.94	31.16	UI	D	inf	-1	0	I didn't receive it yet {vocalsound} .
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.7	31.33	34.02	PM	C	inf	+1	1	this is the the plan for today's meeting
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.8	34.02	40.31	PM	C	inf	+1	1	is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly ,
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.9	40.31	45.12	PM	C	inf	-1	0	um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already .
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.10	45.12	50.09	PM	C	inf	+1	1	Then the main purpose is to {disfmarker} so that we get to know each other a little bit more .
ES2006a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.1	49.38	49.66	ID	A	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.11	50.09	59.25	PM	C	inf	+1	1	Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings ,
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.12	59.25	64.3	PM	C	inf	+1	1	um specifically the whiteboard over there .
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.13	64.3	70.44	PM	C	inf	+1	1	Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.14	70.44	73.44	PM	C	fra	-1	0	and discuss {disfmarker}
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.15	73.44	75.56	PM	C	inf	+1	1	come up with some preliminary ideas about it .
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.16	76.88	78.66	PM	C	inf	-1	0	And then that's it .
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.17	78.66	80.73	PM	C	inf	+1	1	So we've got twenty five minutes to do that ,
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.18	80.73	82.58	PM	C	inf	-1	0	that's until eleven twenty five .
ES2006a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.2	84.432	86.98	ID	A	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound} {gap} so sh
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.19	85.17	88.61	PM	C	el.inf	-1	0	S so any any questions ?
ES2006a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.3	88.704	91.334	ID	A	fra	-1	0	{gap} {vocalsound} {gap} .
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.21	88.61	88.73	PM	C	fra	-1	0	Is i
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.20	89.491	91.36	PM	C	ass	-1	0	{gap} not at this point .
ES2006a.D.dialog-act.s9553330.4	89.3	90.22	UI	D	inf	-1	0	Not at this point .
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.22	94.72	96.94	PM	C	inf	-1	0	So this is our project .
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.23	96.94	103.73	PM	C	inf	+1	1	What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television .
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.24	103.73	113.73	PM	C	inf	+1	1	Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly ,
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.25	113.73	118.84	PM	C	inf	+1	1	so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product .
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.26	139.03	150.09	PM	C	inf	+1	1	The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such .
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.27	150.09	157.43	PM	C	inf	+1	1	There's the functional design of the the remote control .
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.28	157.43	158.01	PM	C	fra	-1	0	We're going {disfmarker}
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.29	158.01	162.3	PM	C	inf	+1	1	the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.30	162.3	166.22	PM	C	inf	+1	1	and then come together for meetings to to work on that .
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.31	167.58	172.16	PM	C	inf	+1	1	Um similarly with the conceptual design ,
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.32	172.16	178.34	PM	C	inf	-1	0	we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.33	178.34	180.2	PM	C	inf	-1	0	and then we'll bring what we've done together .
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.34	181.63	186.88	PM	C	inf	+1	1	Um and then the detailed design will come after that .
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.35	186.88	188.11	PM	C	inf	+1	1	We'll pull it all together .
ES2006a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.4	188.69	194.05	ID	A	inf	+1	1	I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ?
ES2006a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.5	194.05	199.12	ID	A	el.inf	+1	1	Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ?
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.36	199.01	208.99	PM	C	inf	+1	1	I think it {disfmarker} th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be {disfmarker}
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.37	208.99	212.45	PM	C	inf	+1	1	we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control
ES2006a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.6	212.63	212.97	ID	A	und	-1	0	Right .
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.38	212.45	215.79	PM	C	inf	-1	0	and what what specific things it it has to do
ES2006a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.7	215.863	216.577	ID	A	fra	-1	0	{gap}
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.39	215.79	220.12	PM	C	inf	+1	1	but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.40	220.12	225.83	PM	C	inf	+1	1	and includes the {disfmarker} how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing .
ES2006a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.8	221.67	223.18	ID	A	inf	-1	0	How how it will be done .
ES2006a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.9	227.37	229.0	ID	A	stl	-1	0	So
ES2006a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.10	229.0	233.14	ID	A	el.inf	-1	0	whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ?
ES2006a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.11	233.14	233.86	ID	A	stl	-1	0	Uh
ES2006a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.12	233.86	237.83	ID	A	fra	-1	0	I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the {disfmarker}
ES2006a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.13	237.83	243.33	ID	A	el.ass	+1	1	it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ?
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.41	244.45	251.54	PM	C	inf	+1	1	Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then
ES2006a.A.dialog-act.s9553330.14	249.72	249.99	ID	A	ass	-1	0	Okay .
ES2006a.C.dialog-act.s9553330.42	251.54	251.9	PM	C	oth	-1	0	{disfmarker} yeah .
