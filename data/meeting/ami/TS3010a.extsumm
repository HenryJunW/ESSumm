The first kick-off meeting .
First the opening ,
then the rest .
We m have to make a new remote control .
It has to be original , trendy and user-friendly .
So we will get back th on that .
First we have to make a functional design .
After that we have to make a conceptual design ,
and then after that a detailed design .
So we'll discuss that later .
So first to {disfmarker} we have to make a small painting .
First you can save the documents .
We have to do that every time we make something .
And we have to use {vocalsound} the pen and the eraser .
We all have to use this one .
So I'll make an example .
Um you can change some things .
Um format , line , and change it . {gap} {disfmarker}
{vocalsound}
{vocalsound} And you can change the colour .
An elephant . {vocalsound}
So and after it you have to save it .
{vocalsound} So you're next .
Uh a bird .
Now save ?
Okay .
Now next . The budget .
we will sell the t at twenty five Euros .
And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it .
First I wanna hear from you .
Uh what are your experiences with remote controls .
Big one , they are uh not easy to use .
And uh g big buttons ,
{vocalsound} m uh that's easier to use than uh {disfmarker} I think .
Big buttons , positive .
Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set .
And that it controls the channels and the the volume .
And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote .
And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it's working .
But I {disfmarker} my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that .
Uh at home we have a T_V_ , a video uh recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver .
We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that .
That's not really ea easy .
So it would be nice if we have one for all .
For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it .
So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ?
The weight . Not not too heavy .
Not much buttons .
That when you drop it , it won't break .
Like uh some kind of rubber on it .
Or hard uh hard plastic .
Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . Uh it between the couch and you can't find it .
When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some {gap} {disfmarker} uh some sort of bleep .
Yeah well that's {disfmarker} that are good ideas . Uh {disfmarker}
And looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material .
So probably plastic or something . Uh {disfmarker}
Yeah I think it uh {disfmarker} from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice .
on our website we can see what products we already have .
And it should work with as many uh as possible of them .
Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries .
So you don't {disfmarker} won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks .
It's only the first ideas .
uh what are we going to do now is {disfmarker} Next meeting is in half an h hour .
Um , what you have to do . Well look on your {gap} .
And {disfmarker} Next instructions you'll get in your email . So {disfmarker}
