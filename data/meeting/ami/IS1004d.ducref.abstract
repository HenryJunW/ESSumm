The project manager goes through the minutes of the last meeting.
They have the prototype presentation and talk about the final design , features , and power source , type of chip and weight of the remote.
They go through the evaulations , using the a list of criteria made by the marketing expert.
They rate each criteria on a scale of 0 (true) to 7 (false): how fancy it is , how handy it is , how functional , how cool it is , whether they would spend twenty five euro for it , and whether they would change their current remote for this one.
Next they do a cost estimate for production.
In doing this , they decide against solar cells and go with the rechargable batteries.
They keep the regular chip , stick with plastic , put two scroll wheels and three push buttons , and make it a special shade of yellow.
They eliminate the turbo button and give the remote a single curve because of budget restrictions.
They briefly evaulate the project process and close the meeting.
