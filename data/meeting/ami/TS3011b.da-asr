TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	321.33	326.25	B	UI	ass	-1	0	My personal preference where ease of uh that use use remote control Because uh the user 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	326.25	331.8	B	UI	inf	-1	0	Because uh the user friendliness and uh it can be more trendy in and use design but 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	331.8	339.73	B	UI	inf	-1	0	but um your new goal for was for uh people than less than forty years old so maybe

TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	339.73	346.84	B	UI	sug	-1	0	so maybe um the multi function and can be implemented in uh in our design but 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	346.84	350.09	B	UI	sug	-1	0	but it should be i think it should be a combination but teletext buttons 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	350.09	354.58	B	UI	inf	-1	0	but teletext buttons are not uh in our design so it should 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	354.58	361.07	B	UI	inf	-1	0	so it should uh Take out well eight buttons or so but not as in my opinion 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	361.07	367.63	B	UI	ass	+1	1	but not as in my opinion the uh it be easy to use r. c. is uh the best uh one possibility for us

TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	426.47	429.92	C	ID	stl	-1	0	Okay um mm well there 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	429.92	434.0	C	ID	inf	-1	0	mm well there are some changes in the Design requirements so that uh some 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	434.0	436.71	C	ID	inf	-1	0	that uh some changes in the method also um

TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	436.71	442.51	C	ID	inf	-1	0	um basically all this device has to do is to send messages to t. v. set and and 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	442.51	449.31	C	ID	inf	+1	1	and and most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to the t. v. set well i was 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	449.31	449.67	C	ID	stl	-1	0	well i was 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	449.67	450.09	C	ID	fra	-1	0	well i was a tried to 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	450.09	453.73	C	ID	inf	-1	0	a tried to um Implement picture here but 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	454.05	455.328	B	UI	fra	-1	0	And it's nice and then 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	453.73	455.18	C	ID	inf	-1	0	picture here but it's hardly readable 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	456.44	457.66	C	ID	el.inf	-1	0	Casey no 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	457.13	458.23	A	PM	inf	-1	0	No it's not as well 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	457.66	458.13	C	ID	und	-1	0	no well 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	458.13	460.26	C	ID	stl	-1	0	well Um there's the energy source 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	460.26	462.39	C	ID	inf	+1	0	there's the energy source here and 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	462.39	464.47	C	ID	stl	-1	0	and um basically there is 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	464.47	464.91	C	ID	fra	-1	0	basically there is 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	464.91	466.38	C	ID	inf	-1	0	basically there is connected to free things user interface 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	466.38	468.58	C	ID	inf	+1	1	user interface connect to chip which is connected 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	468.58	470.55	C	ID	inf	+1	1	which is connected to the sender which generates 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	470.55	474.84	C	ID	inf	+1	1	which generates messages using uh infrared light which 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	474.84	476.25	C	ID	inf	-1	0	which is sent to the receiver that's basically the idea 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	476.25	477.87	C	ID	inf	-1	0	that's basically the idea and 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	477.87	485.49	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and doesn't little bit you just for your imagination how the device like this should look or can look Okay 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	485.49	487.48	C	ID	stl	-1	0	Okay um what have i found 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	487.48	488.25	C	ID	inf	-1	0	what have i found usually 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	488.25	494.3	C	ID	inf	-1	0	usually these kind of things consist of battery infrared diodes buttons chip set a circuit boards that's all 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	494.3	495.18	C	ID	inf	-1	0	that's all this case together 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	495.18	498.22	C	ID	inf	-1	0	this case together nothing more and that's It's almost 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	498.22	507.07	C	ID	inf	+1	0	It's almost every piece of equipment um Every piece of uh every t. v. set is controlled infrared there are some exceptions 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	505.65	505.94	B	UI	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	507.07	508.34	C	ID	inf	-1	0	there are some exceptions but 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	508.34	512.62	C	ID	inf	-1	0	but most of all have uh infrared controls and 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.48	512.62	516.48	C	ID	inf	+1	0	and uh the more luxury a remote controls and let them buttons and i 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	516.48	519.47	C	ID	fra	-1	0	and i think that's what we're yes in 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	518.06	521.25	B	UI	inf	+1	0	The on the dark uh concept uh we discuss 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	519.47	520.0	C	ID	ass	-1	0	yes in the end it's 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	520.0	520.42	C	ID	fra	-1	0	the end it's 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	520.42	523.15	C	ID	inf	-1	0	the end it's a little more little bit more fancy also so maybe 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	523.15	526.55	C	ID	sug	+1	0	so maybe we should consider that Okay 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	524.18	524.44	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	525.47	525.88	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	526.55	527.37	C	ID	stl	-1	0	Okay i have the 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	527.37	532.23	C	ID	inf	-1	0	i have the basic scheme of things uh which are implement um 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	532.23	535.77	C	ID	inf	-1	0	um basically this is all the rest is just 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	535.77	537.01	C	ID	inf	-1	0	the rest is just one chip there are few buttons connected 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	537.01	538.65	C	ID	inf	-1	0	there are few buttons connected uh the buttons 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	538.65	540.17	C	ID	inf	-1	0	uh the buttons uh let's and 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	540.17	544.48	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared light diodes and there's not a 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	544.48	546.08	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and there's not a power source here 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	546.447	548.78	C	ID	stl	-1	0	So that's basically 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	548.78	552.35	C	ID	inf	-1	0	So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment that's not a moderate 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	552.6	553.72	A	PM	inf	-1	0	So it's very easy 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	552.35	553.69	C	ID	inf	-1	0	that's not a moderate it's very 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	553.69	554.63	C	ID	ass	-1	0	it's very easy it's been dorm 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	554.63	557.32	C	ID	inf	-1	0	easy it's been dorm many times before and i think we should 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	557.264	557.93	A	PM	bck	-1	0	I 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	557.168	560.04	B	UI	inf	-1	0	Sixty and it also 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	557.32	561.49	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and i think we should to we should succeed in in a plan to do this so 
TS3011b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	557.514	558.185	D	ME	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	561.48	562.67	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay good 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	561.49	565.34	C	ID	stl	-1	0	do this so Okay so uh personally i think 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	562.67	562.9	A	PM	be.pos	-1	0	good 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	565.34	567.9	C	ID	sug	+1	1	uh personally i think we should infer use infrared because 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	567.9	574.31	C	ID	inf	+1	0	because uh otherwise our device can have uh communicate with uh almost every t. v. set so 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	574.31	577.08	C	ID	inf	-1	0	so i think that there should be clear at another important 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	576.78	577.1	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	577.08	583.72	C	ID	sug	+1	1	at another important point is that we really should use uh energy uh sparse friendly components uh they're 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	583.72	588.83	C	ID	inf	-1	0	uh they're specially uh designs uh and energy friendly components which 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	588.83	593.21	C	ID	inf	-1	0	components which can zoom uh far less power than a conventional components and um 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	593.21	602.19	C	ID	sug	-1	0	and um if we want to use uh uh uh a rechargeable design or uh uh energy save design we should really implement them 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	602.769	608.66	C	ID	sug	+1	1	Um for cost effectiveness if we should really use a very low cost the circuit board and 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	608.66	613.93	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and because most the production cost r. r. in just a part of the equipment and 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	613.25	613.59	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	613.93	623.37	C	ID	sug	+1	2	and um the money we say if we using this we can use uh for an average fancy lighting and techniques blinking lights and all that kind of fancy stuff i think our 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	621.883	628.54	B	UI	fra	-1	0	And what's the um If we use 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	623.37	626.14	C	ID	inf	-1	0	i think our uh use as we really yeah we're really like that 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	628.54	632.38	B	UI	el.inf	+1	1	If we use and that's it doesn't use so much more energy or

TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	632.62	632.96	C	ID	inf	-1	0	No that 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	632.96	635.09	C	ID	inf	+1	1	No that was uh power friendly less also so we can use them 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	635.06	635.47	B	UI	und	-1	0	Okay 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	635.09	636.6	C	ID	sug	-1	0	so we can use them so that's no problem 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	636.6	637.39	C	ID	inf	-1	0	so that's no problem 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	637.35	639.19	B	UI	el.inf	-1	0	Or the same costs can be uh in 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	639.19	640.515	B	UI	fra	-1	0	can be uh in uh 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	639.15	641.95	C	ID	inf	+1	1	Um now the other a little bit more expensive but 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	641.95	645.429	C	ID	fra	-1	0	expensive but by uh um uh i'm making 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	644.71	646.36	B	UI	inf	-1	0	Combined with the low cost circuit boards this yeah

TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.113	840.12	842.48	C	ID	stl	-1	0	so um i don't think 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.114	842.48	844.74	C	ID	inf	-1	0	i don't think we have a ticket there so we 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.115	844.74	851.87	C	ID	inf	-1	0	so we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs so 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.116	851.87	858.37	C	ID	sug	-1	0	so maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and sound signal 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	855.91	856.53	B	UI	ass	-1	0	Yeah the sound signal 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	856.53	857.78	B	UI	sug	-1	0	the sound signal is one 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	857.78	858.29	B	UI	stl	-1	0	is one thing i'm just wondering 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	858.29	865.79	B	UI	el.sug	+1	0	thing i'm just wondering Some signal from where do you execute the this in south I know

TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	978.63	979.77	C	ID	fra	-1	0	No and it the the most 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.155	979.77	992.4	C	ID	inf	+1	0	the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which you can go and uh at the form uh uh some kind of uh online And then uh the remote control uh reports itself so 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.137	984.35	984.6	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	992.4	993.21	C	ID	stl	-1	0	so we we should use have 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	993.21	994.26	C	ID	fra	-1	0	we we should use have uh we should use 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	994.26	995.87	C	ID	sug	-1	0	uh we should use something like that you 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.160	995.87	1004.44	C	ID	sug	-1	0	something like that you do not want another device which can be uh everywhere in the house which you have to find first before you can find your remote control 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	1004.374	1009.03	B	UI	ass	+1	1	Just a base station next a t. v. is a bus with nancy 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.161	1006.39	1007.74	C	ID	ass	-1	0	Right something like that but it 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.162	1007.74	1009.92	C	ID	inf	+1	1	like that but it will be very costly i think so 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.138	1009.99	1010.4	A	PM	stl	-1	0	Yeah maybe 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.139	1010.4	1022.28	A	PM	sug	+1	1	maybe um well we we do agree on on the thing that the the remote should have such a function if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things um maybe sebastian 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.163	1009.92	1011.35	C	ID	ass	-1	0	i think so that's not a good idea

TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.140	1022.28	1029.5	A	PM	sug	+1	1	um maybe sebastian should have a a detailed look later on and um come up with the solution because that's

TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	1661.56	1663.31	C	ID	stl	-1	0	so um when you add

TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.275	1822.66	1827.93	A	PM	inf	-1	0	maybe maybe you all have uh things not um spoken about yeah 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.276	1827.93	1828.77	A	PM	stl	-1	0	about yeah that 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.277	1828.77	1831.33	A	PM	inf	-1	0	that that are important uh did you 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.278	1831.33	1835.54	A	PM	inf	-1	0	uh did you you came up with the voice recognition the data uh are there 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.279	1835.54	1838.52	A	PM	el.inf	-1	0	uh are there other things about the market we should now 
TS3011b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	1841.18	1846.77	D	ME	inf	-1	0	Um i think we do with the most important information just 
TS3011b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	1846.77	1855.99	D	ME	inf	-1	0	just uh the uh younger parts off uh uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh Want to sell two 
TS3011b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	1857.48	1864.77	D	ME	sug	-1	0	So we we should uh uh for least a bit uh look at the uh uh all people but

TS3011b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.108	1870.59	1873.14	D	ME	inf	-1	0	so I think that's a big problem 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.281	1871.65	1872.08	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.282	1874.19	1874.65	A	PM	stl	-1	0	Okay so although we

TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.283	1874.65	1886.95	A	PM	el.inf	+1	1	Okay so although we are focusing on younger people uh to make it uh a profitable uh Well we we yeah we still need to take in account the the bit older people 
TS3011b.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.109	1879.46	1881.05	D	ME	ass	-1	0	Yes yeah profit

TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.285	1888.61	1892.1	A	PM	stl	-1	0	Okay Um at all 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.286	1892.1	1892.37	A	PM	el.inf	-1	0	at all 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.287	1893.594	1896.12	A	PM	und	-1	0	Nothing to uh 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.187	1893.59	1896.23	B	UI	inf	-1	0	I have nothing yeah nothing that i think 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.288	1899.2	1899.73	A	PM	el.inf	-1	0	It's lost yeah 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.320	1900.2	1907.73	C	ID	off	-1	0	Um i just want to make it a summary of all all things are spoken and uh the different possibilities um 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.289	1903.61	1905.39	A	PM	ass	-1	0	Yeah Right 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.321	1909.3	1910.45	C	ID	stl	-1	0	So uh basically we've decided 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.322	1910.45	1915.15	C	ID	inf	+1	1	we've decided to implement uh seemingly uh easy design so on the outside 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.323	1915.15	1915.56	C	ID	stl	-1	0	so on the outside 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.324	1915.56	1917.11	C	ID	inf	-1	0	so on the outside it looks easy but 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.325	1917.11	1922.0	C	ID	inf	+1	0	but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on your side so that's one 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.326	1922.0	1923.42	C	ID	fra	-1	0	that's one that that those are the choices 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.327	1923.42	1925.53	C	ID	inf	-1	0	that that those are the choices we have to make but 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.328	1925.53	1934.61	C	ID	ass	+1	0	but i think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing a speech techniques uh voice recognition that these kinds of things 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.290	1932.12	1932.52	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.291	1934.87	1935.05	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.329	1935.43	1942.38	C	ID	ass	-1	0	Um it makes it also more uh at writable i think two are uh audience Um there 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.330	1942.38	1945.97	C	ID	inf	-1	0	Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages and 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.331	1945.97	1950.48	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques which uh 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.332	1950.48	1952.91	C	ID	inf	-1	0	which uh i think our customers well like disadvantages 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.333	1952.91	1963.42	C	ID	inf	-1	0	well like disadvantages that there are so concerns about uh the the costs and uh and uh things like that battery lifetime energy saving uh another advantage 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.292	1962.7	1962.88	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.334	1963.42	1969.06	C	ID	inf	-1	0	uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more user if we do in that do not implement these buttons 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.335	1969.514	1977.31	C	ID	inf	+1	0	If you just at uh uh a chip which just uh a voice recognition uh our circuit board will become even more cheap so 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.336	1977.31	1979.53	C	ID	fra	-1	0	so that's not well it'll it'll 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.293	1977.94	1978.12	A	PM	stl	-1	0	Yeah and that was the main issue 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.294	1978.12	1979.14	A	PM	inf	-1	0	and that was the main issue right the the board

TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.337	1979.53	1979.78	C	ID	stl	-1	0	well it'll it'll 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.338	1979.78	1980.27	C	ID	fra	-1	0	well it'll it'll it was an issue 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.339	1980.27	1981.56	C	ID	ass	-1	0	it was an issue but we also 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.340	1981.56	1983.6	C	ID	fra	-1	0	but we also false but we already 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.341	1983.6	1987.37	C	ID	inf	-1	0	but we already fort we should do it as cheaply as possible and there's even 
TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.297	1987.06	1987.28	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.342	1987.37	1989.64	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and there's even uh makes it more cheaply so 
TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.188	1989.74	1994.08	B	UI	el.inf	-1	0	But the cheaper that uh uh the chip or in one of the circuit board 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.343	1993.14	1994.1	C	ID	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh the circuit board

TS3011b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.300	1998.88	1999.82	A	PM	fra	-1	0	No it's it yeah 
TS3011b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.345	1998.62	2002.22	C	ID	ass	-1	0	The fewer buttons you have yeah that's the cheaper the circuit board yes

TS3011b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.191	2000.64	2001.6	B	UI	und	-1	0	Yeah okay
