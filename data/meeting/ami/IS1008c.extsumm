For uh this meeting the main agenda okay uh to discuss about the conceptual design meeting .
Okay and the agenda will be the opening
and uh the presentations from the Christine and uh Agnes and from Mister Ed .
and we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and uh the functional design
we were looking he specifically at the components uh {disfmarker} the following components ,
uh the case , the power supply , uh the means of communications with the television set .
In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition ,
you have to have microphone {disfmarker}
well no you don't actually I haven't {disfmarker} have to have microphone in the device ,
it has to it has to hear the speaker
so it could be in the television set , could be in the device ,
and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost .
Our method for going about this is we've looked at uh the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't
and then we also um {disfmarker} we wanted to evaluate some new materials
and we contacted manufacturing for their input
because , course , we m might {vocalsound} come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us ,
So um for the case , um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design .
Course , you know , I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable ,
but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh {disfmarker} we can really seriously explore ,
{vocalsound} so then we were thinking about um rubber ,
but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor
and th um there might be some {vocalsound} problems with the m uh how it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh goes with the board .
{vocalsound} Uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle {disfmarker} it gets brittle after a while ,
so um we still had titanium and and wood available ,
but um unfortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh ,
the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium ,
nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood .
So then there's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board ,
{disfmarker} uh these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much um intelligence with this simple one .
And um then there was the regular which {vocalsound}
I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one .
Uh the other option was this advanced chip on print ,
we found that it it includes this infrared sender ,
which w 'member the beam was {disfmarker} that was an important component of finding the right chip .
And uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print ,
now jumping right to our personal preferences
um I I'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um ,
you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods .
I think that people will might really want to design their own cases ,
and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know ,
and then I uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip .
and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood .
question , uh , what's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ?
I think it's um um a multiple uh chip design um {vocalsound}
and it's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board .
but I'll find out more at our next meeting .
Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ?
Because um it gets brittle , cracks {disfmarker}
we expect these um {vocalsound} uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years .
I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems ,
I mean it chips , it if you drop it ,
So {gap} so you're not convinced about the the wood , yes .
I think {vocalsound} if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work ,
the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood ,
Well , it's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood .
One thing we'd have to check though is what the users {disfmarker} whether {disfmarker} how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh {vocalsound}
you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your {disfmarker}
have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that ,
So , it's a very short presentation ,
'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board
I took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape ,
which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls .
And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size ,
so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control .
{vocalsound} So , that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability .
Um , one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones ,
so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it ,
especially if you have little kids around , they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a T_V_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off .
And also {vocalsound} um you had issues with the batteries running out ,
so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is {disfmarker} starts to die .
And in terms of invisible features , audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition .
You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big ,
sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons .
And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume ,
so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right .
And then here you'd have your sort of standard , telephonish number pad .
and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control .
Um , so again you can have a little L_C_D_ light somewhere , the flip {vocalsound} thing and {disfmarker}
So , as you can see , it's a very very simple design ,
which is one of the things I really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it .
although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different .
Be like a copper hinge or you know .
But you also have to d start watching out for the weight ,
'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don't want it to start getting too heavy .
As you can see , there's still lots of space on the actual remote control
and if you do it customisably , {vocalsound} you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences .
Um the centering of the key pad and {vocalsound} the channel is just depending on where your thumb is
and you tend to use the the volume control and uh the browsing more than the actual number pad ,
so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control ,
the number pad a little bit lower 'cause it's used less frequently .
So once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning ,
I also have a f {vocalsound} very simple presentation ,
because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want .
{vocalsound} I also have uh copied a different type of remote .
{vocalsound} We've been giving simple {vocalsound} questionnaires in different areas
because th {gap} obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today ,
'cause uh trends change very very quickly .
fancy and feel-good , that's what we've been looking for ,
something that feels good in the hand , that's easy to use .
Looking for next generation of innovation ,
Easy to use , has always has become {disfmarker} has become another major interest that uh ,
And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology .
The second two , you can see the last one is a very easy simple design . {vocalsound}
The second one , there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , uh very hard to use .
The first one , I see {vocalsound} that they put in a display .
Now there's something else uh with the little flip-up , now we're adding all kinds of things in ,
but with the little flip-up , if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked .
Maybe the display also makes it easier to use ,
Context-sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ or something else is in .
Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and
So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use , trendy , fancy , feels good , {vocalsound} uh with a display , wood , designer wood , designer colours
You know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um {vocalsound} a uh {vocalsound} uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball ,
and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand .
But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if {disfmarker} unless everyone has their own personal remote .
Well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick .
it was uh Nokia that came out with this changeable colours .
Right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face
and then they sold millions , millions .
We'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes ,
we might wanna um learn about um {vocalsound} labour laws .
You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap ,
but you don't wanna exploit uh labour in um third world countries .
So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device .
Yeah , but we can get a production in , uh {vocalsound} , countries like , uh , India
We're here to design , come up with a nice product . {vocalsound}
but uh that that we can that we can talk about the production later , okay , depends on the the quantity , okay .
So we don't need to have our own uh fabric factory or something ,
but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay ,
And your design {vocalsound} whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so
I mean I think it's a good idea ,
but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be
because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display {vocalsound} right in front of you .
So , if we're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go .
I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for {disfmarker}
do you know how much it costs , um , to to add a little display like this uh ?
Do you wanna take an action item to go find out ?
Once we get a price on it then we can market it .
So the {vocalsound} the advanced chip on print is what um what we've {vocalsound} we've deci we've determined
and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation ,
and um I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case .
A customisable and {disfmarker}
What about the buttons , would {disfmarker} Would the buttons be wood too , or {disfmarker}
I think they could be rubber like they are now ,
what we'll do is , uh , we will stick with the the simple design for time being
until uh th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra , in case we go for the display .
maybe what you can do is uh , both of you , you can come up with the the prototype , okay , the model .
Then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it's cost as extra for uh the display .
An and the marketing strategy , that's very important , okay .
So , by next meeting , so , please come up with the the prototype , okay ,
then uh , then we can proceed from there .
