TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	750.0	757.39	C	ID	inf	+1	1	have the uncurved or flat case uh that's the most common uh remote can control form uh we used to 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	757.39	760.77	C	ID	inf	-1	0	uh we used to it's just uh it's it is just a box i'm sorry 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	760.77	761.16	C	ID	inf	-1	0	a box i'm sorry i i don't have any pictures

TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	763.347	765.56	C	ID	inf	+1	1	We have a uh a curved one it's 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	765.56	767.27	C	ID	inf	-1	0	it's uh curved in two dimensions you have to imagine 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	767.27	770.6	C	ID	inf	-1	0	you have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form so it's 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	770.6	774.71	C	ID	inf	-1	0	so it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape and

TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	774.71	777.22	C	ID	inf	+1	0	and we have an even more advanced a shape which is curved

TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	908.7	909.47	B	UI	stl	-1	0	walk and uh it but uh you use 
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	909.47	910.89	B	UI	inf	-1	0	it but uh you use it on the couch 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	909.28	916.24	C	ID	inf	-1	0	but you know you know from your own watch you watch use is uh a minimal call it consumes a minimal amount of energy then the the shaking of

TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	923.87	929.54	C	ID	inf	+1	1	its but uh the problem here is that it's it's supplies at the very little amount of kinetic energy so 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	929.54	941.99	C	ID	inf	-1	0	so i think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't move the remote uh a remote control in the in an amount of time Any wanted to switch the channel or something well

TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.128	943.76	946.15	C	ID	sug	-1	0	work so that's something you have to keep in mind 
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.119	946.48	946.91	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.129	948.08	948.3	C	ID	stl	-1	0	So but maybe

TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.131	953.67	955.65	C	ID	inf	-1	0	so we can save on the batteries and 
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	956.08	956.33	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.132	955.65	960.04	C	ID	sug	-1	0	and uh um mine doesn't have kind of kinetic energy used kinetic energy and all the wise use the

TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.147	1174.99	1176.88	A	PM	inf	-1	0	because you grip grab it like this

TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	1187.05	1187.19	B	UI	stl	-1	0	Yeah believe it if you 
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	1187.19	1202.11	B	UI	inf	-1	0	Yeah believe it if you have uh what we've already said um the grip a places in in the remote control you have your hand on one place on a remote control so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb So in that case of 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.195	1200.13	1202.15	C	ID	ass	-1	0	But when reach yes you have to Yeah 
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	1202.11	1206.13	B	UI	ass	+1	0	So in that case of the volume button on the sides a of remote control would be perfect

TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.200	1209.5	1217.46	C	ID	inf	-1	0	Okay um we have to note if you want to use uh these rubber double curved get a case um you must use used by should have pushbuttons there's no way 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.201	1217.46	1219.82	C	ID	inf	-1	0	there's no way you can integrate l. c. d. displays there's no 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.202	1219.82	1221.66	C	ID	inf	-1	0	c. d. displays there's no way you can integrated scroll wheels because 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.203	1221.66	1222.92	C	ID	inf	-1	0	scroll wheels because it's all curved there's 
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.154	1223.13	1223.42	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.204	1222.92	1227.78	C	ID	inf	-1	0	it's all curved there's there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things so 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.205	1227.78	1230.58	C	ID	inf	-1	0	these things so that's a limitation 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.206	1230.661	1236.25	C	ID	off	-1	0	About um the components and just the hardware we basically have 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.207	1236.25	1239.69	C	ID	inf	-1	0	we basically have uh three types of chips we can use and 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.208	1239.69	1249.02	C	ID	inf	-1	0	use and uh these chips incorporate all the logic uh and uh um hum uh hardware does need to send it to send signal uh we have a simple regular 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.209	1249.02	1252.03	C	ID	inf	+1	0	uh we have a simple regular an advanced chip and there is something 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.210	1252.03	1255.89	C	ID	inf	+1	1	and there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker which 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.211	1255.89	1257.96	C	ID	inf	-1	0	which is a little cryptic uh to me but 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.212	1257.96	1262.29	C	ID	inf	-1	0	to me but i think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about 
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	1261.598	1262.3	B	UI	stl	-1	0	Yeah yeah you can uh um 
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	1262.3	1262.63	B	UI	fra	-1	0	yeah you can uh um 
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	1262.63	1265.36	B	UI	inf	-1	0	yeah you can uh um i have some information about it uh in the voice 
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	1265.36	1274.57	B	UI	inf	+1	0	uh in the voice recognition you say i were you can program words like uh uh volume up Of newt that's a mute um

TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	1271.74	1272.59	C	ID	bck	-1	0	Okay so that you 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	1272.59	1274.19	C	ID	stl	-1	0	so that you said okay 
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	1274.57	1285.14	B	UI	inf	-1	0	um you program it you musically you give um and uh And action to it's that's that's really the mute function and uh 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	1274.19	1274.51	C	ID	bck	-1	0	okay

TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	1285.14	1292.84	B	UI	inf	+1	0	and uh when you speak in the uh remote control it's repeats uh uh you're saying so 
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	1293.03	1295.08	B	UI	inf	-1	0	that's the sample sensor so if you say mute 
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	1292.84	1293.03	B	UI	bck	-1	0	saying so that's the sample sensor 
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	1295.08	1297.71	B	UI	inf	-1	0	so if you say mute it's a nude again and then

TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	1297.71	1301.913	B	UI	inf	-1	0	and then it uh um What i believe it is 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	1297.48	1297.71	C	ID	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.156	1301.25	1303.1	A	PM	inf	+1	0	It performs the action yeah 
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.157	1303.1	1303.32	A	PM	bck	-1	0	yeah 
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	1302.71	1303.05	B	UI	ass	-1	0	Yeah and then uh you you 
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	1303.05	1307.18	B	UI	inf	-1	0	and then uh you you you piece of this action with which you believe it is you use a mute 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	1303.97	1304.42	C	ID	bck	-1	0	Okay 
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.158	1307.4	1307.61	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	1307.18	1308.2	B	UI	inf	-1	0	you use a mute you repeat can use 
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	1308.2	1309.44	B	UI	inf	-1	0	you repeat can use any it 
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	1309.44	1312.2	B	UI	inf	-1	0	any it makes a computer sound mute and then goes 
TS3011c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	1312.2	1314.0	B	UI	inf	-1	0	and then goes to the mute function 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	1313.095	1314.39	C	ID	und	-1	0	Oh okay okay so that's basically 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	1314.39	1318.14	C	ID	inf	-1	0	okay so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for okay this sample 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	1318.14	1318.69	C	ID	stl	-1	0	okay this sample 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	1318.69	1324.39	C	ID	inf	-1	0	okay this sample sensor uh requires and regular chip i fault Um 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	1324.39	1328.5	C	ID	ass	-1	0	Um mm no well and that's for sure that's right 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	1328.5	1330.08	C	ID	inf	-1	0	sure that's right here if we want to use the 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	1330.08	1333.48	C	ID	inf	-1	0	if we want to use the l. c. d. display really need the advanced version which is a bill

TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	1380.28	1386.64	C	ID	inf	-1	0	well my conclusion um unfortunately the market is decide as a little older than i thought i thought 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	1386.64	1393.04	C	ID	inf	+1	0	i thought um the market would like uh uh something sort of titanium casing but they 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.243	1393.04	1395.9	C	ID	inf	+1	0	but they seem to like natural uh stuff so 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.244	1395.9	1399.99	C	ID	sug	-1	0	uh stuff so maybe we should think about uh would finish um 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.245	1399.99	1406.52	C	ID	sug	+1	0	um i've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy it's more 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.246	1406.52	1407.93	C	ID	inf	-1	0	it's more reliable it's 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.247	1407.93	1409.14	C	ID	inf	-1	0	reliable it's cheaper so i don't 
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.167	1409.03	1410.21	A	PM	ass	-1	0	Okay yeah 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.248	1409.14	1413.2	C	ID	sug	-1	0	so i don't think we should use to dynamo thing or the kinetic thing it 
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.168	1412.0	1412.99	A	PM	fra	-1	0	okay 
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.169	1412.99	1413.39	A	PM	bck	-1	0	okay 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.249	1413.2	1416.03	C	ID	inf	+1	0	the kinetic thing it it it is it's possibility is is more sense 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.250	1416.03	1417.04	C	ID	inf	-1	0	is is more sense but i and 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.251	1417.04	1420.9	C	ID	sug	+1	0	but i and i think you should combines with batteries otherwise 
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.170	1420.61	1420.9	A	PM	stl	-1	0	Okay it's 
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.171	1420.9	1423.17	A	PM	ass	+1	0	Okay it's maybe a bit too too flashy to

TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.254	1425.15	1429.32	C	ID	inf	-1	0	It's in in in some way it can give is in that sense because you 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.255	1429.32	1432.25	C	ID	inf	-1	0	because you will save all your batteries But 
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.174	1432.3	1432.5	A	PM	stl	-1	0	Yeah but that that's 
TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.175	1432.5	1435.5	A	PM	inf	-1	0	Yeah but that that's the same with a solar cell that's anything

TS3011c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.179	1447.83	1449.97	A	PM	inf	-1	0	No no but they uh and that was an l. c. s. i. d.s 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.260	1448.64	1452.026	C	ID	inf	-1	0	That that a new thing yeah We have to skip that

TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.398	2165.69	2169.04	C	ID	inf	-1	0	what you want because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel and that's what you get with rubber 
TS3011c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.399	2169.04	2170.87	C	ID	inf	-1	0	that's what you get with rubber so
