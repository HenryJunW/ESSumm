ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	40.24	44.39	B	PM	inf	+1	0	and I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	44.39	50.55	B	PM	off	+1	0	Um so I guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	50.55	56.74	B	PM	inf	+1	0	Um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	56.74	64.14	B	PM	inf	+1	0	and started to discuss um a bit about the project , you know , cost-wise how much how much money we had to s
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	100.92	104.29	B	PM	inf	+1	1	Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements ,
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	104.74	114.79	B	PM	inf	+1	2	which is the {disfmarker} The first one {vocalsound} is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	114.79	116.98	B	PM	inf	-1	0	Nobody uses teletext very much anymore ,
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	116.98	121.94	B	PM	inf	+1	2	so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the {disfmarker} of the remote control .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.5	116.75	116.99	D	ME	bck	-1	0	'Kay .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	121.94	130.69	B	PM	inf	+1	2	Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ or anything else .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	130.69	141.68	B	PM	inf	+1	1	I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	141.68	145.41	B	PM	inf	+1	2	So um , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.6	141.27	141.59	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Okay .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	145.41	150.49	B	PM	inf	+1	2	And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	151.21	154.97	B	PM	inf	+1	1	Um I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	154.97	158.12	B	PM	inf	+1	1	It might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.7	157.94	163.02	D	ME	el.inf	+1	1	And the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ?
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	163.17	165.72	B	PM	inf	-1	0	Well that's the thing , I'm I'm not sure um
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	166.499	171.482	B	PM	el.inf	+1	1	{vocalsound} uh th because on the the company website , uh what does it say {disfmarker}
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	172.42	173.002	B	PM	stl	-1	0	Uh something {disfmarker}
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.8	172.4	174.07	D	ME	inf	+1	1	'Bout putting the fashion in electronics .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.1	174.28	174.47	A	ID	bck	-1	0	Mm yeah .

ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	177.83	179.3	B	PM	inf	+1	1	'cause it's quite long .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	180.07	182.3	B	PM	inf	-1	0	Um or yeah , just the idea , but I'm not sure .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	182.3	183.96	B	PM	sug	-1	0	So that's something we can discuss as well .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	183.96	185.24	B	PM	inf	+1	1	So those are the three things ,
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	185.24	196.19	B	PM	inf	+1	1	just not to worry about teletext , uh only control the T_V_ , and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	196.19	200.69	B	PM	el.ass	-1	0	Um so is everybody okay with any of that
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	200.69	204.57	B	PM	el.sug	-1	0	, or do you want me to recap at all ?

ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.4	258.385	260.05	C	UI	inf	+1	1	{gap} so this is the technical functions design .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.5	261.67	262.417	C	UI	stl	-1	0	Um {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.7	265.53	265.88	C	UI	stl	-1	0	Right {gap}
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.8	265.88	271.15	C	UI	inf	+1	1	to do the um {vocalsound} the design I have I've had a look online , I've had a look at the homepage ,
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.9	271.15	275.05	C	UI	inf	-1	0	which has given us um some insp inspiration from previous products .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	274.45	274.85	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.10	275.05	278.32	C	UI	inf	+1	1	Um I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.11	278.32	284.6	C	UI	el.sug	-1	0	and um I would like to ask you guys for um {vocalsound} your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.12	284.6	287.896	C	UI	ass	-1	0	Um unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room , so {disfmarker}
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	287.456	288.19	B	PM	bck	-1	0	{vocalsound} Okay .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.11	287.65	288.0	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Right .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.13	289.13	295.73	C	UI	inf	+1	1	Um , having a look at the existing products , I found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes ,
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.14	295.73	301.71	C	UI	inf	+1	1	there's either um a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you don't know what you're doing .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.15	301.71	304.71	C	UI	inf	+1	1	{vocalsound} Um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.16	304.71	306.74	C	UI	off	-1	0	Um there's an example I'll show you at the end ,
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	306.74	308.63	C	UI	off	-1	0	um {gap} sh show you now .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	308.91	312.516	C	UI	stl	-1	0	Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	315.117	316.29	B	PM	bck	-1	0	{vocalsound} Alright {gap} .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	314.728	318.74	C	UI	inf	+1	1	{gap} here um the button there and there .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	318.74	319.88	C	UI	inf	-1	0	This one's prog .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	319.88	320.13	C	UI	be.pos	-1	0	Sorry .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	320.13	322.03	C	UI	inf	+1	1	That one's perg and that one's prog ,
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	322.03	323.43	C	UI	inf	+1	1	and it doesn't really tell you what it does .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	334.36	338.76	C	UI	inf	+1	1	Um , not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	338.76	340.2	C	UI	inf	+1	1	Um it's a very simple one .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	340.2	341.91	C	UI	inf	+1	1	It's got only the basic functions mm
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	341.91	347.9	C	UI	inf	+1	1	but um {vocalsound} it's the same size as the the hard to use one .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	345.86	346.37	B	PM	oth	-1	0	Oop .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	347.9	349.57	C	UI	inf	+1	1	{vocalsound} Uh it looked a bit clunky .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	349.57	353.69	C	UI	inf	+1	1	They're very big and not very much use for {gap} buttons .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	353.69	354.98	C	UI	stl	-1	0	{vocalsound} Um , {vocalsound}
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	354.98	357.33	C	UI	inf	+1	1	and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	357.33	359.37	C	UI	inf	-1	0	There's there's nothing for instance for a slow motion button .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	362.3	365.93	C	UI	ass	+1	1	Um , my own preferences , I prefer the the clunky one .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	365.93	367.39	C	UI	inf	-1	0	Um it's very easy to use .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	367.39	370.73	C	UI	inf	-1	0	Um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	370.73	373.85	C	UI	ass	-1	0	which I I quite like having on the controls .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	373.85	377.24	C	UI	sug	+1	3	{vocalsound} Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer ,
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	377.24	378.99	C	UI	sug	-1	0	or something like tha {gap} from the bottom of it .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	381.54	384.29	C	UI	el.sug	+1	1	So , {vocalsound} now I'd like to ask for your preferences .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	384.29	387.057	C	UI	inf	-1	0	Um not sure of how long we've got , uh {disfmarker}
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	386.73	388.63	B	PM	stl	-1	0	Um .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	388.63	392.43	B	PM	inf	-1	0	Well we can chat away for uh for five minutes or so I think at at most .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.12	391.86	392.42	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	392.43	393.56	B	PM	inf	-1	0	Just a couple of minutes anyway .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.13	394.06	403.08	D	ME	inf	-1	0	M yeah , like a lot of a lot of what I've um read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what Craig's just gone over .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.14	403.08	405.63	D	ME	off	-1	0	So in part I could I could give you some of my personal preferences
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.15	405.63	411.48	D	ME	off	-1	0	but I could also th add some to this which is just about sort of um sort of market research .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	411.0	412.66	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.17	411.48	412.58	D	ME	stl	-1	0	But anyway ,
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	412.66	413.06	B	PM	stl	-1	0	Shall we sh
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	413.06	415.11	B	PM	sug	-1	0	well we'll stick to kind of your area for now .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.18	412.58	414.07	D	ME	sug	-1	0	um we might come to that later .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.3	413.84	416.19	A	ID	el.inf	+1	1	Which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	414.635	416.8	C	UI	inf	+1	1	{vocalsound} Um , the clunky one is the one on the right .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.4	417.13	417.39	A	ID	ass	-1	0	Okay .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	417.54	417.94	B	PM	ass	-1	0	Yeah .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.19	417.62	419.02	D	ME	el.inf	-1	0	Um clunky in what sense ,
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.20	419.02	421.85	D	ME	el.inf	-1	0	like um h heavier ? Larger ?
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	420.99	425.23	C	UI	inf	+1	1	Um I think it's supposed to be the same size , but um it's got much fewer buttons .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	425.23	427.29	C	UI	inf	-1	0	It's , you know , it's very spread out
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.21	425.98	428.97	D	ME	ass	-1	0	I see , so it's more just basic .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	427.24	428.56	B	PM	ass	-1	0	Looks kind of {disfmarker} Yeah .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	427.29	429.65	C	UI	fra	-1	0	and kind of {disfmarker} you know
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.22	428.97	429.59	D	ME	ass	-1	0	Right , okay .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	429.65	431.82	C	UI	inf	-1	0	, I get the idea it'd be sort of about this size .
ES2002b.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	431.82	433.212	C	UI	inf	-1	0	{vocalsound} {gap} got very few buttons on it and {disfmarker}
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.23	431.45	431.71	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Yeah .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.5	432.36	432.799	A	ID	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.24	432.71	433.74	D	ME	ass	-1	0	Yeah . Sure .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	434.06	435.58	B	PM	ass	+1	1	Well I think it's a valid point .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	435.58	439.72	B	PM	inf	+1	1	I mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated ,
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	439.72	444.05	B	PM	inf	-1	0	and that P_R_T_ p P_R_O_T_ thing is incredibly confusing .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.57	444.05	449.15	B	PM	ass	+1	1	Um so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design ,
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.58	449.15	451.89	B	PM	ass	-1	0	but yeah you don't want to lose out on , you know , what it does ,
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.61	451.89	453.01	B	PM	stl	-1	0	so maybe you know
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.25	451.79	452.21	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.62	453.01	455.8	B	PM	inf	+1	1	you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open ,
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.6	454.92	455.475	A	ID	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.63	455.8	457.41	B	PM	ass	-1	0	I think that's a good idea .

ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	818.35	820.34	D	ME	el.und	-1	0	So um does that make sense ?
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	820.34	823.35	D	ME	inf	+1	1	So what I basically got is I just looked into some information
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	823.35	826.22	D	ME	inf	+1	1	and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it

ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	826.77	828.97	D	ME	inf	+1	1	and what kind of decisions we could take away from it
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	828.97	834.1	D	ME	sug	-1	0	and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	834.1	836.7	D	ME	inf	-1	0	'Cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	836.7	841.36	D	ME	inf	+1	1	So um I'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs ,
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	841.36	842.59	D	ME	sug	-1	0	that we start with the customer ,
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	842.59	844.48	D	ME	sug	-1	0	and w you know , what they want

ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	855.44	860.13	D	ME	sug	-1	0	Um and then , as I say uh w we'd like to prioritise our design features from this

ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	872.59	877.37	D	ME	inf	+1	1	Um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	877.37	878.77	D	ME	inf	-1	0	So they find them ugly .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	878.77	880.54	D	ME	inf	+1	1	Most people find them ugly .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	880.54	885.56	D	ME	inf	+1	1	Um {vocalsound} the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well ,
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.128	885.56	893.06	D	ME	inf	+1	1	we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition .

ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.130	893.85	895.47	D	ME	sug	-1	0	we'll look at that in a second .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	895.47	900.87	D	ME	inf	+1	1	Um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	900.87	905.0	D	ME	inf	-1	0	So I guess what we're looking at here is people want this h technology ,
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	905.0	907.35	D	ME	inf	+1	1	they tend to use the most simple controls
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	907.35	912.04	D	ME	inf	-1	0	and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't {disfmarker} doesn't really appeal to them .

ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	912.57	914.53	D	ME	stl	-1	0	So I think what we're doing is we're trying to take like {disfmarker}
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.137	914.53	919.89	D	ME	inf	+1	1	if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations , you know ,

ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	924.09	931.96	D	ME	inf	+1	2	And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	931.96	933.9	D	ME	stl	-1	0	Um , {vocalsound}

ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	941.55	946.66	D	ME	inf	-1	0	This is uh why I mention when Craig was uh showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls ,
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	946.66	948.73	D	ME	inf	-1	0	so d it doesn't just look like a big panel ,
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.147	948.73	951.69	D	ME	inf	-1	0	kinda like when you you look at , you know , a new computer keyboard ,

ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	970.98	977.17	D	ME	inf	-1	0	Um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	977.17	979.98	D	ME	stl	-1	0	I also found that most people would
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	979.98	982.54	D	ME	inf	+1	1	uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition .

ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.158	988.26	991.34	D	ME	sug	+1	2	if that's possible we might consider getting into it .

ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.160	993.261	1000.91	D	ME	inf	-1	0	{vocalsound} And and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this ,
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.161	1000.91	1007.4	D	ME	inf	+1	1	I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be {disfmarker} wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy .

ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.163	1012.94	1021.44	D	ME	sug	-1	0	so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can um put that into a unit which is which people like .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.127	1021.65	1023.45	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay .

ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167	1028.43	1041.82	D	ME	sug	-1	0	so you know just c looking at what what Craig um Craig's i uh ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and um separate the different things that we wanna include in this .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.168	1041.82	1048.75	D	ME	sug	-1	0	So if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology .

ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.170	1055.93	1061.61	D	ME	inf	-1	0	but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through .

ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	1425.79	1428.71	A	ID	inf	-1	0	Well this is just what {disfmarker} how I would go about it .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	1428.71	1432.4	A	ID	inf	+1	1	Um I guess I try to define like what we're doing now ,
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	1432.4	1434.16	A	ID	inf	-1	0	try to define what we're trying to get done .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	1434.16	1437.18	A	ID	inf	-1	0	Um I think in a practical way , we kind of know what it is .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.252	1434.23	1434.62	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Right .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	1437.18	1437.81	A	ID	inf	-1	0	We've used it ,
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	1437.81	1438.66	A	ID	inf	-1	0	we're familiar with it ,
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	1438.66	1444.98	A	ID	inf	+1	1	but we're {disfmarker} we can't n we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like {disfmarker}
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.85	1444.98	1445.87	A	ID	inf	-1	0	Besides the basics ,
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	1445.87	1449.16	A	ID	inf	+1	1	I think back {disfmarker} in the back of our minds we know what the basics are .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.87	1449.16	1450.75	A	ID	inf	+1	1	Has to change channels , has to change volume ,
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.88	1450.75	1455.56	A	ID	inf	+1	1	but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.89	1455.56	1459.9	A	ID	inf	-1	0	Um are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ?

ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.90	1459.9	1460.81	A	ID	stl	-1	0	Um and I just {disfmarker}
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.91	1460.81	1464.33	A	ID	fra	-1	0	the idea is just to get everybody to um {disfmarker}
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.92	1464.33	1468.9	A	ID	inf	-1	0	I usually {vocalsound} have a have have a design that's there as a basic ,
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.93	1468.9	1472.54	A	ID	inf	-1	0	so , you know , things that {disfmarker} to start everything going .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.94	1472.54	1474.23	A	ID	inf	-1	0	But I guess everybody does have some idea ,
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.95	1474.23	1476.09	A	ID	ass	-1	0	so I don't think um there's a need for that .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.96	1477.09	1481.56	A	ID	inf	-1	0	Um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing ,
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.97	1481.56	1483.34	A	ID	off	+1	1	so I'll go into the diagram first .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.98	1483.34	1485.74	A	ID	inf	+1	1	It just explains how the process goes through ,

ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.100	1486.45	1488.0	A	ID	inf	+1	1	from the basic technology point of view ,
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.101	1488.0	1489.52	A	ID	inf	+1	1	the basic steps that you need
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.102	1489.52	1492.49	A	ID	ass	-1	0	um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	1492.49	1493.76	A	ID	stl	-1	0	Um okay ,
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	1493.76	1495.88	A	ID	inf	+1	1	you need some power source .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.105	1495.88	1498.27	A	ID	inf	+1	1	'Kay , a battery or something , to keep it going .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.219	1496.79	1497.26	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.106	1498.27	1500.27	A	ID	inf	+1	1	Um and that power source is important
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.107	1500.27	1505.13	A	ID	inf	+1	1	because it ties you down to um how long the device will last .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.108	1505.13	1509.0	A	ID	inf	-1	0	Um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.220	1504.72	1505.07	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.109	1509.0	1511.52	A	ID	inf	-1	0	um how far you can transmit the signal
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.110	1511.52	1514.55	A	ID	inf	-1	0	or the complexity of the functions that you want .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.254	1513.32	1513.82	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.111	1514.55	1516.58	A	ID	inf	+1	1	Like for example , voice recognition , right .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.112	1516.58	1519.56	A	ID	inf	+1	1	That might be constrained because that {disfmarker} you might need to power a microphone ,
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.113	1519.56	1521.15	A	ID	inf	-1	0	you might need to power other things ,
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.114	1521.15	1523.71	A	ID	inf	+1	1	so that's one perhaps constraint there .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.115	1523.71	1524.26	A	ID	stl	-1	0	Um
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.116	1525.03	1528.68	A	ID	inf	+1	1	{vocalsound} Th Okay , the basic thing is there's a user interface
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.117	1528.68	1535.1	A	ID	inf	-1	0	where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.221	1534.28	1534.44	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Hmm .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.118	1535.1	1538.85	A	ID	inf	+1	1	You know , and that um picks up an input from a user ,
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.119	1538.85	1541.31	A	ID	stl	-1	0	um uh a logic {disfmarker}
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.120	1541.31	1544.87	A	ID	inf	+1	1	a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device ,
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.121	1544.87	1550.01	A	ID	inf	-1	0	and the device has to r you know , based on you push button A_ , so I will do something with button A_ .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.122	1550.01	1552.64	A	ID	inf	-1	0	So maybe button A_ is the power button , okay .
ES2002b.D.dialog-act.dharshi.255	1550.55	1551.15	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.222	1551.87	1552.17	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.123	1552.64	1556.22	A	ID	inf	+1	1	Um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.124	1556.22	1557.86	A	ID	inf	-1	0	which is the receiver here .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.125	1557.86	1562.87	A	ID	inf	-1	0	Um and I think that's about it in terms of my design um .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.126	1562.87	1564.38	A	ID	inf	-1	0	It's fairly general ,

ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.128	1569.04	1571.76	A	ID	inf	+1	1	like um voice recognition , right ,
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.129	1571.76	1573.05	A	ID	stl	-1	0	um ,
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.130	1573.05	1576.31	A	ID	sug	+1	1	if it's something which is important then we just add more power

ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.159	1651.27	1656.9	A	ID	inf	+1	1	but I think the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , um and the receiver , okay ,

ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.162	1665.48	1674.25	A	ID	inf	+1	1	Um there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the T_V_ for example .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.241	1665.34	1665.77	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay .

ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.164	1680.47	1684.67	A	ID	inf	+1	1	Because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to . Right .

ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.245	1684.95	1693.62	B	PM	inf	+1	1	Well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market ,
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.246	1693.62	1700.59	B	PM	sug	+1	1	so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.247	1700.59	1703.96	B	PM	sug	-1	0	and not worry so much about uh how we transmit it

ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.248	1703.96	1706.57	B	PM	inf	+1	2	um because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red ,
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.249	1706.57	1708.05	B	PM	sug	+1	2	so we could stay with tha
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.166	1707.23	1709.62	A	ID	inf	-1	0	There might be one other problem with the transmission ,
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.167	1709.62	1713.13	A	ID	inf	-1	0	um in particular right now , since we're talking about voice recognition .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	1713.13	1718.07	A	ID	inf	+1	1	Um if somebody's gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.250	1715.9	1716.18	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm

ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.171	1719.78	1721.58	A	ID	stl	-1	0	but you know , um it's it's

ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	1721.58	1725.91	A	ID	inf	-1	0	it's something very natural , I guess , you know , to hold it , to signal to the user ,
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.252	1723.07	1725.437	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Yeah , mm-hmm . {vocalsound}
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.173	1725.91	1728.38	A	ID	inf	-1	0	and push a button maybe to start s talking about it .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.253	1727.69	1728.17	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.174	1728.38	1729.72	A	ID	inf	-1	0	Then you need to send the signal out ,
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.175	1729.72	1738.57	A	ID	inf	+1	1	so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight um say the T_V_'s at that chair , and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it .
ES2002b.B.dialog-act.dharshi.254	1729.8	1730.21	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Mm .

ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.176	1738.57	1741.19	A	ID	inf	-1	0	So in that sense , there's not really a restriction

ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.180	1763.05	1768.95	A	ID	inf	-1	0	but I think that um one indication of infra-red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices .
ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.181	1768.95	1770.64	A	ID	inf	-1	0	Because infra-red is something which everybody has .

ES2002b.A.dialog-act.dharshi.207	1939.69	1946.12	A	ID	inf	-1	0	but I think from a point of view of a person using the device , you know a T_V_ is something they see and something they hear ,
