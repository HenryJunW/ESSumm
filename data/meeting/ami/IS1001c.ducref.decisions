The group decided on the features that will be incorporated into the design of the prototype.
The remote will be shaped and colored like a banana , and be covered in a spongy material.
The buttons will be lighted.
The group decided to keep the wheel sensor despite the added cost.
It will be placed at the top of the banana shape.
The group decided to simply use a standard chip that will not accomodate speech recognition , as this feature will be eliminated from the functional design.
The remote will use standard batteries.
