There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only , they should ignore the teletext function , as it is dated , and , also , the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product.
The target group will be people below 40.
The UI preferred an easy-to-use remote to a multi-function one.
The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip , and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared.
The use of infrared , energy-efficient power source and cheap circuit was suggested.
The remote could light up via LED's placed inside.
Functions like zapping are very prevalent , as well as complaints about remotes being easy to lose.
It also transpires that customers like innovative technology like speech recognition.
The design can focus on such customer needs , like finding a mechanism to locate a lost remote.
The functions of the remote will include a back button to switch between two channels , volume , program selection , and speech recognition , with a focus on simplicity of design.
