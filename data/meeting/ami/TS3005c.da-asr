TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	383.76	392.03	C	ID	inf	-1	0	uh rubber uh uh the total uh piece of rubber that's or a that's that's used uh to make the case is uh the same colour so if you scratch it 
TS3005c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	392.03	394.27	C	ID	inf	-1	0	so if you scratch it it's still the same colour perhaps uh it's
