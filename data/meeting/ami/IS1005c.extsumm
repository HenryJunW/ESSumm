Um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept
and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be ,
we will have again three presentation , from all of you ,
and uh I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions .
Okay . Um so basically I just want to presented to you {disfmarker} present to you some recent results we've had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world . Um
so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel , um as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority .
Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative .
Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well ,
{vocalsound} From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan , um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture .
And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy .
I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature .
Okay . So I am going to talk about {disfmarker} a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use .
Um {vocalsound} generally , generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something , in my opinion , uh the first feature is just to be easy to use .
So , the more frequent buttons should be larger ,
they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control .
And uh s uh I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it .
Uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can {disfmarker} which should be taken easily in hand .
And uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not uh consume lots of energy .
so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels ,
Uh . And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier .
And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good .
but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy .
that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers
seven seven inch T_ {disfmarker} T_F_T_ screen ,
which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there .
So there will be some circuit uh for the power .
Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries
And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy ,
which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything .
Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres ,
And on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone , which is somewhere ,
Can you fit any uh for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ?
A all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically .
Well , sponginess . Maybe it a good feature , since it takes {disfmarker} if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe ,
Well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside .
Maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around .
how big is it in reality ?
Uh uh have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen ?
Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal .
But I I think we can we can cut it .
So so for the same price we have four screens now {vocalsound} .
Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something .
Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still {disfmarker}
Yeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know .
I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something .
so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions .
Uh first I think energy it's a key problem
If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_ uh speech recognition and L_C_D_ ,
so no problem in energy , I think .
So if we use s solar cells , um where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside ?
I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large .
Could you re could you redesign your board ?
I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_ , if it's possible .
Okay , so five to ten , I I think it's it's feasible .
So using some L_C_D_s we can touch , so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh , I dunno the name , L_C_D_ responding to fingers .
So let's go for a small L_C_D_ .
My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the {disfmarker} it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and {disfmarker}
Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company .
I dunno if it can fit with the technology .
The screen has to be {vocalsound} square ?
But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so .
It's like more more expensive to have shape like that .
I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen .
So we are agree with the banana thing ?
So , {gap} the last point we decided it's infra-red , I guess .
Yeah , peeling of the banana .
should should discover the other buttons , which are hidden .
Is it is it possible to do that ?
I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that ,
If you see it's like peeling . You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor .
it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic uh {vocalsound} materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely .
And what would be the matter here of the first layer I mean ?
Mm . Likes . Soft plastic , or {disfmarker}
So we add also the speech recognition device .
Um , so uh the the Industrial Manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design .
The User Interface uh uh Mana uh Manager will work on the user interface device .
And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation .
uh I think you should work together , s you uh Hamed and Peter , to work uh in a in a first prototype ,
