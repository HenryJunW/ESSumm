ES2002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.356	1825.89	1838.43	C	ME	ass	+1	1	I mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork
ES2002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.357	1838.43	1846.89	C	ME	inf	+1	1	because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation

ES2002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.361	1852.43	1865.81	C	ME	inf	-1	0	but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay , first thing we have to do is come up with um let's say um a design concept ,
ES2002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.362	1865.81	1867.91	C	ME	inf	-1	0	and we sit here together and do it ,

ES2002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.363	1867.91	1869.41	C	ME	ass	-1	0	well that's what teamwork is .
ES2002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.364	1869.41	1877.62	C	ME	ass	-1	0	To s to say okay go off and don't talk to each other , it's actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork .
ES2002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.374	1871.9	1872.41	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Yeah .
ES2002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.375	1877.46	1878.17	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay .
ES2002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.365	1877.62	1880.72	C	ME	ass	-1	0	Um not that we haven't done I think the best we could have done .

ES2002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.380	1888.11	1896.27	B	PM	el.ass	-1	0	um what about the you know how we used the whiteboard , the digital pens , the projector , stuff like that ?
ES2002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.381	1896.27	1898.58	B	PM	el.ass	-1	0	Um did anybody think anything was like really useful ,
ES2002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.367	1896.57	1896.97	C	ME	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
ES2002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.382	1898.58	1900.61	B	PM	el.ass	-1	0	anything was pretty un f

ES2002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.368	1902.41	1906.33	C	ME	inf	+1	1	I think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing I would use all the time ,
ES2002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.369	1906.33	1911.15	C	ME	ass	-1	0	but it's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been ,
ES2002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.370	1911.15	1924.09	C	ME	sug	+1	1	maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text .
ES2002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.385	1920.91	1921.58	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Mm .
ES2002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.371	1924.59	1928.54	C	ME	sug	-1	0	Um , and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that .
ES2002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.372	1928.54	1934.57	C	ME	inf	+1	1	I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype
ES2002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.374	1934.57	1944.23	C	ME	inf	+1	1	and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss
ES2002d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.386	1938.55	1938.9	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .

ES2002d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.383	1971.22	1971.94	C	ME	ass	-1	0	Think could be , yeah .
ES2002d.A.dialog-act.dharshi.234	1972.11	1977.25	A	ID	inf	+1	1	I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard ,
