Uh , yeah . Uh , before we begin it , I want to say I've I've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder ,
It uh it uh still some technical difficulties
so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other .
But uh , from now on I won't use my pen anymore , so will be p just {vocalsound} ordinary keyboard .
Okay , when we talk about uh components design , um it's really about the material and the {disfmarker} and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of .
Uh the properties of the case , um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic
uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh {disfmarker} yeah , it feels uh good in your hand .
I when we use a rubbled {disfmarker} a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to {disfmarker}
uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design ,
which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy . Uh {disfmarker}
uh the basic battery ,
which I thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um {disfmarker}
Uh here you have to have a hand uh {disfmarker} yeah , kinetic uh energy .
Mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls .
uh I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because uh wood or titanium would also be a bit weird .
Oh titanium is probably trendy , I think .
Well , maybe a little bit expensive .
uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf .
all the materials and the components are uh just available in uh in our uh factory .
Um , another possibility . I uh yeah , I looked up on was uh the L_C_D_ displays .
Could be uh something special to our uh remote control ,
and it's possible , but it only cost a bit more ,
{vocalsound} I th I got an email with uh some examples and it {disfmarker} these were were the most trendiest one .
Yes , maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh {disfmarker}
um , I still don't have any information about user requirements .
I was thinking about just uh the basic functions and I got uh {disfmarker}
Oh , we decided upon that in the last meeting .
Yeah , but but then wh I don't know when there are new user requirements .
Well , tha I didn't receive any new requirements or somethi
Well , I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of .
these are the ones you already summed up in the {disfmarker}
Uh , I was also looking for what you said , for {disfmarker} I got an email uh uh about uh L_C_D_ in in in front of the remote control .
I don't know if that's a good idea , or maybe it's a little bit too much for twelve and a half . Production .
I d I uh ju I was just thinking about it . Then I got a pop-ups to go to the meeting . But {disfmarker}
Um , yeah . Well , the functions are are not more to discuss , I think .
It's it's just the base things we already discussed that the {disfmarker} no V_C_R_ or that kind of {disfmarker}
But you do mention the next and previous uh button .
Well , that's next channel . I mean {gap} next channel .
And I um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small {disfmarker}
Well , w when we only use basic functions , we have the possibility to make the buttons larger .
Well , I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons , th th those two have {disfmarker} yeah , they have to be large .
It puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big , like t
uh personal preference I didn't have .
Well , I've done some research again about trends on the internet .
the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control .
The second important thing is uh innovative technology in the R_C_ .
And uh the third point there in this uh order if {disfmarker} of importance , the third point , is a high ease of use .
The younger market likes uh {disfmarker}
Well , {gap} the {gap} themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material .
Uh , catchy colours .
uh I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself .
To implement some spongy thing , maybe we can do it in the in the docking station .
Yeah , also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want {vocalsound} maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour .
But how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in Christ's {vocalsound} sake with {vocalsound} remote control ?
No , but I I I think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit .
Yeah , but it that doesn't have to remind you , you know , like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like the the the the round curves .
Well , w we can uh {disfmarker} w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things .
{vocalsound} And um , maybe , yeah , a b a banana is uh is n {vocalsound} not easy for a remote control , but m yeah .
yeah , I do like uh the f uh to {disfmarker} the idea of making a a y uh , a catchy colour design and a d because I do {disfmarker} I think a dark colour would be nice too .
But pictures of fruit , vegetables vegetables {disfmarker}
Maybe it's too much , you know .
But , we we have to um {disfmarker} There have to be the the the the firm colours , our own uh colours has to be in it .
But I don't think our our company colours are this fashionable .
If this is our docking station , we can make our logo over here .
do we want to um use an L_C_D_ display , for example ?
Well , it's nice , of course . But I don't I don't know what to display on it .
Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it , for the channel you're on .
Yes sure , but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large L_C_D_ screen , because {disfmarker}
Yeah , but {disfmarker} no . I do I think it's a bit redundant , actually .
Well well what would you display on it then ?
Uh , programme uh information or or or or g or a guide
But you're already watching the T_V_ , you're not gonna watch your remote control .
I really understand you want to make your job more exciting {vocalsound} by putting an L_C_D_ in it ,
But I don't think a L_C_D_ display fits in that image .
When when you put uh maybe a colour L_C_D_ t uh screen on it , it's very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from {disfmarker}
well , I'm coming back to the costs again , but I think uh we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits .
and really , I don't see how the the L_C_D_ display is gonna add anything , you know , on a design level .
Okay , we s skip the {vocalsound} L_C_D_ display .
The m material , I think uh it was a good idea to use the plastic and uh the rubber . Uh
Maybe just bring it out in different colours ,
but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards , that's also too much .
But is it possible to use both the the plastic and so uh soft things and t p titanium , as well ?
But it it {disfmarker} then it uh {disfmarker} you can't throw it it . It will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff
Uh , I think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic .
On the other hand , if you want to make fruit {disfmarker} fruity stuff with uh {disfmarker}
Yeah , but I I really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big kind of thing .
But wha th our basic idea {disfmarker} y I mean , you gonna {disfmarker} we're probably gonna have like two type of materials , like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it .
How many colours are we gonna give it ?
Like two-tone colour ? T
I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons , {vocalsound} and the cushions as well should be in another colour .
Not more than two colours I think .
It's a g a little bit too flashy .
Th in that way we have like only the numbers , the power button , skip and volume , and then uh uh ten uh rem
A mute and a teletext and a menu .
I think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions , pads and things on the s uh side .
I think this is kind of fruity , you know . Just round shapes with uh {disfmarker}
I think colours is very important , because it has to be flashy , but {disfmarker} and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying ,
Okay , well I think the meeting will be over within a minute .
Well , you will read the minutes uh in the {disfmarker} you can find them in the {disfmarker}
In the shared folder .
because I'm will now type them out .
What are we going to do now ?
You'll see in you email , I guess .
