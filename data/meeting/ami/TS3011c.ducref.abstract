They could also add some rubber to provide easy grip of the device.
Cases can be flat , single- or double-curved.
They can be made of plastic , rubber , wood or titanium.
Hand or kinetic dynamos , batteries , and solar cells can be used as energy sources.
Possible interfaces are push buttons , scroll wheels , and LCDs . A way to make this device different would be to use a scroll-wheel on the side with integrated button for volume control and mute.
Speech recognition can be implemented by adding a sample sensor and speaker on the remote.
The final decisions also included combined battery with solar cells.
The team will design a single-curved device with a scroll wheel and speech recognition , in black and yellow , the company colours.
