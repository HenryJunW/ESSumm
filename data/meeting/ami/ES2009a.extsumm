We're gonna just do a quick opening
and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another
um then we're gonna start {disfmarker} talk a little bit about tool training .
{vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this
we're making a remote control
Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible ,
and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me {vocalsound} tell us what's possible
and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go
and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible
So it's a three stage kind of thing .
for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it ,
um and just write down {disfmarker} I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs
I'm a excellent Project Manager . Um .
I'm Marty ,
I'm Sarah ,
and I'm the Marketing Manager or something .
I'm Ron .
and I am the User Interface Designer .
I'm Nathan ,
uh project finance .
what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros . Um . {vocalsound}
it's pretty dear ,
the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it .
Eur internationally .
one of the things I I was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably .
Um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty .
um {vocalsound} and I'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it .
Um {vocalsound} U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there
I need you to tell us what um {vocalsound} we {disfmarker} what the user's gonna want .
{vocalsound} and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between
we can't kind of build it into other uh products .
For instance like a mobile phone or something like that .
I don't think there's any rules about it yet . So {disfmarker}
can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ?
Maybe a remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones .
does anybody have any initial ideas ?
as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do , like your microwave or your front door
but then , I've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons ,
But {disfmarker} I'm thinking {disfmarker} I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ uh design
so touch screen design rather than button
so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things .
we've got this kind of an idea of a trade-off between um {vocalsound} uh size and functionality .
but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart ,
maybe like an L_ {disfmarker} like a touch screen type of remote ?
An interesting option .
Needs {disfmarker} it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes .
I think , making it out of a nice material would be very important ,
because so many of those remotes that you see , these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality .
there's such a problem with losing them ,
that adding this whole like P_D_A_ pen business is only one more thing to lose ,
I like the idea of the uh multi plate .
I think , it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device ,
maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote .
there used to be those whistling devices
Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing
that you could place something else
and it makes the remote page .
so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price .
Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote
Or if you our users in mind ,
these {disfmarker} grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design ,
they're used to the buttons
so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to ,
I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um {vocalsound} project documents ,
