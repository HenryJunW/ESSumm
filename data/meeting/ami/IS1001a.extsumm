Okay so welcome everyone .
So we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control .
So I will first start with a warm welcome opening {vocalsound} stuff ,
then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it .
And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas
and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be {disfmarker} you will have to fulfil to complete this process .
So the the goal is to have a remote control
so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly .
So uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points .
First it will be the functional design .
Third is the conceptual design
and then is the desired design .
So the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil .
And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that .
And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing {vocalsound} and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point .
So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board .
It's an abstract drawing of an orangutan .
Of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost . {vocalsound}
It's a cat .
{vocalsound} Maybe I can draw like a very simplified cow . {vocalsound}
So {disfmarker} Here the uh financial objective of our project .
That is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros
and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million Euros .
{vocalsound} Yeah if it's trendy , original I d fulfil the user needs .
so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple .
Maybe I can have the {disfmarker} your opinion from the marketing side ?
Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one
Okay , so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device .
And uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil ?
If we don't have so many buttons could be nice .
And do you have it also to be {disfmarker} to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ?
Something which is not squarey maybe uh , not a box .
So . Fit in your hand , yeah .
{vocalsound} Water-proof as well .
Maybe water-proof would be very original .
And , and that's one of the {disfmarker} that's one of the shock {disfmarker} I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it .
But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well .
Maybe we can sell uh all that together , so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well .
most of the time I I lose my remote control .
We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping .
Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep .
That's a good idea , that's very original and that's can uh improve .
So i it's just going to add t to the cost .
Yeah . We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer .
{vocalsound} Okay so try to find that for next meeting . {vocalsound}
So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working {disfmarker} any working function we have discussed .
So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user .
And also um {vocalsound} I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user .
and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon . {vocalsound}
I think that's all for this point .
