Welcome to the {disfmarker} what should be the last of these meetings
the um th the the minutes of the last meeting uh I think we'll take those as read , um {disfmarker}
the um th the the next uh thing we we we'll have a look at the uh th have a look at the prototypes
and uh look at the uh evaluation criteria and finance
and then uh uh just tidy up with production
we basically have the same kinda lay-out here
you hold it like this
and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically .
Um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume ,
on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda {disfmarker}
so you can hold it and scroll ,
or you can hold it and and push .
Uh this is the power key ,
um it's kinda like the biggest
Uh that's the little menu key .
This is the infra-red section
Uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands
so you can you know talk to it like that
Um the logo is down down there um
and {gap} has the cover on it
the red bit's the cover
and it kinda goes over everything
and then there's holes for the buttons to come through . Um .
And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic ,
just kind of a light {vocalsound} non-descript grey
and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers ,
so they kinda just stretch over .
spongy like is something that people wanted
and it just sort of stretches over
But it's also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers
and then the buttons come through
each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the R_R_ .
{gap} for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically
we could broaden the {disfmarker} broaden it out a bit
but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger
if we just lengthen it I guess
so it comes down to the base of the hand
{vocalsound} The final product would actually stand up , yeah {vocalsound} .
I think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on
let's have a look at the um f finance .
if I {gap} get the uh spreadsheet up .
this is the company's uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design
and I I I've treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us ,
for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not a special colour ,
we're just simply on batteries ,
the the one th the one decision I've had to make is that um
we're {vocalsound} we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with
and I I um I'm I'm I'm certain that they they are around
that I don't think is a a serious problem .
The uh the the voice sensor is is expensive
but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design
so that that has to stay .
Um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves
Um it's simply made of plastic
so th that's uh that's no problem
we haven't actually got a scroll wheel
we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um {vocalsound} slider
I do don't know that they're special colour .
the the costings uh come in at {disfmarker} exactly on target at twelve point five
uh but I thi I think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we've got is is so in innovative and uh and different
that um {vocalsound} any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers
if the management expect us to be techno {gap} again {gap} fail again {disfmarker} technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give ,
I I think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget . Um .
Andrew do you want {disfmarker} what do you want to say about um the uh yeah the evaluation
Method of evaluation {vocalsound} testing the product was to just {gap} if it met all the criteria {disfmarker} all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve , from the point of view of the the consumer and the management .
what I've been asked to do is , on the whiteboard
um gauge our team response to these questions .
on a scale of one to seven , one being true and seven being being false .
And then at the end just take an average
look at these questions .
Is the device f flashy and fashionable ?
I think most definitely .
I'd say definitely a one yeah .
and also uh technologically innovative ?
the voice technology indeed .
Yeah , defi yeah , yeah
Easy to use ?
I don't see we could've made it any easier .
Uh suitable for the consumer ?
Yeah definitely .
I think it made {disfmarker} we met all of the consumer
Uh is it complicated ?
No .
{vocalsound} Uh functional ?
Yeah definitely .
{gap} found easily .
We've b built in the the speech , where are you , function .
Does it take long to learn to use ?
No , not at all .
The R_S_I_ compares to the current standards ,
{vocalsound} Less buttons
{gap} it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well .
{vocalsound} Um will device appeal to all age groups ?
I think it will
because I mean uh old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so {disfmarker}
we had the we had the data {gap} saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money
but the funct the increased functionality , {vocalsound} the e ease of use of the device might make up for that .
I I I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups
I think we can reasonably say it's another another one ,
{gap} in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions uh is that yes it it meets the requirement
it's it's simple to use ,
um it's it's it's within budget ,
I I think we've done an amazing job
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven .
Eleven divided by {vocalsound} eleven's one so {vocalsound} equals average of one .
I think we worked well together
and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make
seemed to discuss things pretty well
th this this slide here I mean the satisfaction with uh room for creativity ,
I think we've allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows .
Um I won't comment on leadership ,
uh teamwork I think we've uh {disfmarker} I think everybody's uh worked pretty well together .
Um we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens ,
and new ideas found , um , again gi no given relatively everyday product , I think we've v very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh
uh a new approach .
Um are the costs within budget ?
Yes .
Is the project evaluated ?
We're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria , um
Thank you very much indeed ,
Cool , thank you {vocalsound} ,
So I call the meeting closed .
