So we are here for the concept design meeting .
So , we will first start by summarizing the mm {vocalsound} the previous meeting and the decision we've taken .
So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours .
We'll then t take decision in concert
and then uh uh we will uh define the nest {disfmarker} next task , to have {disfmarker} to be done before the next meeting .
So maybe we can start with uh industrial design .
you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button
and in our case we are using a um a wheel control .
The push button are usually extremely cheap ,
but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive .
And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not {disfmarker} if if we could combine something with the push button .
Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button .
So will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce ?
We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money .
You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed .
Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff ,
the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button ,
We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button .
Um , what is the purpose of the light ?
You can easily find the button in the dark or so ?
As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light .
I don't think that this is really expensive ,
Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so ,
But it can be uh battery consuming , no ?
To have the light always on ?
Yeah , a little bit .
So I just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls .
And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple .
And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler .
We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle .
So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power ,
So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two .
With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part .
I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb .
Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way .
Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel
and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case .
Maybe the wheel will be a {vocalsound} good advantage over our competitors .
And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends ,
uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures .
{vocalsound} So , maybe if our {vocalsound} remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form {vocalsound}
something like that , or {disfmarker}
{vocalsound} And the mm the material is expected to be spongy .
I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing ,
Yeah , because it's robust .
I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has .
that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible .
Maybe uh um {vocalsound} a colour that remember some fruit uh , things like that .
Well the obvious thing is a banana , I guess .
Yeah . Maybe pear yeah or something like that .
And for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice ,
But that's not in the trend . {vocalsound} .
{vocalsound} I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well .
I think we can keep the wheel
Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then .
but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control ,
You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company .
So we will just use a a standard battery ?
chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use .
I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape .
I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it .
