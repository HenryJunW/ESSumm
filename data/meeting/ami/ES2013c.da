ES2013c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	433.36	454.0	D	ME	sug	+1	2	{vocalsound} And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset .
ES2013c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	454.0	455.83	D	ME	stl	-1	0	So . {vocalsound}

ES2013c.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	490.73	507.52	D	ME	inf	+1	2	but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically {vocalsound} superior fabrics or uh , you know , designed in interesting substances .

ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	1414.01	1419.5	C	UI	ass	+1	1	{vocalsound} Uh I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel ,

ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	1427.48	1430.37	C	UI	inf	+1	1	but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right .
ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	1430.37	1436.88	C	UI	inf	+1	1	It has uh scroll wheels without without a display ,
ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	1436.88	1439.98	C	UI	inf	-1	0	but they they scroll like a computer mouse .

ES2013c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.141	1440.43	1440.65	B	ID	bck	-1	0	Hmm .
ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	1439.98	1450.66	C	UI	sug	+1	1	So I was thinking that uh {vocalsound} um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um
ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	1450.66	1455.26	C	UI	sug	+1	1	and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen .
ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	1456.32	1463.08	C	UI	inf	-1	0	Like I guess an existing Sky or cable one does .
ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	1463.08	1463.67	C	UI	stl	-1	0	Like , you know ,

ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	1479.25	1486.15	C	UI	ass	+1	1	Uh but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote ,

ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	1487.57	1496.28	C	UI	ass	+1	1	um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press ,
ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	1496.28	1499.45	C	UI	inf	+1	1	but still quite simple and quite cost effective .

ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	1502.5	1518.94	C	UI	sug	+1	1	what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , I mean just pretty simple plastic , probably ,
ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	1518.94	1520.36	C	UI	sug	+1	1	I was thinking , yellow and black ,
ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	1520.36	1523.07	C	UI	inf	+1	1	just because that's the company's colours ,
ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	1523.07	1533.41	C	UI	sug	+1	1	with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , {vocalsound} just small along the bottom
ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	1533.41	1541.87	C	UI	ass	-1	0	instead of instead of having the iPod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive .

ES2013c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.142	1541.6	1541.84	B	ID	bck	-1	0	Hmm .
ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	1541.87	1546.77	C	UI	sug	-1	0	And when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you , you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you ,
ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	1546.77	1549.46	C	UI	inf	-1	0	it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching .

ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	1550.27	1561.67	C	UI	inf	-1	0	And so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing Sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down .
ES2013c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.144	1560.77	1562.65	B	ID	ass	+1	1	Yeah , I'd I'd certainly support that idea .
ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	1561.67	1569.06	C	UI	ass	+1	2	And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber .
ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	1569.06	1571.93	C	UI	ass	+1	2	I mean titanium would be great ,
ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	1571.93	1577.63	C	UI	ass	+1	2	but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey .
ES2013c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	1577.63	1586.24	C	UI	ass	+1	2	If we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then I think titanium's too futuristic .
