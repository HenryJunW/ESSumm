Now uh , I ask you to presentate the prototype .
{vocalsound} This is it .
It's uh it's uh it's yellow .
And uh , this is rubber .
And and and this too .
the sides .
And the rest is hard plastic .
We had a new idea {vocalsound} that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside .
And then it covers the {disfmarker} these buttons
And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .
So , you can still operate uh all the things .
Because you don't always use the menu .
And the buttons ?
Big buttons .
And everything is blue , except the power button .
yeah , and the mute and the the other button .
And the joystick is for the volume and the channels .
Very obvious .
Up is channel up .
Down is channel down .
To the right is volume up .
To the left is volume down .
Okay , so if joystick and L_C_D_ .
What's the R_R_
R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo .
That's on the rub rubber part .
So , what they say on the side is put fashion there .
So , that's it . That's prototype .
Now , the finance . {vocalsound}
Do we change the the order ?
Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ?
Finance is um {disfmarker}
first uh {disfmarker}
Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet .
Sorry .
Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together .
I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias ,
uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences .
Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ?
And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating .
Um , well uh we have the Word document
Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important .
But um , if I can get a number in here .
Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative .
Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together .
And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating .
Yeah , I think it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh {disfmarker} it doesn't contain many new features .
Um , I think I will give it a {disfmarker} yeah , yeah , yeah {gap} , a four .
I think the scroll-button is something also uh new .
I think technologically I'll give it an seven .
So now i I think you uh see it {gap} um its statement .
Oh , true or false .
And you {gap} true or false .
Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two .
Two .
It's a one . {vocalsound} The first item .
Um , this product is for all sorts of customers .
Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market
and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers .
That's uh a six .
Mm , four .
So I think it's four .
I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons .
Maybe version uh three point O_ uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} has other colours . {vocalsound}
We put the fashion in electronics .
Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ?
I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design .
Um , so I would give it a two .
Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard .
Uh , I say uh a five .
It's not fashion , it's new .
Then make it th three .
The next element um is the product looks good .
Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow .
So , I would give this a five .
I give it a one . {vocalsound}
Well , I say three .
Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons .
I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better .
Well , uh if we go to {vocalsound} uh this fashion , I {disfmarker} We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers .
So , I would give this a two .
One .
Me too . One .
It does not get lost easily .
Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ?
Yes . {vocalsound}
No , we did not .
So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ?
Ah . Yellow .
I don't think so .
It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch .
A one ? {vocalsound}
Yeah , o one .
Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market .
Uh yeah , did we achieve that .
I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two .
There's a fancy look-and-feel .
That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said .
Well , let's also give this a two .
I gave this a one because of the rubber .
Yeah , f very fancy {gap} trendy .
It's a a bit personal . If it's fancy .
So I think s two is better .
uh it goes with the latest trends .
No , it's new .
Innovation .
If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables ,
well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food
We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that .
We'll go for a three .
I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round .
But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue .
Something what also younger people want .
So um , come back to the presentation now .
So , we find yourself there ,
and now we have to calculate an average rating .
Effort is three , ten and twelve . Thirty , forty , fifty , {gap} .
Twenty one .
So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third .
Two .
So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think .
So , it's good .
So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job . {vocalsound}
Next . Finance .
So , now uh we have a product .
But uh , is it cheap enough ?
We have a battery .
Cheapest there is .
Electronics . Advanced chip .
it's the most advanced .
We have the simple , regular and advanced .
We have the adva advanced .
We have double curved .
{gap} we have half rubber , half plastic .
Special colour .
Yes , yellow .
So , we have the L_C_D_
We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ?
One .
And it's not really a s
Joystick uh thing .
Now , uh button supplement .
Special colour .
The buttons are regular colour .
It's too expensive .
So , we have to change something .
Fifteen Euros .
well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay .
'Cause we can't lose the battery .
We can't lose the advanced chip .
We can't lose the double curve .
We have rubber , special colour .
Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour .
Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ?
For a remote control , I think it is . {vocalsound}
If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right .
Um , then we uh lose two Euros .
Then we have thirteen Euros .
Half a Euro too much .
Exactly the special colours .
Um {vocalsound} just only plastic or only rubber ?
One Euro discount .
I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ .
And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour {disfmarker}
Normal colour , and the the joystick away ,
But if you lose the joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ?
Or it's then a regular ?
The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_
If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ .
Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television .
And then uh we move the the colour .
No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour .
And you cannot use the red and green button .
So , all the buttons has to {disfmarker} have to be the same colour .
What's the normal colour ?
Very good .
Now , uh project eva evaluation .
process . Went good .
I think uh the creativity uh {vocalsound} was good enough .
Uh leadership .
Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote .
Team-work okay .
New ideas found . {vocalsound}
Nope .
I I espe I especially uh liked the the means ,
the the SMARTboard
Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices .
Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation .
Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient .
Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor {gap}
Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly .
Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others .
And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking .
I think it was good .
Not too many discussions .
So , it's good for the speed .
So , I think we're ready .
Good price .
Evaluation ready .
