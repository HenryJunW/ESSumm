IS1007c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.4	60.25	68.23	A	PM	inf	+1	0	And so In the last meeting we had discussed the for sure design and now we 
IS1007c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.5	68.23	72.63	A	PM	inf	+1	0	and now we talk about the concepts in it so 
IS1007c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.6	76.39	85.24	A	PM	inf	+1	0	Really Because what's on Specific case 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.2	81.59	88.08	C	ID	off	+1	1	Okay so i think i read them into my presentation on the components concept so can you use 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.3	88.08	92.084	C	ID	sug	-1	0	so can you use uh all the mm 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.4	96.85	98.2	C	ID	inf	-1	0	And it's them to 
IS1007c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.7	103.06	103.805	A	PM	fra	-1	0	It's 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.5	102.57	103.85	C	ID	inf	-1	0	That is that 
IS1007c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.8	109.679	111.337	A	PM	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.6	109.82	111.3	C	ID	stl	-1	0	Okay so um the first thing yeah 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.7	111.3	121.06	C	ID	inf	+1	1	the first thing yeah i have their knees to to me there we easy to get a wind uh uh manufacturer well the department i have which components 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.8	121.06	126.57	C	ID	inf	+1	1	i have which components for as a as a be able to be the remote control So 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.9	126.57	144.85	C	ID	inf	+1	1	So for energy source is there one we have to choose between the solar energy and in um oh and the kinetic um what a kinetic a technique school to store the energy We also 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.1	140.528	146.445	B	UI	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
IS1007c.D.dialog-act.s9553330.1	142.603	145.246	D	ME	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.10	144.85	152.68	C	ID	inf	+1	1	We also uh oh uh We also can put uh regular battery in the in the remote control No 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.11	152.68	153.327	C	ID	stl	-1	0	No 
IS1007c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.9	152.68	156.12	A	PM	inf	-1	0	Oh this is what we have decided last meeting but if you split 
IS1007c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.10	156.12	157.2	A	PM	inf	-1	0	but if you split it 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.12	157.46	157.9	C	ID	ass	-1	0	Yeah above 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.13	157.9	170.93	C	ID	inf	-1	0	Yeah above well and uh i meant um by by battery and and uh i i would not have uh a a why are between the remote control and an energy source but 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.14	170.93	173.9	C	ID	fra	-1	0	but uh i didn't we 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.15	173.9	181.06	C	ID	inf	+1	1	we didn't decide that which kind of battery We we gonna put inside the uh the remote so 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.16	181.06	184.78	C	ID	inf	+1	1	it's a point to discussion Then 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.17	184.78	195.01	C	ID	inf	-1	0	Then the uh the case much yeah or we have uh uh also several cases like wood rubber chicken yeah um or like tax that one 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.18	195.01	205.93	C	ID	inf	-1	0	that one It's not uh i don't know where the real issue for a dollar From the technical no point of view 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.19	207.38	217.36	C	ID	inf	+1	1	Concerning the interface uh we can look it could just simple buttons all scroll-wheels or buttons uh are much more complicated but it's 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.20	217.36	224.94	C	ID	inf	+1	1	but it's also requires that the chip to presses the button is more complicated so Uh it 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.2	221.01	221.26	B	UI	bck	-1	0	{vocalsound}
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.21	224.94	228.75	C	ID	inf	+1	1	Uh it means that this is the last ones to change the chips 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.22	230.36	242.16	C	ID	inf	+1	1	So what i have found that is that so i think the basic bakery or kinetic uh energy um collection is the the better way to provide energy because 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.23	242.16	249.04	C	ID	inf	+1	1	because like things are are energy we want for him back at earlier uh and the round and 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.3	247.72	247.95	B	UI	bck	-1	0	Hmm 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.24	250.24	257.82	C	ID	inf	-1	0	So um so i think we can start with these two main things for 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.25	257.82	264.67	C	ID	inf	+1	1	for the case uh well uh i think that's that's done "'em" is uh is a good show is because 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.26	264.67	266.15	C	ID	inf	+1	1	show is because it's trendy and it's a 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.27	266.15	269.43	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and it's a it's a way a small town the 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.28	269.43	282.11	C	ID	inf	-1	0	town the user uh huh Uh will be uh very happy to have uh Uh huh a nice a remote For interface 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.29	282.11	293.78	C	ID	inf	+1	1	For interface uh i think that we can add that she's uh all the design of functionalities by is just uh using the rubber buttons simpler buttons and 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.30	293.78	301.824	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and the test this l. o. to use a regular chip That are and when cheaper 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.4	302.37	302.64	B	UI	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.31	302.92	307.97	C	ID	sug	-1	0	And it's a so um we can move to the next slide yeah 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.5	307.22	308.48	B	UI	be.pos	-1	0	Sorry what is a single 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.32	307.97	308.37	C	ID	ass	-1	0	yeah 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.6	308.48	310.84	B	UI	el.inf	+1	1	what is a single curved that doesn't 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.7	310.84	311.49	B	UI	el.inf	-1	0	that doesn't mean 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.33	311.88	317.29	C	ID	inf	+1	1	Well uh it it somehow and the and the shape of the um of the remote you you will have 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.8	315.68	316.732	B	UI	fra	-1	0	So it's it's not 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.34	317.29	325.606	C	ID	inf	+1	1	you you will have the uh where um and the and the curve it fits into your hand when you grab the

IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.10	324.7	327.39	B	UI	inf	-1	0	when you call only use comfortable the whole 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.35	327.55	328.31	C	ID	ass	-1	0	Yeah it's more confident 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.36	328.31	333.3	C	ID	inf	+1	1	it's more confident for comfort to do that to i used to use uh oh it's completely flat 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.11	331.14	331.68	B	UI	bck	-1	0	Okay

IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.13	333.87	338.24	B	UI	el.inf	+1	1	Yeah and the battery is a kind of a rechargeable doesn't it the 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.37	338.27	340.85	C	ID	inf	+1	1	Yeah the um mm and that's the point the 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.38	340.85	346.192	C	ID	inf	+1	1	the point the kinetic one is uh are you can recharge a good idea yeah 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.14	346.42	349.08	B	UI	inf	-1	0	Yeah that's what it means by kinetic 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.39	348.08	348.5	C	ID	ass	-1	0	Yeah um but 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.40	348.5	357.99	C	ID	inf	+1	1	Yeah um but where but just by moving or your arm the uh whether the remote will uh accumulate energy that 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.15	351.87	352.26	B	UI	bck	-1	0	Okay 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.16	353.82	354.21	B	UI	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh

IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.33	443.19	448.08	B	UI	inf	+1	0	So that that i think a this is the um normal case but I'll show you some pictures 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.34	448.08	449.98	B	UI	off	+1	0	I'll show you some pictures that i have and 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.35	449.98	453.11	B	UI	el.sug	+1	0	that i have and you can you would adapt it to name case or not is another issue 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.54	452.132	454.95	C	ID	off	-1	0	Right that's Yeah 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.36	453.11	458.63	B	UI	inf	+1	0	is another issue uh plastic that the new well but uh that's another 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.37	458.63	460.76	B	UI	off	+1	0	that's another point although make is that 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.38	460.76	473.088	B	UI	inf	+1	0	make is that be uh what you have seen them and like not my presentation that on a point know some white buttons some of them Not beyond you ways you can use 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.39	474.37	474.59	B	UI	sug	-1	0	Yeah 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.40	477.41	478.48	B	UI	sug	-1	0	Maybe in 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.41	478.48	479.15	B	UI	sug	-1	0	Maybe in 
IS1007c.C.dialog-act.s9553330.53	478.32	481.903	C	ID	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
IS1007c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.12	479.39	480.4	A	PM	off	-1	0	Period okay

IS1007c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.13	498.88	499.19	A	PM	inf	-1	0	Three 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.42	499.65	499.87	B	UI	ass	-1	0	Yeah 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.32	504.72	505.184	B	UI	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.43	506.26	513.58	B	UI	inf	+1	1	So the user interface is uh You do is the aspect uh of a complete this is the um a problem 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.44	513.58	519.72	B	UI	inf	+1	1	is the um a problem which can be seen or heard Or otherwise perceived but if you menus uh and the commands

IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.45	519.72	527.5	B	UI	inf	+1	1	uh and the commands and mechanisms The user uses to control its operation and it would be that so you see 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.46	527.5	530.92	B	UI	inf	-1	0	so you see it just gives you the wasting would be that and 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.47	530.92	532.55	B	UI	fra	-1	0	be that and we have uh we um well we have as 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.48	532.55	536.28	B	UI	inf	+1	1	um well we have as a small on the graphical user interface here the idea is to 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.49	536.28	542.63	B	UI	inf	+1	1	the idea is to represent buttons as fee gurus diagrams symbols and um so you 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.50	542.63	548.19	B	UI	inf	+1	1	um so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing Yeah yeah 
IS1007c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.14	546.94	548.61	A	PM	inf	-1	0	What's the function of this button 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.51	548.19	550.48	B	UI	ass	-1	0	Yeah yeah so 
IS1007c.A.dialog-act.s9553330.15	551.24	553.92	A	PM	ass	-1	0	It makes a d. v. d. a tapestry 
IS1007c.B.dialog-act.s9553330.52	554.35	556.46	B	UI	ass	-1	0	Easy to use
