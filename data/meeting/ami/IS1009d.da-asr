IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.131	1157.17	1163.51	D	ME	sug	+1	0	and i think we should so this prototype to people from various age and socioeconomic groups and see about 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.132	1163.51	1168.0	D	ME	inf	-1	0	and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things that we haven't thought of we can accept every

IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.89	1166.99	1167.45	C	ID	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.133	1168.0	1170.51	D	ME	inf	-1	0	we can accept every you suggestion of course but they we 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.134	1170.51	1172.68	D	ME	sug	-1	0	course but they we just need to get a few and show

IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.135	1172.68	1175.52	D	ME	sug	+1	0	and show the the prototype you can see research groups we don't 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.136	1175.52	1183.56	D	ME	inf	-1	0	groups we don't want somebody to suddenly come to listen tell us that this button is toxic and you know some charles well what do we want selling so we have

IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.138	1183.56	1186.28	D	ME	inf	-1	0	so we have to get input from most people and then after that we 
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.93	1185.86	1186.18	C	ID	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.139	1186.28	1188.84	D	ME	sug	-1	0	and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.140	1188.84	1193.88	D	ME	ass	-1	0	intuition and you know we like it we think it's good we're gonna get behind it and sell it um 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.141	1193.88	1195.36	D	ME	sug	-1	0	sell it um next slide please 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.142	1197.81	1205.14	D	ME	ass	+1	0	Okay you know the things that i was thinking and no but my wish list is really then realised in this prototype i wanted the shape to 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.143	1205.14	1211.4	D	ME	inf	-1	0	i wanted the shape to be bio warfare can do one anything with angles a little square one to be comfy and round d. so we've got 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.144	1211.4	1212.83	D	ME	ass	-1	0	d. so we've got that size 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.145	1212.83	1214.05	D	ME	inf	-1	0	that size a small the colours bright and 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.146	1214.05	1216.44	D	ME	inf	-1	0	the colours bright and warm which is what we wanted wanted

IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.151	1226.87	1232.07	D	ME	inf	+1	0	a nice and functionality of the last i was because people i can use it but i i I thought paradoxically 
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.94	1231.616	1232.128	C	ID	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	1232.07	1241.24	D	ME	inf	-1	0	thought paradoxically the other features in other words the lock the feel um and a shape that's what people are gonna get in the story they don't have a television 
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	1238.78	1240.32	B	UI	bck	-1	0	See that's what i was in there 
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	1240.75	1241.19	C	ID	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	1241.24	1243.44	D	ME	inf	-1	0	they don't have a television star they can play with it Um 
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	1243.74	1244.05	B	UI	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
IS1009d.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	1243.4	1243.75	C	ID	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	1243.78	1246.59	D	ME	inf	-1	0	with it Um so they'll be our main selling points so 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	1246.59	1248.87	D	ME	stl	-1	0	so um but 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	1248.87	1251.71	D	ME	ass	-1	0	but those are been fulfilled by your prototype and 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.157	1251.71	1254.17	D	ME	sug	-1	0	and get had to the next slide please okay so 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.158	1254.17	1260.43	D	ME	ass	+1	0	okay so um the shape um i think is a oh one that's really 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.159	1260.43	1263.01	D	ME	ass	-1	0	that's really really excellent shape the size is 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.160	1263.01	1266.76	D	ME	ass	-1	0	size is small um and 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.161	1266.76	1273.41	D	ME	inf	-1	0	and these points are an important for the for the marketing these are in how i feel i think that 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.162	1273.41	1274.71	D	ME	stl	-1	0	i think that it's i think 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.163	1274.71	1277.07	D	ME	ass	-1	0	it's i think the display small have to sell but i think we're sort of write 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.164	1277.07	1278.35	D	ME	fra	-1	0	but i think we're sort of write the scale of one 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.165	1278.35	1279.67	D	ME	inf	-1	0	the scale of one to seven and i think 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.166	1279.67	1284.09	D	ME	ass	-1	0	to seven and i think we're sort of right in the middle as far as other competitors At our colour 
IS1009d.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	1281.81	1282.78	B	UI	bck	-1	0	Okay 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.167	1284.56	1286.2	D	ME	ass	+1	0	At our colour i think it's great colours or bright 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.168	1286.2	1289.75	D	ME	ass	-1	0	colours or bright and warming really do great job there and 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.169	1289.75	1295.52	D	ME	ass	-1	0	and give "'em" on the constraints that we had i think we got a soft as possible and 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.170	1295.52	1300.9	D	ME	ass	-1	0	and then the functionality um i think you did a really good job on functionality obviously 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.171	1300.9	1305.89	D	ME	inf	-1	0	on functionality obviously we could at at at at different functions for then we just or something else so 
IS1009d.D.dialog-act.dharshi.172	1305.89	1310.14	D	ME	ass	+1	0	else so i would say that we got two five out of seven on on functionality so i think that there's a look
