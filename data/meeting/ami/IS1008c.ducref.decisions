The group decided on the features that will be included in the final design of the prototype.
The remote will have customized wood casing and ergonomic sizing , voice recognition , a locator function , rubber buttons in a simple arrangement , an advanced chip , and a battery life indicator.
The group discussed including a display on the remote , but the prototype will be designed without a display until the Marketing Expert finds out how much it would cost to add it.
The group decided to contact another company to manufacture the product that could do it cheaply yet still paid fair wages.
