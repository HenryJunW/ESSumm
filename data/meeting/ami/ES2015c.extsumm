Well , welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design .
on the agenda for this , um , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with um some general ideas of our design .
And , um , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what uh materials we're gonna use , and that sort of thing .
The meeting will be forty minutes long .
And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter .
Um , first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made ,
Um , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source .
Um , there are several components of , um , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of .
Um , including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip .
Are they all included , like mandatorily , or r are these different options ?
they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced .
so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well .
Okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source .
We could use a basic battery ,
{vocalsound} There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago .
Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed .
Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power .
Um , or there's solar power ,
which we've been considering inside a building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite so useful .
Um , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat .
We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up .
we could use metal ,
we could use rubber
which might be more um ideal for the anti-R_S_I_ .
Um , titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really .
Um right our choice for buttons as well .
with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons .
they're basically quite a flexible design , modern , you don't have to use individual buttons .
Um one thing with the scroll buttons though .
we would have to have an L_C_D_ um
and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult .
Um , also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with .
{vocalsound} My personal preferences ?
I think we could go for the kinetic energy source .
It's not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor ,
And also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy , you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels .
Rubber casing I thing would probably the best , if we're going for the anti-R_S_I_ and like more choice with um aesthetics .
And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple ,
Another thing is it might be more difficult {disfmarker} if it's a rubber exterior {gap} talking about putting on interchangeable plates .
Maybe if the , um , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case .
So , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable .
you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something , that's just {disfmarker} it's protective as well .
So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber .
is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber ?
As far as I know . It should be .
Or I dunno if you could have a battery pack .
Like as a backup for something .
you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors ,
but a lot of calculators , yeah , have solar power .
May maybe that could be the backup .
I think that might be a little impractical though .
Like if the kinetic thing , I think what's best about that is that it's instant energy .
Um , I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now .
Uh , first of all I'll explain what a user interface is .
Um , there are two types of user interfaces .
There's the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output
and a pointing device , for example a mouse for input control .
I'm not really sure about the pictures that {disfmarker}
maybe that's on an L_C_D_ screen .
Um , because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard ,
so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard .
So you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics .
Like an L_C_D_ screen .
But if we're having a simplified display anyway , w that , we probably won't have to focus so much on that .
It'll be more the on the numbers and the volume .
It'd be more a command interface ,
No I think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that's on the buttons of the remote control ,
I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway ,
to make it more simplistic .
We , we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our , um , more user-friendly remote control , that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons ,
that their functions , colours and forms aren't always helpful .
It can be a bit , yeah , overwhelming . {vocalsound}
But what about the lighting up effect ?
Um , well , um , I thought we had um decided that we would {disfmarker} if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up .
I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards .
I'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through .
So there would have to , have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons , or something .
and well rubber is a more translucent product too ,
so we have that taken care of .
Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe ?
'Cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone . You can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons .
I don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing .
this report is about uh trend-watching .
And the recent fashion update , uh , according to fashion-watchers in Paris and Milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . {vocalsound}
Um , also , in contra uh in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy .
um of course , as {disfmarker} we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting ,
and I'd like to stick to that .
The fruits and vegetable themes , I don't know if that's going to work for us .
Um , the temporary light-up idea , sounds like we're gonna stick to that .
Yeah , it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring .
{vocalsound} It's , it's a little {gap} but it , it's everywhere .
I think we possibly could take a more abstract design .
Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables .
I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something .
I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals .
So maybe there could be animal-based , you know .
Energy , we've decided on kinetic , right ?
I , I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential .
It could even be one of our selling points .
I think we decided on the pushbuttons , right ?
Uh , so that's the simple .
Would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting , the interior lighting system ?
So regular chip .
is regular not simple ?
because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well .
Well , I guess plastic and coated in rubber .
yeah , interchangeable plates .
and supplements .
What's that all about ?
what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the {disfmarker} in consistent use .
We haven't really decided what to do about that .
just just the basic button functions .
Like we , I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of
So we're just going for power , channels , volume ,
Should we have audio ?
it's a problem with the international uh appeal , I think . Um , if we have audio
because we don't know how other televisions work .
'cause it , {vocalsound} mm it is a good sales ploy to say , aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons .
We can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic .
And , okay , in closing , 'cause we only have five minutes .
Um , you'll be working , Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design .
and um the user interface design , so this is where the trendy stuff comes in .
And you'll be evaluating the product .
Poppy and Tara will have to work together , using modelling clay .
And , um , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen .
Um , I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect .
seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research , I thi I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something ,
are you gonna come up with casing ideas ?
Like f five different {disfmarker}
what do yous think of this ?
Um , having the numbers kind of like , not a bunch of grapes , but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle .
Yeah you can have some fun with the buttons , it's true .
I guess what you i ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well .
So it's a something that will , you know , appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds .
'Kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then .
