Our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting ,
for us to go over the previous minutes ,
then for the two of you to present your prototype
and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria .
We then have a finance aspect ,
And I know what you're all thinking of , oh my ,
um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation .
So we're going to make a very fast track .
um each of you made your presentations .
{vocalsound} Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations .
The market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy .
Um we decided chip on print would be used .
Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus ,
powered by kinetic energy .
There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight .
Um looking like a scroll ,
but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling um that was actually in use ,
Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product
Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us .
and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints
Um we're down to the prototype presentation .
well you see ,
each made one ,
This is the one that I made .
It is uh curved , easy to hold , hand-held , nice and small with big easy buttons .
This is like a scroll ,
but they are push buttons
and they enter {disfmarker} takes you into the different menus .
And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there .
the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right {vocalsound} in the different menus .
The main feature of it is just a simple design , simple ,
lack of uh buttons all over the place .
{vocalsound} Form curved , kind of smooth , hand-held ,
Uh material , I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit ,
but I think we have two different options ,
because we did make a another one ,
which wa uh is in the shape of banana ,
if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana ,
which is also nice
and easy to hold
and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology ,
just a slightly different design .
uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic .
Whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one {disfmarker}
uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons .
we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints .
colour , I think {disfmarker} I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons ,
but if anybody's got any other suggestions , I'm quite willing to consider them as well .
maybe , Kate , you better say what you think about them .
I don't have very much to add .
The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic .
We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two ,
We have simple rubber push buttons
I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped .
This one has no obvious connections to fruit ,
it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie ,
you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one ,
{vocalsound} Would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ?
I could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having a problem with the
Breaking ,
that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it ,
I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role .
Yeah , {gap} we really like we really like that design ,
And it's a very simple design ,
{vocalsound} I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I mean actually how to program the menus
and what sort of , you know , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen ,
This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation ,
this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers
a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise .
I'm going to go and use the whiteboard ,
and I've made a list of criteria to look at ,
but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria ,
fancy , technologically innovative , easy to use , trendy , buttons , excess buttons , good buttons , ugly , sellable , and other .
And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms ,
some of them seem rather close ,
what about price , is that gonna go on there as well ? Price of materials .
We'll put price up at the top .
{vocalsound} Not that we actually know anything about it ,
wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ?
It depends what what you mean by fancy really ,
I'd call these quite uh minimalist ,
a plain , simple , clean design .
it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality ,
I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy ,
{gap} like stylish or aesthetic .
in terms of elegant , fancy . we'll call it E_F_ um , do we do we think that perhaps {disfmarker} and maybe we should say the yellow ?
they're both yellow with black buttons ,
but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black .
So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two
but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff ,
I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana .
And of the two I really like I m I like the banana ,
that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now ,
I think between the two , somewhere between the two is true .
It's more true than false , about a two .
{vocalsound} technologically innovative .
I think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative .
we'll say {disfmarker} we'll say uh false .
Easy to use .
{vocalsound} One ,
trendy , s {vocalsound} and I say specifically spongy fruity .
maybe only a two or a three then ,
we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific {disfmarker}
We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy .
Yeah , I don't really think that's gonna work ,
two ? Um
are there excess buttons ?
{vocalsound} {vocalsound} That is false .
Um {vocalsound} good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons .
Better , more intuitive buttons , yes .
Ugly .
No . {vocalsound}
I think they're different ,
it is quite it is quite quirky I think .
It could be quite a good brand , like a good little object .
uh could we say it's cost saving ?
we also need tho think about the energy .
Is it the kinetic energy ?
it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy .
but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet ,
do you have any idea about price or other features ?
I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop .
So true one
I would say maybe a two ,
And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these
instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive
and then make that true ,
'cause I have to do an average . {vocalsound}
And then um excess buttons .
Just putting no excess buttons .
so it doesn't ruin the polarity .
see if we're technologically innovative , I'd say it is quite innovative ,
because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons .
I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition
but but we are at the upper end of the push button market . {vocalsound}
let me know if if any of these {disfmarker} um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here {disfmarker} if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features .
If not I'll average those .
and the next big thing is the finance .
and I'll uh figure out the average here .
Thank you for everyone's help with that .
And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet
it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device .
Hand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells .
just kinetic then , {gap} .
Electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those .
'cause we've just got push buttons ,
and we only need one of those .
the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve .
It looks like it {gap} single curve ,
What does double curved mean , I don't understand .
I I think you {disfmarker} it means you reverse the curve .
you can do a banana in single curve ,
case material supplements . Plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour .
I just wanna say plastic .
We had the special colour .
I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself ,
Okay . We'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added
Button supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black .
And the buttons {disfmarker} Wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ?
does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ?
'Cause I think they can be plastic .
Yeah . They could be plastic ,
we don't have to have rubber buttons ,
Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed .
More profit .
go to the project evaluation , next slide .
the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity .
leadership ,
teamwork ,
Sure .
Yes .
means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things .
Yeah , yeah , the Play-Doh was best , I thought . {vocalsound}
'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder .
we went over all those things
and we're satisfied with all the above .
Um did we find any new ideas ?
I think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I {disfmarker} that really opened my eyes .
Spongy .
And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before ,
Good work as a design team ,
I'm not sure all the wires are really great though .
Are the costs within the budget ?
Oh yes .
Is the project evaluated ?
Yes .
I can give you a number ,
the average evaluation score is one point eight eight ,
There were six true or ones ,
two s almost true or close to true ,
and then uh one false , seven points ,
And the the only false one is because we've chosen to keep a simple old technology ,
which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works ,
And we've therefore {disfmarker} we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary ,
I have a final report to present ,
um and then we're done .
I believe that is the end of our meeting .
