my name's Adam Duguid ,
Ebenezer Ademesoye .
I'm the Marketing Expert .
Tarik Rahman . T_A_R_I_K_ .
Industrial Designer .
Uh , Dave Cochrane .
And you're going to be the User Interface ,
This is the agenda for today's meeting . As you can see , w opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing .
the reason we're here , we're gonna design a new remote control ,
The very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly .
We're gonna have the three kay phases ,
the functional , architectural , and the detailed design . Um {disfmarker}
First one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design .
Second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials ,
and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far .
Ebenezer , you wanna have a {disfmarker} you wanna draw your favourite animal {vocalsound} ?
{vocalsound} Here we have an elephant .
Tarik , would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry ?
Uh , here we have a tiger . Uh {disfmarker}
Dave , if you'd like to uh have a dash .
Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Um , the monkey , um .
but uh cats are one of my favourite animals ,
Project finance . As you can see , twelve point five Euros per unit .
and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five .
If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them .
that was profiting ,
Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ?
one thing I'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes
that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models ,
Um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design .
And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket .
with the price range we're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our {disfmarker}
Absolutely prohibitive ,
But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion .
I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units ,
and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for {vocalsound} um running macros .
Would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the T_V_ , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of {disfmarker}
you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well , um
um I've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television ,
we used to e play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers ,
but our remote controls would get worn out really easily ,
and {vocalsound} the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar , um keypad , for playing games .
Instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins ,
I've seen the bar-code design before ,
I think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot .
Uh , you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television ,
so {vocalsound} we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality ,
um , how the user interface might work ,
that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility
do you think they should have some sort of stick on it , rather than buttons ?
Like uh control pads , you know of games ,
and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well .
Mm-hmm . The other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic ,
something that just fits {vocalsound} fits as comfortably as possible into the hand .
But of course , uh al al also allows for {gap} the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive uh sha shape for it overall , {vocalsound} .
small , stylish , and something that's just a little different .
Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form ,
I'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done ,
and I'll get that out to everybody .
