So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design
and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control .
So let's see the {disfmarker} what did you prepare .
S so so I discussed with Guillaume .
and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes ,
because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive .
One with and one without L_C_D_s .
Um but both comes with a charger
and then detachable and uh or {gap} control module .
And detachable big buttons for all people um .
{vocalsound} S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes {vocalsound} .
Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display .
And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button .
You can uh choose the direction
You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the {vocalsound} for the speech recognition system here .
And here the the switch that control if you want {disfmarker}
The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere .
Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ?
Well so it's a microphone array .
Oh it's very costly , microphone array {vocalsound} .
it's just a single microphone ,
I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to {disfmarker}
well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance .
And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off .
And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger .
How much does it cost this one ?
Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars
Ah it's above it's above the budget .
but uh it's just a prototype
the {gap} and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars . {gap}
How many b battery is there ?
Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it .
A_A_ rechargeable batteries .
Is that two or one ?
{vocalsound} Actually uh it's a flexible thing .
So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger
and uh leave it uh alone , it's alright .
I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there ,
This button is like the mouse {disfmarker} is like a joystick ,
you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction
and it {disfmarker} the additi functions associated to all the actions
you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button {vocalsound} .
You can move up , down , left , right ,
or you can do a swing .
Here I present another version without the L_C_D_ .
So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration .
The second version is also simpler ,
we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also {vocalsound} .
Uh-huh and also the switch .
Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before .
But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation .
Press one button uh acting as a a enter button .
So um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user .
And uh it's also cheaper to produce .
We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars . {vocalsound}
And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger ,
and if you disable speech recognition system then ?
W w I'll I'll come to that point later on .
in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah .
It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone
but uh again depends on the types .
I think we have to investigate more on that , but {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
The price should be below twelve and a half Euro .
but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to {disfmarker} people are willing to pay more for good design .
but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment .
The price of selling is twenty five Euros .
the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular
so you want more function you pay more .
If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system ,
for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it {disfmarker} put it back in , or you can use the other one ,
Something like customised . Yeah
or {vocalsound} the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah .
You want a microphone to put in the {vocalsound} speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see {vocalsound} .
It's pretty flexible in the yeah price {vocalsound} .
You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control
that that you ca you can add up {vocalsound} to the {disfmarker} to your remote control
i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on .
H here is just the the the module for the kids
and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up {disfmarker} they come up with their modules ,
We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled ,
and it acts like the previous one ,
you just plug in and it works .
the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful .
Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons ,
powerful is that all the controls with {vocalsound} the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n
that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here {vocalsound} .
Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you .
The first one is the speech recogniser ,
again it's detachable or add-on .
And then we also have security feature
it's very robust {gap} ,
and the material , what's the material again ?
The titanium
Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one ,
again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want .
Lithium-ion may be a good one ,
again you pay for what you get ,
and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder .
So when you finish watching your T_V_ {vocalsound} and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ , uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger ,
And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary ,
so we didn't define the vocabulary
so it's up to the user to define
And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a {gap} of T_V_ programmes by genre ,
and this can be used by the adult or by the children .
What's the price to p to produce ?
Well so the price to produce {disfmarker} For uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device .
The {disfmarker} without without the charger
it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems .
Two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules ,
and finally three dollars for the charger .
So if you uh sum up uh everything wi with the L_C_D_ {vocalsound} , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two .
We don't have all the options {vocalsound} .
so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars .
it's below the the the budget .
I think we will just have a rough look
and then we can make our statements ,
and we can finalise the product based on this discu
So the marketing made an evaluation criteria
and these were some of the findings ,
and uh in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface ,
but most of the people what they are interested is {disfmarker} first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel ,
it should be very fancy with colourful
and uh very handy to hold .
And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative .
Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative .
And the third one is easy to use .
Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself
since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons .
here you can find {disfmarker} these are the latest fashion updates ,
and so this {disfmarker} in Paris and Milan {gap} they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable ,
so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like .
So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes .
And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium ,
it should be somewhat spongy .
you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy {vocalsound} .
Yeah so uh {vocalsound} so finally we have these three criterias .
One is fancy look ,
second is innovative ,
and third is easy to use .
So {disfmarker} and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these ,
say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven ,
and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this .
So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ,
so on this scale , if it is true , if it is {disfmarker} if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one ,
or if it is false , it doesn't {disfmarker} it looks uh {disfmarker} it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven .
But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ?
according to you designers ,
On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control . How do you look {disfmarker} how does it look ?
D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ?
I'll I'll say three or four .
{vocalsound} I think we can improve on the design .
Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh {gap} {vocalsound} design .
Um we have been focused all all this {vocalsound} time on the {vocalsound} on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity .
So I take three on {disfmarker} with L_C_D_ ?
So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ?
Uh four .
I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated
so removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look .
And in the sense of innovativeness , with L_C_D_ .
Well it's it's the same for both
so {vocalsound} I will give a five , six . {vocalsound}
from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um {vocalsound} the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content ,
and for now {disfmarker} and another innovation we have is simplicity
and {disfmarker} simplicity , few buttons , we've uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} A lot of functionalities .
So without L_C_D_ ?
Mm for both it's the the same innovations .
So maybe I can put six to seven .
actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts .
then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness .
Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ?
We haven't really uh determined {vocalsound} what are {disfmarker} actually actually
I mean on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme .
but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen .
on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now .
If you have the L_C_D_ ,
Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ .
But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ .
Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_ {vocalsound} we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ ,
So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ?
Well I think both are really easy to use
and uh well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so {disfmarker}
so I will give a six for the easy to use .
No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ .
Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price ,
So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes
according to fruit and vegetable
or a spongy touch
without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition .
I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect .
I think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people .
For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated
because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons .
For kids they want simply the {gap} s similarit for the old people they want simplicity ,
but but uh what I'm trying to say here is that the um {disfmarker} we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people .
So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ?
Um six .
S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ .
As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also ,
and it's going to be much simpler to use .
so let's go back to our laboratory and {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
{vocalsound} To improve on the design .
{gap} what about the integration of speech recognition ?
The speech recogniser is a add-on module .
That's going to be an optional .
I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control ,
because maybe parents will lose these uh {disfmarker}
but I mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module
Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or ,
{vocalsound} The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children
{disfmarker} {vocalsound} when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people ,
and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them .
So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional {disfmarker} uh will be optional .
{vocalsound} But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? {vocalsound}
I think it inc increase . {vocalsound}
because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but {disfmarker}
it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the {vocalsound} functionalities um on the same module , but uh {disfmarker}
Well well the other aspect is that if {vocalsound} in the {disfmarker} when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the {disfmarker} you're gonna keep the same customer ,
because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons .
i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future .
attracting them to come back in again and again .
Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be {disfmarker} can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ?
And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ?
Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ?
but we are also the um well the components will have to change
because uh we have to deal with the shape
Or uh it could be like this {disfmarker} the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all .
What we can change is to propose the {vocalsound} customers with skins .
For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin
and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better .
we can have the same global shape
and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that .
I think you need to look into the material .
I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models .
Project evaluation project satisfaction , for example .
I don't know , we have to ask these question .
{vocalsound} Room for creativity .
This room is a bit small , but {vocalsound}
{vocalsound} but I think it's okay for us to work with . {vocalsound}
This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations .
And the leadership was excellent .
Yeah I think so {vocalsound} .
Uh the teamwork was very very good .
And new ideas found .
{vocalsound} Come up with new product {vocalsound} .
Yeah and also more well uh {vocalsound} more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting
uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that ,
We achieved uh project goal I think .
that is within the budget .
yes , more or less .
Without without L_C_D_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple .
Yeah thank you for your work and {disfmarker}
