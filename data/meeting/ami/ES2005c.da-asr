ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.4	84.18	89.49	B	ME	inf	-1	0	Um how this trend is going to affect a remarkable attention and how important is it is so we have 
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5	89.49	91.48	B	ME	sug	-1	0	so we have to look on this 
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	92.92	94.67	B	ME	inf	-1	0	First of all methodology they might 
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	94.67	101.4	B	ME	fra	-1	0	they might lead to do it in to find out that and was into the lower than in a way Uh we have done it 
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	101.4	108.88	B	ME	inf	+1	1	we have done it is it not only these a remote control market so there but we also considered the greatest threat fashion trends of the market was 
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	108.88	113.39	B	ME	inf	-1	0	was we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit 
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	115.25	117.58	B	ME	inf	-1	0	So what are our findings in a very 
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	117.58	117.98	B	ME	stl	-1	0	in a very 
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	117.98	121.26	B	ME	stl	-1	0	in a very uh you know findings we have seen that When we did other 
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	121.26	134.49	B	ME	inf	+1	1	When we did other remote control market so we we found that Uh people will uh uh people do have preference for a those fancy more one of the remote control switch look and feel a vote better than having 
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	134.49	138.23	B	ME	inf	+1	1	better than having a functional look and feel so good so this 
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	138.23	144.46	B	ME	inf	-1	0	so this shit this clearly indicates that preference for the design the the outlook of the remote controls so 
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	144.46	146.45	B	ME	stl	-1	0	so we should take into uh so we should 
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	146.45	149.95	B	ME	sug	-1	0	uh so we should consider this vector is the most important factor of 
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	149.95	153.18	B	ME	inf	-1	0	factor of this vector it is twice as important the second factor which 
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	153.18	158.91	B	ME	inf	-1	0	the second factor which is for that to do is they as important as the side uh so the third factor so 
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	158.91	169.13	B	ME	inf	-1	0	factor so this vector one of the most important factor in others are uh uh in our market um means and take in designing our um our uh remote controls 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.4	169.43	171.62	D	UI	el.inf	-1	0	The last one is most important one is uh oh sorry

ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	412.02	416.01	D	UI	inf	+1	1	Okay so the interface concept um 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	417.74	420.64	D	UI	inf	-1	0	Yeah the interface specification what people 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	420.64	422.27	D	UI	stl	-1	0	what people and how they interact 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	422.27	425.85	D	UI	inf	-1	0	and how they interact with that basically i think Um 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	425.85	429.44	D	UI	inf	+1	1	Um so the method we did the existing designs one of the 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	429.44	430.05	D	UI	stl	-1	0	one of the what's good about 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	430.05	432.65	D	UI	inf	-1	0	what's good about them what's bad at them um 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	432.65	434.26	D	UI	inf	-1	0	um let's have to also going to look at it 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	434.26	436.31	D	UI	sug	-1	0	also going to look at it was everything um and 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	436.31	442.9	D	UI	inf	-1	0	um and what's in Just have a told is and what we think would be good it's 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	442.9	445.48	D	UI	inf	-1	0	good it's a bit of imagination Uh the 
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	444.62	445.06	C	PM	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	445.48	449.43	D	UI	inf	-1	0	Uh the findings of got some pictures to say stuff Okay yeah 
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	446.2	450.752	C	PM	be.pos	-1	0	Either 
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	449.452	450.896	A	ID	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	449.78	449.96	B	ME	bck	-1	0	Hmm 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	449.43	449.96	D	UI	ass	-1	0	yeah 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	450.928	453.5	D	UI	inf	+1	1	Okay it's a maze to remote controls is graphical interface where you 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	453.5	462.87	D	UI	inf	-1	0	interface where you um have cops buttons and you point to it rather than having the output is a stream of text or something um 
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	462.03	462.51	C	PM	bck	-1	0	Uh huh 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	462.87	467.64	D	UI	inf	+1	1	um and we also found that is inconsistent layout which makes it confusing so 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	467.64	470.07	D	UI	inf	-1	0	so i think for a remote control there is some inconsistency 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	470.07	473.58	D	UI	inf	-1	0	there is some inconsistency already nick existing in between remote controls by things 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	473.58	480.97	D	UI	inf	+1	1	controls by things stand that kind of and shape and up in a in this kind of button buttons like 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	480.97	483.41	D	UI	inf	-1	0	button buttons like that the top right so on and off or something i think people 
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	483.73	484.84	C	PM	ass	-1	0	Right okay yeah 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	483.41	486.21	D	UI	inf	-1	0	or something i think people find that important "'cause" and it's easy to use

ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	539.85	541.39	C	PM	stl	-1	0	like scrolling that that that uh fourth of 
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	541.39	544.51	C	PM	inf	-1	0	uh fourth of of like in the right one of the same thing and from um one or you scroll

ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	552.39	553.17	D	UI	el.inf	-1	0	is the but the one to lay 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	553.17	557.1	D	UI	inf	+1	1	but the one to lay that it's got like a little scroll function on the side but i presume 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	557.1	560.79	D	UI	inf	+1	1	but i presume that the functions was come up on the t. v. screen

ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	563.48	564.99	D	UI	inf	-1	0	so it's just a few ideas then 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	564.99	567.27	D	UI	ass	+1	1	a few ideas then that's that's quite boring shape great looks quite space 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	567.27	570.38	D	UI	ass	+1	1	looks quite space eighty bit too many buttons i think on that one

ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	589.78	592.78	D	UI	ass	-1	0	bright so i like this um uh for a design i think 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	592.78	595.18	D	UI	ass	-1	0	i think something like that would be good of course yellow 
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	594.84	595.14	A	ID	bck	-1	0	Oh 
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	594.89	608.22	C	PM	ass	+1	1	Yeah um i mean the one thing uh think about about these ones is um these uh secure areas and i've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing so like other hand 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	595.18	596.353	D	UI	ass	-1	0	of course yellow 
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	608.22	610.99	C	PM	sug	+1	1	so like other hand show them so clip-on right 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	608.0	608.51	D	UI	ass	-1	0	Right yeah 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	610.12	612.58	D	UI	ass	-1	0	Yeah that's true yeah um 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	612.58	618.57	D	UI	sug	-1	0	um so maybe that could be built into one things and it comes up on the t. v. or something and this one 
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	618.57	620.94	D	UI	inf	+1	1	and this one big oversized one i

ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	998.74	1001.23	C	PM	el.inf	-1	0	So is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip is it 
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	1001.41	1001.72	A	ID	inf	-1	0	Right it's very 
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	1001.72	1002.14	A	ID	stl	-1	0	Right it's very very cheap remote 
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	1002.14	1003.0	A	ID	inf	-1	0	very cheap remote this remote costs
