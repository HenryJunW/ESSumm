6	ES2014b.JacquelinePalmer.s.19	The group had difficulties finding a balance between adding more features and finishing the project quickly.
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.146	1523.12	1533.67	A	PM	inf	+1	2	So anything that uh is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.145	1516.01	1523.12	A	PM	inf	+1	2	and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out .
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.147	1533.67	1539.9	A	PM	inf	+1	2	because time to market is is critical . S
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.149	1544.74	1551.46	A	PM	inf	+1	2	But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras .
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.155	1566.58	1569.76	A	PM	inf	+1	2	Uh d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end
ES2014b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.156	1569.76	1573.03	A	PM	inf	+1	2	and then get to the end with um added extras if possible .
