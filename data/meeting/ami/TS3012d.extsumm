Detailed design {disfmarker}
Prototype presentation , well first
It's basically what we agreed upon ,
but just a little bit more specified .
{vocalsound} Basically in {gap} {disfmarker} what we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components ,
We chose a different type of colour for the menu . A bit darker yellow
And it {disfmarker} I guess it's more easier to just paint it on the rubber
So we have it's a bit round shaped ,
We chose the buttons to be uh teletext , okay button , favourite channel and the mute .
We have battery power ,
we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor . The sample sensor and uh {disfmarker} for speak recognition anyway .
we have sin one curve , {vocalsound} a design . Rubber design .
And we had a special colour . Suppose yellow is a special colour .
{disfmarker} You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display .
You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost ,
What do we scrap .
think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition .
Because the L_C_D_ has more support on customer side .
Uh we don't really have a extra function with the speech sample ,
so I had to take out the special colour I suppose .
and if you want it {disfmarker} if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers .
So can't we just basically extend it to thirteen ?
uh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half ,
we could take out the curve .
I think the colour is more important than the really the curve ,
but the example is because we do offer the um {vocalsound} the possibility of adding your own custom covers .
Can we then not also uh change the material ?
We take plastic for the basic cover
something that's stuck into my mind is that {disfmarker} something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of {disfmarker} the spongy feeling of the {disfmarker}
We can put those to the to the other covers .
Rubber would increase durability
so why why uh {vocalsound} do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half ?
and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company
But we can take a risk .
that's not our decision to take .
I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect
and keep the functionality between {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget .
but the one that g has given us the order to design this .
and then tell them okay , we had to drop this and that , just that you know . It is an {disfmarker} still an option , but {vocalsound} not for this price .
yeah , it's true .
So that's what we gotta go with .
just to get it through final ,
I say lose the curve . Oh that's true ,
Which would , yeah , turn it into something far more ordinary .
I second that .
So we keep the curve .
And I'm in favour of keeping the rubber ,
because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has .
Yeah . I would say {disfmarker} I would agree with you on the colour ,
we're final on that .
we could just discuss how the project went .
I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time .
Me too , I felt a bit blind throughout the project ,
because it's good .
I mean it's got everything for the for the reasonable price ,
let's eval evaluate uh the product of us , our design .
I uh will pre present uh some statements
and we will decided together wha what {disfmarker} if it's true or false
So so the buttons , the look and feel .
One and a half . {vocalsound}
And the next one {vocalsound} uh {disfmarker} yeah , when it's lost uh you can find it .
so I think it {disfmarker} that's {disfmarker} that deserves a one . Definitely .
And the next one .
Manual .
I think the L_C_D_ display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control ,
it it is pretty straight-forward .
So I might make this a two instead of a one , I guess .
You can use the L_C_D_ in a good way .
What are we uh displaying on the L_C_D_ screen ?
Things like brightness and uh those kind of things we've put in the menu ,
I thought that people wanted previews on their {disfmarker}
I don't think it's possible really .
uh with configuring your remote control for favourite {disfmarker} your favourite channel for example , how do you configure that .
So that could be done by L_C_D_ display .
A three .
I mean the shape is trendy .
The the sh the the functions are trendy .
It's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model .
Maybe we should go with a two then ,
Overall score .
Two and two thirds .
mostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition .
'Cause yeah , that gives you a seven ,
I do admit that we d {vocalsound} did miss a little {disfmarker} or didn't sp didn't talk {gap} {disfmarker} talk enough about the possibility of the L_C_D_ display .
We could have used it more efficiently ,
{gap} {disfmarker} like I said , {vocalsound} changing channels , everything hidden in your L_C_D_ display , so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything .
For example , I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created .
I think we did pretty well as team-work though .
Because , yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime ,
There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them .
I think a SMARTboard SMARTboard is pretty cool .
I think uh s especially for design issues , it's very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little {disfmarker} it's easier to share them .
Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher ,
The digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to further elaborate on that .
So we cannot work on more than one page at same time . That's not possible .
The one thing we missed though , we don't have a product name .
And it's especially on the triple R_ that's important . The Real Reaction Remote .
Triple R_ it is .
have to write my report now , I guess .
Could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report ?
Yeah , sure .
