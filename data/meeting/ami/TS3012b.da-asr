TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	475.56	479.25	B	UI	inf	-1	0	um usually when you have a lot of buttons buttons are small so you press 
TS3012b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	479.25	486.34	B	UI	inf	-1	0	so you press more once remote control goes Couple we or something like that so we have to

TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	605.66	609.42	C	ID	el.sug	-1	0	and uh how big easy remote control uh going to be i'll tell you why 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	609.42	611.77	C	ID	inf	-1	0	i'll tell you why that's important to me um 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	611.77	615.12	C	ID	inf	-1	0	um the a lot of technical parts in the remote control so uh uh

TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.120	635.42	636.57	A	PM	ass	-1	0	Yeah my first 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	634.98	635.31	C	ID	stl	-1	0	to be built so it's that's 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	635.31	635.8	C	ID	fra	-1	0	it's that's 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	635.8	637.98	C	ID	inf	-1	0	it's that's not as easy as it might do like uh

TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	637.98	641.78	C	ID	inf	-1	0	like uh but do a study i'm working on that um for the the costs have to 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	641.78	644.44	C	ID	off	-1	0	costs have to check out how far can go with that normally a 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	644.44	646.78	C	ID	inf	-1	0	normally a circuit board is made of fibreglass otherwise 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	646.78	649.44	C	ID	inf	-1	0	fibreglass otherwise i made of copper uh that's 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	649.44	651.18	C	ID	inf	-1	0	uh that's is how it is done and all remote controls 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	651.18	652.88	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and all remote controls work that way i think 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	652.88	654.8	C	ID	sug	-1	0	work that way i think we can just scroll said um 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	654.8	660.22	C	ID	inf	-1	0	said um then i have read more integration of materials means less cost for the production them all we can 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	660.22	665.07	C	ID	inf	-1	0	them all we can make uh at once uh in one piece uh that is cheaper 
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.121	665.41	668.11	A	PM	el.inf	-1	0	Maybe integrate them all to the circuit board okay 
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.122	668.11	668.41	A	PM	und	-1	0	okay 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	667.62	668.31	C	ID	inf	-1	0	Exactly so if you make a 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	668.31	673.46	C	ID	inf	+1	0	so if you make a circuit board with the the connections already on its then that's cheaper so we have to 
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.123	673.074	674.0	A	PM	und	-1	0	Yeah okay so if 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	673.46	678.28	C	ID	sug	-1	0	so we have to make something that's not too difficult in design again right This is what it look like 
TS3012b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.124	674.0	674.682	A	PM	fra	-1	0	so if 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	678.28	681.43	C	ID	inf	-1	0	This is what it look like a looks like it if you press one button so this is not think 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	681.43	682.96	C	ID	inf	-1	0	so this is not think i think you 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	682.96	685.27	C	ID	inf	+1	0	i think you have the the power coming in they have like a switch 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	685.27	686.75	C	ID	inf	-1	0	they have like a switch switch 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	686.75	695.08	C	ID	inf	+1	1	switch uh uh uh uh uh if you uh press it then some electrical charge goes into the process uh that things of uh a morse code that's how you should see 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	695.08	696.35	C	ID	sug	-1	0	that's how you should see most would go to 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	696.35	698.1	C	ID	inf	-1	0	most would go to the amplifier then at the scene no sense 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	698.1	701.14	C	ID	inf	+1	1	then at the scene no sense to to uh huh by buttons you have infrared

TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.51	709.09	711.58	C	ID	inf	-1	0	Uh it here again that's my story about the different modes if you want 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	711.58	720.67	C	ID	inf	-1	0	modes if you want to make a remote uh universal then the process there has to uh make uh but different morse code went some button was pressed that make 
TS3012b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	720.67	722.28	C	ID	inf	-1	0	that make it much more complex so we really need to
