ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.34	189.44	198.37	D	ME	off	+1	1	i had basically wanna wanna do here we get in there too far as i want to show you all the background information i have that i think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	198.74	199.13	B	PM	ass	-1	0	Okay 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.41	199.16	203.26	D	ME	off	-1	0	And uh and then sort of go through some of the way that uh that was that information and then sort 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.36	203.26	208.54	D	ME	off	-1	0	and then sort of brightness altogether and at the c. ceds yeah that's it some of the overall vision 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.35	209.14	215.05	D	ME	inf	-1	0	Um so i tried to take a lot of market research and summarise it for us and then i'd identify 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.38	215.05	223.23	D	ME	inf	-1	0	and then i'd identify yeah trends that are are sort of in synch an important to our our um project plan that we have so far and then that initiate 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.39	223.23	227.09	D	ME	inf	-1	0	and then that initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it's it helps 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.40	227.09	234.28	D	ME	inf	-1	0	so that it's it helps us to to narrow way on on aspect sell inform other um that elements of the of the project That makes 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.42	234.72	236.95	D	ME	el.inf	-1	0	That makes sense that that's strange i 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.11	235.64	235.89	A	ID	ass	-1	0	Yep 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	235.53	235.92	B	PM	ass	-1	0	Uh-huh 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.43	236.95	238.95	D	ME	inf	-1	0	strange i thought that that will impact on the rest what we do so 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.44	238.95	241.37	D	ME	inf	-1	0	on the rest what we do so that's why suggested we get an okay so out 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	239.91	241.14	B	PM	ass	-1	0	Um for a pointer right 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.45	241.37	254.62	D	ME	inf	+1	1	okay so out of um different uh figures in ratings above have people in general um consumers in general the number one thing that was found was that uh the important to television remote control a fancy look-and-feel okay and not 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.46	254.62	260.72	D	ME	inf	+1	1	okay and not can specify not a functional look or or feel up for fancy 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.41	258.92	259.36	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.47	261.11	265.48	D	ME	sug	-1	0	Um however this is where we can have to be very adding creative about a number two 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.48	265.48	268.02	D	ME	inf	+1	1	a number two with that it be innovative okay so 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.49	268.02	276.58	D	ME	inf	-1	0	okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative with a adding just a necessary um to the functional but stuart uh and 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.50	276.58	279.49	D	ME	inf	+1	1	uh and third very uh for ease of use so again that 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	279.49	288.19	D	ME	inf	-1	0	of use so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be um and quite user-friendly you will still having technology So it all the 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	288.35	293.65	D	ME	off	-1	0	So it all the same right away is a bit of a foreshadowing how we perceive at us in terms of marketing is that i 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	293.65	307.46	D	ME	sug	+1	1	is that i think um well we should think about is how the um But how the innovation uh it can truly so the look and feel and not so much to the functionality of it for example like 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	301.631	303.408	B	PM	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.43	307.62	308.39	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	307.46	311.83	D	ME	sug	-1	0	for example like when you pick it up and push it like it all light up or something you know to me like 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	311.83	315.91	D	ME	sug	-1	0	or something you know to me like or it's got something else to add they just scenes innovative because 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	313.97	314.37	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Uh 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	315.91	317.25	D	ME	fra	-1	0	innovative because obviously the thing at the messages 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.58	317.25	319.36	D	ME	inf	-1	0	at the messages easy to use so how do you 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	319.36	323.5	D	ME	el.inf	-1	0	so how do you make innovation makes any more more easy to use well that's i 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	323.5	325.82	D	ME	sug	-1	0	to use well that's i guess we're gonna go with that okay 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	325.01	325.47	B	PM	ass	-1	0	Okay 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	325.82	330.25	D	ME	inf	-1	0	okay then there's the other aspect of the it back d. v. market um 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	331.35	333.76	D	ME	inf	-1	0	Research i have here is on fashion style okay which

ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	346.53	352.92	D	ME	inf	-1	0	furniture when i first saw that i thought hmmm what do we want to actually try and think about this trend in how we add something to it or 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	352.92	353.98	D	ME	inf	-1	0	something to it or we get right in the or 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	353.98	355.57	D	ME	inf	-1	0	we get right in the or we completely steer away from it you need 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	355.89	356.8	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay okay 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	355.57	356.15	D	ME	el.und	-1	0	from it you need My my 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	356.72	360.07	D	ME	sug	+1	1	My my feeling is that we we do want to observe this trend but we want to 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	360.07	368.34	D	ME	sug	-1	0	but we want to think also that the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics um 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	368.34	370.29	D	ME	stl	-1	0	um "'cause" i think what we're in what we're in is partly 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	370.29	374.96	D	ME	inf	-1	0	in what we're in is partly sort of home decor partly something like a computer um 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	374.96	381.27	D	ME	inf	-1	0	um so i think we might wanna be careful about how you how quickly we create like a remote control the shape of an apple or something i think that would be pushing 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	381.408	382.243	B	PM	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	381.27	382.42	D	ME	ass	-1	0	something i think that would be pushing it

ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	383.17	386.95	D	ME	inf	+1	1	And then in terms of material trends everything's to be soft and spongy and 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	386.95	390.66	D	ME	inf	+1	1	and spongy and two of my set ergonomic or or from a handle which is 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	390.66	395.39	D	ME	inf	-1	0	from a handle which is which also you indicated that last year this was this is not the case so 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	395.39	401.86	D	ME	inf	-1	0	so um probably a lot of a competition on the market will be still in last year's mode so if 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	401.86	406.19	D	ME	sug	-1	0	mode so if we try and re capitalise on that i think that'll be in our favour um 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	406.19	406.96	D	ME	stl	-1	0	um 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	409.6	411.46	D	ME	inf	-1	0	So this this is the summary of everything um 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	411.46	416.77	D	ME	inf	-1	0	um style is number one uh thing in the in the market if we were selling to uh 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	416.77	423.19	D	ME	inf	-1	0	uh innovative design technology is also a master that it seemed to be seen to be uh cutting edge um but ease of use 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	423.19	425.48	D	ME	inf	-1	0	um but ease of use has to be insured threat that was like the number 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	425.48	427.25	D	ME	inf	-1	0	threat that was like the number three thing and then at the end 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	427.25	430.91	D	ME	inf	+1	1	and then at the end there or vibrate natural colours um 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	432.05	433.8	D	ME	inf	-1	0	That's the way i interpreted in any way soft 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	433.8	436.56	D	ME	inf	+1	1	in any way soft is the material shape and function and so i 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	436.56	441.97	D	ME	inf	-1	0	and so i brought that rid of the bottom to get a sort of a context of discussion mac ipods something 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	441.76	442.33	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	441.97	446.98	D	ME	inf	-1	0	something which is i that's a very high-tech ten gigabytes whatever but 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	446.98	449.43	D	ME	inf	-1	0	whatever but when you hold in your hand the signal buttons you know the macrophone 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	449.57	451.32	B	PM	ass	-1	0	Mm that's true hmmm 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	449.43	450.57	D	ME	el.und	-1	0	you know the macrophone it 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	451.04	453.54	D	ME	inf	-1	0	I'm thinking of a mac ipod a sort of last year is because it's very 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	453.54	456.47	D	ME	inf	-1	0	year is because it's very hard and sort of blasting in glossy so i'm thinking 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	456.47	460.96	D	ME	sug	+1	1	so i'm thinking of we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a mac ipod and 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	460.96	465.69	D	ME	sug	+1	1	and word then making it's more of like uh more like a comfortable type of or more 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	465.69	466.672	D	ME	stl	-1	0	of or more like a 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	467.537	470.48	D	ME	inf	-1	0	Maybe more vibrant for anything yeah 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	471.6	472.83	D	ME	fra	-1	0	Um and then so this is what 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	472.83	479.43	D	ME	sug	-1	0	and then so this is what with all that information um what i'm what i'm suggesting in the slide here is that we we take these ideas and as we get 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	479.43	485.54	D	ME	sug	-1	0	and as we get in the more and more um I think like sort of production side of things are we think about 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	485.54	491.14	D	ME	sug	-1	0	side of things are we think about shape materials and teens or series to go through a sort of like uh 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	491.14	492.176	D	ME	fra	-1	0	sort of like uh 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	494.04	495.74	D	ME	fra	-1	0	I don't know like um we think 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	495.74	498.11	D	ME	sug	+1	1	we think is some kind of a thing thing that unifies at all do we agree on 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	498.11	499.05	D	ME	sug	-1	0	do we agree on us um like a marketing 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	499.05	501.49	D	ME	sug	+1	1	us um like a marketing identity um 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	501.49	502.288	D	ME	stl	-1	0	um 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	503.75	504.74	D	ME	el.und	-1	0	That makes sense yeah 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	504.74	505.7	D	ME	oth	-1	0	sense yeah so 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	505.7	514.28	D	ME	inf	-1	0	so so like a threat a few ideas they're just a kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon line i dunno green colours or whatever just i. 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.114	514.28	515.28	D	ME	inf	-1	0	just i. d. x. and thinking that 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.115	515.28	524.97	D	ME	inf	-1	0	d. x. and thinking that some of these ideas for seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people so see that them as in terms of texture shape colours things like that 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	525.35	525.81	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	526.87	527.24	B	PM	ass	-1	0	Right 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	526.87	535.03	D	ME	inf	+1	1	Like count the ones the ones that um most fond of in terms of getting like it into it would be like um like lemon or something like that you know something which is 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.117	535.03	540.17	D	ME	inf	-1	0	you know something which is like you see a lot in in other areas like i see 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	540.17	545.351	D	ME	inf	-1	0	like i see what's web sites and things it seemed associate like lemon and mine So 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	545.6	546.05	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.119	545.95	547.92	D	ME	inf	-1	0	So and it's just an idea 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.52	548.66	549.01	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.120	549.07	558.4	D	ME	sug	-1	0	I'm thinking we we could incorporate some these features in a fairly um In the something which is which seems to have something to which is almost gimmicky because 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	558.4	562.49	D	ME	inf	-1	0	because like um like something to do it like the lighting within that like you know 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	562.49	570.42	D	ME	inf	-1	0	like you know just as in the simple sense when you pick up the phone and touch a button it to uh lights up usually the buttons light out how to me build 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	563.45	564.31	B	PM	und	-1	0	Um 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	570.42	571.56	D	ME	sug	-1	0	how to me build on that maybe like 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	571.56	574.07	D	ME	sug	+1	1	on that maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	574.07	578.31	D	ME	sug	+1	1	or or people could by the by the control and then it comes at different like 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	579.96	581.38	D	ME	sug	+1	1	Cover or something so any does it that's

ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	728.98	732.37	C	UI	inf	+1	1	colour scheme um for instance the standby button is no threat that we should be 
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	732.37	733.05	C	UI	inf	-1	0	that we should be a system to the user then 
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.22	733.05	735.68	C	UI	inf	-1	0	a system to the user then uh identify with this year

ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.23	919.73	922.78	A	ID	off	-1	0	okay i mean just get this We are just 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.89	920.53	920.95	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.25	925.09	925.97	A	ID	oth	-1	0	Ah it is

ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.26	954.12	954.97	A	ID	inf	-1	0	It should be 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.27	957.91	963.21	A	ID	inf	-1	0	Okay um i guess the same thing again i start with something very basic so just so you guys 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.152	959.037	960.348	D	ME	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.28	963.21	966.66	A	ID	inf	-1	0	so just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process and then 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.29	966.66	968.03	A	ID	sug	-1	0	and then you can just walk through it and we'll have 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.153	966.43	966.7	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.30	968.03	973.12	A	ID	sug	-1	0	and we'll have a modified or something scratch um that anyway you need to Um 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.31	973.68	976.21	A	ID	inf	-1	0	Um the components are exactly the same um i think like 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	975.69	976.17	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.32	976.21	981.76	A	ID	inf	-1	0	um i think like when you guys said um the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface the rest 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.33	981.76	987.14	A	ID	inf	-1	0	the rest of the components um did you have an impact in terms of cost and complexity um like you said time 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.34	987.14	989.53	A	ID	inf	+1	1	um like you said time to market was a problem um and 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.35	989.53	991.96	A	ID	inf	+1	1	um and how me components are physically in in cost 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.36	992.23	994.38	A	ID	inf	+1	1	And the parts basically a factor that um and 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.37	994.38	1002.61	A	ID	inf	+1	1	um and the law components the power the logic which has been an infrared um the effect in terms of the size of the device um and 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.38	1002.61	1011.88	A	ID	inf	-1	0	um and that would have something to impact on how i think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the the remote control because 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.39	1011.88	1017.52	A	ID	inf	-1	0	the remote control because um like we say we define i really wanna basic things it to be visible on our estimate right So 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.40	1017.93	1021.44	A	ID	inf	-1	0	So um you know it's just a matter of working out space so i guess three 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.154	1017.87	1018.23	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.41	1021.44	1026.91	A	ID	inf	+1	1	so i guess three things um costs um complexity and the size is 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.42	1026.91	1029.76	A	ID	inf	-1	0	the size is the three things that um we'll have an impact on you to just 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.43	1029.76	1031.89	A	ID	inf	-1	0	on you to just go through the components um 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.44	1031.89	1034.86	A	ID	inf	-1	0	um these other options are available to you um 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.45	1034.86	1041.29	A	ID	inf	+1	1	to you um i'm not very sure about the voice thing "'cause" i don't know the email and it was fact quite sketchy on what the voice options are I'm it 
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	1041.23	1041.45	C	UI	bck	-1	0	Ah 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.46	1041.73	1045.63	A	ID	inf	+1	1	I'm it said it could talk to you but i never said anything about be able to this and it it 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.47	1045.63	1048.62	A	ID	inf	+1	1	this and it it said something about sensor banana curve like that so maybe 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.155	1047.99	1048.35	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Hmm 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.48	1048.62	1049.91	A	ID	fra	-1	0	so maybe if you know 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	1048.22	1048.67	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Hmm 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.49	1049.91	1052.46	A	ID	inf	-1	0	if you know i could see the other you know it's into um 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	1052.46	1058.45	A	ID	inf	-1	0	um "'cause" you go back to be fine different requirements Um or at different offerings or what component of it Okay so 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	1058.51	1061.11	A	ID	inf	+1	1	of it Okay so your basic components of buttons okay and you have are we 
ES2002c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	1058.92	1059.11	C	UI	bck	-1	0	Right 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	1061.11	1064.16	A	ID	inf	+1	1	okay and you have are we all available like um a scroll-wheel okay there's an l. c. d. 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	1060.78	1061.13	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Mm

ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	1066.64	1068.69	A	ID	inf	-1	0	Um i think these are quite standard things 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.156	1068.95	1069.76	D	ME	el.inf	-1	0	They're standard uh huh 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	1070.14	1070.44	A	ID	ass	-1	0	No um that 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	1070.44	1071.6	A	ID	fra	-1	0	No um that well 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	1071.6	1073.88	A	ID	inf	-1	0	well in a sense of these all options available for yeah it's 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	1073.88	1077.45	A	ID	off	-1	0	options available for yeah it's going to the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later okay um 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.159	1076.37	1076.68	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	1077.45	1081.15	A	ID	inf	+1	1	okay um then there's um how the case actually looks it can actually be 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	1081.15	1084.15	A	ID	inf	+1	1	it can actually be flat or it can be curved um and then 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	1084.15	1086.98	A	ID	inf	+1	1	um and then the different hats material so you can use um 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	1086.98	1089.35	A	ID	inf	+1	1	so you can use um i don't think you can use them in a combination 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	1090.69	1091.61	A	ID	stl	-1	0	Um but um i could check 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	1090.27	1090.72	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	1091.61	1093.12	A	ID	off	-1	0	um i could check that for you but i don't think you can 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	1093.12	1095.43	A	ID	inf	-1	0	but i don't think you can actually use them in a combination 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	1094.87	1097.28	B	PM	el.inf	-1	0	But you could have like plastic and rubber 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	1097.83	1100.0	A	ID	inf	+1	1	Um i think plastic or rubber would be fine but plastic with rubber 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	1100.0	1102.04	A	ID	inf	+1	1	plastic with rubber and what i was i i'm not very sure 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	1102.04	1104.72	A	ID	inf	-1	0	i was i i'm not very sure about the titanium they had 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.95	1104.19	1104.67	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Uh 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	1104.72	1107.61	A	ID	inf	-1	0	they had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium um the

ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	1107.61	1111.24	A	ID	inf	+1	1	um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use but the 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	1107.53	1107.9	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	1111.24	1116.03	A	ID	inf	+1	1	but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the things so i think that there is some 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97	1115.29	1115.62	B	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	1116.03	1119.095	A	ID	inf	-1	0	so i think that there is some restrictions on um I think you could probably 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	1119.2	1123.39	A	ID	inf	-1	0	I think you could probably go plastic or rubber together wood and titanium but

ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	1123.39	1128.28	A	ID	inf	+1	1	but you know might be easier from a cost perspective in a complexity just use one you know supposed to to

ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	1129.96	1136.17	A	ID	inf	+1	1	um any uh the components are logic chips um again i'll i'll go back to the component chips the court how 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	1136.17	1141.36	A	ID	inf	+1	1	the court how complex or how easy the logic is it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit Um and 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	1141.63	1143.58	A	ID	inf	-1	0	Um and that impacts cost um i don't 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	1143.58	1147.43	A	ID	inf	+1	1	um i don't in the logic chip has a sure but size "'cause" they should be about the same size power consumption

ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.83	1149.72	1152.54	A	ID	inf	-1	0	um i think the main impact is complexity um

ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.165	1774.99	1777.12	A	ID	el.inf	-1	0	c. d. display what what's the functionality of that 
ES2002c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.212	1776.61	1780.31	B	PM	inf	+1	2	It's points to increase the cost of uh a lot of a thought 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.169	1779.2	1781.47	A	ID	el.inf	-1	0	Yeah but the question is what are we using it will work well 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.251	1780.25	1780.99	D	ME	el.inf	-1	0	What we did a cheap 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.170	1781.47	1783.14	A	ID	el.inf	+1	2	it will work well would be achieved and putting in lights is 
ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.168	1783.14	1787.2	A	ID	inf	-1	0	putting in lights is cheaper putting an l. c. d. panel just make it go with a bit of a 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.252	1783.29	1783.861	D	ME	stl	-1	0	Well 
ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.253	1785.21	1786.8	D	ME	stl	-1	0	Else well uh when you

ES2002c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.255	1789.42	1794.76	D	ME	sug	+1	2	and that's the thing i can see it happen might be if it was somehow connected with um less things so as

ES2002c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.172	1802.2	1807.15	A	ID	ass	+1	2	I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get those things into that so um it's
