Today , functional design phase .
The functional requirements , it's uh {vocalsound} uh very important for uh the user ,
seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly . Um {disfmarker}
they want to spend money for a better system , for better remote control ,
and um they use {disfmarker} yeah , they use zap a lot ,
but um uh the relevant buttons are the power , the channel selection and the volume selection .
but uh w and not important in the audio settings , display settings
we can we can hide those under a menu or something ,
that was {gap} in the test , the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control ,
so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it .
And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition
And they want maybe an uh L_C_D_ screen
We wanna have a little preview on the remote control . Preview what's on the channel .
'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too .
Uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel ,
it just remembers the channel that you are on most , for example .
Yeah .
some technical functions .
There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear .
Uh also symbols tend to fade after a while .
And possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger
this is basically what I h had in mind in the {disfmarker} fade-proof symbols , locator , a sound ,
Yeah , it's true .
but more {disfmarker} less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons .
So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere
so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that's cheaper .
You have the the power coming in ,
The switch uh uh {vocalsound} uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a Morse code ,
then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs .
You have infrared
Uh I don't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far ,
except for uh the materials to be used uh light , that they are light .
Like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore
I don't think we should remove the button ,
But I don't think it should be {vocalsound} very {disfmarker} it should be one of the big buttons for example .
{vocalsound} This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people ,
um the younger people were defined under forty .
{disfmarker} And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable ,
which is apparently {vocalsound} black and yellow ,
With that concept I started thinking , so why not just steal Nokia's idea
and just make changeable covers for your {disfmarker}
I think this is a good idea .
I think we should lose the L_C_D_ screen ,
Y Yes , I think so too .
I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power .
What we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an L_C_D_ screen but with a preview ,
For example , a little T_V_ guide .
I'm not sure it's even possible ,
I have to check that out ,
I think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement ,
just make a button on your T_V_
we should go for that .
then uh I'd I'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not ,
because that's uh determines everything I'm gonna do .
I think it's universal . I think we should go for universal ,
Speech recognition , I think it's very hard ,
because we're selling across multiple countries .
Besides that , the technology isn't really super yet ,
but it's just not {disfmarker} I don't think the market's ripe for that yet .
you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable .
maybe a little harder plastic
If we uh make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make uh a cover for every language area .
But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves
it's not even a bad idea .
For example , if your buttons are faded , after {disfmarker} I mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover .
Uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve .
it's just just a one one piece of rubber for example ,
something I have to look into .
you have to come up with a components concept ,
you should do some trend-watching ,
I think it should be {disfmarker} have less or l very little buttons
and maybe a second {vocalsound} second level menu for the advanced things .
Or maybe just stick 'em under a menu ,
Is it techni technically possible to uh {vocalsound} send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu ,
because we're working with different types of television ,
That is true .
I don't think so .
A double-sided remote control ?
I don't think that's useful .
but you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s .
because usually the the menu is {disfmarker} the menu button is is usable between different brands . Especially the big ones , the big brands ,
if you can put some research into that , if it's possible .
I think it's possible ,
I thi I think so too .
Maybe it's a little more curves or whatever .
And uh with different colours uh .
I'll put some on paper
and present them next time uh the ideas that I have .
we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example .
I think that the {vocalsound} the buttons should be {disfmarker} the channel buttons should be {vocalsound} uh on their own .
and since you're holding it like this , I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume {disfmarker}
Think it's like this . {vocalsound}
Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle .
Yeah , in the middle .
Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it , if you {disfmarker} if it's lost , for people that are deaf .
but for example if it's lost in your armchair , we'll not see the flash .
We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you {disfmarker} that some light lights up .
We could do that .
uh the power button somewhere over here ?
I usually press it on top .
Mute .
I think it should be at the bottom somewhere .
{vocalsound} Around uh not uh not at top at the {disfmarker} around the volume selection .
Shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote ?
I'm not sure y {vocalsound} I'm not sure it's {disfmarker} if it's expensive ,
but just take a look at it ,
to have uh like sort of a {disfmarker} maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_ . Could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it .
But I think that will cost a lot .
Uh a normal wire would be better .
I'm not sure if it costs a lot ,
And do people actually want that ? To pay extra {disfmarker} they want to pay for rechargeable ?
we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it ,
we have to {disfmarker} either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station .
I think this is a brilliant product .
because if they're willing to pay more , we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers ,
Could you post some {vocalsound} other essentials of what people want ,
Where would we want the uh teletext button ?
Do we put it somewhere over here ?
Or maybe this is something for the next meeting ,
draw us up some some designs of of possible {disfmarker}
just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big ,
we don't want {gap} we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot .
because some T_V_s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus .
but that's what we stick under the menu button .
Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu .
If it isn't , then we cannot reach it .
But I think most modern T_V_s have it in their menu .
Uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ?
If you rule out functions , then uh {disfmarker} and that gets known , then people are not gonna buy it .
Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition .
Oh , we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then , with an L_C_D_ screen .
Yeah , just look at the possibilities then ,
we should do a little thing about design ,
because it looks boring really to me .
{vocalsound} Different colours maybe .
And the design , it should differ .
let's say that people would want an L_C_D_ thing .
Let's take take the basic design again , what we {disfmarker} oh , crap {disfmarker} uh came up with .
If you're reading from top to bottom , I think it's better to put it uh at the top .
How can you use an L_C_D_ screen ?
But nee the function of it . {vocalsound}
I {disfmarker} I'm not sure .
So we have three people saying it should be on top .
Do we put the volume control and the channel control here ,
In the middle .
Maybe in a circle for example , like we {disfmarker} like in this example .
but we do agree that we {vocalsound} keep this at the centre ,
I think the channel button should be in the centre .
but if we need two batteries and an L_C_D_ screen , that means a lot of space that we need .
But it has to be a little bit heavier .
Just to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space .
uh let's give this uh a name , and not like some vague serial number that no one understands , like with cars .
Yeah , let's think of a name , okay .
the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly ,
