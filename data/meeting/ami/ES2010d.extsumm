Okay . Um here's the agenda for our last meeting .
Um after the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation ,
then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote .
Then we're going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process ,
let's have the prototype presentation .
{vocalsound} The base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided ,
and it's gonna be plastic .
Um then there's the latex cover , which is what you see as red .
Um and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue , almost see-through .
The whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it {disfmarker} just that one button will light up .
Um and then at the bottom we have our logo .
And then on the side you have the buttons .
and as you've noticed on our prototype um they've ended up with a curvature kind of ,
I think you did an awesome job .
I don't really know exactly what we should uh talk about .
Feel good meaning what ?
Physically ,
Yeah , it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it .
Okay so , we're using the criteria uh for a seven point scale ,
do we feel it's very easy to use ?
Two . That's what I say .
Okay , fashionable ?
I mean like no , I think it's very fashionable .
I'll give it a two , because at the moment it's not looking that way .
Mm I don't think it's that fashionable .
does it feel good ?
And it's i it is very ergonomically designed .
Alright , average is two .
Is it technologically innovative ?
does it have voice {disfmarker} I mean the phrase recognition on it ?
We could do it with the chip , yes .
And there's no way you can represent it on here . Y
so I'd probably give it a three .
But it is just a T_V_ remote .
It's just trendy , basically .
It's capable of being squishy and fruity .
{vocalsound} So um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner ,
Okay , so now uh we're moving on to finance ,
Um it's not hand dynamo , it's powered by battery , so we give it a {disfmarker}
Do I just put quantity being one battery , or {disfmarker}
this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s ,
Oh , let's just go for a lithium .
And special colour .
We're really having just push-button interface .
button supplements {disfmarker} the buttons are no
Um they're uh they're a special form , 'cause they're indented .
Mm . Well , we're under cost then .
We've got eleven point two .
So we can go to production .
Now we're gonna talk about the project process
We think we got stifled for cri {vocalsound} creativity by the company itself , in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote , initially .
We didn't have a whiteboard .
And no internet .
Oh , overall I mean I thought we did a good job like {disfmarker}
minus it being just merely a T_V_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it .
and we've all been a pretty congenial team here , I think .
Yeah , digital pens .
{vocalsound} I really appreciated those , yeah .
The use of the laptops for receiving everything .
but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only .
I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs .
and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary ,
