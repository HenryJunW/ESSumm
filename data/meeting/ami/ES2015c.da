ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	123.94	134.61	B	ID	inf	-1	0	I've been doing some research into the different components that we could use , um what's available to us f to actually make the remote control .
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	134.61	138.79	B	ID	inf	+1	1	Um , first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made ,
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	138.79	143.27	B	ID	inf	-1	0	and what is it happens inside the casing , which is more your field .
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	143.27	151.44	B	ID	inf	+1	1	Um , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source .

ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	151.44	155.42	B	ID	inf	-1	0	Which is not necessarily a battery , as we're about to see .
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	155.42	164.73	B	ID	inf	+1	1	Um , there are several components of , um , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of .
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	164.73	169.41	B	ID	inf	+1	1	Um , including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip .
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	169.41	173.75	B	ID	inf	-1	0	Which is where all the main information is uh contained .
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	173.75	180.7	B	ID	inf	-1	0	Um , diodes , transistors , resonators , resistors , and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well .
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	180.7	183.0	B	ID	inf	-1	0	Um , and all their positioning in the circuit .
ES2015c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	181.2	181.717	A	PM	stl	-1	0	Um {disfmarker}
ES2015c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	183.29	188.19	A	PM	el.inf	+1	0	Are they all included , like mandatorily , or r are these different options ?
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	188.05	188.75	B	ID	stl	-1	0	Uh , these ,
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	188.75	190.2	B	ID	inf	-1	0	they're all different options ,
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	190.2	196.1	B	ID	inf	+1	1	they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced .
ES2015c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	192.51	193.47	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Yeah .
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	196.1	197.73	B	ID	inf	-1	0	We can go into that later .
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	197.73	201.8	B	ID	inf	-1	0	Um , all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately ,
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	201.8	208.05	B	ID	inf	-1	0	and work out the most , like , effective um circuit , including all the wires and everything like that .
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	208.05	210.79	B	ID	inf	-1	0	And the L_E_D_ of course , that's a light emitting diode .
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	210.79	211.79	B	ID	stl	-1	0	So , we could ,
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	211.79	216.56	B	ID	inf	+1	1	so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well .
ES2015c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	214.95	215.23	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Mm .
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	217.65	221.46	B	ID	inf	+1	1	Okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source .
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	221.46	223.43	B	ID	inf	+1	1	We could use a basic battery ,
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	223.43	228.4	B	ID	inf	-1	0	but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as well .
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	228.4	233.68	B	ID	inf	-1	0	And they're not so great to dispose of , environmentally .
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	233.68	240.37	B	ID	inf	+1	1	{vocalsound} There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago .
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.37	240.37	241.5	B	ID	inf	-1	0	A bit out of date .

ES2015c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	244.23	245.8	A	PM	el.inf	-1	0	What is a hand-powered dynamo ?
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	245.76	250.56	B	ID	inf	-1	0	Um , where you manually charge up the power .

ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	258.62	260.2	B	ID	inf	-1	0	It would be like going a step back in time .
ES2015c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	258.123	260.33	C	UI	bck	-1	0	{vocalsound} Yeah .
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	260.2	264.25	B	ID	inf	-1	0	I don't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology .

ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.47	264.25	275.32	B	ID	inf	+1	1	Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power .
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	275.32	281.98	B	ID	inf	-1	0	I mean , the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work .
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.49	281.98	283.88	B	ID	inf	+1	1	Um , or there's solar power ,
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.50	283.88	292.2	B	ID	ass	+1	1	which we've been considering inside a building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite so useful .

ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.51	292.2	294.42	B	ID	ass	-1	0	But , good to look into ,

ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.53	296.74	302.63	B	ID	inf	+1	1	Um , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat .
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.54	302.63	304.81	B	ID	inf	-1	0	That's got a lot to do with the ergonomics .
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.55	304.81	307.75	B	ID	inf	-1	0	Like how it's comfortable and s sits in the hand .
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.56	307.75	311.27	B	ID	ass	+1	1	We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up .

ES2015c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	799.22	805.86	C	UI	inf	-1	0	And it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data .
ES2015c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	810.61	813.45	C	UI	inf	+1	1	Um , there are two types of user interfaces .
ES2015c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	813.45	819.37	C	UI	inf	+1	1	There's the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output
ES2015c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	819.37	823.75	C	UI	inf	+1	1	and a pointing device , for example a mouse for input control .
ES2015c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	823.75	826.47	C	UI	inf	-1	0	So that's sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about .

ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.79	1300.23	1303.52	D	ME	inf	-1	0	just so you know , my method was mainly web web-based research this time around .
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	1303.52	1306.9	D	ME	inf	-1	0	I also spoke with fashion experts in Milan , New York and Paris .
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	1306.9	1311.41	D	ME	inf	-1	0	And I looked at the design reports from previous years , here at Real Remote .
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	1311.41	1314.43	D	ME	inf	-1	0	Um , just so c we can work off of them , see how fashions have changed .
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	1315.2	1319.3	D	ME	off	-1	0	Um , {vocalsound} so I'll list the three most important aspects that I've come across .
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	1319.3	1323.03	D	ME	inf	-1	0	Um , and they , they're each more important than the one that comes after it .
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	1323.03	1328.62	D	ME	inf	-1	0	Uh , the first one is that there should be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look-and-feel .
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	1328.62	1331.15	D	ME	ass	-1	0	Um , this should be our priority , as we've been saying .
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	1331.46	1336.42	D	ME	inf	-1	0	The second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative .
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	1336.42	1338.03	D	ME	inf	-1	0	So , I think we've done a lot of talking about that ,
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	1338.03	1341.93	D	ME	inf	-1	0	just with lighting and the buttons and the {disfmarker} face-plates .
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	1341.93	1344.41	D	ME	ass	-1	0	Um , so it looks like we'll be able to keep on track with that .
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	1344.41	1347.81	D	ME	inf	-1	0	And the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use .
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	1348.736	1350.09	D	ME	ass	-1	0	{vocalsound} So , pretty basic there .
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	1351.02	1360.336	D	ME	inf	+1	1	And the recent fashion update , uh , according to fashion-watchers in Paris and Milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . {vocalsound}
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	1360.73	1365.47	D	ME	inf	+1	1	Um , also , in contra uh in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy .
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	1365.47	1368.81	D	ME	inf	-1	0	Again , we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons .

ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	1371.63	1374.26	D	ME	inf	-1	0	So , my personal preferences here ,
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	1375.33	1378.89	D	ME	inf	+1	2	um of course , as {disfmarker} we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting ,
