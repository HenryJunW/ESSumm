ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.16	225.01	228.85	C	ID	inf	+1	1	Well the first thing question are stews well we tried design well 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.17	228.85	233.58	C	ID	inf	+1	1	well uh a device which basically just sends the signal to the t. v. changes say whether that 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.18	233.58	246.92	C	ID	inf	+1	1	say whether that be the power all the channel um of the volume everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the t. v. all other appliances sending a signal to a 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.19	249.03	253.18	C	ID	inf	+1	1	Um so i decided not to have a look to one of the people of designed and try and take some 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.20	253.18	257.38	C	ID	inf	+1	1	and try and take some inspiration from the mm But uh although 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.21	257.38	265.15	C	ID	inf	+1	1	But uh although i we will want to be taking I like this for the people wanna make sure that our design stands out and 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.22	265.15	270.51	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and i thought that was something that mm well it wasn't really my area because 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.23	270.51	274.9	C	ID	inf	-1	0	area because Um dealing with the inside really fair 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.24	274.9	280.55	C	ID	be.pos	-1	0	fair amount yeah i ran out of time so i can do this one is one of us have um

ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.25	280.55	288.35	C	ID	inf	+1	1	um and uh what i found out the mice that controls you use some form of infrared send signals to the t. v. presumably 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.26	288.35	295.43	C	ID	inf	+1	1	t. v. presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh same thing we can she's she's wallace and you don't need 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.27	295.43	298.52	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and you don't need sound very much information Um 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.28	298.52	302.49	C	ID	inf	+1	1	Um mice them up at by is some form battery now all 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.29	302.49	307.59	C	ID	sug	+1	1	now all one on on the show or whether we want to look at the slides issue because 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.30	307.59	311.31	C	ID	inf	+1	1	issue because my stuff out by triple a. batteries do this can be quite 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.31	311.31	312.97	C	ID	inf	+1	1	do this can be quite bulky so 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.32	312.97	321.73	C	ID	sug	+1	1	bulky so but but i didn't know if you want to look at something else um so it could shrink down so i was Of the control yeah sure 
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.9	319.15	319.7	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh that 
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.10	319.7	321.92	D	ME	el.inf	-1	0	Uh-huh that can i interject ask a question is

ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.33	321.73	322.22	C	ID	inf	-1	0	yeah sure 
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.11	321.92	323.02	D	ME	el.inf	-1	0	ask a question is that appropriate use initial play that she's 
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.12	323.02	326.75	D	ME	el.inf	+1	1	use initial play that she's a small of a cat Our surrounding it 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.34	325.58	326.17	C	ID	inf	-1	0	And then a if you if you look 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.35	326.17	330.5	C	ID	inf	+1	1	a if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls are quite a quite chunky and that's because 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.36	330.5	332.53	C	ID	inf	+1	1	and that's because of the saw as the batteries to have to

ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.37	332.53	337.69	C	ID	inf	-1	0	to have to be obviously this and size to fit those batteries and yeah the 
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.14	335.95	336.46	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Uh it replaces 
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.15	336.46	338.76	D	ME	el.inf	+1	1	it replaces a small as you can yeah right 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.38	337.69	337.95	C	ID	inf	-1	0	yeah the 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.39	337.95	338.36	C	ID	fra	-1	0	yeah the the y. u. k. you 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.4	338.55	338.75	A	UI	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.35	338.28	338.73	B	PM	inf	-1	0	Yeah 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.40	338.36	341.66	C	ID	inf	+1	1	the y. u. k. you can get these all circular round ones well i'm just 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.41	341.66	343.74	C	ID	inf	-1	0	round ones well i'm just wondering about power consumption and how 
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.16	341.57	342.56	D	ME	und	-1	0	Oh oh i see 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.42	343.74	347.54	C	ID	inf	-1	0	consumption and how much you need to send They tend to cause um and 
ES2004b.D.dialog-act.s9553330.17	345.51	345.9	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Okay 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.43	347.54	354.61	C	ID	inf	-1	0	cause um and which leads of onto the next point about them being small and easy to carry around um 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.44	354.61	357.12	C	ID	inf	+1	1	um the other ones in mind a small but 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.45	357.12	360.32	C	ID	sug	+1	1	but i've just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.46	361.198	366.72	C	ID	inf	-1	0	No the main components i came up with um well uh obviously the power source the batteries "'cause" otherwise 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.47	366.72	368.8	C	ID	inf	-1	0	the batteries "'cause" otherwise it's not a while like uh 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.48	368.8	375.11	C	ID	sug	-1	0	uh as i said about the know which batteries we're gonna to use we can uh discuss i like that and then you obviously 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.49	375.11	383.67	C	ID	inf	+1	1	and then you obviously need something to to carry to be information the you all pressing and from from the controller and 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.50	392.12	395.03	C	ID	inf	+1	1	now these have uh one strange about about five meters which is 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.51	395.03	399.15	C	ID	inf	-1	0	which is so suitable for anyone who is watching the t. v. and less than this animal 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.52	399.15	402.77	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and less than this animal Which know much people they say 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.53	402.77	407.24	C	ID	inf	-1	0	people they say as weird like the mice audience that should be fine and then now is 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.54	407.24	412.46	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and then now is that just have a quick look at the x. m. what's on but i 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.55	412.46	417.86	C	ID	inf	-1	0	on but i do unless that my stick to be Yeah interface designer 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.56	419.18	422.76	C	ID	inf	-1	0	Uh so this is what i had to us the basic idea for one at a it's 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.5	420.202	420.792	A	UI	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.57	422.76	426.32	C	ID	inf	-1	0	for one at a it's not a proper circuit i'm not sure 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.58	426.32	428.28	C	ID	ass	-1	0	i'm not sure that work or not uh not incompetent 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.59	428.28	433.07	C	ID	ass	-1	0	uh not incompetent that that is the real um we're way you two are out but anyway i've just got the 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.60	433.07	441.8	C	ID	inf	+1	1	i've just got the the power going to the infra-red bulb the chip and the uh your line interface um 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.61	443.35	453.51	C	ID	inf	+1	1	Which would basically when you when you press anything a wood to the chip which converts it into use some form of a update uh which could be dictated by the t. v. receiver which obviously 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.62	453.51	464.89	C	ID	inf	+1	1	which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to What i have a Um why the form of communication the t. v.s are already using and 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.63	464.89	468.47	C	ID	inf	-1	0	are already using and since that that's an uh these a reason to use that infrared because that's 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.64	468.47	472.4	C	ID	inf	-1	0	because that's what all t. v. season and And then finally 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.65	472.4	479.97	C	ID	inf	-1	0	And then finally um we want Uh the it to be available to a wider audience uh lower costs 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.66	479.97	485.24	C	ID	inf	+1	1	uh lower costs i will the components thought of that for tall uh it lowering costs so that that 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.67	485.24	487.72	C	ID	ass	-1	0	so that that should be good Um 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.68	487.72	495.34	C	ID	inf	+1	1	Um it should it should be different enough Um from the alternative products to get good "'cause" you base we're talking about

ES2004b.B.dialog-act.s9553330.41	612.74	613.56	B	PM	fra	-1	0	Oh yeah 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.19	614.77	620.48	A	UI	inf	+1	1	Yeah It seems some of my points my do whatever but williams just mention but basically 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.81	618.68	619.07	C	ID	ass	-1	0	Yeah 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.20	620.48	627.94	A	UI	inf	+1	1	but basically my method was like to know what about brainstorming we did in the last meeting just a couple like the points and start and everything and that and 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.21	627.94	635.04	A	UI	inf	+1	1	and everything and that and they might be some missing yeltsin this thing which i think really i would take a feedback from the marketing because 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.22	635.04	639.8	A	UI	inf	-1	0	because Um I haven't had some marketing that out and 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.23	639.8	642.56	A	UI	inf	-1	0	marketing that out and basically every product is marketable soap operas 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.24	642.56	646.63	A	UI	inf	-1	0	soap operas as anyone reason i would put it to simplify the interaction with t. v. to make make 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.25	646.63	649.19	A	UI	inf	-1	0	with t. v. to make make it as simple as possible and to summarise i i 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.26	649.19	655.7	A	UI	inf	+1	1	and to summarise i i would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use Rather than having a lot of complex wouldn't because you 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.27	655.7	659.16	A	UI	inf	+1	1	complex wouldn't because you can have an engineering do and maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.28	659.16	666.22	A	UI	inf	+1	1	and maybe having all remote control which have the main features Like volume control a challenge changing the channel or whatever 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.29	667.41	671.48	A	UI	inf	-1	0	But we have to to make it unique so that people wanna buy we went 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.30	671.48	674.62	A	UI	inf	-1	0	buy we went in this to your features to get the so what 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.31	674.62	677.5	A	UI	sug	+1	1	so what though concept is to have a flipped a part of the main functions 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.32	677.5	682.15	A	UI	sug	+1	1	of the main functions such as which are like often used maybe on the top And the complex functions 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.33	682.15	693.51	A	UI	sug	+1	1	And the complex functions which so you you can say like the young generation not trendy generation one or c. programme your favourite channels uh what what can we put in the middle part of the flip flip top so 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.34	693.51	699.02	A	UI	inf	-1	0	so it's like it could be x. is by you wider range of four audience and we can punch in new 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.35	699.02	703.48	A	UI	sug	+1	1	and we can punch in new for the features such as uh i did features that you shop of more t. and maybe 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.36	703.48	706.54	A	UI	sug	-1	0	and maybe are designed to appeal to our people 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.37	708.26	712.34	A	UI	inf	-1	0	Findings most people prefer use the user friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.38	712.34	721.08	A	UI	inf	+1	1	because there are times like well people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they're not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's know of no use 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.39	721.08	728.14	A	UI	inf	-1	0	so it's know of no use a punching into trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user As you saw we we have to 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.40	728.14	730.59	A	UI	inf	-1	0	As you saw we we have to make a profit also so we we 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.41	730.59	734.33	A	UI	sug	+1	1	so we we can maybe go for any commas all of a higher production and make fifty 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.42	734.33	736.49	A	UI	el.inf	-1	0	and make fifty million we said yeah with 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.43	736.49	736.91	A	UI	ass	-1	0	yeah with 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.82	736.03	736.36	C	ID	inf	-1	0	Yeah 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.44	736.91	739.92	A	UI	inf	-1	0	yeah with that i think we'll be able to achieve economics of scale so so 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.45	739.92	743.78	A	UI	inf	+1	1	of scale so so you can giving adding more features and make it less costly 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.46	745.44	748.81	A	UI	fra	-1	0	Um That's so this is if 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.47	748.81	756.15	A	UI	inf	+1	1	so this is if you ask me personally i would make though The top of the trendy uh uh design and it's maybe 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.48	756.15	761.81	A	UI	sug	+1	1	and it's maybe we we should look at all so like the buttons but uh whether they liked soft a little hard because 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.49	761.81	767.62	A	UI	inf	+1	1	a little hard because there are times the buttons tend to be a bit hard of the uh continues you use a general so you know what 
ES2004b.C.dialog-act.s9553330.83	762.29	762.86	C	ID	ass	-1	0	Yeah 
ES2004b.A.dialog-act.s9553330.50	767.62	771.76	A	UI	inf	-1	0	so you know what a simple uh no User friendly design
