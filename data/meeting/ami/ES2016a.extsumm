Uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote .
Uh I'm Nick Debusk ,
I'm the Project Manager .
Uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is um .
{vocalsound} I am Corinne Whiting
and I will be the Marketing Expert
In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification ,
In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching
And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation
, I'm Ryan .
Um I'm the User Interface Designer .
Um likewise I've three different roles for each stage of design .
Um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control .
Um in the concept design , the user interface ,
And the detailed design um {vocalsound} sort of like the user interface design ,
{vocalsound} I'm Manuel
and I'm the Industrial Designer in in this project um .
In the functional design phase I'm {disfmarker} I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements ,
um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on .
Um um in the conceptual design um I'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product .
And uh the detailed design {disfmarker} in the detailed design I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself ,
our our agenda is the opening , uh acquaintance which we've kinda done . Uh tool training , project plan discussion and then closing .
we are putting together a new remote control .
Um we want it to be something original .
Um of course we're a {disfmarker} not only a electronics company but a
fashion um conscious electronics company ,
so we want it to be trendy um
and we want it to be easy to use .
{vocalsound} Um we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design
let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have ,
and then we can go into how we're gonna design it
function of remote control is just just {disfmarker}
change channels is its main function .
we want it to be um a T_V_ remote or {disfmarker}
I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ?
I suppose you c try make it a universal remote
But , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming .
I think they all work on the same prin principle as well
Um one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em .
So if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily , I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature .
So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh
like a tracking device
you could whistle
or make a noise
and it'd beep .
there's a button on the T_V_ that you press
Generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance .
so they're kinda like long and rectangular .
Do we want something crazy ?
we want something new that's gonna stand out .
Maybe sorta spherical or something . A ball .
Maybe like user-friendly ,
where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing .
I thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another {disfmarker}
and maybe the actual controls are inside or something .
you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time ,
so there are always the {disfmarker} some restrictions
Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be ,
How sturdy is it gonna be ?
we want it to to hold up to somebody's child , you know , throwing it across the room
so ball-shaped , uh you know , if it were ball-shaped maybe ,
It could be cased on the outside
and t everything could be inside .
we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy ,
It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros
goals for profits are I think somewhere around uh fifty million Euros , what they wanna make on it , so .
Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association ,
maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal .
marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing {vocalsound} remote control out there .
And maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences ,
Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ?
We want it to be a b a ball ,
I could draw sorta the ball idea .
this is where it's connected together ,
and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone ,
Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it .
I think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons ,
so maybe as simple as possible ,
um as few buttons inside as possible .
if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it .
um {disfmarker} the ball is a nice idea
because of it's stability really ,
so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere ,
Also also you risk the hinges here . That's that's um a problem .
but that's of course a weak point , yeah .
I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ?
The shape is perhaps not the most ideal .
there must be a compromise between um stability and design here , so .
I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote ,
it's not innovative ,
everybody does long remote
My idea was just to have it be kind of like a
keyboard type shape , you know , like video games
We could also try to do the hinge thing ,
so it could like flip out that way .
I mean maybe design something , that's sort of like {vocalsound}
but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier .
Because even {disfmarker} I suppose even with the ball
it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah .
So perhaps the the joystick {disfmarker} the the keyboard idea might work better .
I think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job .
if it's small it probably looks better ,
may not be th as functional .
say we went with the ball the ball function
um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um
to make it easier to hold on to .
But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways .
And then we have the problem with the hinge .
The question is also , I dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ?
so then we forget the ball .
So we've got our sort of keyboard kind .
Question is what makes those game pads functional ?
I think that's pretty much the form for full hand .
So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy ,
Except for that I think we'll not {disfmarker} probably not get a get away from some longer design .
and {disfmarker} Batteries go weak as well ,
Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ?
So that either way you're pointing it it would work .
O of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so .
but um it's rather about an instinctual thing ,
Otherwise the design of {disfmarker} or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work .
just to finish up ,
should we s go with this plan ,
it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , I think .
And then marketing will look and see what uh what people want .
And Project Manager will design a better meeting for next {vocalsound} time around ,
