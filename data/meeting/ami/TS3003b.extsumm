Uh now we're going um into the functional design .
Then our agenda .
first the opening .
Uh this time I will take the minutes .
Uh you're going to have a presentation . All of you .
Um and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations .
So uh I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation ,
and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements
And then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include .
My name is Freek Van Ponnen .
I'm the Market Expert .
We have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab
where we observed um users operating remote controls .
Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire .
Uh in addition we did some market research . Uh see what the market consists of . What ages are involved .
these are three quite astonishing results , I thought .
uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly .
Um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control .
Um in addition remotes were not very functional .
Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control .
And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room .
Then we did some research to the most relevant functions .
Channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy .
The power button got a nine .
And teletext got a six and a half .
Then there are some one-time use function .
That uh audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons .
Which are not really used very frequently ,
but are still considered to be of some importance .
Um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . One hundred and sixty eight times per hour .
Um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six .
the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market .
They are not really very interested in features .
But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier .
What I think this indicates for our um design . I think we should make a remote for the future .
And this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five .
Um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design .
Um {disfmarker} The results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused R_S_ R_S_I_ .
And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control .
I think we should make very few buttons .
Uh I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . Especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons .
But it might be a good idea to make a docking station .
And this would , could get a button in it
which would send a signal to the remote
which would then beep .
So you'd know where it is in the room .
And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in .
Then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred .
This was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five .
This would also greatly increase the production costs
but I think these are just some small factors we could consider .
I've been looking at uh the user interface of it . Um f for the techno f functions uh of of it . Um {disfmarker}
I think uh we uh must use the general functions uh of the uh remote control .
Uh uh I've do I've uh done a little uh research on the internet
and {gap} not much information about it , {gap} {disfmarker} Um about uh interface
I I've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control .
Uh so uh you've got a lot of devi uh devices like uh D_V_D_ uh uh television , uh stereo .
But uh it must be uh user-friendly .
you c you can't put a a lot of uh functions uh in one uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Uh uh uh {disfmarker} Yeah . In one um remote control .
you can see , this is uh quite simple uh remote control .
but uh {disfmarker} This uh re uh remote control got a a lot of uh buttons .
what uh I was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are .
like uh the on-off uh button . Uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button .
My personal uh preferences um .
Use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device .
And um here you've got a s kind of a display .
It's a touchscreen .
you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a D_V_D_ player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh {gap} .
And um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device .
you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device .
We better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh
Everybody uh have to use it so {disfmarker} Uh ol even even old people um young people .
we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large .
I think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros .
N I I don't think so .
Uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen . S um it's uh not uh in colour or something .
it would certainly make a fancy design .
But the {disfmarker} It wouldn't be very robust .
I've got a presentation about the working design .
Um first about how it works .
Everybody knows how a remote works .
The user presses a button .
The remote determines what button it is ,
uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_ .
The T_V_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is .
we've got um the the plate .
It gots conductive disks for every button .
When the user presses a button , a signal got sent ,
goes to the LED
and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_ .
this is a schematic overview .
You've got the buttons .
The power source .
And uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip .
I think we should use default materials , simple plastics .
Keep the inner workings simple ,
Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface ,
and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product .
it's , in my idea , it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself .
so I'm here to mess things up
and uh tell you some new uh requirements .
we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_ .
Um that's because {vocalsound} uh it will be too complex
and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it uh for more functions .
Uh another point is we have to skip the teletext ,
because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past .
Another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus . Uh that's the the market we have to to to target ,
because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers .
And we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product .
So it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works .
I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions .
{vocalsound} Uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product . Um {disfmarker}
'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature
But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access
within the next like twenty years is very slim .
In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control .
So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it .
Besides that , I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small .
But I mean if I s if I see this , it's {disfmarker} I think we're just gonna go for another
Standard remote .
I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons
Uh if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons . Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach
if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now .
But don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market , that people think {gap} {disfmarker} the people think that's the the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it .
I think that if we're {disfmarker} If we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um {disfmarker} I don't know if you've heard about it in the news , the the elderly mobile phone ?
if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , I think .
We don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality .
Uh I think teletext can be uh
um can be a function as well . But only if uh if it won't higher the the cost ,
But um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles .
I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext .
Is anybody um really against teletext ?
I think that's a good idea as well , especially for the subtitles .
I think uh that's very important we have a few buttons .
So we can s we can skip the display ,
But do you need the buttons for one to zero .
Think if you're gonna include teletext you do .
maybe we can implement the scroll button ?
Or a joystick like ?
Just look if you look at telephones . The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or {disfmarker}
but um I don't think there are many T_V_s that can switch channels that fast .
And so you would need like the T_V_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it .
If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt .
So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout .
But I don't think {disfmarker} I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_ , you there's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible .
I think it's very important in the in the design .
You can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places .
you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station .
I think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons
But I don't think we should spend very much time in that .
Do you think the docking station will uh is allowed in the budget we have ?
And if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible
we're just gonna focus on the extras ?
I think so .
fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost .
So maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something .
Like with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound .
you have it's on some phones too ,
which have a docking station .
And you just press a button
and the phone goes ringing .
{gap} Uh another
point is the L_C_D_ screen .
Um I don't know if that will rise the cost too much ,
um I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen ,
I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn ,
and we're focusing on elderly people here
which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices ,
it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it ,
which would explain a button if you press it .
And it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen ,
Just the L_C_D_ .
That's a good idea .
Few buttons , we talked about that . Docking station , L_C_D_ . Um general functions {disfmarker}
And default materials . I think that's a good idea as well ,
Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe .
If we want um a {gap} with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people , we can
target the real elderly people .
If we're able to really bring an innovative product .
{gap} Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example .
But I'd have to look into that a little more .
And with uh the little screen in it , {gap} which explains the buttons . You could {disfmarker} I think we n it would be a lot easier to
adapt it to different cultures .
In different languages , you know .
{vocalsound} Um what we're going to do for the next meeting is the Industrial Designer will do the components concept ,
User Interface Designer the user interface concept ,
and the trend-watching .
