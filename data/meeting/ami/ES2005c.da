ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.5	89.49	91.48	B	ME	sug	-1	0	So we have to look on this .
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	92.92	94.67	B	ME	inf	-1	0	First of all methodology .
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	94.67	101.4	B	ME	fra	-1	0	The met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	101.4	108.88	B	ME	inf	+1	1	We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market ,
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.9	108.88	113.39	B	ME	inf	-1	0	because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit .
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.10	115.25	117.58	B	ME	inf	-1	0	So what are our findings ?
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	117.58	117.98	B	ME	stl	-1	0	In our {vocalsound}
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	117.98	121.26	B	ME	stl	-1	0	uh in our findings we have seen that {disfmarker}
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	121.26	134.49	B	ME	inf	+1	1	when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good ,
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	134.49	138.23	B	ME	inf	+1	1	rather than having a functional look and feel uh good .
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	138.23	144.46	B	ME	inf	-1	0	So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls .
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	144.46	146.45	B	ME	stl	-1	0	So we should take into uh
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	146.45	149.95	B	ME	sug	-1	0	we should consider this factor as the most important factor ,
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	149.95	153.18	B	ME	inf	-1	0	because this factor is twice as important ,
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	153.18	158.91	B	ME	inf	-1	0	the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor .
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	158.91	169.13	B	ME	inf	-1	0	So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take {disfmarker} in designing our rem uh remote controls .

ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.51	409.33	410.93	D	UI	ass	-1	0	Okay . Um
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	412.02	416.01	D	UI	inf	+1	1	okay , so the interface concept um .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	417.74	420.64	D	UI	inf	-1	0	Yeah . The interface specification ,
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	420.64	422.27	D	UI	stl	-1	0	what people {disfmarker}
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.55	422.27	425.85	D	UI	inf	-1	0	um how they interact with it basically , I think .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.56	425.85	429.44	D	UI	inf	+1	1	Um so the method , we looked at existing designs ,
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.57	429.44	430.05	D	UI	stl	-1	0	what are the {disfmarker}

ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.59	432.65	434.26	D	UI	inf	-1	0	um I looked at their flaws ,
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.60	434.26	436.31	D	UI	sug	-1	0	so we're going to look at their flaws , everything .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	436.31	442.9	D	UI	inf	-1	0	Um and what {vocalsound} the survey told us and what we think would be good ,
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	442.9	445.48	D	UI	inf	-1	0	so a bit of imagination .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	444.62	445.06	C	PM	bck	-1	0	Mm 'kay .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.63	445.48	449.43	D	UI	inf	-1	0	{vocalsound} Uh the findings , I've got some pictures to show you as well .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	446.2	450.752	C	PM	be.pos	-1	0	{vocalsound} {gap} either . {vocalsound}

ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.79	449.78	449.96	B	ME	bck	-1	0	Hmm .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.64	449.43	449.96	D	UI	ass	-1	0	{vocalsound} Yeah .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	450.928	453.5	D	UI	inf	+1	1	{vocalsound} Okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface ,
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	453.5	462.87	D	UI	inf	-1	0	where you um have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	462.03	462.51	C	PM	bck	-1	0	Uh okay .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	462.87	467.64	D	UI	inf	+1	1	Um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	467.64	470.07	D	UI	inf	-1	0	So I think for our remote control {disfmarker}
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	470.07	473.58	D	UI	inf	-1	0	There is some inconsistency already in {disfmarker} ec existing in {disfmarker} between remote controls ,
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	473.58	480.97	D	UI	inf	+1	1	but I think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	480.97	483.41	D	UI	inf	-1	0	like the the top right for on and off or something ,
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	483.73	484.84	C	PM	ass	-1	0	Right , okay . Yeah .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	483.41	486.21	D	UI	inf	-1	0	I think , people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	487.567	488.544	C	PM	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.73	487.43	491.78	D	UI	off	+1	1	And we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you .

ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.74	491.78	495.013	D	UI	el.inf	-1	0	Do I press Escape F_ five ? Or just {disfmarker}
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	494.1	495.01	C	PM	inf	-1	0	Uh no just escape
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	495.87	497.197	C	PM	fra	-1	0	should uh {disfmarker}
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.75	495.8	496.62	D	UI	ass	-1	0	Escape , okay .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.76	497.8	501.35	D	UI	inf	-1	0	Um , oh I still haven't got my glasses on .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.77	501.35	502.46	D	UI	ass	-1	0	Yeah , okay .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.78	502.46	508.08	D	UI	inf	-1	0	So these are the {disfmarker} some of the pictures of existing ones .

ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.80	509.83	513.59	D	UI	inf	-1	0	This one is a voice recognition .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	513.71	513.93	C	PM	bck	-1	0	'Kay .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	513.59	516.78	D	UI	inf	-1	0	And that's the kind of idea we're going for .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	515.4	516.76	C	PM	ass	-1	0	Looks pretty complicated .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	516.78	518.83	D	UI	inf	+1	1	There's um an L_C_D_ thing ,
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	518.83	520.78	D	UI	stl	-1	0	which we thought could {disfmarker}
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	520.78	526.22	D	UI	ass	+1	1	I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	524.76	525.35	C	PM	bck	-1	0	Right , okay .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	526.22	531.26	D	UI	inf	+1	1	This one is {disfmarker} got a kind of scroll like a mouse ,
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.40	530.55	532.32	C	PM	ass	-1	0	Mm-hmm , like the middle button .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	531.26	532.62	D	UI	fra	-1	0	which {disfmarker}
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	532.62	533.98	D	UI	ass	-1	0	Yeah .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.41	533.4	533.73	C	PM	ass	-1	0	Okay .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	533.98	538.03	D	UI	inf	+1	1	Um and {disfmarker} But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that ,
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	534.976	537.824	A	ID	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	538.45	539.85	C	PM	inf	-1	0	Ah it's kinda like scrolling {disfmarker}
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	538.03	540.304	D	UI	fra	-1	0	like would the computer come {disfmarker}
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	539.85	541.39	C	PM	stl	-1	0	uh right , well ,
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	541.39	544.51	C	PM	inf	-1	0	if I s if I'm thinking of the right one , I've got the same thing in front of my monitor ,
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	544.51	552.46	C	PM	inf	-1	0	you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um {vocalsound} menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	550.47	552.39	D	UI	inf	-1	0	Uh-huh , that's like the L_C_D_ one ,
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	552.46	553.14	C	PM	ass	-1	0	Right , okay .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	552.39	553.17	D	UI	el.inf	-1	0	is it ?
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	553.17	557.1	D	UI	inf	+1	1	But the one below that has got like {vocalsound} a little scroll function on the side .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	557.1	560.79	D	UI	inf	+1	1	But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen .
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	561.746	562.6	B	ME	bck	-1	0	{vocalsound} Yeah .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	561.32	562.62	C	PM	ass	-1	0	Yeah , presumably .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	561.96	563.48	D	UI	inf	-1	0	I think that's what that is .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	563.48	564.99	D	UI	inf	-1	0	So these are just a few ideas .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	564.99	567.27	D	UI	ass	+1	1	Again that's just quite boring shape , grey ,
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	567.27	570.38	D	UI	ass	+1	1	looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one .
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	569.9	570.86	A	ID	ass	-1	0	Uh it looks threatening .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	569.72	575.07	C	PM	ass	-1	0	Yeah , looks like uh looks like something out of a jet . {vocalsound}
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	571.48	573.97	D	UI	ass	+1	0	Yeah , it does look kind of dangerous .
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.16	573.232	574.73	A	ID	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound} It looks like
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	574.73	575.19	A	ID	bck	-1	0	yeah {gap} .
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.81	574.63	574.83	B	ME	bck	-1	0	Hmm .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	574.63	576.55	D	UI	ass	+1	1	Um this one I thought was really cool .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	576.55	579.62	D	UI	inf	+1	1	It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about .
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	580.048	581.408	A	ID	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	579.62	581.03	D	UI	inf	-1	0	You can put it in there ,
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	581.03	581.8	D	UI	inf	-1	0	it's for your kids ,
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	581.8	584.67	D	UI	inf	+1	1	and it's quite an organic shape
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	584.67	587.43	D	UI	ass	-1	0	and the little circle around there is pretty cool .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	587.12	587.52	C	PM	bck	-1	0	Okay .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	587.43	589.78	D	UI	inf	-1	0	And that's really easy to use , bright ,
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	589.78	592.78	D	UI	ass	-1	0	so I like this one lot for our design .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	592.78	595.18	D	UI	ass	-1	0	I think something like that would be good .
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.19	594.84	595.14	A	ID	bck	-1	0	Wow .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	594.89	608.22	C	PM	ass	+1	1	Yeah , I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um {vocalsound} , I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.108	595.18	596.353	D	UI	ass	-1	0	Of course yellow . {vocalsound}
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	608.22	610.99	C	PM	sug	+1	1	So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	608.0	608.51	D	UI	ass	-1	0	Right , yeah .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	610.12	612.58	D	UI	ass	-1	0	Yeah , that's true . Yeah .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	612.58	618.57	D	UI	sug	-1	0	Um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the T_V_ or something .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	618.57	620.94	D	UI	inf	+1	1	And this one , the over-sized one ,
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.113	620.94	624.04	D	UI	ass	+1	1	I don't know about you , but I think it's a bit too gimmicky .

ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	625.73	630.336	C	PM	el.inf	-1	0	I mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something , is it ? {vocalsound}
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.116	629.029	630.81	D	UI	inf	-1	0	{vocalsound} I guess so .

ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.118	631.91	633.176	D	UI	fra	-1	0	I think that's a bit {disfmarker}

ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.121	638.72	643.12	D	UI	stl	-1	0	And um this one {vocalsound} is just pointing out .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.122	643.12	647.75	D	UI	ass	+1	1	I like {vocalsound} some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything ,
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.123	647.75	654.92	D	UI	inf	-1	0	but {gap} pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.57	654.37	655.41	C	PM	bck	-1	0	Right , okay .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.124	654.92	655.62	D	UI	stl	-1	0	So that could {disfmarker}
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.125	655.62	657.31	D	UI	inf	-1	0	that's a bit confusing .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	657.31	660.72	D	UI	stl	-1	0	Um but the buttons on this I think are {disfmarker}
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.127	660.72	665.23	D	UI	inf	-1	0	it's just showing you how you can have different different um buttons .

ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.50	953.33	955.37	A	ID	stl	-1	0	Right . So ,
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.51	955.37	961.8	A	ID	sug	+1	1	the way I'm gonna do this {vocalsound} is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work ,
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.52	961.8	967.71	A	ID	sug	-1	0	uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it ,

ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	967.71	971.04	A	ID	sug	+1	1	and then we'll throw in our new innovations um {vocalsound}
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	971.04	972.01	A	ID	sug	-1	0	and keep it all within budget .

ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	973.91	979.43	A	ID	inf	-1	0	So uh yeah , looking inside a a very simple remote control .
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	979.43	981.31	A	ID	inf	-1	0	Um this is what they sent me .
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	982.4	984.9	A	ID	inf	-1	0	'Kay . Here's uh the competition , I suppose .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.102	985.232	986.653	C	PM	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	986.0	989.35	A	ID	inf	+1	2	Um you open it up , there's a circuit board inside ,
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	988.72	989.06	C	PM	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	989.35	991.13	A	ID	stl	-1	0	um {vocalsound}
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	991.13	993.61	A	ID	inf	+1	2	and there's a a chip , a processor ,
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	993.61	998.76	A	ID	inf	+1	2	the T_A_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons ,
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.63	998.76	999.01	A	ID	fra	-1	0	and ch
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	998.74	1001.23	C	PM	el.inf	-1	0	So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ?
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	1001.41	1001.72	A	ID	inf	-1	0	Right ,
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	1001.72	1002.14	A	ID	stl	-1	0	it's very {disfmarker}
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	1002.14	1003.0	A	ID	inf	-1	0	they're very cheap remote .
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.67	1003.0	1005.63	A	ID	inf	-1	0	This remote costs nothing , you know .
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	1005.63	1015.62	A	ID	inf	+1	1	Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier ,
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	1015.62	1020.82	A	ID	inf	+1	1	which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps ,
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	1020.82	1025.5	A	ID	inf	+1	1	and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light ,
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.71	1025.5	1029.47	A	ID	inf	-1	0	which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end ,

ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.72	1029.47	1034.59	A	ID	inf	-1	0	and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.105	1029.19	1029.44	C	PM	bck	-1	0	Right .
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.73	1034.59	1035.07	A	ID	inf	-1	0	Oh here it is .
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.74	1036.017	1040.9	A	ID	inf	-1	0	{vocalsound} Um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control ,
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.75	1040.9	1042.8	A	ID	fra	-1	0	because it it defines the uh {disfmarker}
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.106	1040.98	1042.46	C	PM	ass	-1	0	Okay .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.107	1042.46	1046.34	C	PM	el.inf	-1	0	So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ?
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.76	1045.79	1054.31	A	ID	inf	-1	0	R Um no , I mean this is a very old one , so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.108	1050.87	1051.328	C	PM	fra	-1	0	They gotta be {disfmarker}

ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.78	1055.59	1057.88	A	ID	inf	-1	0	So this is what we need to have for certain .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.110	1058.4	1060.12	C	PM	bck	-1	0	{vocalsound} Okay .
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.79	1059.03	1062.5	A	ID	inf	+1	1	Um . So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing ,
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.80	1062.5	1065.24	A	ID	sug	+1	1	which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be ,
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	1065.24	1070.25	A	ID	inf	-1	0	um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up ,

ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.84	1077.73	1082.9	A	ID	inf	+1	1	Um so for the casing , uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team
