TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.213	653.98	654.674	A	PM	fra	-1	0	yellow so 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.214	656.29	658.76	A	PM	inf	-1	0	It's a so we have to decide on 
TS3012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	660.04	664.21	C	ID	sug	-1	0	I'd say you lose the curve and the colour and 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.215	662.88	664.82	A	PM	und	+1	1	So you lose the curve oh that's true we could 
TS3012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	664.21	664.769	C	ID	fra	-1	0	and 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.216	664.82	665.43	A	PM	fra	-1	0	oh that's true we could lose it yeah i forgot 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.218	665.73	666.26	A	PM	inf	-1	0	lose it yeah i forgot that's right 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.219	665.43	665.73	A	PM	stl	-1	0	lose it yeah i forgot 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.217	666.26	667.71	A	PM	be.pos	-1	0	that's right Uh the curve 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.220	667.71	668.63	A	PM	oth	-1	0	Uh the curve so um 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.221	668.63	670.82	A	PM	stl	-1	0	so um That's 
TS3012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	668.95	670.08	B	UI	el.inf	-1	0	So which curve is that they that's basically 
TS3012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	670.08	670.37	B	UI	fra	-1	0	they that's basically 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.222	670.82	673.26	A	PM	inf	-1	0	That's just just one just to this is the banana curve 
TS3012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.54	670.37	671.74	B	UI	inf	-1	0	they that's basically that for 
TS3012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	673.11	673.49	C	ID	bck	-1	0	Hmm 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.223	675.08	676.85	A	PM	sug	-1	0	So this would just that would be straight 
TS3012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.55	675.24	677.17	B	UI	inf	-1	0	So we could you still have become for it 
TS3012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	674.84	675.72	D	ME	ass	-1	0	Yeah that's right 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.224	678.48	679.22	A	PM	ass	-1	0	No i've not that would be a 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.225	679.22	682.26	A	PM	inf	-1	0	that would be a curve inside thing i guess that would i would 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.226	682.26	682.46	A	PM	ass	-1	0	that would i would 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.227	682.46	686.56	A	PM	inf	-1	0	that would i would just be straight remote just like Like that 
TS3012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	686.38	686.6	C	ID	bck	-1	0	Hmm 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.228	689.77	694.78	A	PM	inf	+1	0	Which would Yeah three something for more leery we could 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.229	694.78	695.85	A	PM	sug	-1	0	leery we could make it yellow than that 
TS3012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	695.21	696.96	B	UI	ass	+1	0	I second that 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.230	695.85	696.164	A	PM	fra	-1	0	make it yellow than that 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.231	697.91	699.76	A	PM	und	-1	0	The second that you second we lose the curve 
TS3012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.57	698.058	700.98	B	UI	ass	-1	0	No that 
TS3012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.58	700.98	705.01	B	UI	inf	-1	0	No that it would turn out to be a pretty straight forward remote control so but it's not 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.232	704.91	705.54	A	PM	und	-1	0	Okay yeah 
TS3012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	705.01	708.455	B	UI	fra	-1	0	but it's not really that 
TS3012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	705.24	706.48	D	ME	ass	-1	0	Yeah yeah 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.233	706.75	709.53	A	PM	ass	-1	0	So i think it would be a good idea to keep the curve to separate 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.234	709.53	714.43	A	PM	inf	-1	0	to separate from the rest of the remote control world so to speak so we keep the curve 
TS3012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	711.88	712.16	C	ID	bck	-1	0	Mm 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.235	714.43	715.38	A	PM	inf	+1	0	so we keep the curve 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.236	717.86	723.69	A	PM	el.sug	-1	0	So the l. a. l. a. solution is either to use that you lose the yellow or lose the rubber and i'm in 
TS3012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	717.88	718.495	B	UI	fra	-1	0	I would 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.237	723.69	725.12	A	PM	sug	+1	0	and i'm in favour of keeping the rubber because as a more 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.238	725.12	729.69	A	PM	inf	+1	0	because as a more more advantages but then the colour yellow hats 
TS3012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	726.432	726.79	C	ID	bck	-1	0	Mm 
TS3012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	728.35	728.71	C	ID	ass	-1	0	I agree 
TS3012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	729.32	733.29	B	UI	ass	+1	1	Yeah i would say i would agree with you on the colour because that's an 
TS3012d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	730.32	730.53	C	ID	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3012d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	730.49	730.68	D	ME	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
TS3012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	733.29	738.71	B	UI	inf	-1	0	because that's an extra option next to serve as we can deliver for a little bit more money so 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.239	736.97	737.28	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.240	739.15	739.66	A	PM	stl	-1	0	Yeah and i guess 
TS3012d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	738.71	740.82	B	UI	inf	-1	0	so we can always do that 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.241	739.66	741.34	A	PM	inf	-1	0	Yeah and i guess people are willing to pay for that so i think we can take 
TS3012d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.242	741.34	747.27	A	PM	sug	-1	0	for that so i think we can take that option just with the with the idea the back of a hat that you can customise remote control so i
