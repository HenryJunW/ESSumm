ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.11	118.45	119.81	B	ID	oth	-1	0	It's it's "'kay" 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.12	122.69	123.94	B	ID	stl	-1	0	Okay 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.13	123.94	134.61	B	ID	inf	-1	0	been doing some research into the different components that we could use um what's available to us to to actually make the remote control Um test 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.14	134.61	138.79	B	ID	inf	+1	1	Um test will have to look at how the remote control is actually made and what 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.15	138.79	143.27	B	ID	inf	-1	0	is actually made and what happens inside the casing because wall you'll feel um does 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.16	143.27	151.44	B	ID	inf	+1	1	um does main internal feature uh it is a circuit board which contains all the uh that at it on x. and also the contacts with that power source is not

ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.17	151.44	155.42	B	ID	inf	-1	0	source is not necessarily a battery is about to see Um there 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.18	155.42	164.73	B	ID	inf	+1	1	Um there are several components of um the circuit board that we need to consider when i will be getting them from what they'll be made of um 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.19	164.73	169.41	B	ID	inf	+1	1	made of um including the integrated circuit which is also known as the chip which is where 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.20	169.41	173.75	B	ID	inf	-1	0	which is where all the main inspiration is that contains um 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.21	173.75	180.7	B	ID	inf	-1	0	um but diodes transistors resonators resistors and passes it could pass it is all need to be considered as well um 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.22	180.7	183.0	B	ID	inf	-1	0	well um and all that positioning in the circuit 
ES2015c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.12	181.2	181.717	A	PM	stl	-1	0	Um 
ES2015c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.13	183.29	188.19	A	PM	el.inf	+1	0	Uh they'll include good like ten to to earlier there are these different options 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.23	188.05	188.75	B	ID	stl	-1	0	is that they're 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.24	188.75	190.2	B	ID	inf	-1	0	is that they're all different options are all separate 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.25	190.2	196.1	B	ID	inf	+1	1	are all separate apart from the chip which will probably decide whether we buy a simple regular advanced we can do is that later 
ES2015c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.14	192.51	193.47	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.26	196.1	197.73	B	ID	inf	-1	0	we can do is that later um 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.27	197.73	201.8	B	ID	inf	-1	0	um all the other thing is the individual components so we'd have to get it in separately i like 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.28	201.8	208.05	B	ID	inf	-1	0	i like out the most like effective um circuit i'm thinking of a why is and things like that and that at e. d. of 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.29	208.05	210.79	B	ID	inf	-1	0	and that at e. d. of course that's the light emitting diode so we 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.30	210.79	211.79	B	ID	stl	-1	0	diode so we could so we've 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.31	211.79	216.56	B	ID	inf	+1	1	could so we've got like flexibility with liz and things that are that's all 
ES2015c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	214.95	215.23	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Mm 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.32	217.65	221.46	B	ID	inf	+1	1	Okay there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source we could use 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.33	221.46	223.43	B	ID	inf	+1	1	we could use the basic battery but that brings 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.34	223.43	228.4	B	ID	inf	-1	0	but that brings it thing we need to be recharged and the bulk the size of it as well and then 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.35	228.4	233.68	B	ID	inf	-1	0	well and then not so great to dispose of environment b. i. There's 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.36	233.68	240.37	B	ID	inf	+1	1	There's the high and how it dynamo which is the sort of thing that was used to to which is fifty years ago the ousted

ES2015c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.17	244.23	245.8	A	PM	el.inf	-1	0	What is the hand power dynamo 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.39	245.76	250.56	B	ID	inf	-1	0	Um where you manually charge it up the power like you 
ES2015c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.18	250.93	252.33	A	PM	el.inf	-1	0	Just every every once in a while 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.40	250.56	252.85	B	ID	inf	-1	0	like you wind up something sorry

ES2015c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.20	255.83	256.15	A	PM	ass	-1	0	Right it be kind of strange 
ES2015c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.21	256.15	259.85	A	PM	ass	-1	0	it be kind of strange to we speak rating are they 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.42	255.73	256.814	B	ID	fra	-1	0	i think but it's 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.44	258.28	258.62	B	ID	ass	-1	0	Yeah but like 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.45	258.62	260.2	B	ID	inf	-1	0	Yeah but like i guess that back in time i don't think you would really 
ES2015c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.2	258.123	260.33	C	UI	bck	-1	0	Yeah 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.46	260.2	264.25	B	ID	inf	-1	0	i don't think you would really be with kind of cutting edge technology wise kinetic

ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.48	275.32	281.98	B	ID	inf	-1	0	i mean the kinetic energy is transformed into a power to make a circuit what um

ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.90	421.26	425.89	B	ID	inf	+1	1	um also got be integrated push button which is what we made for you it's very 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.91	425.89	427.28	B	ID	inf	-1	0	we made for you it's very straightforward to be come 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	427.28	431.71	B	ID	inf	-1	0	be come in like incorporate that with the scroll button as well to the to 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	431.71	433.91	B	ID	inf	-1	0	to the to the seasons like that and 
ES2015c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.94	433.91	435.38	B	ID	inf	-1	0	like that and this so i'm just saying for links into the different

ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.81	1306.9	1311.41	D	ME	inf	-1	0	and i looked at the design reports from previous years here real remote and just so can 
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	1311.41	1314.43	D	ME	inf	-1	0	and just so can we can work off of them see how fashion to change 
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	1315.2	1319.3	D	ME	off	-1	0	Um so i'll this is three most important aspect that come across um and 
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	1319.3	1323.03	D	ME	inf	-1	0	um and they they reach more port and then the one that comes after it at the first one is 
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	1323.03	1328.62	D	ME	inf	-1	0	the first one is that they should be a fancy look-and-feel and so the current functional look and feel um 
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.86	1328.62	1331.15	D	ME	ass	-1	0	um this should be a priority has it been saying The second most 
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.87	1331.46	1336.42	D	ME	inf	-1	0	The second most important aspect is the remote should that the remote control should be technologically innovative so i can we do 
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	1336.42	1338.03	D	ME	inf	-1	0	so i can we do a lot talking about that just with the lighting in 
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	1338.03	1341.93	D	ME	inf	-1	0	just with the lighting in the buttons and uh Face plates um 
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	1341.93	1344.41	D	ME	ass	-1	0	um so that's it'll go to keep on track with that and the third most 
ES2015c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	1344.41	1347.81	D	ME	inf	-1	0	and the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use
