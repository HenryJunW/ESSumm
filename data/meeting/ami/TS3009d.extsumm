this is our design .
Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting .
We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape .
Th So there's this part um {vocalsound} which is made of hard plastic , the front .
And uh we're we're using different colours .
Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours ,
and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything .
and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium ,
Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner ,
uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part .
It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo {disfmarker}
I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons .
the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here .
Um um with kind of arrow shapes ,
we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers .
Menu for the L_C_D_ screen .
And the video button .
And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen .
And we thought about the logo big in the middle .
And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo .
the voice recorder is uh at the bottom .
If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . But {disfmarker}
Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands .
And how large is it ?
That's the question .
Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen .
And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it .
But you you hold it like this .
Well the the {disfmarker} Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but {disfmarker}
Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree
and only Nils {disfmarker}
{vocalsound} For me , I I wouldn't buy it .
So {vocalsound} let it be like this at uh at this moment .
I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation .
That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria .
So I made a {disfmarker} I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends .
Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ?
So I think it's very good-looking
Easy to change channels ?
{vocalsound} I think it's uh as easy as uh can be made . Uh {disfmarker}
The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ?
Well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so ,
R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ?
Uh well well a bit ,
Are there enough technology ?
Three .
Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ?
Three , alright .
Is the material attractive ?
So I would say at least two .
look at the costs at this point .
My god .
The sample speaker ,
Kick it out .
Then we go to fourteen point six .
Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ?
Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said .
What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ?
but it wasn't very clear .
Yeah , we need to have the {vocalsound} the L_C_D_ screen .
Well , we could say , well this special colour , that isn't that that isn't there ,
because the the fronts they will buy it . The special colour .
But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen .
We can also make it flat .
Yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah .
No , it's one curve .
W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half .
Well we make it more expensive to buy .
Well , then we have two dollars less profit .
If if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more .
{vocalsound} Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen , it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing .
Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium ,
Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy .
I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days .
I I'll talk to the managers . {vocalsound}
So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid .
But then we can add the special colour ?
As we have money over uh left . {vocalsound}
Well I think uh the case is double curved then .
Well y we have curves in all directions .
So {disfmarker} alright .
but now we're going to evaluate our project , of uh project ,
are we satisfactory about our creativity ?
{vocalsound}
Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah .
I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment .
and you had to dump all your creativity .
Uh leadership
Well it's {vocalsound} {disfmarker} It was very democratic . {vocalsound}
{vocalsound} Well the managers were terrible . So , with their all their useless requirements .
teamwork ?
Well great I think .
Uh well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ?
It was a complete disaster .
{vocalsound} That one isn't accurate .
But I I think this is meant by the digital pen .
Uh {vocalsound} a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing .
And uh the digi the digital pen ?
It isn't practical . Right .
Yeah , it might be useful for drawings . I I agree on that .
{vocalsound} N new ideas found ?
Well I missed uh the option to uh to email ,
Communicate in between .
