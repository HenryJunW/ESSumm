Well our functional design meeting , that's the stage we're in .
Um now the new project requirements , I'll just show them .
Well , teletext goes out .
I I disagree ,
because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_
and they don't want it ,
because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years .
Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products .
Well , I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements .
Well , {vocalsound} um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly .
They also say , that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls .
Uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity .
Furthermore , it's uh {vocalsound} seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot .
Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb .
A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their {vocalsound} in their living room .
So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that's your um your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily .
Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn .
I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course . Uh {disfmarker}
Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think .
It sh it should be there , the manual .
So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design . So you can pick up and use it , than {disfmarker} I think .
Next point . Um R_S_I_ .
Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device .
Uh {disfmarker} I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that .
It's going to be expensive . Yeah .
I don't have any information on that . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
No , we'll look we'll look into that later .
And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition .
They also like that ,
I think that's uh difficult to realise also .
We don't rule them out uh yet .
Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design .
You have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control ,
And the {vocalsound} the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip ,
The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course .
Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set ,
I've some couple of pictures here .
It has uh very little buttons and {disfmarker}
High tech . {vocalsound}
and it's not very user-friendly .
So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that ,
uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly ,
Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons .
Uh the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext .
But I think it's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences .
but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ .
Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this .
Yeah . If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel .
That's very irritating , I think .
But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb .
and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach ,
And I have some pictures of the inside workings ,
Yeah . Well I'm Mike {gap} , User Interface Designer .
took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two .
Um {disfmarker} This one is engineering-centred ,
I like user-centr centred uh {vocalsound} uh also the best .
I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need .
{vocalsound} I um I kinda like the shape .
I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front .
but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company .
So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then uh our recognition is totally gone .
Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote .
We can put it on the on the back side .
We can make a symbol of the company right here .
And {vocalsound} if you put a front on it , there's a hole on the front . So the symbol's always on
Mike , uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ? In Map ?
Yeah , I will .
and we've uh chose for the younger one .
Um , research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features .
but what kind of features ?
Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition .
And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information .
Which programme you are l watching or something .
So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have ,
No not clickable .
I think it should be at the top .
Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ?
Uh well I think so , yes . Um {disfmarker}
{vocalsound} Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost .
No but we're we'll have to look into that .
So we have to decide on the different remote control functions .
Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural .
because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom .
We don't want them to look like a calculator .
I think it's still important to have it at the top ,
because it's uh it's more familiar that way .
I think we have uh a few functions ,
and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it ,
and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand .
Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions ,
{vocalsound} We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons {disfmarker}
Channel , yeah .
Volume control .
Uh the mute button .
I think we we should use something like this um to um {disfmarker} The the channel up and channel down button ? {vocalsound} Yeah , in circle , you know ?
And and a volume control also in it .
You should put that uh power button , channel and volume should have the most uh importance .
I think these should be in one big circle in the middle .
Yeah , but what he said about R_S_I_ was {vocalsound} t kinda true .
So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other .
Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place .
So the the {vocalsound} channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down .
No I don't think .
I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together ,
but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together .
Right , just make some decisions .
Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions ,
and the design comes into the next round ?
Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital ?
On most T_V_s if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other , {vocalsound} d it {disfmarker}
Alright so no button for that .
Uh there's um {vocalsound} screen . You can make it wider and less wide .
And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video .
I do think we have to put that underneath a clip .
Th that's a bit uh waste .
But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section .
You can just put it somewhere
Oh , they can be small or round like buttons .
Well uh and and I think more at the bottom . Yeah .
We have it , and we design later where everything goes . Yeah .
Why go to video ?
Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh {disfmarker}
Yeah , but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons , you have to have uh channel setting ,
Yeah well uh d different screen settings a Yeah , sk {vocalsound}
and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh {disfmarker}
So we still {gap} have one uh four ?
For a screen uh fu uh channel setting .
Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu .
Yeah , alright .
Menu button .
Yeah . I think that's important .
I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu , yeah .
And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something .
and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think . So {disfmarker}
