This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting .
what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two ,
so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .
It does look very cool .
{vocalsound} then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against .
Then I need to say some st a few things about finance ,
'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria .
Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits .
Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through .
so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things
and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and {disfmarker}
{vocalsound} Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana .
{vocalsound} You think bananas are a safe thing to use ?
It's a bit um phallic .
{vocalsound} Well , but it's it's just an a approximation . {vocalsound}
{vocalsound} Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again .
And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that .
And we have the user interface o in here
and uh {vocalsound} the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside .
And it's {disfmarker} the whole thing's made of rubber , is that {disfmarker}
Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?
Um it could be made a bit smaller ,
{vocalsound} yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder ,
so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable .
So {vocalsound} so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the {vocalsound} on the cover we just have the very basic things .
So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three {disfmarker}
So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here .
And then , well this is on off button .
and and also the colour is quite often red ,
And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and {disfmarker}
And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next .
The volume is is scrolling .
On the side ,
And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here .
and and you have the mm {vocalsound} spinning wheel with options to choose .
Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button .
Well , {gap} we'll have this on the screen , on the display .
On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute .
Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options .
yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ?
But if you hold it in ,
if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ?
{vocalsound} And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it .
You can't really see it in the interface .
And it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours .
Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website .
I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues ,
but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow .
So what we're gonna do is prefer {disfmarker} prepare the evaluation of the new design .
{vocalsound} Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale ,
so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement
and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again .
Um , you know . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them .
So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven .
I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here ,
but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points .
Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good .
Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in .
If you take a note of them ,
Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ?
Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people ,
so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m {vocalsound} model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one .
left-handed people can't normally write right-handed ,
So maybe we need to put {disfmarker} that needs a little bit of investigation ,
maybe give it a five , I would say ?
Or maybe six ,
It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right ,
I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top .
Yeah , but we {disfmarker} which makes it kind of really big , yeah .
or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ?
th there's the locator dot .
so that means you need a {disfmarker} that does mean you need a little speaker on it though ,
Mm that you stick on T_V_ .
To make it beep .
so that's seven , yeah .
If {vocalsound} uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things
I'd say six ,
'cause the {disfmarker} I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it .
but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to .
but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it .
So , should we maybe say f a five
so possibly for left-handed . Investigate .
But otherwise it's superb .
So , should we give it a six ?
Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design {disfmarker}
well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things ,
but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway ,
And moreover it it has um {vocalsound} L_C_D_ and everything ,
so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway .
Okay , so we give that a six ,
G_ technologically innovative .
it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . {vocalsound}
Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is {disfmarker} yeah , it's kind of new .
All of the components have been used in other things before .
They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think .
What do you reckon , five , six ?
Six .
Put fashion in electronics .
Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so .
So I think we've done very well ,
So , we need the average here ,
The average is about six and something .
{vocalsound} Six point five , yeah .
that's pretty good , I think .
so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria .
And now we have to calculate the production costs .
So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that .
Um I started filling it in ,
No hand dynamo , right ?
One simple battery .
The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print .
We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker .
Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it .
Case material we said rubber .
I don't know what special colour means .
I think something coloured ,
but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know .
{vocalsound} maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different .
Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it ,
We have pushbuttons ,
Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ?
And we have L_C_ display
And button supplements .
Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel {disfmarker}
We've got more than one pushbutton though ,
That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ?
That seems unlikely .
whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we {disfmarker}
We have to count all of them ,
I don't think that makes sense .
if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five ,
it's a scroll wheel {disfmarker} so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display ,
So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here .
Our budget's twelve point five .
Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go ,
'cause that's the most expensive thing on there .
so that has implications though for the {gap} .
Uh it does not have for voice recognition ,
but it does have for the feedback speaker .
{gap} when you say {disfmarker} when you press one it says one or it says hello .
But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ?
Mm {vocalsound} and the locator also goes away .
Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive ,
but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps .
A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface ,
because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber .
Right , so we need one fifty off .
Take it down to just a scroll wheel .
how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ?
in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ?
But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button .
you can push this one ,
but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing .
So that's point three .
and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing .
The scroll wheel is on the side .
We're point three over at the moment .
Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether
and just have pushbuttons for the volume .
Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up {disfmarker} for up and down .
Oh look , we're way under budget
Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve {gap} , couldn't we ? {vocalsound}
{vocalsound} Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour .
So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ?
No , I don't think so .
Because we keep all the features ,
we keep voice recognition ,
we keep L_C_D_ display .
instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons .
{vocalsound} But we lose the locator .
We're gonna have a beep .
so we still have the locate .
It can come in the same colour as the the case .
so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went ,
um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product .
as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity .
The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had .
I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with .
If we'd had that sheet at the beginning {gap} should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can .
But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of .
I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know .
Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used .
the whiteboard digital pens .
{vocalsound} We like the pens . {vocalsound}
But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint ,
Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah .
I mean that was fairly tight anyway ,
I mean especially with that last-minute alteration .
I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah .
You weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good .
And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah .
Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ?
Mm . I guess it was a fairly small group ,
so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah .
New ideas found .
Not quite sure what about .
Well it's it's it's pretty new ,
I think we'd like to think the ideas were new ,
costs are within budget ,
One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee .
Um we've evaluated the project .
Can you put that in the project documents file ?
And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with .
And my main difficulty was the the time pressure .
sometimes it's like a little bit rushed .
we've got like five minutes left .
but if we've finished , then we've finished .
So I would say that's the end of that meeting .
Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you .
Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it .
Was there a questionnaire already sent ?
Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ?
I don't see why you can't stay here , really .
