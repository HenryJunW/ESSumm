IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	211.57	213.98	ID	B	stl	-1	0	So um well
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	213.98	219.14	ID	B	sug	+1	1	I I figured uh we should um identify some user requirements ,
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	219.14	230.29	ID	B	sug	+1	1	and from my experience , I wanna uh , and from {vocalsound} research I did , uh the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button ,
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	230.29	235.22	ID	B	inf	-1	0	you can't uh can't have like uh waffling on this point , you know .

IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	235.22	235.723	ID	B	fra	-1	0	Really have {disfmarker}
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	235.87	236.6	ID	B	fra	-1	0	It needs to be able
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	236.6	238.15	ID	B	sug	-1	0	y y have to be able to find it .
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	238.64	243.54	ID	B	inf	+1	1	Because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them .
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	244.49	245.34	ID	B	stl	-1	0	So uh ,
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	245.34	245.77	ID	B	sug	-1	0	I also ,
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	245.77	250.01	ID	B	inf	+1	1	since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product ,
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	250.01	251.97	ID	B	sug	+1	1	thought we better look at things that are popular
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	251.97	254.12	ID	B	sug	+1	1	and um ex go beyond those ,
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	254.12	255.75	ID	B	inf	+1	0	and , as I said in the first meeting ,
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	256.58	268.5	ID	B	sug	+1	1	um {vocalsound} and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction , especially in the the uh the outside of the product
IS1008b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	266.628	267.0	PM	A	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	268.5	270.69	ID	B	inf	-1	0	so that it gives the appearance ,
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	270.69	273.313	ID	B	inf	-1	0	and it is reliable , and so forth . {vocalsound}
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	273.67	277.67	ID	B	inf	+1	1	I did a little history on uh the the uh remote controls
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	277.67	279.72	ID	B	inf	-1	0	and when they were invented and so forth ,
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	279.72	280.46	ID	B	stl	-1	0	so ,
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	280.46	284.29	ID	B	inf	-1	0	I guess this guy Zenith uh created the Flashmatic ,
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.29	284.29	285.33	ID	B	ass	-1	0	which I kinda like the idea ,
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.30	285.33	292.33	ID	B	inf	-1	0	'cause it made me think of um um maybe the remote control made a big flash when uh you turn the T_V_ on and off ,
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.31	292.33	293.29	ID	B	ass	-1	0	that might be interesting .
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.32	293.93	296.71	ID	B	stl	-1	0	And um {vocalsound} so
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.33	296.71	300.51	ID	B	inf	-1	0	it was highly directional flash light
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.34	300.51	303.49	ID	B	inf	-1	0	that uh you could turn the picture on and off ,
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.35	303.49	304.78	ID	B	inf	-1	0	and the sound on and off ,
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.36	304.78	306.3	ID	B	inf	-1	0	and change channels
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.37	306.3	306.36	ID	B	fra	-1	0	c
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.38	306.36	312.94	ID	B	inf	-1	0	so I think um those are still requirements we have today , uh fifty years later .
IS1008b.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.53	309.402	309.801	PM	A	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	311.06	311.25	UI	C	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.39	313.6	316.72	ID	B	inf	-1	0	And uh it was really a pioneering innovation ,
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.40	316.72	318.82	ID	B	inf	-1	0	but it was uh sensitive to the sun ,
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.41	318.82	322.98	ID	B	fra	-1	0	so that uh it would get {disfmarker} would start off by the {disfmarker} you'd get {disfmarker}
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.42	322.98	326.24	ID	B	inf	-1	0	it would easily cause um problems .
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.43	327.09	328.06	ID	B	stl	-1	0	So , uh
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.44	328.86	334.31	ID	B	fra	-1	0	I {disfmarker} in addition to uh looking at the um {vocalsound} uh the functional requir
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.45	334.31	334.46	ID	B	stl	-1	0	so
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.46	334.46	342.569	ID	B	inf	+1	1	all these devices are examples of where uh mm {disfmarker} they {vocalsound} represent examples that are available today {vocalsound}
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.47	342.569	348.24	ID	B	be.pos	+1	1	{vocalsound} which I think the one in the middle is r um really uh something to keep in mind .

IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.49	350.22	354.41	ID	B	fra	-1	0	And um it would uh y you'd {vocalsound} {disfmarker}
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.50	354.41	356.51	ID	B	be.pos	+1	1	you could throw it at things

IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.52	360.99	364.7	ID	B	inf	-1	0	And since I'm not really um {vocalsound} Industrial Designer ,

IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.56	376.07	380.07	ID	B	inf	+1	1	and I guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board .

IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	391.33	400.08	ID	B	sug	+1	1	and I think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference .

IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	1325.04	1325.82	UI	C	ass	-1	0	Yeah , and that's fine .
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	1328.39	1332.31	UI	C	stl	-1	0	Okay . So , basically ,
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	1332.31	1339.18	UI	C	inf	+1	1	the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products .
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.66	1339.18	1341.13	UI	C	inf	+1	1	So , in our case , existing remote controls .
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	1341.64	1343.21	UI	C	inf	-1	0	And then , what the good ideas are ,
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	1343.21	1344.63	UI	C	inf	-1	0	and what the bad ideas are ,
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	1344.63	1346.01	UI	C	inf	-1	0	and why they're bad and good ,
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	1346.01	1347.3	UI	C	inf	-1	0	which isn't always as obvious .
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	1347.3	1350.95	UI	C	inf	+1	1	We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad ,
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	1350.95	1356.31	UI	C	inf	+1	1	but when you look , technically , at how it works , sometimes that's not the case .
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	1356.89	1359.79	UI	C	sug	+1	1	Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep ,
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	1359.79	1363.8	UI	C	inf	-1	0	'cause that'll feed into both Ed's work and Christine's work .
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	1364.52	1366.94	UI	C	sug	+1	1	Um and then what the remote control should look like ,
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	1366.94	1370.65	UI	C	sug	-1	0	obviously , once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are .
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	1371.41	1371.63	UI	C	stl	-1	0	So ,
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	1371.63	1375.6	UI	C	sug	+1	1	in terms of the functionalities that we need , you obviously need to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off .
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	1375.6	1381.12	UI	C	sug	+1	1	You need to change channels , both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing .
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.80	1381.12	1382.81	UI	C	sug	+1	1	You need to be able to control the volume
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	1382.81	1387.68	UI	C	sug	+1	1	and then control any menus on the T_V_ to regulate contrast or whatever .
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.82	1392.05	1392.51	UI	C	stl	-1	0	So ,
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.83	1392.51	1397.18	UI	C	inf	+1	1	the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls , in general .
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.84	1397.62	1400.79	UI	C	inf	+1	1	The buttons {disfmarker} it's not clear what they're supposed to do .
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.85	1401.33	1408.18	UI	C	inf	+1	1	Um often , you need to know specific button sequences {vocalsound} to get certain functionalities done ,
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.86	1408.18	1412.93	UI	C	inf	+1	1	um which you don't necessarily always remember , especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often .
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.87	1413.4	1414.89	UI	C	inf	-1	0	And that the buttons are too small .
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.88	1416.14	1416.74	UI	C	stl	-1	0	So ,
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.89	1416.74	1418.84	UI	C	inf	+1	1	here we've got two examples
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.90	1418.84	1424.43	UI	C	inf	+1	1	where here on the left-hand side , you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons .
IS1008b.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.135	1424.914	1427.149	ID	B	fra	-1	0	{vocalsound}
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.91	1424.43	1426.7	UI	C	ass	+1	1	The buttons , in a lot of cases , are tiny .
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.92	1427.58	1429.03	UI	C	ass	-1	0	Um they're hard to see ,
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.94	1429.03	1429.65	UI	C	ass	-1	0	and okay ,
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.93	1429.65	1430.58	UI	C	inf	+1	1	they're labelled ,
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.95	1430.58	1434.04	UI	C	ass	+1	1	but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much .
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.96	1434.33	1437.81	UI	C	inf	+1	1	Whereas , on the other side , you have a much simpler remote control
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.97	1437.81	1442.72	UI	C	inf	+1	1	that I think basically has the minimum functionalities {vocalsound} that are needed .
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.98	1442.72	1448.29	UI	C	inf	+1	1	And it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it .
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.99	1448.29	1454.06	UI	C	sug	+1	1	So , I would be inclined to go sort of towards this , in terms of design , rather than this .
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.100	1454.54	1461.29	UI	C	sug	+1	1	And if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons .
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.101	1462.02	1466.24	UI	C	sug	+1	1	So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit , or to a minimum ,
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.102	1466.24	1467.07	UI	C	be.pos	-1	0	sorry ,
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.103	1467.07	1475.25	UI	C	sug	+1	1	make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed , so like the on button being really obvious one , the channel changing and the volume ,
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.104	1475.25	1477.89	UI	C	sug	+1	2	and to keep the design basically sleek and simple .

IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.105	1479.43	1485.4	UI	C	inf	-1	0	Which , I think ties into what Christine and Ed have both said fairly reasonably .
IS1008b.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.106	1485.7	1486.3	UI	C	stl	-1	0	Um so ,
