So we are here for the detailed design meeting .
I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting .
I will also take notes during this meeting
and I will send you uh a summary then as usual .
We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues
{vocalsound} And uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product .
Then we will uh evaluate the product .
And uh end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with {disfmarker} it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not .
let's start with the cost aspect
I look at the aspect discussed last time ,
that is to say uh to have a standard battery ,
{vocalsound} to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it
uh to feel spongy ,
{vocalsound} and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera .
And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros .
which is uh good ,
because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros .
for the financial aspect it's okay ,
we can uh {disfmarker} we can continue with this product uh as if ,
{vocalsound} and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert .
I made an evaluation
and the the evaluation criteria is made according to {vocalsound} the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings .
we have uh six points .
we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , {vocalsound} easy to find in a room , and robust ,
I have a scale of uh seven points .
I go through all the uh all the points here ,
and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point , two point or seven point .
And after we ha we have an an average , and uh we see .
fancy look and feel , what do you think ?
between o one and seven .
{vocalsound} So I think it's uh very uh very nice .
I give it a {disfmarker} I give it a five .
it's between one and seven ?
Seven is the highest uh ?
{vocalsound} Seven is the {disfmarker}
I will give a six .
I will give a a five .
Maybe we all have to agree on a common {disfmarker}
uh I don't know if you {disfmarker} we ha we have to put uh one uh f If it's better or {disfmarker}
we can choose what we want .
let's say that seven is the best .
do note the grade we have five , six for me ,
How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ?
I think six , it's a good uh {disfmarker}
So it will have five point five average .
after , the technological aspect ?
we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel .
We also have the rubber material ,
I think I would give a five .
It's {gap} four .
A four also ,
because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation .
are we including the voice in the end or not ? Huh ?
No .
Yeah , four . Four , yeah , let's put four .
Very easy to use . Do you think it's easy to use ?
I give a seven , I think .
Mm , six for me also .
six point five .
{vocalsound} Is it fashion ? {vocalsound}
its its f its fruit fruit shape .
I would say seven .
Yeah it's fashion ,
we can we can put a seven here .
{vocalsound} Easy to find .
I think you can't miss it .
I think it's cool .
We have the lightning ,
{vocalsound} So you'll make the material transparent
so that it uh lights up completely ,
I would say seven .
Is it {disfmarker} is it robust ?
it's rubber , made of rubber ,
the only problem there might be {disfmarker} which {gap} know , i if it's very sensitive ,
But it is uh {disfmarker} it is surrounded by rubber material .
So maybe we can put a six .
{vocalsound} Everybody is okay , six .
We have to sum up everything .
{vocalsound} Six is a good {disfmarker}
Uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better ,
and when uh s six sit six are good {disfmarker} it's a good uh p product , I think .
So it's a good evaluation , I think .
We have a good price
So this prototype is quite nice . {vocalsound}
So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive , I think .
we have seen the prototype .
It's very nice according to the work of our two designer .
The the the financial aspect were okay .
We we have the cost below uh our threshold
and so we could sell at twenty five Euros
and make i make profit .
The the evaluation give satisfying result as well .
the cost is in the budget ,
the evaluation is okay ,
so I th I think we can now uh open champagne
{vocalsound} Congratulations to the team .
Uh very well , we worked together fantastically .
I think it was a good collaboration uh .
