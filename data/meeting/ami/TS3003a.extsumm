First I will introduce myself .
I'm Bart ,
My name's Frank .
let's start off um with a little presentation .
Uh Now first I'll tell you a little bit about the setting .
You can see there are a few cameras here .
They'll record uh our actions
and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice .
is there a project documents folder ?
There are some notes in it already I see , some documents .
I don't know if you've noticed , but uh we're working for Real Reaction .
We put fashion in electronics ,
uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself .
This is our agenda .
{vocalsound} Uh we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing .
then I can take some notes
Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while .
but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down , just write it down .
Um have you all seen the corporate website already ?
Have you seen any flaws in it ?
I think I found one . {vocalsound}
But um on the corporate information side there's a th uh {disfmarker} there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction .
{vocalsound} Uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control .
It has to be original , trendy , and user friendly .
Uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through .
First is functional des uh design , individual work , meetings .
After the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design .
The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design , uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design .
Uh the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design .
{vocalsound} And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project {disfmarker} uh product ev evaluation .
But that will be all worked out in uh other meetings .
As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board .
Um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side .
Here are some functions .
You can save .
uh these functions we don't have anything to do with ,
only undo , you can undo a little uh piece of drawing .
A blank new document for each person .
Uh select a pen ,
eraser .
Uh then we've got our pen . This pen .
It's really funny
You can also select the current colour and the line width .
and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there .
We've got our shared folder ,
But all you will found that already
because there are a lot of documents in it already ,
so if you have a document you wanna show , just open it from the folder .
Here is a simple tool bar .
it's save , print , move back or forward one page .
You can switch between the different drawings .
And then we're going to try out the white board .
We're going to uh draw animal .
{vocalsound} And uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics .
Um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours , and different line width .
You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child .
Because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked
Another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow .
'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then um the pen won't hold up .
we choose form of current colour
uh I think grey is appropriate .
Now you'll see my drawing capabilities .
you have to do it real slow .
I was trying to draw a dolphin ,
{vocalsound} And then you can undo
Maybe you have to hold it a bit upside-down .
now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you .
Gonna use a different line width .
Maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width , I think .
You have to go really slow when you're writing .
Um I'm just gonna draw its uh head ,
I was gonna draw a cat too ,
it's pretty skinny cat . {vocalsound}
everybody knows how to work with the white board now ?
Yeah .
move along to the project finance .
Um as you can see , we um for our remote control , a selling price is uh twenty five Euros . Our selling price .
Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros .
Uh we can do it international ,
so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well .
Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros ,
just try to remember these points . Selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million um , but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on . And production cost uh maximal twelve and a half Euros .
that's leads us to our little discussion .
does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls , and I mean not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ? Like you can use for other ?
No , me neither .
kind of broad T_V_ at home , and a D_V_D_ player ,
so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the T_V_ , one for the video recorder , one for the D_V_D_ player .
And I think it's {disfmarker} it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all .
I've I've got one at home .
And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it ,
And it also operates on infra-red ,
so you have to got the little device inside your room ,
and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor .
I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as well .
we've {disfmarker} we want different functions
uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red .
Think it has to be shock proof
Sure , yeah .
my remote control tends to fall a lot .
Waterproof ,
Um I will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder .
Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it .
how much is left in the battery .
But they'll also really drag up the production costs ,
so think we'll have to see about that too .
But maybe just a little LED ,
then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder ,
And we can all work uh on our own projects . {vocalsound}
then I'll meet you in about a half an hour , I think .
