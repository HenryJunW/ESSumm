There was criticism for the shape of the remote (thicker at the ends , thinner at the middle).
The project manager still disagreed on the position of the LCD: he would prefer it to be at the top.
The total cost of the prototype was 18.6 euros.
The team had to discuss which features should be discarded.
The only way was to go to a regular chip , but that would mean losing the LCD screen , which was integral to the design.
Replacing the titanium with plastic would have a detrimental effect on the looks of the remote.
The team discussed the possibility to leave the remaining cost at 14.10.
The SMARTboard was considered a disaster as they could not draw , and the digital pens can only be useful for drawings.
Some people thought that there was no advantage to using the SMARTboard instead of a normal blackboard and chalk , although you can save and reuse things with the former.
