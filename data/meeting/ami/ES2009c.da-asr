ES2009c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	139.16	143.46	B	ID	inf	+1	1	Um components of remote control okay we were a kind of gone over this but we have to get

ES2009c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	145.62	147.95	B	ID	sug	-1	0	what you tell "'em" probably have to reach some conclusion sometimes and 
ES2009c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	148.9	157.37	B	ID	inf	+1	1	Energy source um are manufacture offers a variety of energy sources the standard battery solar cells are manufactured in 
ES2009c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	157.37	159.15	B	ID	inf	+1	1	are manufactured in say anything about with them so we might have to look 
ES2009c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	159.15	160.37	B	ID	fra	-1	0	so we might have to look if we do go that 
ES2009c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	160.37	163.75	B	ID	inf	+1	1	if we do go that route we might have to look elsewhere um 
ES2009c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	163.75	167.08	B	ID	inf	+1	1	um and also there's a kinetic energy possibility basically it's like 
ES2009c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	167.08	173.4	B	ID	inf	+1	1	basically it's like a um the idea of moving the remote would be enough energy to keep it running so that's one possible 
ES2009c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	173.4	174.23	B	ID	inf	-1	0	so that's one possible but i don't know whether that 
ES2009c.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	174.23	180.03	B	ID	ass	+1	1	but i don't know whether that would be a powerful have to illuminate a touchscreen so have to look into that
