Okay , the waiting is for our Marketing Expert , Ruud .
Is there a schedule for this meeting ?
Yes , there is actually .
Um I will li list the agenda for today .
For this meeting .
It's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square , um for the cameras .
Um we're here to develop uh a new product .
this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it .
Um you are here in a specific role .
Uh Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert ,
Roo is here as the User Interface Designer
and Sebastian is here uh in the role of Industrial Designer .
we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here .
Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan ,
uh and we will have a discussion .
Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes ,
Um is there any room for a little presentation ?
Uh maybe during the discussion uh section ?
{vocalsound} No problem .
this new product we are are g are going to develop , um
it's a remote control ,
Um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly .
{vocalsound} Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .
Um {vocalsound} we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development ,
Uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design ,
um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the {gap} {disfmarker}
Um the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements ,
Um {vocalsound} the second is the technical functional design ,
um what effect should the remote have ?
Um and the last one is the working design .
How exactly does it work in the technical sense .
{vocalsound} Okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here .
You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to .
{vocalsound} to um presentate , to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder ,
Um then we have this electronic white-board system .
you can draw on the board using this pen .
There are little um uh
sensors ,
it's on the um eraser now ,
so we click the pen button .
{vocalsound} you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button .
Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file .
So do not m make a new file .
But we all use the same white-board file
Current colour , you can choose another colour .
Um so now I d have a different line width and uh colour .
I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder
Um as a little training {vocalsound} um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected .
Uh a wee rabbit .
Um Roo , could you do the same please ?
But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width .
It it should be a cat .
Okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .
the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros .
Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros ,
we uh we will focus this internationally ,
And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty ,
maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation .
Yes , um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion ,
I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things ,
and the technical possibilities and impossibilities .
So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions ,
but uh there might be some impossibilities .
Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available
I have some uh initial ideas about some things
One thing about uh interopera operability .
Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device {disfmarker} diverse subset of equipment .
Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment .
Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .
Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other .
We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh
is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore .
But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth .
Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that .
But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared , so
you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote .
but that's uh something we should discuss
but take these things into account when you start the discussion .
Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things .
Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications .
Um there are other things like um {vocalsound} how to make it trendy ,
which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role .
Um the way how it should be controlled by the user ,
which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part .
H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ?
Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said ,
um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different
devices ?
I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store .
Yes , I think it should be something like that .
It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product ,
Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer ,
right ?
Yeah , I do I don't know that .
don't have the information for it .
We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ?
we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public ,
And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ?
Or are there any o other controls ?
Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or {disfmarker}
I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward , sidewords .
And um it's very easy for a user to to switch {disfmarker}
to to switch b uh between uh channels
or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ ,
And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing .
Uh point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ ,
so you must {vocalsound} point everywhere ,
Maybe not even pointed .
so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that .
So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited .
For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ ,
so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that ,
but if you want to uh get it working with a radio , and you're in {disfmarker} outside your garden with just one uh speaker , then maybe the range should be uh {disfmarker}
You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons ,
so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand .
And of course you don't always know where all buttons are ,
so it should be visible al um {vocalsound} in dark too .
Uh I'll write down glow in the dark .
Okay , um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting .
Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the {disfmarker} such a product ?
Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ?
Uh I think most most things have already been said ,
like uh control multiple devices .
And uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue .
But uh lots of devices already use infrared .
we'll probably have to implement that .
Um you said something about visibility in the dark .
uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ?
but it it can be quite simple ,
you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it .
The uh the the digits in black .
Uh then it's already visible in dark .
So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy
{disfmarker} well , it can be for design , of course .
because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product .
Yes , but there's a cost limitation too .
twelve Euro fifty , yeah .
So that's a big problem , I think .
I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product .
The cost price is very low .
The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade .
Always have s the soft buttons , always uh clear the the the paint on it .
Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily
um or it should not consume too much um power .
Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week .
maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or {disfmarker}
But then Bluetooth uh might be problem .
{vocalsound} It's use uh a lot of uh {disfmarker}
Well does it ?
I know it from the cell phone .
Well , cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's {disfmarker} it seems to work uh quite okay .
But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .
Okay . Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time .
{vocalsound} so we will go back to our own uh work .
Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes
and um , well , you know your o your individual actions
or your personal coach will probably email you about th it .
See you in thirty minutes .
