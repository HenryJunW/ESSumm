Well this is the uh final detailed design meeting .
Um we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product .
And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control ,
um and then I'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report .
we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display , no need for talk-back ,
it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons ,
maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing ,
um hopefully a jog-dial ,
and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well .
Um , there are a few changes we've made .
Um , well look at the expense sheet , and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside ,
this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen , um just a a very very basic one ,
very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm
Uh , apart from that , it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time .
the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use .
Um they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial ?
The L_C_D_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing .
If you're using an advanced function right , like um c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say {disfmarker}
It might even be one , a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the the symbols of the various functions .
That's a number pad .
Where are we gonna have the slogan ?
just like right inside there .
{vocalsound} Well {vocalsound} we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger
so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand . {gap}
So we're talking about ten centimetres .
uh I'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours .
We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button .
this button um , because it's red it's sort of very prominent , we're gonna use it as uh {disfmarker} it can be the power button
if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal .
Um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen
Oh we've discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ? {vocalsound}
be about th three and a half .
what else can you do ?
Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons .
but um because we've got the the L_C_D_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume .
And what else do you do with the jog-dial ?
Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and {disfmarker}
Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them .
Audio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid-range , your high range .
left-right balance ,
um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes ,
We can now have a little look at the the Excel sheet and price listing ,
and see if we need to
um if we need to rethink anything at all .
for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ?
Do we have kinetic as well ?
No .
And that's because of cost restraints is it ?
Yep .
We need an advanced chip I think , yep .
So we want double-curved ?
I think we're gonna have to skip the rubber .
um and we wanted special colours didn't we ?
For the case itself , one colour . It's one special colour .
We've got push buttons as well .
Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one .
So we're w w quite far over .
something's gonna have to go .
Um we're at sixteen point eight and {disfmarker}
The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together ,
so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond ,
It {disfmarker} It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is a single panel .
or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons .
No can do .
Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons ,
And now we're under budget .
sort of {vocalsound} deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat .
width-wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something ?
How how tall do you envisage it being ?
About two centimetres , okay .
Maybe closer to three even or two and a half .
Okay we'll s we'll say two point five .
but um just in in that we want this to be stylish , should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid ,
I think that's something that's very hard to catch ,
so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something .
What about button shape ?
Square buttons ?
Yeah
discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um with these four points ,
Maybe we should do the design evaluation first .
I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning ,
and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan ,
So to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had ,
uh when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low ,
and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this ,
So the first one uh , stylish look and feel .
I rate that pretty highly .
Okay let's go with five then .
Fi oh uh just actually the opposite .
Let's go with two point five then .
high tech innovation .
so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted ,
but jog-dial
Yeah about three , okay .
Style reflects a fruit inspired colour , design .
Okay , the blue the blue colours and {disfmarker} don't re don't actually represent the colour ,
the the yellow is more representative of the colour ,
so we'll go two .
and um design is simple to use , simple in features .
I mean I'd give that nearly a one .
Um , {vocalsound} soft and spongy , have we achieved that ?
We've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price .
Yeah I think it's about five .
logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ?
And um it's within budget , yep .
out of forty nine with with zero being the highest .
We are at uh two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five .
So it's pretty good .
I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals .
It's not something I need to p push through ,
but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions , um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um {disfmarker}
uh well next up then , because we've done finance , is the project evaluation .
Um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and {vocalsound}
Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ?
Yeah , yeah
it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know .
But I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room .
answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity
We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds ,
so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual {disfmarker}
The constraints do come in very fast .
it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money .
I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings ,
and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts {disfmarker}
it it it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate .
and and the time the time given also restricts {disfmarker}
In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your {disfmarker} the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a {vocalsound} quite a con confining framework to work within .
And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so {disfmarker}
But it's not bad leadership , it's just sort of s fairly strong , you know .
So you think maybe a little too controlling or {disfmarker}
Yeah , oh yeah , without without a doubt .
I think the interactions are very structured .
I don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it ,
uh what about teamwork ?
Uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting .
If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would've been a lot easier .
I think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , I think that's the word .
I mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork
because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation
I think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing I would use all the time ,
maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text .
I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype
and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss
and in a way everybody's {disfmarker} as we discuss things in the {disfmarker} in theoretically and out of our notebooks ,
we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds .
I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard ,
and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think .
And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints , I don't think , you know , we needed to actually {disfmarker} it could have , we could have gone through it {gap} verbally ,
What about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ?
Oh they're a bit clunky .
Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well ,
But I think the pen is v is very intuitive ,
So I think the pen's good .
And o on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files .
We only actually needed one computer .
And the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something , you know ,
, the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other .
well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team .
I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on
I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room ,
and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c
And we have Ninja Homer .
Well apparently now I write the final report .
I'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber ,
Oh , I did learn something new , Play-Doh is useful .
It is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing , in being creative .
Like we were playing with the Play-Doh and the ideas came with the Play-Doh rather than with everything else .
It becomes tangible .
