ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	34.24	35.64	B	PM	stl	-1	0	Okay . So
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	35.64	41.21	B	PM	off	+1	1	just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one , um
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	43.28	47.08	B	PM	el.inf	-1	0	we're gonna go for something uh uh how was it ?

ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	49.23	51.28	B	PM	inf	+1	1	Um something that looks good
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	51.28	54.58	B	PM	inf	+1	1	'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end ,
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	54.58	58.39	B	PM	inf	-1	0	though we should never avoid functionality , of course .
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	58.39	61.07	B	PM	inf	+1	1	Uh many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf ,
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	61.07	64.46	B	PM	inf	+1	1	but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	64.46	69.33	B	PM	inf	+1	1	and we were still very much for the idea of using an L_C_D_ display .
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	69.33	73.3	B	PM	inf	+1	1	Um other things were we were hoping to use rubber ,
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	73.3	75.72	B	PM	inf	+1	1	most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera .
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	77.66	80.86	B	PM	stl	-1	0	Okay . So um
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	80.86	84.5	B	PM	sug	+1	1	due to your hard work , we might as well let the uh two designers go first ,

ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.1	87.07	87.72	A	UI	stl	-1	0	Okay ,
ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	87.72	88.48	A	UI	fra	-1	0	it's a {disfmarker}
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	89.22	91.65	B	PM	sug	+1	1	Quite how the best way to do this is , I'm not sure ,

ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	90.656	94.28	A	UI	sug	+1	1	{gap} I think if we both step up

ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	94.28	97.84	A	UI	sug	+1	1	and uh outline our ideas .
ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	98.94	100.34	A	UI	stl	-1	0	Okay . Now
ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	101.91	107.66	A	UI	inf	+1	1	do {disfmarker} uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design .
ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	107.66	122.26	A	UI	inf	+1	1	Um for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is um is h i is down here for the uh L_E_D_ .
ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	122.26	133.37	A	UI	ass	+1	1	As it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick ,
ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	133.37	140.24	A	UI	sug	-1	0	though it might be an idea to be able to a adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit
ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	140.24	140.864	A	UI	fra	-1	0	for uh {disfmarker}

ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	142.031	144.5	A	UI	inf	-1	0	{gap} ju just a thought .
ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	144.5	148.43	A	UI	sug	+1	1	You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick
ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	148.43	151.63	A	UI	sug	+1	1	that could then just be turn uh twisted round ,
ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	151.63	158.5	A	UI	sug	-1	0	so that the uh sticky uh so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other .
ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	158.5	167.04	A	UI	ass	+1	1	But as you as you see with the uh {vocalsound} with holding it in the left hand , the L_ uh the L_C_D_ is nowhere useful ,
ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	167.04	172.87	A	UI	sug	+1	1	so that would need to be articulated uh if we're going to retain {gap} ergonomic design .
ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	174.1	176.28	A	UI	stl	-1	0	Um now
ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	176.28	180.25	A	UI	inf	+1	1	I I got your note about uh keeping the cost down .

ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	181.79	182.79	B	PM	sug	-1	0	We'll go into that a bit more ,
ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	183.264	194.46	A	UI	sug	+1	2	{gap} this design could be done with um with uh plastic casing .

ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	194.46	200.71	A	UI	sug	+1	1	Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that
ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	200.71	205.95	A	UI	inf	+1	1	which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as well .
ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	205.95	218.34	A	UI	sug	+1	2	As for the um as for the single curve , um well this edge and this edge , like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it ,
ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	218.34	219.51	A	UI	ass	-1	0	but it's not absolutely necessary .
ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.25	219.51	222.67	A	UI	sug	+1	1	Really the curve that's most needed is the underside
ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.26	222.67	228.51	A	UI	inf	-1	0	so that the jo so that the joystick rests over the the edge of the hand like this .
ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.27	229.65	240.76	A	UI	inf	+1	1	Um and you have the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder .
ES2003d.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.28	241.85	242.17	A	UI	stl	-1	0	So .

ES2003d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.2	245.79	248.92	D	ID	sug	+1	1	Um obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks ,
ES2003d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.3	248.92	251.84	D	ID	sug	+1	2	because it's gonna be flat on one side ,
ES2003d.D.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	251.84	253.91	D	ID	inf	-1	0	so the L_C_D_ will be s sticking down like this ,

ES2003d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	351.55	352.5	C	ME	inf	+1	1	we average that

ES2003d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	585.34	588.25	C	ME	inf	-1	0	they really mean it they they're very big on fashion ,

ES2003d.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	599.94	602.73	C	ME	inf	+1	1	I guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface ,

ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.59	619.82	620.84	B	PM	inf	+1	2	Slight problem we had
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.60	620.84	628.1	B	PM	inf	+1	3	was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do .
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.61	628.1	632.26	B	PM	inf	+1	2	Um most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.62	632.26	636.54	B	PM	inf	+1	3	which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.63	636.54	639.25	B	PM	inf	-1	0	because of course we required a chip as well .
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.64	639.25	645.08	B	PM	inf	+1	3	Um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_ ,
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.65	645.08	648.68	B	PM	inf	+1	3	at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface , {gap}

ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.67	652.08	660.52	B	PM	inf	+1	2	Or what we did was that we um we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure .
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.68	660.52	669.56	B	PM	inf	+1	3	Um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.69	669.56	670.92	B	PM	inf	-1	0	and we're just scraping it in ,
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.70	670.92	673.89	B	PM	inf	+1	2	we've got point two of a Euro left over there .
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.71	673.89	676.48	B	PM	inf	-1	0	So we're just managing it really .
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.72	676.48	681.11	B	PM	inf	+1	2	Even then as well , um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.73	681.11	683.46	B	PM	inf	+1	2	so I've used what I think's appropriate .
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.74	683.46	687.12	B	PM	oth	-1	0	With any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to .
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.75	689.82	693.83	B	PM	inf	+1	2	It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side ,
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.76	693.83	699.4	B	PM	inf	+1	2	for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now . Um .

ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.77	702.23	703.51	B	PM	inf	-1	0	That should still be viable .
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.78	703.51	704.59	B	PM	inf	+1	1	We've got an advanced chip ,
ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.79	704.59	705.95	B	PM	inf	+1	3	we've got the use of the L_C_D_ .

ES2003d.B.dialog-act.vkaraisk.81	711.79	717.52	B	PM	el.sug	-1	0	Um but what's something we need to decide on is how we're gonna go from here .
