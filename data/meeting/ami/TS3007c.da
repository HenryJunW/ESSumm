TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.92	1238.72	1249.9	B	UI	inf	-1	0	So um the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small , so you can put it in inside your hands .
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.93	1249.9	1251.84	B	UI	inf	-1	0	And some remotes you can use with your thumb .

TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.96	1254.35	1259.82	B	UI	sug	-1	0	So you can make it s a little broader . Yeah . And here ?
TS3007c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.97	1259.82	1264.45	B	UI	inf	-1	0	And maybe use your thumb on the on the main buttons .
