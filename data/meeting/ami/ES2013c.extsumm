this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting .
Um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting ,
the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point .
Um and we should each have a presentation to make .
Um we have certain decisions to make
{vocalsound} Um there are the decisions we have to turn to ,
but we'll come back to them in a minute
after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting .
Um Sarah , you presented a marketing research report
um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition .
And then Steph did a second presentation
um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use .
Kate presented a working design of {disfmarker} going after {disfmarker} going over the basics on the whiteboard
um that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half Pence cost .
Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries
and having a docking place as a selling point .
we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers .
Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_ ,
Um and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held .
{vocalsound} Um at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for .
Um and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics .
Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed .
first thing I want to address is um one of the points that Florence brought up ,
which was uh current cost of the competition devices ,
and and they're uh twenty to sixty Euros , depending on uh branding .
But I think that with the current um price that we're searching for , we're well within , even on the lower end , of the uh of the market .
I investigated the remote control market in greater detail ,
and my uh {disfmarker} the theme of what I was to work on was uh trend watch .
What's hot ,
fruit and veg . Spongy .
And this is all over the catwalks , Paris , Milan , and I'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes . {vocalsound}
This is really interesting change from past years ,
because it is much more organic ,
{vocalsound} And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset .
on um {vocalsound} what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing .
Fancy .
Functional is out .
And f the fancy , and that's exactly the term , I'm I'm thinking polished , elegant , {vocalsound} you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above .
This is twice as important as the next finding ,
which is technologically innovative .
This is interesting ,
'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important ,
but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically {vocalsound} superior fabrics or uh , you know , designed in interesting substances .
Ease of use . Again , pretty low ,
I mean it's the top three ,
but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important .
I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of {vocalsound} fruit {vocalsound} fruit themed sleeves .
It sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote , you know , your t your cell phone .
I was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress . {gap} you know , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy .
initially I thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held , so banana , pineapple and pear .
They could be interchangeable ,
they're spongy ,
So what we're talking about is changing . this concept .
Everyone has a T_V_ remote ,
but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , I'm thinking the teenager , the {disfmarker} someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers .
So I really open this up to uh any other feedback . This {vocalsound} spongy fruit and veg .
I I think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this .
Spongy is gonna be difficult , I'm afraid .
{vocalsound} And as for as for um well budgeting as well , if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable components .
we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber .
I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy ,
I was thinking titanium myself .
I have been influenced by pictures of iPods ,
I think many of us would associate those with fancy .
it would be uh a a very simple product
that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . So {disfmarker}
Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management
W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit ,
I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next .
I was really thinking a lot about the I_ uh the iMac kind of gel gem tone .
you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you ,
I've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate ,
and I've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division ,
who have told me what's actually available , you know , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they've got ,
this is the innards of a remote control um .
and that's the the back of the interface .
And this is a push-button one ,
so you see these little little buttons here , they're little rubber rubber buttons
that go through onto the the board at the back
and they push these buttons here .
that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate .
We got to have something that pushes the little buttons
that um talk to the chip
that encodes the message
that sends the the message to the receiver .
{vocalsound} So first of all um I wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source .
Um we can have your bog standard double double A_ batteries in a replaceable um little compartment .
We can have a hand {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
a wind-up , yeah ,
but i it maybe is {disfmarker} doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg .
{vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source ,
where um {vocalsound} you you actually get the energy by moving the device ,
Or we we had talked about solar power ,
but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark .
I'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case .
It can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like , {vocalsound} or titanium .
Um and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber ,
and basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface ,
but I think if we wanna use standard components , we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that .
what does the interface look like ?
push button , that's that's the one we're all familiar with . {vocalsound}
Um we can have scroll buttons
and the the scroll button can incorporate a push ,
so you can have it like on a mouse
where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that
and push to select something .
{vocalsound} Um you can have multiple scroll buttons ,
And we can also incorporate an L_C_D_ display in the remote ,
but this will increase the cost . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}
Um the electronics that actually makes the device work , we've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced ,
If we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons .
Um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons .
And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices .
I don't know what that is ,
but I think they think it's quite important
I I think we've got two options .
We can either go for a really cheap model ,
keep all of the costs down ,
Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer ,
I think it , um won't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple ,
{vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} but it could have an L_C_D_ screen
and it could have multiple scroll buttons ,
and it could have the the company's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker . {vocalsound}
Um do you have any idea if if this could {disfmarker} if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty ?
I'm afraid I don't have that information available .
Um manufacturing didn't actually give {disfmarker} attach any prices to any of this , I'm afraid .
so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it .
I I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company .
That's before I heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit-wise .
We we could we could do um a double curved rubber one ,
which would allow um say a banana ,
but um unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface ,
I don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says ,
just that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations ,
which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including M_P_ three players , uh like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things .
Uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones ,
um what functions we actually need ,
{vocalsound} Uh I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel ,
but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right .
It has uh scroll wheels without without a display ,
So I was thinking that uh {vocalsound} um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um
and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen .
and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment ,
you can scroll along
and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen .
Uh but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote ,
um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press ,
but still quite simple and quite cost effective .
what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , I mean just pretty simple plastic , probably ,
I was thinking , yellow and black ,
just because that's the company's colours ,
with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , {vocalsound} just small along the bottom
Yeah , I'd I'd certainly support that idea .
And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber .
I mean titanium would be great ,
but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey .
If we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then I think titanium's too futuristic .
we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately .
Whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else .
{vocalsound} And the the having the the the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea ,
But as for actually arranging them {disfmarker} let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one .
And I quite like it ,
'cause it's just smooth and hand-held
and it's got these easily reachable buttons
so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle . Up , down , left , right .
Do you want scroll buttons in that as well ?
I I was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll ,
like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right . And enter in the middle ,
and when when you click on each one , it {disfmarker} you can go into a new menu for that .
I think I think that's a g nice clean design ,
But they all have this this feature of this uh {disfmarker} It's not quite a scroll wheel , but it's a kind of selection in this circle ,
But we can implement it with simple push buttons ,
either a channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down , {vocalsound} uh and then also {vocalsound} when you get into the different menus on the screen , it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down .
So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle .
{vocalsound} It seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic ,
Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ? And have it abstract .
we could call {vocalsound} like a fruit name ,
Mm . We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather {disfmarker} if you feel {disfmarker} if you like the spongy {disfmarker}
I'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so {disfmarker}
Uh just something else I need to bring to your attention
This is actually the volume up and down ,
but {vocalsound} they both say V_ on them ,
so uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these .
But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down .
If we're having the scroll wheel , then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions .
Um we need to come up with some specifics of the components , um the materials , things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things .
They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use ,
which {disfmarker} the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery , kinetic or solar .
You were saying that the kinetic would be useful ,
um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries . Um
or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day , that it'll die on you , and no way to do it .
unfortunately I don't have costing information .
I i in terms of workability , I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic ,
What's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic ?
I've used kinetic in terms of watches
you don't even notice um that it's there .
I've never come across it before ,
but it sounds fantastic .
it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient .
So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible .
a good selling point .
But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs .
Mm .
Um {vocalsound} the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision .
Um chip on print is just a manufacturing technique
um and I would certainly recommend it , I think ,
Um what about the case ?
I think they're talking there about do we want wood , plastic , titanium or rubber ,
and I think we've discussed not having titanium .
Um we've sort of eliminated wood .
We said plastic or rubber .
Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy Yeah , s thick spongy cover ,
I'd I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible ,
but I agree , it's uh {disfmarker} sounds like a nice idea if it is .
Um the next part they want is the user interface concept .
Then I'll just say I support either {disfmarker} from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that .
like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen .
I'd {disfmarker} like push buttons with {disfmarker}
Um this is gonna sound weird ,
but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes .
And they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design ,
Marketing they want product evaluation .
Um the look and feel design is for Kate ,
uh Steph gets the user interface design ,
you get product {vocalsound} evaluation .
Um the two of you {vocalsound} get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype .
Uh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way .
And that's the end of this meeting .
