ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.6	92.92	94.67	ME	B	inf	-1	0	First of all methodology .
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.7	94.67	101.4	ME	B	fra	-1	0	The met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.8	101.4	108.88	ME	B	inf	+1	1	We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market ,

ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.52	412.02	416.01	UI	D	inf	+1	1	okay , so the interface concept um .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.53	417.74	420.64	UI	D	inf	-1	0	Yeah . The interface specification ,
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.54	420.64	422.27	UI	D	stl	-1	0	what people {disfmarker}

ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.61	436.31	442.9	UI	D	inf	-1	0	Um and what {vocalsound} the survey told us and what we think would be good ,
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.62	442.9	445.48	UI	D	inf	-1	0	so a bit of imagination .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	444.62	445.06	PM	C	bck	-1	0	Mm 'kay .

ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.65	450.928	453.5	UI	D	inf	+1	1	{vocalsound} Okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface ,
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.66	453.5	462.87	UI	D	inf	-1	0	where you um have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something .

ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.67	462.87	467.64	UI	D	inf	+1	1	Um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.68	467.64	470.07	UI	D	inf	-1	0	So I think for our remote control {disfmarker}
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.69	470.07	473.58	UI	D	inf	-1	0	There is some inconsistency already in {disfmarker} ec existing in {disfmarker} between remote controls ,
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.70	473.58	480.97	UI	D	inf	+1	1	but I think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.71	480.97	483.41	UI	D	inf	-1	0	like the the top right for on and off or something ,

ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.72	483.41	486.21	UI	D	inf	-1	0	I think , people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use .

ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.82	516.78	518.83	UI	D	inf	+1	1	There's um an L_C_D_ thing ,
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.83	518.83	520.78	UI	D	stl	-1	0	which we thought could {disfmarker}
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.84	520.78	526.22	UI	D	ass	+1	1	I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	524.76	525.35	PM	C	bck	-1	0	Right , okay .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.85	526.22	531.26	UI	D	inf	+1	1	This one is {disfmarker} got a kind of scroll like a mouse ,

ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.88	533.98	538.03	UI	D	inf	+1	1	Um and {disfmarker} But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that ,

ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.42	538.45	539.85	PM	C	inf	-1	0	Ah it's kinda like scrolling {disfmarker}
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.89	538.03	540.304	UI	D	fra	-1	0	like would the computer come {disfmarker}
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.43	539.85	541.39	PM	C	stl	-1	0	uh right , well ,
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	541.39	544.51	PM	C	inf	-1	0	if I s if I'm thinking of the right one , I've got the same thing in front of my monitor ,
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	544.51	552.46	PM	C	inf	-1	0	you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um {vocalsound} menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.90	550.47	552.39	UI	D	inf	-1	0	Uh-huh , that's like the L_C_D_ one ,
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	552.46	553.14	PM	C	ass	-1	0	Right , okay .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.91	552.39	553.17	UI	D	el.inf	-1	0	is it ?
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.92	553.17	557.1	UI	D	inf	+1	1	But the one below that has got like {vocalsound} a little scroll function on the side .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.93	557.1	560.79	UI	D	inf	+1	1	But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen .
ES2005c.B.dialog-act.dharshi.80	561.746	562.6	ME	B	bck	-1	0	{vocalsound} Yeah .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.47	561.32	562.62	PM	C	ass	-1	0	Yeah , presumably .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.94	561.96	563.48	UI	D	inf	-1	0	I think that's what that is .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.95	563.48	564.99	UI	D	inf	-1	0	So these are just a few ideas .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.97	564.99	567.27	UI	D	ass	+1	1	Again that's just quite boring shape , grey ,
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.98	567.27	570.38	UI	D	ass	+1	1	looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one .
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.15	569.9	570.86	ID	A	ass	-1	0	Uh it looks threatening .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	569.72	575.07	PM	C	ass	-1	0	Yeah , looks like uh looks like something out of a jet . {vocalsound}
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.96	571.48	573.97	UI	D	ass	+1	0	Yeah , it does look kind of dangerous .

ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.99	574.63	576.55	UI	D	ass	+1	1	Um this one I thought was really cool .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.100	576.55	579.62	UI	D	inf	+1	1	It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about .

ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.101	579.62	581.03	UI	D	inf	-1	0	You can put it in there ,
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.102	581.03	581.8	UI	D	inf	-1	0	it's for your kids ,
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.103	581.8	584.67	UI	D	inf	+1	1	and it's quite an organic shape
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	584.67	587.43	UI	D	ass	-1	0	and the little circle around there is pretty cool .
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	587.12	587.52	PM	C	bck	-1	0	Okay .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.105	587.43	589.78	UI	D	inf	-1	0	And that's really easy to use , bright ,
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.106	589.78	592.78	UI	D	ass	-1	0	so I like this one lot for our design .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.107	592.78	595.18	UI	D	ass	-1	0	I think something like that would be good .

ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	594.89	608.22	PM	C	ass	+1	1	Yeah , I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um {vocalsound} , I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing .

ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	608.22	610.99	PM	C	sug	+1	1	So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.109	608.0	608.51	UI	D	ass	-1	0	Right , yeah .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.110	610.12	612.58	UI	D	ass	-1	0	Yeah , that's true . Yeah .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.111	612.58	618.57	UI	D	sug	-1	0	Um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the T_V_ or something .
ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.112	618.57	620.94	UI	D	inf	+1	1	And this one , the over-sized one ,

ES2005c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.126	657.31	660.72	UI	D	stl	-1	0	Um but the buttons on this I think are {disfmarker}

ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.54	967.71	971.04	ID	A	sug	+1	1	and then we'll throw in our new innovations um {vocalsound}
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.55	971.04	972.01	ID	A	sug	-1	0	and keep it all within budget .

ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.56	973.91	979.43	ID	A	inf	-1	0	So uh yeah , looking inside a a very simple remote control .
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.57	979.43	981.31	ID	A	inf	-1	0	Um this is what they sent me .
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.58	982.4	984.9	ID	A	inf	-1	0	'Kay . Here's uh the competition , I suppose .

ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.59	986.0	989.35	ID	A	inf	+1	2	Um you open it up , there's a circuit board inside ,
ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.103	988.72	989.06	PM	C	bck	-1	0	Mm-hmm .
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.60	989.35	991.13	ID	A	stl	-1	0	um {vocalsound}
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.61	991.13	993.61	ID	A	inf	+1	2	and there's a a chip , a processor ,
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.62	993.61	998.76	ID	A	inf	+1	2	the T_A_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons ,

ES2005c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.104	998.74	1001.23	PM	C	el.inf	-1	0	So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ?
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.64	1001.41	1001.72	ID	A	inf	-1	0	Right ,
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.65	1001.72	1002.14	ID	A	stl	-1	0	it's very {disfmarker}
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.66	1002.14	1003.0	ID	A	inf	-1	0	they're very cheap remote .

ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.68	1005.63	1015.62	ID	A	inf	+1	1	Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier ,
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.69	1015.62	1020.82	ID	A	inf	+1	1	which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps ,
ES2005c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.70	1020.82	1025.5	ID	A	inf	+1	1	and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light ,
