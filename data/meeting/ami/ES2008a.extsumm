Good morning everybody .
Um I'm just gonna have a little PowerPoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting .
My name is Rose Lindgren .
I I'll be the Project Manager .
Um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening
and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about the project ,
then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit , including a tool training exercise .
And then we'll move into the project plan ,
do a little discussion
Um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about ,
it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly .
Um so we're gonna divide us up into three {vocalsound} compa three parts .
First the functional design
which will be uh first we'll do individual work ,
come into a meeting ,
the conceptional design , individual work and a meeting ,
and then the detailed design , individual work and a meeting .
Um we're gonna do a little tool training ,
so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you .
Um introduce yourself ,
and then draw your favourite animal
My name is Alima Bucciantini .
and I guess I'm the Industrial Designer on this project .
I will draw a little turtle for you all .
my name is Iain uh
and I'm the User Interface Designer for the project . Um .
It's a whale {vocalsound} , yes .
I'm Jessy .
Briefly , it's supposed to be a seal .
We're gonna talk about project finances .
we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales
and because this is such {disfmarker} this is for television it's a {disfmarker} we have a market range of Internet , like it's an international market range ,
Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro .
just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um , I could {disfmarker} I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls ,
what would be the best um like you {disfmarker} what are the features that you really like
Um I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the T_V_
'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload .
especially , like you know if I'm watching T_V_ I have have to have three separate remote controls of {disfmarker} in front of me , you know , one for the T_V_ , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . Um .
And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing ,
they've got too many buttons on them
uh too too sort of too sort of complicated
and that there's not too many buttons ,
they are not too small ,
like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries
but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery
it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes .
doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder
but that just has your major buttons for {disfmarker} that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off ,
so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's , you know , like the top thing on the remote , I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it , but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here ,
then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here ,
all the {disfmarker} whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together ,
and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day .
so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things .
are we designing a remote control for a television only
would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ?
Um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ?
{vocalsound} I'll look into that .
I guess we have to define what what we're aiming for .
If it's just a television then that {disfmarker} it's a bit simpler ,
If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it .
Um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes .
Um the industrial design , Alima will be doing um the working design .
Um the User Interface Designer , that's for {gap} . Technical functions , I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons .
Um user requirements um , so you'll be hearing about different trends , uh about different things that people need ,
And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach .
What we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting ?
I haven't gotten an agenda yet ,
um I'll put that together .
I'm sure as we'll each get our own instruction
I'll type up mi minutes
and probably email those out to all of you . Um just including all the things that we talked about . Um .
Can you e-mail your slides as well ?
Yes , I yes , I think I can .
I'll just attach it to an email .
Just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails . {vocalsound}
