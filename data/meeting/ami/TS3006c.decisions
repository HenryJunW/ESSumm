1	TS3006c.dharshi.s.9	The remote will use kinetic energy.
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.81	911.1	916.84	A	PM	inf	+1	3	So we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy .
2	TS3006c.dharshi.s.10	The case will be double-curved and made of rubber.
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.82	916.84	920.331	A	PM	inf	+1	3	Uh the case would be doubly curved . So {disfmarker}
TS3006c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.104	919.66	920.87	D	ME	inf	+1	3	Rubber material .
1	TS3006c.dharshi.s.11	The remote will use an advanced chip.
TS3006c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.86	937.27	939.02	A	PM	ass	+1	2	Advanced chip . Okay .
