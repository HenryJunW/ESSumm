IS1003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	98.38	98.97	A	PM	el.inf	-1	0	interface 
IS1003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.4	98.74	98.91	C	UI	inf	-1	0	yeah 
IS1003c.A.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	100.02	100.39	A	PM	el.inf	-1	0	That's 
IS1003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.5	100.34	100.53	C	UI	inf	-1	0	Mm 
IS1003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.6	105.24	106.15	C	UI	stl	-1	0	So well first i will present 
IS1003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.7	106.15	110.91	C	UI	off	-1	0	first i will present the concept of user interface um 
IS1003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.8	110.91	115.51	C	UI	inf	+1	1	um there's three concepts and the user interface the first line 
IS1003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.9	115.51	117.98	C	UI	inf	+1	1	the first line so we'll come from 
IS1003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.10	119.06	122.29	C	UI	inf	+1	1	The second be the fancy come from the last line to 
IS1003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.11	122.29	125.06	C	UI	inf	+1	1	the last line to hide income for so there are three concepts 
IS1003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.12	125.06	127.41	C	UI	inf	-1	0	so there are three concepts you know a compartment 
IS1003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.13	128.66	131.94	C	UI	off	-1	0	Um next every o. explained my mail and the 
IS1003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.14	131.94	134.34	C	UI	inf	+1	1	my mail and the first is the logo control um 
IS1003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.15	134.34	135.48	C	UI	stl	-1	0	um so i want the comparable 
IS1003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.16	135.48	140.53	C	UI	sug	+1	1	so i want the comparable to be easy to use that to be said fifty functions so it's a combination 
IS1003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.17	140.53	144.72	C	UI	inf	-1	0	so it's a combination of easy to use and the the fifty functions 
IS1003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.18	146.9	150.85	C	UI	inf	-1	0	Oh this is the first concept of a control the second 
IS1003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.19	150.85	154.4	C	UI	inf	+1	1	the second concept is a fancy control um so we're 
IS1003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.20	154.4	154.86	C	UI	stl	-1	0	um so we're 
IS1003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.21	154.86	160.65	C	UI	inf	+1	1	um so we're but keep the cost some of the impression that's all control is very attractive uh 
IS1003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.22	160.65	165.59	C	UI	inf	-1	0	uh we can t. v. like that all come from a lot of products So 
IS1003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.23	165.59	167.09	C	UI	stl	-1	0	So so do you say 
IS1003c.C.dialog-act.vkaraisk.24	167.09	176.13	C	UI	sug	+1	1	do you say you have the the the user interface would be very very cute very very um
