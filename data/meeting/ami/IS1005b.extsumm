Tod uh for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes .
Uh so we will see our three presentations .
Um we will start with the uh Manager Expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device .
Okay , so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control .
So basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market .
seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly .
Um they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user ,
Um and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls .
And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most {disfmarker} by far the most used buttons on the remote control .
And basically they came {disfmarker} they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users ,
And fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it .
In particular , do they want an L_C_D_ d display ,
and secondly , do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control .
Um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes .
So I guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market .
And speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very e expensive .
And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per per unit is fairly high I think ,
so I think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote .
Okay , so here is my presentation about technical function design .
Uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands .
And then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands
and uh finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves to transmit through the air
Okay , {vocalsound} uh about {disfmarker} what I found about uh different uh these different blocks are uh , usually there are two different methods uh to {disfmarker} for designing a remote control .
They are based on infra-red uh waves or uh uh radio waves .
uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with {disfmarker} uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way .
And uh uh again , using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred , as I see .
Do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home ?
Uh , I don't think so ,
And what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same {disfmarker} have our remote control , for example ?
but one solution can be something like putting uh p password or something inside the wave , so the only your T_V_ can understand it
I have only a couple of things because I had {disfmarker} I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this uh uh in this company .
so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication {disfmarker} for the I_R_ circuits and so on ,
And uh I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there ,
So , I know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves
but you know , when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on
and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the um infra-red control instead of R_W_
well , L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_ ,
But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the {disfmarker} what does it offer , you know .
If we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle
And uh my personal preference is yes , I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit ,
but from the point of view uh of the design and price , I would stick to I_R_s .
And the price is fairly cheap for this .
because I mean all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red , so people don't expect anything other than infra-red .
But I think , based on my usability studies I th I feel that users are {disfmarker} prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , you know , the difference between infra-red or radio waves .
So um I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control . Um
Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it's not useful to have teletext .
Um the second thing is uh they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for T_V_ , not for D_V_D_ and other devices ,
the third one is uh about the the the image of the company .
So um uh we should we should keep uh {disfmarker} The the product should be recognisable .
It's {disfmarker} That mean we should use the colour of our company
and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is uh , we put fashion of {disfmarker} in electronics .
So now we we should take the decision what we are going to {disfmarker} what function we will have on this uh on this remote control .
Well , should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need .
And then we can move on to the more advanced features .
I think we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button .
So , turning channel , of course . Volume setting .
will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ?
Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number .
so so we keep all these all these buttons .
Maybe we could have key buttons , like uh discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and {disfmarker}
If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus .
So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably , to to tell you {disfmarker}
We could maybe also c um incorporate Petre's idea of the um slider for the volume , with the channel .
So we've got channel and volume . Um .
I mean there's always {disfmarker} we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere ,
{vocalsound} We should hide them somewhere .
I mean a power button's obviously
{vocalsound} This I was thinking . Do we need a power button at all ?
uh required .
Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ?
Uh , well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off .
Okay , so we should keep this button .
so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff ,
Should we make it a button , or some some something which would be {disfmarker}
A button is better .
What about things like the clock and um timers ?
If we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that ,
I mean , are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ?
Probably not .
W In my opinion we should have only useful thing
So , um . So now we are going for for a small lunch .
And uh after we have uh thirteen minutes to to do indevel individual works .
And uh you are going to work on your individual works .
And uh you will receive as usual your specific instruction and so on .
