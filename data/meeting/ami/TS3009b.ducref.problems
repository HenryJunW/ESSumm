A discussion on ergonomic solutions like placing the main buttons (power , channel selection , volume) where they can be easily reached with the thumb (as many users complain of RSI) , did not reach a conclusion as to whether this would actually cause more repetitive movements.
Some advanced features , like LCD screen with program information or speech recognition , would be very important in order to attract their target group , but there are costing issues that have not been clarified yet.
There was some disagreement as to whether the LCD screen should be placed at the top or the bottom of the remote.
No consensus was reached regarding the positioning of the main buttons (zapping , volume , power) either: should they be placed close together or more scattered (to avoid RSI complaints)?
A special AV button for direct access to the video channel , although its necessity was disputed , because there are alternative solutions that make it obsolete.
