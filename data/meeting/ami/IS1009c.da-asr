IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.17	810.13	817.22	C	ID	inf	+1	1	I have just a belief uh don few of components which we've required for the remote control uh construction uh the first

IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.18	817.22	823.78	C	ID	inf	+1	0	uh the first one is key is to keep all the components like integrated suck you would battery it's a fact that writes like 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.19	823.78	824.296	C	ID	stl	-1	0	a fact that writes like Oh 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.20	824.52	826.96	C	ID	inf	-1	0	Oh it can be a plastic quite hard 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.21	826.96	829.74	C	ID	inf	-1	0	quite hard plastic so that it can be struck even

IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.23	835.49	837.53	C	ID	inf	+1	1	three so it should be strong and uh um 
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.103	837.36	837.74	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.24	837.53	841.99	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and uh um they are more harmful materials used in that and 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.25	841.99	843.49	C	ID	inf	+1	0	that and it should be recycled but 
IS1009c.A.dialog-act.dharshi.104	844.73	845.18	A	PM	bck	-1	0	Uh-huh 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.26	845.23	846.75	C	ID	stl	-1	0	Ah and uh oh yeah 
IS1009c.D.dialog-act.dharshi.33	845.72	846.54	D	ME	ass	-1	0	Uh-huh good point 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.27	846.75	847.12	C	ID	ass	-1	0	oh yeah and also are 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.28	847.12	850.03	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and also are using of cutting component components like uh if we want 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.29	850.03	858.23	C	ID	inf	+1	1	like uh if we want to have different colours blue red green so uh uh we have to use a some kind of a call on the component components And 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.30	858.84	864.44	C	ID	inf	+1	1	And uh the second important thing is that uh it uh integrated thank you um

IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.31	864.44	870.57	C	ID	inf	+1	1	um the sure we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote control it if it is 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.32	870.57	879.57	C	ID	sug	-1	0	control it if it is not the fish and then everything but it's going to be uh like a then if it's less efficient so it you should be should have a highly sophisticated one and it should 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.33	879.57	883.48	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and it should be racist into high as well as a low temperatures suppose if 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.34	883.48	895.79	C	ID	inf	-1	0	suppose if it is thirty degrees outside forty degrees outside it should it should it be able to address is the the temperature the the price and uh i can listen to it i just i know 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.35	895.79	900.48	C	ID	sug	-1	0	just i know it should be a bit well um it could put it it's time uh and and i'm facility 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.36	901.4	907.13	C	ID	inf	+1	1	And they all are the component we should all be have in the remote control or is that a sister of 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.37	907.13	916.07	C	ID	inf	-1	0	of which is like uh it it is very very much important for the electricity uh fiddle to to to the remote controller and also a capacitator 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.38	916.07	917.52	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and also a capacitator which isn't 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.39	917.52	921.99	C	ID	inf	-1	0	which isn't it isn't i think it's it's like a battery capacity a

IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.44	937.63	939.88	C	ID	off	-1	0	battery uh i would like to say just one thing uh 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.45	939.88	941.09	C	ID	stl	-1	0	one thing uh if we Uh if 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.46	941.62	950.16	C	ID	inf	+1	2	Uh if we will be able to me "'cause" least a rechargeable battery can be should be need not go for our high-performance battery even if it is a mobile

IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.48	954.34	956.28	C	ID	inf	-1	0	it it it's not that how you would expect you can also we can 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.49	956.28	960.94	C	ID	inf	-1	0	you can also we can if it is a rechargeable one then people can use it for a long time so 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.50	960.94	967.48	C	ID	inf	-1	0	it for a long time so in that way we can cut cut the cost but uh it yet that we have to me the battery as rechargeable one 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.51	968.32	972.15	C	ID	inf	-1	0	And we we have a circuit board uh in a remote control to go to the 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.52	972.15	974.46	C	ID	sug	-1	0	go to the next slide and how 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.53	974.46	977.54	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and how it works how the remote controller works when you press

IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.54	986.39	987.14	C	ID	be.pos	-1	0	Well when you press a button 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.55	987.14	992.05	C	ID	inf	-1	0	Well when you press a button when you do with that you complete a specific connection that means when you 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.56	992.05	1001.07	C	ID	inf	-1	0	that means when you when you press a button that will be uh it's it's more it's a cute and that me the button and it will send some signals through the wires and then at the chip

IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.59	1013.97	1017.7	C	ID	inf	-1	0	was pressed it was it produces a morse a morse code line signal specific to that button 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.60	1018.28	1021.81	C	ID	inf	-1	0	Every button and the individual button has it's a one more school suppose 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.61	1021.81	1031.51	C	ID	inf	-1	0	more school suppose that that well use it has pressed a button button one then it would have a spare the circuit will generate a specific morse code to put that back button and the transistor 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.62	1031.51	1038.96	C	ID	inf	-1	0	and the transistor that amplify the signal and the l. e. d. which translates the signal into infrared light make 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.63	1038.96	1042.47	C	ID	inf	-1	0	light make you have got a signal by pressing the button that's the 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.64	1042.47	1046.34	C	ID	inf	-1	0	that's the that a morse code has been generated like they did it it's like you Now 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.65	1046.9	1050.88	C	ID	inf	-1	0	you Now that signal that morse code has to be amplified but the transistor that 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.66	1050.88	1054.49	C	ID	inf	-1	0	but the transistor that is the use of transistor transistor be which we use in the remote control it will amplify 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.67	1054.49	1062.05	C	ID	inf	-1	0	control it will amplify the signal and it will send it to the e. d. and which translates the signal into an inset infrared that's that's inside and the t. v. 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.68	1062.05	1069.14	C	ID	inf	-1	0	that's inside and the t. v. can see the infrared light and seeing the signal seen the signal three it reacts appropriately that we need c.s 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.69	1069.14	1078.71	C	ID	inf	-1	0	that we need c.s that amplify that more morse code signal that it it up it will uh will know which what what actually it has to uh do then it 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.70	1078.71	1081.0	C	ID	inf	-1	0	do then it will do the appropriate actions so uh this is how 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.71	1081.0	1084.06	C	ID	inf	-1	0	uh this is how the remote controller works

IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.96	1175.06	1178.5	C	ID	inf	-1	0	uh it's it costs less than what you print of the people because i uh 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.97	1178.5	1187.46	C	ID	inf	-1	0	because i uh well when you when you are building a some steak use some of those are cute and also wires it's it's better to go for printing because it you 
IS1009c.C.dialog-act.dharshi.98	1187.46	1196.07	C	ID	inf	-1	0	because it you can build these kind of circuit boards on a on a buck and it's just printing nothing like oh you know you don't need to use why it's not it's not exactly
